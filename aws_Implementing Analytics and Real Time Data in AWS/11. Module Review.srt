00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,360
[Autogenerated] all right, way to go.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,440
You have now made it through the third module of this course

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
before we move on to the final module.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,140
Let's have a quick wrap up and review.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,310
Now,

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,340
we looked at using sqs as a queuing service for distributed systems and we

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,140
looked at the different types of cues that we can create,

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,840
including Standard and Fife OAuth.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
We looked at how we can publish notifications through s and S.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
And we demo that by sending an email to a subscribed

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,500
address which was my quick to cloud address and then

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,440
building off of the sqs and SNS lessons.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,670
We looked at integrating both together for a pub sub architecture er.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,940
So if you recall that diagram we looked at,

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,880
it allowed us to send the same message to several different subscriptions

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,740
and perform parallel processing with different compute.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,040
It allowed us to efficiently fan out and perform multiple actions.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,220
And then we just finished up utilizing step functions for

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,120
stepping through application work flows.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,460
So we looked at the visual builder and console that comes with step

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,560
functions and how we can use it for both the bugging and creating different

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,140
work flows that will do it for this third module.

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's go ahead and wrap up and we'll pick up in the final module where it will start talking about implementing a W S I O T.
