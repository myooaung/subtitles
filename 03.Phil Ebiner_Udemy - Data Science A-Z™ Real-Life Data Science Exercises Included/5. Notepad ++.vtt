00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:02.820
That we've already touched on Notepad plus plus.

2

00:00:02.850  -->  00:00:07.630
However in this tutorial I just wanted to reiterate exactly why I use it and prefer it.

3

00:00:07.950  -->  00:00:12.550
Notepad plus plus is a very powerful editor for viewing text and CACP files.

4

00:00:12.580  -->  00:00:18.450
It is much more user friendly than the standard notepad that comes with Windows and has some major advantages

5

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:19.800
over it for instance.

6

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:24.750
As you can see here notepad plus plus has ROW numbering which means that you can seamlessly navigate

7

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:25.990
through your files.

8

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:31.440
Also the search and replace feature and note plus plus plus is very useful for daughter related work

9

00:00:31.450  -->  00:00:31.660
.

10

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:38.900
And when using Notepad plus plus you're confident that it will not inadvertently modify your data.

11

00:00:39.000  -->  00:00:45.240
And finally perhaps the biggest advantage for data scientists is that while normal notepad can only

12

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:52.790
open up files up to fifty four kilobytes notepad plus plus can open up files up to 2 gigabytes.

13

00:00:52.800  -->  00:00:57.910
I highly recommend installing notepad plus plus and completely forgetting about normal notepad
