00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:06.540
What is Grettel Grettel stands for Ganu regression econometrics and time series library.

2

00:00:06.540  -->  00:00:11.220
This is a free software package for econometrics analysis and this is what Grindl looks like on the

3

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:12.390
inside.

4

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:18.690
Those of you have worked for SAS and SPSS before will notice that it's got a similar interface and that

5

00:00:18.690  -->  00:00:19.170
is correct.

6

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:24.240
All of these software packages for modeling resemble each other's interfaces and conceptually they are

7

00:00:24.240  -->  00:00:25.750
very similar too.

8

00:00:26.010  -->  00:00:28.720
Once you learn one of them it's much easier to grasp the rest.

9

00:00:29.310  -->  00:00:35.070
In Grettel we will be able to do the same modeling just like an R and Python but we won't have to code

10

00:00:35.070  -->  00:00:35.310
.

11

00:00:35.400  -->  00:00:36.650
And that's the big deal here.

12

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:40.560
Some of you may already know our very well but some may not know it at all.

13

00:00:40.920  -->  00:00:46.260
As I mentioned in the intro to this section My goal is to show you how to build a robust model and give

14

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:50.340
you a framework of steps that you can apply in any tool you choose.

15

00:00:50.670  -->  00:00:56.040
That's where griddle will help us avoid getting bogged down in our coding.

16

00:00:56.040  -->  00:00:59.300
Now let's go ahead and install a griddle to start off.

17

00:00:59.310  -->  00:01:04.400
You're going to need a browser and in Google type in simply Grettel.

18

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:08.820
And then here one of the top links will be the source forge link.

19

00:01:08.820  -->  00:01:11.700
Go ahead and proceed to that here.

20

00:01:11.760  -->  00:01:19.590
You need to find a link which takes you to the installation packages so at the bottom here it says Grettel

21

00:01:19.590  -->  00:01:24.480
for Microsoft Windows can be found here and Grindl for Mac OS can be found here.

22

00:01:24.510  -->  00:01:31.110
So I'm going to click the windows link inside this page you can see that there are several different

23

00:01:31.110  -->  00:01:31.550
versions.

24

00:01:31.560  -->  00:01:37.980
You need the latest release and there is one for the 32 bit operating system there's one for the 64

25

00:01:37.980  -->  00:01:38.950
bit operating system.

26

00:01:38.940  -->  00:01:44.790
So select the correct one for your system and also you know how sometimes at work you can install programs

27

00:01:44.790  -->  00:01:48.120
because you don't have admin rights or am at my previous job.

28

00:01:48.120  -->  00:01:53.970
That was the case and was very annoying that I couldn't install software like this so in this case you

29

00:01:53.970  -->  00:01:56.220
can actually download a zip archive.

30

00:01:56.220  -->  00:02:01.080
It's a portable version so that means once you downloaded you just unzip it and you can use it.

31

00:02:01.080  -->  00:02:06.800
Out of that folder right away without having to install the program and that will allow you to use it

32

00:02:06.840  -->  00:02:08.670
even if you don't have admin rights.

33

00:02:08.670  -->  00:02:15.230
So if you need that go ahead and install that and for the Mac OS it's very similar.

34

00:02:15.240  -->  00:02:16.220
Very straightforward.

35

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:21.930
Here you just have to select the type of operating system you're running or type of processor.

36

00:02:21.930  -->  00:02:25.780
Actually your computer is running and then the instructions are straight forward from there.

37

00:02:26.190  -->  00:02:32.400
And once you've installed Grettel make a shortcut on your desktop and you're ready to proceed to the

38

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:34.070
next tutorial.
