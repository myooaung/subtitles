00:00:01.680  -->  00:00:08.250
All right so last time we stopped here where we have exactly one record that went into bad records we're

2

00:00:08.250  -->  00:00:13.030
going to go to the control flow and disable this and will save our project.

3

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:16.460
And now let's go have a look at this row.

4

00:00:17.080  -->  00:00:19.920
There we are in uploaded files.

5

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:22.720
Now we go to analysis exclude Rose.

6

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:24.530
Open this up here.

7

00:00:24.540  -->  00:00:28.680
We can see this is the row that got X and from here you can't really tell what happened.

8

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:29.290
Right.

9

00:00:29.580  -->  00:00:33.000
Let's go and find our original file.

10

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:37.710
So in our prepared Datto we have an original which we didn't touch with Excel.

11

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:41.550
So we know it's pretty much the same as the original.

12

00:00:41.730  -->  00:00:48.000
Let's look for this customer number and we know that like we can just check that it is unique in this

13

00:00:48.000  -->  00:00:48.300
case.

14

00:00:48.300  -->  00:00:49.890
This one specifically is unique.

15

00:00:49.880  -->  00:00:52.610
So this is the row that we're talking about.

16

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:55.140
And what do we see here.

17

00:00:55.290  -->  00:01:00.880
So here there obviously is four values instead of three.

18

00:01:00.900  -->  00:01:02.060
How did that come to be.

19

00:01:02.220  -->  00:01:08.130
Well if you look over here after the car you've got 118 semicon.

20

00:01:08.240  -->  00:01:08.930
0 1.

21

00:01:09.010  -->  00:01:14.300
So instead of a Daut is got a semi-colon and that is the problem.

22

00:01:14.310  -->  00:01:17.180
This throw the delimiter on the delimiter.

23

00:01:17.190  -->  00:01:23.520
The decimal point got replaced somehow got replaced with a semi-colon and that shifted everything to

24

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:24.260
the right.

25

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:32.180
And so this is the value that we're after for 2016 not this value.

26

00:01:32.550  -->  00:01:34.940
And that's going to be reflected in our sum.

27

00:01:35.050  -->  00:01:40.020
In fact we're going to get back to this later when we are calculating the some because it has been excluded

28

00:01:40.020  -->  00:01:42.150
from the results.

29

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:51.430
So let's close that off and now let's proceed to Microsoft Asgill Server Management Studio.

30

00:01:51.660  -->  00:01:55.830
All right so let's refresh our tables.

31

00:01:55.950  -->  00:02:00.210
And where is our table there vehicle sales.

32

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:01.730
2015 0 9 12.

33

00:02:01.980  -->  00:02:09.140
So now let's change that into a working table so far we have found one error.

34

00:02:09.240  -->  00:02:09.540
Right.

35

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:11.580
So why Sosias why this process.

36

00:02:11.580  -->  00:02:18.060
We found one error out of five and we've actually even explained how it came to be because there was

37

00:02:18.060  -->  00:02:20.200
a semi-colon instead of a decimal point.

38

00:02:20.220  -->  00:02:21.320
We've got four left.

39

00:02:21.320  -->  00:02:23.510
Four more arrows left and then we have to check the sum.

40

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:30.670
So let's go to functions are stored procedures create a new stored procedure.

41

00:02:31.590  -->  00:02:37.160
What are you going to call this one vehicle service what are you going to call this one.

42

00:02:37.320  -->  00:02:41.310
So right away here we're going to change this to create a 5.

43

00:02:41.610  -->  00:02:43.170
Well that's right where we have this one.

44

00:02:43.170  -->  00:02:49.730
So we're going to create this bridge to get rid of this first bit.

45

00:02:49.770  -->  00:02:52.950
And here we're going to just rename it.

46

00:02:52.950  -->  00:02:59.160
And in fact we're just going to take table name press control age and replace all.

47

00:02:59.670  -->  00:03:03.300
OK that's good.

48

00:03:03.300  -->  00:03:05.300
Now we can create it at 5.

49

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:05.580
Good.

50

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:10.390
Now we have to change that back to alter a five working good.

51

00:03:10.390  -->  00:03:18.780
Now scroll down to the bottom the date for the table is 2015 or 9 12.

52

00:03:19.110  -->  00:03:20.450
That's enough.

53

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:22.030
Let's put that in there.

54

00:03:22.160  -->  00:03:25.010
Execute.

55

00:03:25.350  -->  00:03:26.550
That's right.

56

00:03:26.820  -->  00:03:31.490
Well it's not ready because we've got to fix up some stuff here.

57

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:32.620
Right.

58

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:35.270
Let's.

59

00:03:35.400  -->  00:03:36.240
That's fine.

60

00:03:36.300  -->  00:03:37.510
Let's create the table.

61

00:03:37.510  -->  00:03:43.680
So if we select top thousand rows from our row table and then drag it here and then make some more room

62

00:03:43.680  -->  00:03:53.370
this way we have the column names so let's copy the column names here into our create table like that

63

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:55.140
give it a row number

64

00:03:57.990  -->  00:04:00.720
and then maybe put a comma here.

65

00:04:02.610  -->  00:04:11.520
And now we just need to give these the correct types customer IDs going to be a bar char not an integer

66

00:04:11.990  -->  00:04:12.760
customer.

67

00:04:12.780  -->  00:04:21.390
Since that's going to be a date vehicle is going to be a bar Chaar hundred should be enough.

68

00:04:22.020  -->  00:04:26.360
Then 2014 is going to be a float.

69

00:04:26.430  -->  00:04:30.850
So the revenue for 2014 this is a float.

70

00:04:31.140  -->  00:04:32.210
This is a float.

71

00:04:32.370  -->  00:04:38.640
This ideally should be empty because we excluded that row that got shifted so we don't actually NEED

72

00:04:38.640  -->  00:04:46.020
this where we can check here or we can just go where right column is not equal to.

73

00:04:46.020  -->  00:04:50.910
So here you can see that they're all kind of empty so we'll just check that were column 6 is not equal

74

00:04:50.910  -->  00:04:52.120
to empty.

75

00:04:52.290  -->  00:04:58.370
If we run that there's no results so we don't even need a need that column 6 in our table.

76

00:04:58.620  -->  00:04:58.920
Okay.

77

00:04:58.920  -->  00:05:02.850
Then we can get rid of this all right.

78

00:05:02.860  -->  00:05:10.690
So we run this table has been created truncate table good and then insert into we can just copy these

79

00:05:12.070  -->  00:05:13.750
since we didn't change the names.

80

00:05:13.900  -->  00:05:16.170
We can just copy these here.

81

00:05:17.590  -->  00:05:22.850
Now we want to select the same values from our role vehicle service.

82

00:05:22.860  -->  00:05:28.570
We don't want to do any converts at this stage because we're imply relying on the implicit conversion

83

00:05:28.570  -->  00:05:28.960
.

84

00:05:28.960  -->  00:05:34.260
All right so what I'll do here is if I run this by itself by clicking a five Iran's fine.

85

00:05:34.370  -->  00:05:34.740
Yeah.

86

00:05:34.810  -->  00:05:38.750
So this should select the one million rows no problem.

87

00:05:39.010  -->  00:05:41.800
But the thing is somewhere here there might be errors.

88

00:05:41.800  -->  00:05:42.190
Right.

89

00:05:42.220  -->  00:05:43.570
And so how do we pick them up.

90

00:05:43.600  -->  00:05:51.430
Will we pick them up through these types who say set types for our table and we've already created it

91

00:05:51.430  -->  00:05:51.500
.

92

00:05:51.520  -->  00:05:57.310
And so now when we insert into this table the implicit conversion will try to convert all of these rows

93

00:05:57.310  -->  00:06:01.900
which are currently as text into the correct types and all tell us if there's any problems.

94

00:06:01.900  -->  00:06:03.620
So let's highlight that and execute

95

00:06:06.490  -->  00:06:11.380
and what do we have.

96

00:06:11.380  -->  00:06:16.430
There is a million rows so even a secure all takes takes a bit of time sometimes.

97

00:06:16.690  -->  00:06:20.440
And there we go error converting data type bartÃ³k to flow.

98

00:06:20.440  -->  00:06:26.920
So there is an error somewhere and we know that it was the first one that came across as a VAR char

99

00:06:27.370  -->  00:06:32.440
or a textfield was being converted to float and we know that we have three floats in here these three

100

00:06:32.440  -->  00:06:32.930
right.

101

00:06:33.130  -->  00:06:35.900
So how do we find where that error is.

102

00:06:36.370  -->  00:06:38.280
Well we already know how to do that.

103

00:06:38.350  -->  00:06:50.830
We just have to basically go select right star from where and then just check these one by one so where

104

00:06:50.830  -->  00:06:55.960
this is not say is in America

105

00:06:58.480  -->  00:07:02.920
and let's say it equals zero so that means it's not numeric.

106

00:07:02.920  -->  00:07:07.900
So if we execute that you get a lot right you get a lot of browser Y because there's empty rows for

107

00:07:07.900  -->  00:07:12.430
customers who weren't with the company in 2014.

108

00:07:12.430  -->  00:07:17.890
So we've got to exclude those who will say and 2014.

109

00:07:17.920  -->  00:07:25.690
This column is not equal to an empty value.

110

00:07:25.690  -->  00:07:29.580
So we don't want to look at that we want to look at everything that's not numeric but the ones that

111

00:07:29.570  -->  00:07:31.160
are empty.

112

00:07:31.170  -->  00:07:33.160
As a kid that seems to be fine.

113

00:07:33.160  -->  00:07:35.370
So it's not 2014 that's a problem.

114

00:07:35.540  -->  00:07:39.780
Let's do 15 exit kids.

115

00:07:40.480  -->  00:07:41.120
Aha.

116

00:07:41.380  -->  00:07:42.490
Look what we found.

117

00:07:42.760  -->  00:07:48.580
So here we've got a row where there's a dollar sign somewhere in the middle of the valley in fact looks

118

00:07:48.580  -->  00:07:51.550
like it's instead of the decimal point.

119

00:07:51.550  -->  00:07:51.790
All right.

120

00:07:51.790  -->  00:07:56.860
We don't really have to find out whether what the correct value is here because that's not crucial to

121

00:07:56.860  -->  00:07:57.010
us.

122

00:07:57.010  -->  00:07:59.320
What is crucial is that some of this column.

123

00:07:59.350  -->  00:08:02.440
Not this cold but we know that this looks like an error.

124

00:08:02.650  -->  00:08:09.310
So we need to now take this and put it in here as a condition so we need to say we need the opposite

125

00:08:09.310  -->  00:08:10.610
of what we're saying here.

126

00:08:10.660  -->  00:08:12.700
So we'll do that.

127

00:08:12.700  -->  00:08:14.180
Where is numeric.

128

00:08:14.200  -->  00:08:17.090
2015 is equal to 1.

129

00:08:17.140  -->  00:08:17.610
Right.

130

00:08:17.620  -->  00:08:19.360
So it is a numeric value.

131

00:08:19.630  -->  00:08:21.340
And 2015.

132

00:08:21.400  -->  00:08:33.370
So how do we say the opposite of all of this where this is equal to 1 or 2015 is equal to just that

133

00:08:33.380  -->  00:08:33.620
.

134

00:08:33.850  -->  00:08:43.830
So basically what that means is that here we've got easy is equal to zero or is not equal to empty.

135

00:08:43.840  -->  00:08:47.520
And then you've got an and if you take the opposite of that then this becomes opposite.

136

00:08:47.530  -->  00:08:48.740
This becomes the opposite.

137

00:08:49.030  -->  00:08:51.570
And this becomes the opposite too.

138

00:08:51.840  -->  00:08:53.020
And so that's all.

139

00:08:53.050  -->  00:09:01.780
Final verdict and let's let's check this out.

140

00:09:01.780  -->  00:09:06.920
So if we truncate table and run that let's see if we get any more errors.

141

00:09:07.360  -->  00:09:11.180
Well we have to also remember that we excluded this ROE.

142

00:09:11.860  -->  00:09:14.040
And yep there we go.

143

00:09:14.530  -->  00:09:19.510
And this is where you'll see that it's important to say how many Euros so here we can see right away

144

00:09:19.510  -->  00:09:21.620
that this two rose missing.

145

00:09:22.430  -->  00:09:24.430
Now I will just say here exclusions

146

00:09:27.400  -->  00:09:33.280
one row is unnecessary one row suit here so that's the second area that we've picked up the hope that

147

00:09:33.400  -->  00:09:39.850
in 2015 one of the rows there was a dollar sign instead of a decimal point or something just a dollar

148

00:09:39.850  -->  00:09:43.310
signs somewhere inside the value which shouldn't be there.

149

00:09:43.600  -->  00:09:44.780
OK that's good.

150

00:09:45.190  -->  00:09:46.540
But we also have to say

151

00:09:51.160  -->  00:09:54.550
just for ourselves excluded Roe.

152

00:09:54.550  -->  00:10:00.220
So when we're checking the some we know what the exit row was.

153

00:10:00.280  -->  00:10:00.610
All right.

154

00:10:00.610  -->  00:10:06.980
So this one just copy this text this code here.

155

00:10:07.420  -->  00:10:09.610
All right.

156

00:10:10.270  -->  00:10:11.240
That's that part.

157

00:10:11.260  -->  00:10:17.140
So we've done two or five errors is three more somewhere and three more because we haven't picked them

158

00:10:17.140  -->  00:10:18.340
up so far.

159

00:10:18.340  -->  00:10:23.370
The last thing I we still haven't done is the additional quality assurance checks.

160

00:10:23.680  -->  00:10:31.790
So things like dates other conditions and other logical things so.

161

00:10:32.010  -->  00:10:38.710
So I'm going to pause the video again and we'll continue in the next tutorial with these additional

162

00:10:38.860  -->  00:10:39.970
