1

00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:02,260
Storytelling is important.

2

00:00:02,370  -->  00:00:06,510
And we talked about this a little bit in the previous tutorial where we said that your audience has

3

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:08,270
to feel like they're engaged.

4

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:11,430
You have to create a journey for them and they have to feel part of their journey.

5

00:00:11,430  -->  00:00:13,980
They have to anticipate what you want to say next.

6

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:15,770
What's coming round the corner.

7

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:20,850
And they have to be completely immersed in your presentation in order to achieve that effect you can

8

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:21,540
do a couple of things.

9

00:00:21,540  -->  00:00:26,850
So we talked about a few of them in the previous tutorial and the other thing that I wanted to invite

10

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:31,610
you to do is scroll down to the end of the section you'll find the full presentation.

11

00:00:31,770  -->  00:00:33,210
So it's about 15 minutes.

12

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:39,390
And if you watch it you will pick up a couple more of the things that I do or I did in that case to

13

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:43,140
engage my audience and I got some print out here just a couple.

14

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:44,990
So one was to add a funny image.

15

00:00:45,000  -->  00:00:48,850
If you added funny to a presentation you know that can get them excited.

16

00:00:48,890  -->  00:00:50,640
But it has to be relevant of course.

17

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:52,840
And another one was a plot twist.

18

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:57,080
So you'll hear me say at some point that this is a great finding.

19

00:00:57,090  -->  00:00:58,910
And you know this was a great resolve.

20

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:02,790
And you're kind of expecting that we're going to talk about it how how we achieve that.

21

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:05,340
But then I say but that's not what we're going to talk about.

22

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:07,710
We're going to talk about the dark side of the Superman.

23

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:13,650
So completely 90 degree turn and we're talking about for the representation we're talking about a completely

24

00:01:13,650  -->  00:01:14,500
different thing.

25

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:17,410
So that's a plot twist in your presentation.

26

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:22,320
You get them you get them standing on their toes and waiting for what's coming next and not knowing

27

00:01:22,320  -->  00:01:23,270
what's coming next.

28

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:28,020
So you kind of showing them that this is not going to be a linear presentation is going to have swerves

29

00:01:28,020  -->  00:01:29,470
which makes it more interesting.

30

00:01:29,880  -->  00:01:33,750
Also another good one which you should watch out for.

31

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:40,320
I mean like in my presentation I actually say that I want to reenact the series so I'm not in those

32

00:01:40,320  -->  00:01:45,750
exact words but I do suggest to the audience that this is exactly what we're going to do.

33

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:52,320
We're going to pretend that we are data scientists and it is like we actually rewind time backwards

34

00:01:52,320  -->  00:02:00,210
and it is August 2014 and we are performing this analysis so I'm reenacting the situation with them

35

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:02,900
participating as the data scientist.

36

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:04,270
That is very powerful.

37

00:02:04,320  -->  00:02:05,720
And why do we need to do that.

38

00:02:05,730  -->  00:02:09,550
Well and why should we take advantage of that as that aside.

39

00:02:09,660  -->  00:02:12,950
Because first of all data science is very complicated.

40

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:15,000
Second science is hype right now.

41

00:02:15,000  -->  00:02:18,110
Lots of people are talking about it but they don't know anything about it.

42

00:02:18,180  -->  00:02:23,310
And a third everybody wants to be a data scientist but not many people are going to have an opportunity

43

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:28,290
to be a data scientist ever in their lives because in so many different skill sets that you have to

44

00:02:28,290  -->  00:02:33,260
have a lot of commitment to this type of mindset to this type of work.

45

00:02:33,490  -->  00:02:40,200
It's it's completely out of this world so people would love the idea to be a dark side for 15 minutes

46

00:02:40,200  -->  00:02:40,290
.

47

00:02:40,290  -->  00:02:42,690
Right it's like try before you buy or even buy.

48

00:02:42,690  -->  00:02:47,070
Just try just just try what it is like to be a dozen put them in your shoes.

49

00:02:47,070  -->  00:02:52,620
Use that to your advantage like my Probably the biggest presentation cigarette for dollar signs that

50

00:02:52,620  -->  00:02:53,960
I can give you right now.

51

00:02:54,300  -->  00:02:56,590
Put the audience in your shoes.

52

00:02:56,760  -->  00:03:05,130
Make Create the journey in such a way that they will experience what you experience through art your

53

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:07,380
work or your analysis and when you're doing insights.

54

00:03:07,650  -->  00:03:12,300
And in order to do that you've got to use visuals you've got to use visuals and you're going to propose

55

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:16,690
to them that you're going to put them in your shoes and reenact the situation.

56

00:03:16,890  -->  00:03:21,210
And in terms of visuals what we're going to do now is I want to jump behind the computer and I'm going

57

00:03:21,210  -->  00:03:25,360
to show you my presentation and you will see how little text there was.

58

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:28,740
And we'll talk more about storytelling now so stay tuned.

59

00:03:28,770  -->  00:03:29,170
I'm jumping.

60

00:03:29,170  -->  00:03:32,000
We have a computer now.

61

00:03:32,010  -->  00:03:37,050
All right so here's my presentation and I don't think that I'm giving away any secrets here whatsoever

62

00:03:37,070  -->  00:03:37,100
.

63

00:03:37,110  -->  00:03:42,130
This presentation is publicly available online and you can freely find it on the web.

64

00:03:42,360  -->  00:03:48,000
And before we continue I wanted to say that if you are planning on watching my full presentation the

65

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:53,550
video as it happens then probably pause this video actually stop this video and go ahead and watch the

66

00:03:53,550  -->  00:03:59,640
presentation because if you watch this video to the end you will like he's got a few spoilers in here

67

00:03:59,670  -->  00:04:05,820
because it is a journey and if once we go through the slides you will know how the journey ends and

68

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:07,010
all the plot twists.

69

00:04:07,020  -->  00:04:11,070
So once again if you want to watch the full video they'd probably do that now and then come back to

70

00:04:11,070  -->  00:04:12,410
this tutorial.

71

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:14,340
Otherwise off we go.

72

00:04:14,340  -->  00:04:19,710
So this is the presentation and what I wanted to show you or focus on is two things.

73

00:04:19,710  -->  00:04:22,160
First of all how little text there is.

74

00:04:22,350  -->  00:04:25,950
And second of all the journey the story so let's go ahead.

75

00:04:25,950  -->  00:04:31,540
So first light of course the intro by the way the template supplied by the events of this case was see

76

00:04:31,610  -->  00:04:32,480
him Assef.

77

00:04:32,550  -->  00:04:38,380
It's called the conference of major super funds 2015 anyway.

78

00:04:38,400  -->  00:04:39,590
So at the start.

79

00:04:39,600  -->  00:04:46,830
I've got some like Overall I'm giving in terms of the journey I'm giving them some overall background

80

00:04:46,830  -->  00:04:49,220
of what has been happening over the years.

81

00:04:49,230  -->  00:04:52,490
So like kind of building up some inspiration.

82

00:04:52,680  -->  00:04:54,260
And like well what are we going to be talking about.

83

00:04:54,270  -->  00:05:00,110
Give a giving them the the problem I'm outlining the problem and you'll find you'll see me say here

84

00:05:00,120  -->  00:05:00,570
that.

85

00:05:00,830  -->  00:05:03,150
OK so this is is is good.

86

00:05:03,150  -->  00:05:07,980
This percentage is increasing the percentage of people who actually take action is increasing and that

87

00:05:07,980  -->  00:05:08,870
is due to Darcys.

88

00:05:08,880  -->  00:05:13,770
But that's not what we're going to talk about so that's a plot twist and the plot twist then I say that

89

00:05:13,770  -->  00:05:14,940
because a person is so high.

90

00:05:14,940  -->  00:05:16,840
There's a there is a backlog issue.

91

00:05:16,980  -->  00:05:23,940
So we're not going to go into detail of the actual text or the actual problem at hand I'm just showing

92

00:05:23,940  -->  00:05:25,830
you how to structure the presentation.

93

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:31,650
So then once I've told them the problem I make sure that they understand that it's important problem

94

00:05:31,680  -->  00:05:35,430
and it can it can they can relate to it because here are the challenges.

95

00:05:35,610  -->  00:05:41,040
So challenges and as you can see I have like this is all the text I'm going to have in this whole presentation

96

00:05:41,300  -->  00:05:46,740
is after this isn't going to be much text at all so challenges so I highlight four separate challenges

97

00:05:46,770  -->  00:05:51,050
which they can relate to and they also highlight the importance of this.

98

00:05:51,060  -->  00:05:57,380
So step one is to outline the problem that we're going to be discussing and then funny image.

99

00:05:57,480  -->  00:05:59,910
Speaking of ways to engage audience.

100

00:05:59,940  -->  00:06:05,350
So here we say we're going to use our science to approach this problem and solve it.

101

00:06:05,940  -->  00:06:07,350
And there we go.

102

00:06:07,350  -->  00:06:10,630
So here I'm taking them on a journey and putting them in my shoes.

103

00:06:10,670  -->  00:06:16,240
I'm They are imagining that they are a scientist now and for the next 15 minutes.

104

00:06:16,320  -->  00:06:21,300
So I exactly step by step I'm showing them how I approach the problem.

105

00:06:21,300  -->  00:06:26,000
First of all this is exactly what I did I charge a dollar to graphed out.

106

00:06:26,040  -->  00:06:32,430
How many forms were received per in each working day after lodgement saw how much how many of these

107

00:06:32,430  -->  00:06:36,120
forms that we were sending were coming back and how quickly they would come back.

108

00:06:36,120  -->  00:06:38,310
So I saw this this type of curve.

109

00:06:38,370  -->  00:06:45,330
This is exactly as it happened just you know for all the programming or referral the Excel and data

110

00:06:45,360  -->  00:06:49,970
prep and data cleaning just the the fun bits I'm showing them the fun bits of data sets.

111

00:06:50,010  -->  00:06:57,400
Then I applied a three day rolling average so from from this slide I moved to right away the slide.

112

00:06:57,600  -->  00:06:59,570
And then I plotted as a bar chart.

113

00:06:59,730  -->  00:07:04,770
And you know that's a couple of clicks so this presentation is like over 50 slides but every slide takes

114

00:07:04,770  -->  00:07:09,210
like one less than one second on average or one or two seconds on average.

115

00:07:09,210  -->  00:07:10,700
So it worked out really well.

116

00:07:11,070  -->  00:07:12,340
And then after that.

117

00:07:12,390  -->  00:07:13,950
So that's that's what I see so far.

118

00:07:14,040  -->  00:07:19,710
And then in order not to get them bored I decided to give them some quick insights before we go into

119

00:07:19,750  -->  00:07:23,020
the big guns into the real solution to the problem.

120

00:07:23,160  -->  00:07:28,490
So I plotted the cumulative chart and this is also what I did in my analysis and from the simulative

121

00:07:28,500  -->  00:07:38,250
chart what I showed them is that half of the forms are half of the incoming requests were already received

122

00:07:38,250  -->  00:07:39,450
by 13 days.

123

00:07:39,450  -->  00:07:39,920
Right.

124

00:07:39,930  -->  00:07:43,430
So I can show them that I can see this is this.

125

00:07:43,440  -->  00:07:49,080
This is information or an insight which is contained in the data but I can see it and they can see it

126

00:07:49,080  -->  00:07:50,400
too right away from this chart.

127

00:07:50,400  -->  00:07:55,290
It's obvious that only takes 30 days to get half the forms and then there's this longtail.

128

00:07:55,710  -->  00:07:59,940
Then I told him about Pareto's law something that they can take away if they don't operettas low they

129

00:07:59,940  -->  00:08:05,220
can go ahead and apply it further in their own work and I show them how it applies here.

130

00:08:05,340  -->  00:08:11,430
I showed them that 80 percent of the forms or the incoming requests were received about 31 days so not

131

00:08:11,430  -->  00:08:14,060
exactly 80:20 but close enough right.

132

00:08:14,070  -->  00:08:18,060
So you get the 80 percent of the forms back very quickly.

133

00:08:18,060  -->  00:08:24,050
And already this is in terms of backlog it means that the backlog happens in the first 31 days.

134

00:08:24,210  -->  00:08:28,710
And as you'll see from the full presentation is for the for the company.

135

00:08:28,710  -->  00:08:33,540
This means that they have to have the maximum maximum number of people maximum staff in the first 31

136

00:08:33,540  -->  00:08:35,410
days and then they can ease off.

137

00:08:35,790  -->  00:08:40,560
And then so then after they have these inside so they can really see it's interesting if you don't give

138

00:08:40,560  -->  00:08:43,620
them some insights at the very start they'll get bored.

139

00:08:43,650  -->  00:08:48,440
So once they see these in size you can see that oh wow we can derive value from the data.

140

00:08:48,450  -->  00:08:52,040
This data science thing is awesome it's pretty cool.

141

00:08:52,050  -->  00:08:56,250
And also notice by the way a second thing we're talking about here is how little text no text at all

142

00:08:56,250  -->  00:08:57,640
just the picture.

143

00:08:57,750  -->  00:09:01,190
The slides are supporting me not me supporting aside side same thing.

144

00:09:01,200  -->  00:09:02,650
That's how you should present.

145

00:09:02,680  -->  00:09:09,540
Never have never be the the have the slides as the main thing and you're like they'll exhilarate function

146

00:09:09,570  -->  00:09:13,500
performing the auxiliary function supporting the slides in the opposite way around the slides or supporting

147

00:09:13,500  -->  00:09:15,020
what you say people should be looking at you.

148

00:09:15,020  -->  00:09:16,560
Most of the time.

149

00:09:16,980  -->  00:09:20,580
And then I put them together and then I made a funny joke that they look a lot like something I saw

150

00:09:21,030  -->  00:09:23,560
back in university.

151

00:09:23,730  -->  00:09:28,900
And so if you put them close enough that is a log normal distribution right.

152

00:09:28,950  -->  00:09:33,810
So everybody laughs because not many people know what a log normal distribution is.

153

00:09:34,650  -->  00:09:40,590
And so then I take into the process actually show them the tools I was using to find what distribution

154

00:09:40,590  -->  00:09:41,540
this actually is.

155

00:09:41,550  -->  00:09:46,430
So it's not a low gamma distribution not a lognormal not a glow gamma not a Pearson distribution.

156

00:09:46,440  -->  00:09:49,060
And I keep naming these things and they don't understand what I'm talking about.

157

00:09:49,170  -->  00:09:54,420
But to them it's like an anecdote it's like they're seeing what life does scientists is.

158

00:09:54,630  -->  00:09:56,460
I don't expect them to understand these things.

159

00:09:56,460  -->  00:09:58,680
Like I I expect them to see them.

160

00:09:58,890  -->  00:10:00,940
And that's that's the power of pictures.

161

00:10:01,020  -->  00:10:05,790
That's how pictures and journal work together even if people don't understand something they can see

162

00:10:05,790  -->  00:10:06,090
it.

163

00:10:06,120  -->  00:10:11,700
And that's already enough for them to kind of grasp the overall idea because the point of this presentation

164

00:10:11,700  -->  00:10:16,500
is not only to get them to resolve but also take them one journey and by seeing things there like it's

165

00:10:16,500  -->  00:10:18,110
like watching a movie or reading a book.

166

00:10:18,120  -->  00:10:25,640
You don't have to know how to shoot like a gun or ride a horse or you know go scuba diving.

167

00:10:25,650  -->  00:10:32,760
But you can see it in the movie and you can kind of relive that experience with the hero in the movie

168

00:10:32,760  -->  00:10:32,790
.

169

00:10:32,790  -->  00:10:34,530
So this is kind of what's happening here.

170

00:10:34,530  -->  00:10:39,660
They're going through this journey and they're getting sucked into this presentation that's what you

171

00:10:39,660  -->  00:10:40,320
want.

172

00:10:40,710  -->  00:10:44,610
And then they get to get we get here and we get to hear it's not that it's not that.

173

00:10:44,610  -->  00:10:49,200
And then finally we found it right so it's a Frechette distribution and you'll hear me explain in the

174

00:10:49,200  -->  00:10:49,720
video.

175

00:10:49,740  -->  00:10:54,750
This is like a an additional proof that it is a Frechette distribution the cumulative charge fits really

176

00:10:54,750  -->  00:10:55,800
well.

177

00:10:55,800  -->  00:10:59,420
And so you'll hear me explain the video the Forshay distribution is really it's like.

178

00:10:59,490  -->  00:11:00,590
It's fascinating.

179

00:11:00,630  -->  00:11:05,760
This is war and this is where I'm like oh I made another joke saying that this is why I love my job

180

00:11:05,790  -->  00:11:11,640
because the Forshay distribution is actually used and this is true fact to model the behavior of floods

181

00:11:11,670  -->  00:11:13,400
in extreme weather conditions.

182

00:11:13,410  -->  00:11:21,710
So this means that the customers of an organization or pension fund behave in the same way or customers

183

00:11:21,710  -->  00:11:29,450
on a pension fund in Australia should say behave in the same way as a damn response to a flood or two

184

00:11:29,470  -->  00:11:35,420
extremely heavy rainfall and that is you know out of this world like only daughter can show some of

185

00:11:35,410  -->  00:11:35,620
that.

186

00:11:35,640  -->  00:11:40,770
And then you pause and you make them make that thought sink in that this is something you can't logically

187

00:11:40,770  -->  00:11:41,160
think of.

188

00:11:41,160  -->  00:11:45,150
No consultant in the world can tell you that off the top of their head but daughter can.

189

00:11:45,330  -->  00:11:51,220
And dad is super powerful anyway so that's another joke to keep them alive excited.

190

00:11:51,330  -->  00:11:53,370
And what are you going to face next.

191

00:11:53,370  -->  00:11:54,730
That's exactly what you show them.

192

00:11:54,750  -->  00:12:00,570
So I had just had a slide of a question mark and I asked the question so like you're probably thinking

193

00:12:00,570  -->  00:12:08,430
now what is this for is it all sounds cool but what is this for like what is the value to the business

194

00:12:08,430  -->  00:12:10,520
from all these formulas and.

195

00:12:10,590  -->  00:12:16,410
Well and speaking of formulas that for sure distribution allows us to reverse engineer the formula the

196

00:12:16,410  -->  00:12:21,330
distribution of how there are so this takes once again this is not text text because this is more of

197

00:12:21,330  -->  00:12:22,220
a picture.

198

00:12:22,260  -->  00:12:28,950
I expect them to look at this and think Whoa that's that's too much like they should get disgusted by

199

00:12:28,950  -->  00:12:33,520
these formulas they should not want to understand them and I don't I don't need them to understand it

200

00:12:33,520  -->  00:12:33,720
.

201

00:12:33,840  -->  00:12:40,300
You show them the formulas to get them like impress them or frighten them or something cause an emotion

202

00:12:40,310  -->  00:12:40,620
.

203

00:12:40,800  -->  00:12:45,440
And once they've seen the formulas what happens next you say what do you use the formula for.

204

00:12:45,440  -->  00:12:52,080
And I actually show them how I create a tool that will allow to you know model these distributions and

205

00:12:52,080  -->  00:12:57,810
understand the capacity that the company has to have to to avoid a backlog and actually show them like

206

00:12:57,810  -->  00:13:03,120
this is the backlog this is how much stuff will be like there is a backlog so I actually had a picture

207

00:13:03,120  -->  00:13:05,420
showing them how they can see the backlog.

208

00:13:05,430  -->  00:13:10,260
We knew that there was a 40 day backlog but now using the data and through this whole process which

209

00:13:10,260  -->  00:13:18,180
was really fun they can actually see the backlog visually how big it is going to be so this is a prediction

210

00:13:18,780  -->  00:13:21,070
and you'll see it in the full video.

211

00:13:21,090  -->  00:13:21,920
Explain that.

212

00:13:22,200  -->  00:13:29,160
I've already put in the data for the next campaign for the next event like this and this if we do everything

213

00:13:29,160  -->  00:13:32,350
the same way this is how the back at the back was going to be like.

214

00:13:32,470  -->  00:13:33,560
It's not rocket science.

215

00:13:33,660  -->  00:13:35,140
This is what's going to happen.

216

00:13:35,370  -->  00:13:36,660
And we have to avoid it.

217

00:13:36,690  -->  00:13:45,750
And so then using this to you know use created multiple batches and I had a double slide there but I

218

00:13:45,750  -->  00:13:48,150
knew about it so that's Oko.

219

00:13:48,360  -->  00:13:55,410
So a solution was made through data science and we came up a solution that is multiple batches have

220

00:13:55,410  -->  00:14:01,410
to be used and then upped this process was optimized and even reducing the number of people processing

221

00:14:01,410  -->  00:14:07,500
this campaign a backlog reduction battle was.

222

00:14:07,530  -->  00:14:11,950
It was able we were able to achieve a reduction backload from 40 days to three days.

223

00:14:12,000  -->  00:14:12,260
Right.

224

00:14:12,290  -->  00:14:13,620
Water What a great customer expert.

225

00:14:13,630  -->  00:14:16,520
So you can impress them and then and then you say.

226

00:14:16,530  -->  00:14:21,300
So this is what I said in a real position like data science and this is a good good tip for dosshouse

227

00:14:21,300  -->  00:14:21,840
presentations.

228

00:14:21,840  -->  00:14:22,910
Dollar Signs is all hype.

229

00:14:22,920  -->  00:14:24,410
It's a lot of theory.

230

00:14:24,410  -->  00:14:24,690
Right.

231

00:14:24,690  -->  00:14:27,150
So but you want it to be practical.

232

00:14:27,140  -->  00:14:30,460
People want practical application so include that in your presentation.

233

00:14:30,480  -->  00:14:31,740
So I said All right.

234

00:14:31,740  -->  00:14:34,920
We actually we predicted this is what we predict is going to happen.

235

00:14:34,950  -->  00:14:35,190
Right.

236

00:14:35,190  -->  00:14:38,370
So this is how much we can process this is how much we're going to have.

237

00:14:38,610  -->  00:14:38,820
Right.

238

00:14:38,820  -->  00:14:39,300
How bad.

239

00:14:39,300  -->  00:14:41,310
Now we see what actually happened.

240

00:14:41,430  -->  00:14:43,250
And this is a.

241

00:14:43,620  -->  00:14:45,810
And we're monitoring the situation in reality.

242

00:14:45,810  -->  00:14:47,380
So this is what we predicted.

243

00:14:47,430  -->  00:14:51,960
Let's see what happened in the green overlayed green is what actually happens is you can see it's lining

244

00:14:51,960  -->  00:14:55,190
up really well and then like hey explain the anomalies.

245

00:14:55,190  -->  00:14:58,220
Once again you'll you'll see all of that from the full presentation.

246

00:14:58,320  -->  00:15:01,710
Some public call those some errors and so on.

247

00:15:02,070  -->  00:15:04,500
And so what is this.

248

00:15:04,500  -->  00:15:05,770
This is measuring success.

249

00:15:05,780  -->  00:15:08,570
I even named these slides measuring success.

250

00:15:08,610  -->  00:15:15,660
It's important for data size presentations to provide proof and the best proof proof is evidence evidence

251

00:15:15,670  -->  00:15:19,610
that what you forecasted or what you calculated actually works.

252

00:15:19,650  -->  00:15:24,800
And the practical application actually makes the audience go wow.

253

00:15:24,870  -->  00:15:30,330
You did all of this calc all these calculations all this theory all these for share distributions and

254

00:15:30,450  -->  00:15:32,040
it was fun along the way.

255

00:15:32,040  -->  00:15:34,480
Very picturesque lots of images.

256

00:15:34,620  -->  00:15:39,840
And then in the end it actually did work and allowed the company to you know deliver a great customer

257

00:15:39,840  -->  00:15:43,940
experience and a role or consolidate.

258

00:15:44,190  -->  00:15:46,180
Like millions of dollars of funds.

259

00:15:46,260  -->  00:15:51,140
What an impressive presentation what a great ending to a presentation so far.

260

00:15:51,160  -->  00:15:54,630
Like that's something to think about something to consider in your presentations.

261

00:15:54,660  -->  00:15:55,170
Two things.

262

00:15:55,170  -->  00:15:59,630
First of all the journey and I'm sure you just now probably felt like you were in a journey already

263

00:15:59,640  -->  00:16:00,060
.

264

00:16:00,060  -->  00:16:07,620
And the second thing is the lack of text just pictures and that is like data science is visual.

265

00:16:07,660  -->  00:16:14,810
Will we see data and the better you can visualize it the more Culliford you can make it the more N-Gage

266

00:16:14,820  -->  00:16:15,890
audience will be.

267

00:16:16,320  -->  00:16:20,670
So that's how I presented at the same Assef event in 2015.

268

00:16:20,700  -->  00:16:21,800
I wish you luck.

269

00:16:21,810  -->  00:16:23,390
Best of luck with your presentations.

270

00:16:23,390  -->  00:16:28,940
Hope you picked up some useful tips from this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
