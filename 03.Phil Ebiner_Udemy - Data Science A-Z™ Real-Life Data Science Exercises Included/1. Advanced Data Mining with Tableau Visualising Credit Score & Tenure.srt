1

00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:08,610
This is the homework solution for investigating tenure and credit score and seeing if that impacts the

2

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:12,520
choice of people to leave the bank or stay in the bank.

3

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:14,370
So let's get straight into it.

4

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:20,610
We're going to duplicate this sheet that we have estimated Sellery duplicate sheet and we'll call this

5

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:24,990
one the sort of credit score credit score.

6

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:26,210
Two words.

7

00:00:26,600  -->  00:00:27,070
OK.

8

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:30,540
And now we'll create a full credit score.

9

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:38,010
So here it's a bit like you create a bid and obviously it offers you 10 but you don't know unless you

10

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:42,880
live in the U.S. You don't know exactly what the credit score ranges from and to.

11

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:52,230
So let's have a look at credit score you Dharam And here what you want to do is you want to find your

12

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:54,300
column credit score.

13

00:00:54,810  -->  00:00:55,710
There it is.

14

00:00:55,770  -->  00:00:59,880
You want to order it so from minimum to maximum.

15

00:00:59,940  -->  00:01:01,140
Right.

16

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:03,040
Also remember that if you have more.

17

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:04,590
Quite a lot of records here.

18

00:01:04,590  -->  00:01:11,480
The default value might be less than the number of records so just in case check for more.

19

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:14,280
We know that there's 10000 So there's that's all good.

20

00:01:14,280  -->  00:01:19,260
We know that these are all the records and here so you can get the kind of limits so it's minimum 350

21

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:20,910
maximum 850.

22

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:27,900
All right cool so let's use those bands would you want to break it up by maybe looks like maybe 50 would

23

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:29,940
be a good step.

24

00:01:29,940  -->  00:01:31,030
Let's start with 50.

25

00:01:31,170  -->  00:01:33,810
So credit score grade been.

26

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:38,120
And I'll step off the bin will be 50.

27

00:01:38,140  -->  00:01:40,580
OK we've created I've.

28

00:01:41,010  -->  00:01:41,990
We've got our chart.

29

00:01:42,010  -->  00:01:45,270
All we have to do is take credit score and drag it over here.

30

00:01:45,270  -->  00:01:46,350
There we go.

31

00:01:46,350  -->  00:01:56,700
Change the color and let's do like a dark blue something like I don't know maybe like this kind of dark

32

00:01:56,700  -->  00:01:59,290
blue light.

33

00:01:59,910  -->  00:02:00,780
OK.

34

00:02:00,970  -->  00:02:03,550
So what can we see.

35

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:06,890
There's 19 people with a very low credit score and they all left.

36

00:02:06,960  -->  00:02:14,190
But as we talked as we discussed this looks like an anomaly 19 very low number 100 percent very suspicious

37

00:02:14,550  -->  00:02:16,050
and the rest are quite uniform.

38

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:21,200
So maybe there is some something going on here but overall they're about average.

39

00:02:21,200  -->  00:02:24,290
So credit cards distributed well.

40

00:02:24,420  -->  00:02:26,270
So there's a normal distribution.

41

00:02:26,460  -->  00:02:30,270
And at the same time it doesn't have an impact.

42

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:33,610
So people with various credit scores are as likely to leave the bank.

43

00:02:33,670  -->  00:02:38,610
Well you have to do is and your report may make sure that you specify that you excluded this anomaly

44

00:02:38,610  -->  00:02:39,450
.

45

00:02:39,450  -->  00:02:44,430
And next we will move on to tenure so let's duplicate this sheet now.

46

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:49,650
We'll call this one 10 year and same thing.

47

00:02:49,650  -->  00:02:54,300
Tenure is how many years the custom has been if a bank is probably we're going to look at a one year

48

00:02:54,300  -->  00:02:55,220
bond.

49

00:02:55,290  -->  00:02:57,080
It's never a very high.

50

00:02:57,240  -->  00:03:01,680
You can check your daughter said but let's start over one year bad and then we can check it change it

51

00:03:01,690  -->  00:03:01,720
.

52

00:03:01,740  -->  00:03:03,950
If it's too low or too high.

53

00:03:04,140  -->  00:03:06,420
So we'll start off one year.

54

00:03:06,420  -->  00:03:09,320
We've got to been copy the been here.

55

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:17,880
And once again let's change the color to make things more vibrant.

56

00:03:18,060  -->  00:03:19,260
OK is a good one.

57

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:22,240
Let's try purple.

58

00:03:22,240  -->  00:03:23,160
It's a magnetic

59

00:03:26,140  -->  00:03:27,110
plie.

60

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:27,780
All right.

61

00:03:27,780  -->  00:03:28,140
Great.

62

00:03:28,140  -->  00:03:30,140
So what can we see here.

63

00:03:30,200  -->  00:03:39,570
Tenure is interesting it looks like it doesn't matter what age or how long the customer's being in the

64

00:03:39,570  -->  00:03:39,890
back.

65

00:03:39,890  -->  00:03:45,500
It doesn't matter what you feel or care doesn't matter whether it has an impact whether or not the customer

66

00:03:45,500  -->  00:03:46,140
leave the light.

67

00:03:46,140  -->  00:03:53,040
The other thing we can say is that there is a very odd distribution it's it's a uniform distribution

68

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:56,140
across all bands except for 0 and 10.

69

00:03:56,160  -->  00:03:59,910
So the extremes but otherwise it's pretty uniformly distributed.

70

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:02,820
So this does look like something suspicious.

71

00:04:02,850  -->  00:04:03,480
It could be.

72

00:04:03,480  -->  00:04:08,550
It could happen maybe the bank is targeting customers in all.

73

00:04:08,610  -->  00:04:14,610
You know all constantly getting new customers and somehow holding onto old customers or like that's

74

00:04:14,610  -->  00:04:21,150
something you would discuss with somebody who knows more about this who has some insights or some business

75

00:04:21,150  -->  00:04:27,630
knowledge about why they are customers who've been in the bank one year and four years and nine years

76

00:04:27,630  -->  00:04:30,850
and they all have equal numbers.

77

00:04:31,380  -->  00:04:38,700
So that's that's a very interesting observation but the conclusion here is that tenure does not impact

78

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:43,010
the probability or probability the choice of somebody to leave the bank.

79

00:04:43,020  -->  00:04:47,420
It looks like it's pretty well distributed pretty uniform across state.

80

00:04:47,640  -->  00:04:53,130
And right away that's a major point of concern for a bank at the same time because you would expect

81

00:04:53,130  -->  00:04:56,070
that customers that have been banking with you for longer.

82

00:04:56,070  -->  00:05:04,600
So nine eight seven 10 years there would be more likely to stay right as customers to bank with you

83

00:05:04,590  -->  00:05:04,790
.

84

00:05:04,920  -->  00:05:06,240
They develop loyalty.

85

00:05:06,260  -->  00:05:08,160
And the one to stay with you.

86

00:05:08,520  -->  00:05:14,640
But it does seem like the case for this bank this bank seems like they're not doing a good job in helping

87

00:05:14,640  -->  00:05:16,170
customers develop loyalty.

88

00:05:16,320  -->  00:05:22,500
So therefore you would raise this as a red flag maybe you would talk to somebody I'm sure somebody in

89

00:05:22,500  -->  00:05:24,530
the bank would already know about this problem.

90

00:05:24,660  -->  00:05:31,500
But here you've got some actual evidence you've got some hard data suggesting that there is an issue

91

00:05:31,530  -->  00:05:35,190
and it needs to be addressed and that's it.

92

00:05:35,220  -->  00:05:37,730
That's how you solve this homework.

93

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:39,850
Hope you did well I'm sure you did fine.

94

00:05:40,050  -->  00:05:42,550
And I look forward to seeing you back in of course.

95

00:05:42,630  -->  00:05:44,160
Until then happy analyzing
