1

00:00:01,140  -->  00:00:06,480
And finally interpreting coefficients in front of us here we've got the four models that we built in

2

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:09,130
our backward elimination method.

3

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:13,770
And as we agreed Mahler 3 is the best one is the best fitted model.

4

00:00:13,860  -->  00:00:17,210
And if we were to deliver a model on our project it would be this one.

5

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:20,630
So let's go ahead and start interpreting coefficients by looking at this model.

6

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:22,320
Here we've got two variables.

7

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:27,630
R&D spend and marketing spend so it's basically how much companies are spending on their research and

8

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:31,340
development and on their marketing and also about the constant.

9

00:00:31,350  -->  00:00:33,270
And we're predicting profit.

10

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:42,120
So these coefficients here these B 1 and B 2 what they're telling us is that.

11

00:00:42,130  -->  00:00:44,380
So how to how to interpret them.

12

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:51,810
First of all you look at the sign if the sign is positive that means your variable is correlated with

13

00:00:51,810  -->  00:00:56,760
your independent variable is Kolstad with your dependent variable.

14

00:00:56,760  -->  00:01:05,250
Meaning that if you change the value of your independent variable then the value then you can see that

15

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:09,360
the dependent variable will be changing in the same direction.

16

00:01:09,360  -->  00:01:14,790
So basically if you'll be increasing spend on R&D then your profit will be increasing If increasing

17

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:18,000
spend on marketing then your profit is also increasing which makes sense right.

18

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:24,730
So if you're spending more in research and development making your party better than probably your profit

19

00:01:24,730  -->  00:01:26,520
should increase eventually as well.

20

00:01:26,520  -->  00:01:27,450
Same thing with marketing.

21

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:34,500
The more you spend marketing the more you sell and therefore the profit should also go up and that's

22

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:39,090
the sign if the sign is negative if the sign were negative We'll look at an example a bit later than

23

00:01:39,090  -->  00:01:40,110
it's the opposite effect.

24

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:45,470
So basically increase your depende variable and your depende variable decreases.

25

00:01:45,470  -->  00:01:46,960
And now let's look at the magnitude.

26

00:01:46,980  -->  00:01:53,730
So here you can see right away that magnitude is higher foreign the spend and the magnitude is law for

27

00:01:53,900  -->  00:01:54,820
marking spent.

28

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:57,720
Magnitude is always tricky we're regressions.

29

00:01:57,720  -->  00:02:01,350
Be careful of magnitude sign is kind of you know pretty obvious.

30

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:06,740
It's either it's one way or the other magnitude can really trip you up and I can give you an example

31

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:09,540
here so you might think that OK right away.

32

00:02:09,630  -->  00:02:15,510
Magnitude is greater so this this coefficient for R&D spend is bigger than the market spend coefficient

33

00:02:15,510  -->  00:02:18,300
So definitely R&D spend has a bigger impact.

34

00:02:18,570  -->  00:02:24,510
Well what if I tell you that I could easily fall changing anything in the regression I could easily

35

00:02:24,750  -->  00:02:31,260
make this coefficient bigger by a lot by a thousand times bigger than R&D spend.

36

00:02:31,770  -->  00:02:33,000
Well it's easy to do.

37

00:02:33,000  -->  00:02:37,180
All I have to do is say marketing spend instead of looking at it in dollars.

38

00:02:37,210  -->  00:02:43,770
Hobert I look at it in a fraction of a cent so every market is all good and sense.

39

00:02:43,770  -->  00:02:49,830
So marketing spend instead of consing an adult is counted in cents right away because of variable has

40

00:02:49,830  -->  00:02:57,060
gone down 100 times all catfish and will proportionally increase so it'll go up 100 times and if I change

41

00:02:57,060  -->  00:03:02,700
my data and replace everywhere marketing spend with cents and everything else I will leave the same

42

00:03:03,030  -->  00:03:10,510
then rerun this model I guarantee you that the coefficient here will actually become 2.9 9 0 7 9.

43

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:12,120
So it'll just increase 100 times.

44

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:13,750
Everything else will stay the same.

45

00:03:13,860  -->  00:03:16,030
And that way right away you'll see oh wow.

46

00:03:16,080  -->  00:03:23,010
The market is Bank of Shin's greatest so than market has been has a bigger impact on your dependent

47

00:03:23,010  -->  00:03:27,990
variable profit and that's a mistake that a lot of beginners make you should not fall into this trap

48

00:03:28,460  -->  00:03:29,000
Magot.

49

00:03:29,030  -->  00:03:36,810
It is a tricky thing and the way to think about it is always say magnitude in terms of units of the

50

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:37,860
independent variable.

51

00:03:37,860  -->  00:03:43,410
So the correct way to analyze this is even if not knowing what they're measured and maybe this was measured

52

00:03:43,410  -->  00:03:45,730
in thousands of dollars and this was measured in dollars.

53

00:03:45,850  -->  00:03:51,780
I don't know for instance although I do I do know of course I've seen the data but if say I don't know

54

00:03:51,940  -->  00:03:52,170
.

55

00:03:52,320  -->  00:04:01,770
You can still make a conclusion you just have to say this is R&D spend has a greater impact on profit

56

00:04:02,460  -->  00:04:10,920
per unit of R&D spend then marketing then marketing spend has per unit of marketing spend and that's

57

00:04:10,920  -->  00:04:11,080
all.

58

00:04:11,080  -->  00:04:17,880
So basically even if they're measured in different things by saying per unit of the underlying variable

59

00:04:18,180  -->  00:04:24,790
you are protecting yourself from that error that you know they are they are measured in different things

60

00:04:24,800  -->  00:04:25,060
.

61

00:04:25,410  -->  00:04:32,520
And moreover Imagine if they're measured $100 are the ones measured in kilometers or something like

62

00:04:32,520  -->  00:04:34,260
that you can compare dollars and kilometers.

63

00:04:34,260  -->  00:04:34,490
Right.

64

00:04:34,500  -->  00:04:36,770
But you can always say per unit.

65

00:04:36,990  -->  00:04:44,340
And this leads us to the actual interpretation of these variables all these coefficients What does it

66

00:04:44,340  -->  00:04:44,820
mean.

67

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:52,890
So this means 0.7 nine means that for every unit if you keep all other variables constant so you only

68

00:04:52,890  -->  00:04:58,790
have on the verbal So if you keep everything else constant but you are able to adjust R&D spend for

69

00:04:59,160  -->  00:05:06,210
in this model or for it for a hypothetical company for every dollar for every unit of R&D spend that

70

00:05:06,300  -->  00:05:13,770
you increase your profit will increase according to his model your profit will increase by 79 cents

71

00:05:13,770  -->  00:05:14,470
.

72

00:05:14,490  -->  00:05:17,820
That's exactly what this coefficient is saying.

73

00:05:17,830  -->  00:05:24,590
And so for every unit that you decrease in your R&D spend your profit will decrease by seventy point

74

00:05:24,600  -->  00:05:27,230
seventy nine over unit of profit.

75

00:05:27,510  -->  00:05:34,080
And because R&D spend is mission dollars and profit is also $2 that means so for every unit increase

76

00:05:34,170  -->  00:05:41,810
in for every dollar increase in R&D spend your profit will increase in by 79 cents.

77

00:05:42,330  -->  00:05:49,460
So let let me just repeat that again that you are looking at units increase in R&D spend.

78

00:05:49,530  -->  00:05:54,190
They translate through this coefficient into units increase in profit.

79

00:05:54,210  -->  00:06:02,160
So if your profit was measured in apples then a 1 dollar increase and 1 unit increase is always going

80

00:06:02,160  -->  00:06:10,050
to be true one unit increase in R&D spend will drive point seventy nine units increase in profit and

81

00:06:10,130  -->  00:06:12,450
all of course of the profit units.

82

00:06:12,450  -->  00:06:19,920
So let's turn turn that into dollars and apples a one dollar increase in R&D spend will drive a point

83

00:06:19,930  -->  00:06:24,410
79 or 80 percent of an apple increase in profits.

84

00:06:24,510  -->  00:06:31,380
So here you're talking about units of R&D spend and profit you're talking about units of profit and

85

00:06:31,440  -->  00:06:32,670
this coefficient.

86

00:06:32,670  -->  00:06:34,020
It links them together.

87

00:06:34,170  -->  00:06:39,660
So as long as you say per unit you're fine once you already know what these variables are measured and

88

00:06:39,660  -->  00:06:44,460
then you can start comparing them if they're on the same scale and in this case they are on the same

89

00:06:44,460  -->  00:06:50,370
scale because they measured everything is measured in dollars here and you can say that a dollar increase

90

00:06:50,370  -->  00:06:57,000
in R&D spend drives 79 cents dull 79 cents increase in profit and mark a dollar increase in marketing

91

00:06:57,000  -->  00:07:04,770
spend drives only 3 cents increase in profits so basically if you're the venture capitalist which companies

92

00:07:04,770  -->  00:07:09,880
are going to invest in well from this model you're going to decide that you should invest into companies

93

00:07:09,880  -->  00:07:13,180
that are spending more on R&D.

94

00:07:13,260  -->  00:07:17,850
There may be lots of reasons behind this and this is not just around the fact this could be true in

95

00:07:17,850  -->  00:07:24,690
reality because profit is revenue minus expenses maybe marketing does drive a lot of revenue to a company

96

00:07:24,690  -->  00:07:30,810
but at the same time maybe for these specific companies that were looking at their expense the cost

97

00:07:30,810  -->  00:07:38,310
of marketing so the prices that they pay for mortgages so high that the increase in profit the net increase

98

00:07:38,310  -->  00:07:39,780
in profit is actually marginal.

99

00:07:39,780  -->  00:07:45,420
So the marketing is eating up a lot of the revenue is creating whereas R&D is you know is creating a

100

00:07:45,420  -->  00:07:50,250
lot of revenue and a lot of it is actually staying in profit something like that but were not worried

101

00:07:50,250  -->  00:07:51,970
about that right now thats more financials.

102

00:07:51,960  -->  00:07:54,490
What we're doing is we're delivering a model.

103

00:07:54,510  -->  00:08:01,310
All right so that's how you interpret professions with the same sign and on the same scale.

104

00:08:01,380  -->  00:08:06,750
What's going if they're on different scales just say per unit and now let's move on to one of our previous

105

00:08:06,750  -->  00:08:13,080
models is look at this one to a here for example and we'll say we'll kind of ignore for now that they

106

00:08:13,080  -->  00:08:14,190
are insignificant.

107

00:08:14,190  -->  00:08:21,180
So we'll say okay we're not looking at that right now we just want to practice with the coefficients

108

00:08:21,420  -->  00:08:24,990
let's say for instance that they're all significant what would have said to us.

109

00:08:25,110  -->  00:08:30,740
Well R&D spend here you can see we already know that these are old dollars.

110

00:08:30,780  -->  00:08:33,120
This one is a dummy variable so we'll get to that in a second.

111

00:08:33,120  -->  00:08:34,110
So R&D spend.

112

00:08:34,110  -->  00:08:36,030
What happens here.

113

00:08:36,090  -->  00:08:42,920
You know that's a per dollar increase in R&D spend your profit will increase by 80 cents.

114

00:08:42,930  -->  00:08:43,790
Great.

115

00:08:44,070  -->  00:08:50,850
Then marketing spend per dollar that you increase in marketing your profit will increase by 2.6 cents

116

00:08:50,850  -->  00:08:51,060
.

117

00:08:51,060  -->  00:08:54,400
Great then with administration what happens here.

118

00:08:54,420  -->  00:08:56,070
Well you can see that it's negative.

119

00:08:56,430  -->  00:09:03,300
And assuming once again that this is a significant variable independent variable in this model then

120

00:09:03,450  -->  00:09:09,870
what this is saying is that for every dollar increase in administration expense that you incur your

121

00:09:09,870  -->  00:09:12,650
profit is decreasing by 2 cents.

122

00:09:12,660  -->  00:09:18,330
So the more you spend on this administration the lower your profit will be.

123

00:09:18,690  -->  00:09:22,310
And that's an important thing to understand once again this is not a significant variable.

124

00:09:22,320  -->  00:09:26,000
It's not the case in this example so it doesn't really matter what it's saying here.

125

00:09:26,010  -->  00:09:32,100
Could say a million it's significant So we're throwing it out of the model anyway but if it were significant

126

00:09:32,100  -->  00:09:33,210
then that's the thing to think about.

127

00:09:33,210  -->  00:09:38,350
So if you're running a company and you know that the more you spend on the station the lower your profit

128

00:09:38,370  -->  00:09:43,710
then maybe you should stop spending on administration or maybe you should reshuffle your funds or something

129

00:09:43,710  -->  00:09:43,800
.

130

00:09:43,800  -->  00:09:46,920
So it's very insightful actually to know these things.

131

00:09:47,100  -->  00:09:49,480
And in terms of New York what does this saying.

132

00:09:49,500  -->  00:09:57,990
Well this this comes back to the point which we're talking about that our models are not actually biased

133

00:09:57,990  -->  00:10:01,190
towards one categorical category or the other.

134

00:10:01,230  -->  00:10:08,770
As you can see we don't have center California here so what this is saying is that by default if the

135

00:10:09,150  -->  00:10:18,270
New York is zero then the equation is deemed as if it's for California and then if you're in New York

136

00:10:18,270  -->  00:10:25,260
if your company is in New York what happens is this is a one and that means that this profit goes down

137

00:10:25,260  -->  00:10:29,230
by 1332 units if you keep everything else constant.

138

00:10:29,430  -->  00:10:34,710
And you compare a situation in California and New York then.

139

00:10:34,740  -->  00:10:38,760
So basically two companies everything is the same except for one is in California in New York than the

140

00:10:38,760  -->  00:10:48,180
one in New York will have profit which is less by 1332 units point is there are nine of profit because

141

00:10:48,180  -->  00:10:55,960
profit is million dollars that means the profit will go will be lower by 1332 dollars just because the

142

00:10:55,960  -->  00:10:57,170
cost that's in companies.

143

00:10:57,300  -->  00:11:00,870
But once again this isn't a statistically significant variable.

144

00:11:00,960  -->  00:11:04,200
So it doesn't matter what it says here it doesn't matter what the sign is.

145

00:11:04,200  -->  00:11:09,090
It's not portable model because that's our final model so this is just an example.

146

00:11:09,090  -->  00:11:13,320
But once again it would be insightful So if there was a statistically significant Birbal then maybe

147

00:11:13,320  -->  00:11:18,420
the venture capitalist is interested in that and that can drive their decision in which region they

148

00:11:18,420  -->  00:11:21,330
want to invest whether it's California or New York.

149

00:11:21,870  -->  00:11:26,940
So that's how you interpret coefficients with linear regression It's very simple.

150

00:11:26,940  -->  00:11:35,280
Just remember about that per unit trick or tip I guess because if you forget about that you can you

151

00:11:35,270  -->  00:11:37,860
know make the wrong conclusions.

152

00:11:37,900  -->  00:11:40,310
Otherwise it's all pretty simple.

153

00:11:40,320  -->  00:11:45,210
The last thing that I wanted to mention here is that you can see that every time we run a model the

154

00:11:45,210  -->  00:11:46,860
coefficients change.

155

00:11:46,860  -->  00:11:53,220
So what that is telling us is that coefficients actually only talk about the additional effect of every

156

00:11:53,220  -->  00:11:58,350
single variable given that the other variables are already in place so for instance in this example

157

00:11:58,460  -->  00:12:02,540
you could fission of marketing which is 0.39.

158

00:12:02,950  -->  00:12:12,420
It means that given that R&D spend is already in your model and it's fixed then marketing spend adds

159

00:12:12,480  -->  00:12:18,680
additional you know contributes this additional effect of zero point zero to 9 9 or so 9.

160

00:12:18,960  -->  00:12:24,390
Meaning that if you were to ring around a different model and take out R&D spend then the coefficient

161

00:12:24,390  -->  00:12:25,510
would be completely different.

162

00:12:25,590  -->  00:12:31,160
And that's what we see here that when we take our marketing the coefficient for R&D spend is Tichenor

163

00:12:31,200  -->  00:12:38,850
So that's another thing you should remember about that coefficients merely portray the additional effect

164

00:12:38,910  -->  00:12:41,730
that every single variable brings into the model.

165

00:12:41,730  -->  00:12:42,450
Hope you enjoyed this.

166

00:12:42,450  -->  00:12:44,510
Tauriel and I look for see you next time.

167

00:12:44,520  -->  00:12:46,230
Until then happy analyzing
