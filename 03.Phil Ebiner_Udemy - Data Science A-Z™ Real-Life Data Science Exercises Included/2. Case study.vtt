00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:06.270
Case study I've got something very special prepared for you and this is something you won't find in

2

00:00:06.270  -->  00:00:07.490
other courses.

3

00:00:07.500  -->  00:00:14.940
Recently I held a presentation at a major conference for Australian pension fund so they were the largest

4

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:20.850
pension funds or representatives and executives of the largest pension fund present there and also executives

5

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:22.820
of very large Australian banks.

6

00:00:22.980  -->  00:00:27.190
And I presented on Dollar Signs and I'm going to share their presentation.

7

00:00:27.210  -->  00:00:32.450
And in fact in the next little while we're going to take the first part of the video the intro part

8

00:00:32.760  -->  00:00:33.970
and we will analyze it.

9

00:00:33.970  -->  00:00:39.150
So first I'll show you the intro and then we'll go through the intro and I'll add call outs explaining

10

00:00:39.150  -->  00:00:42.280
exactly what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

11

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:47.490
So this is going to be a very interesting experience for you because you will see me present something

12

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:54.000
very recent just a couple months ago that I did some data Dallasites work as a major project a major

13

00:00:54.000  -->  00:01:00.240
breakthrough in the industry and I presented and you will actually see how I went about presenting it

14

00:01:00.310  -->  00:01:06.120
and we together will analyze my mistakes and where where I did well and what you can take away to use

15

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:08.940
in your presentation so it'll be live it won't it.

16

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:13.890
It's not like a rehearsed thing or something that is just for show.

17

00:01:13.890  -->  00:01:16.390
It's actually from the conference.

18

00:01:16.560  -->  00:01:21.540
So there will be an audience there's like 250 people sitting in the audience so I was very nervous on

19

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:22.240
that day.

20

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:29.010
Trust me and I prepared a lot for this presentation and at the same time what I also wanted to say is

21

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:34.800
that even though this was a presentation for a large audience I still use the same skills and techniques

22

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:40.440
when I'm presenting two small groups of people or even on one on one conversations because presenting

23

00:01:40.440  -->  00:01:46.200
dozens projects has lots of specifics to it and we will be talking about them in this section of the

24

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:51.060
course and you will definitely pick up some really valuable insights not only from the presentation

25

00:01:51.090  -->  00:01:54.630
but also from our discussions that we have in this section.

26

00:01:54.660  -->  00:01:56.780
And so let's jump straight into it.

27

00:01:56.790  -->  00:01:59.480
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.
