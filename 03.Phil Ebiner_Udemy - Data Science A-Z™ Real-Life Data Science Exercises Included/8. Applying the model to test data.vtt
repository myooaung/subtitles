00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:04.500
Now that we've talked about training and testing your model today will actually start doing this in

2

00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:05.650
practice.

3

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:11.150
Today we will run our model on the test data set that we have been supplied with.

4

00:00:11.310  -->  00:00:17.130
And in the next tutorial actually compare the performance of the model on the train data and the test

5

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:17.780
data.

6

00:00:17.790  -->  00:00:21.090
So let's go ahead and do all this work now.

7

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:26.730
So Joe demographic segmentation and here are the two data sets that we started with churn modeling and

8

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:33.800
Cherney modeling test data in order to run this model on the test data.

9

00:00:33.810  -->  00:00:36.570
I'm going to do the following things.

10

00:00:36.580  -->  00:00:39.660
I'm going to bring up Excel.

11

00:00:39.660  -->  00:00:47.310
I'm going to copy the test of the normal churn modeling data set in here and then I'm going to

12

00:00:50.280  -->  00:00:54.630
copy the test data set into a separate Excel file.

13

00:00:54.780  -->  00:00:59.760
So now I've got two of them here and all I'm going to do is

14

00:01:03.100  -->  00:01:10.890
I'm going to take all of the rows from the test data set except all the columns except for the last

15

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:15.360
column which actually tells us the results because we don't want the model to know the result.

16

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:19.100
For these people and I'm just going to copy all of them.

17

00:01:19.290  -->  00:01:20.190
So I go to the bottom.

18

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:22.050
There's a thousand records here.

19

00:01:22.320  -->  00:01:29.090
Can I copy them and I'm going to add them to this to this data set at the bottom.

20

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:31.010
So just copy them in here.

21

00:01:31.010  -->  00:01:35.460
So here you can see that they've been out at the bottom but they don't have the result right.

22

00:01:35.460  -->  00:01:41.130
So now when we put the model into the door into Grettel and we build the model we're going to be using

23

00:01:41.580  -->  00:01:48.390
these records because they do have the result and Grindl can and we can build the model based on the

24

00:01:48.390  -->  00:01:57.000
outcome so it can find the right coefficients for the model and then we will use these to actually evaluate

25

00:01:57.000  -->  00:02:05.190
our model so we will ask Grettel to come up with probabilities for these records and then we'll assess

26

00:02:05.190  -->  00:02:06.950
them all on these record separately.

27

00:02:07.260  -->  00:02:14.290
So I'm going to save this as a separate file so I don't overwrite my existing file churn modeling let's

28

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:14.950
call it.

29

00:02:15.020  -->  00:02:20.050
We have test data appended.

30

00:02:20.730  -->  00:02:26.410
OK I will say that.

31

00:02:27.810  -->  00:02:29.680
So there is a data set.

32

00:02:29.760  -->  00:02:36.150
And now we're going to run Grettel File Open Data stop

33

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:41.590
and there it is.

34

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:43.590
That's all good.

35

00:02:43.590  -->  00:02:47.140
So basically we're just doing the same thing as usual right now.

36

00:02:47.310  -->  00:02:48.370
What do we normally do.

37

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:58.310
We add dummies for gender and we are dummies for geography.

38

00:02:58.710  -->  00:03:01.600
So I'm going to change this.

39

00:03:01.710  -->  00:03:03.520
France.

40

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:04.770
OK.

41

00:03:04.770  -->  00:03:10.710
So I've created the dummy variables and rename them and I've added the load balance variable.

42

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:22.050
Now what we need to do is we need to re run the model here we've got our parameters and I'm going to

43

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:25.650
put them into our model.

44

00:03:25.680  -->  00:03:31.110
All right so I have inputted all of the regressors into the model I've put in the dependent variable

45

00:03:31.320  -->  00:03:34.680
show p values but the take here looks good.

46

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:41.910
So now we can run the model and what you should see is you should see the exact same coefficients as

47

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:43.380
we had previously.

48

00:03:43.410  -->  00:03:47.910
Same R-squared everything because even though we did add records curdles not using them griddles only

49

00:03:47.910  -->  00:03:55.470
building the models using observations 1 to 10000 because the last thousand records don't actually have

50

00:03:56.040  -->  00:04:02.070
a value for the outcome and therefore girdled cannot simply just cannot use them in the modeling process

51

00:04:02.070  -->  00:04:03.150
.

52

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:09.720
But what we can do now is we can go to analysis for costs and we want to forecast for this range you

53

00:04:09.720  -->  00:04:15.810
see griddles Mar is already picking up the range from 1 from 10000 1 to 11000 for those records.

54

00:04:15.810  -->  00:04:22.350
We don't want any pre forecast observations or put a 0 here and we don't want it fitted values.

55

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:25.290
It doesn't really matter because we're not going to have any of those anyway.

56

00:04:25.370  -->  00:04:27.530
So now we'll just click OK.

57

00:04:28.140  -->  00:04:28.650
And there you go.

58

00:04:28.650  -->  00:04:34.320
So these are our new records that we added from the test data as you can see they don't have an exited

59

00:04:34.320  -->  00:04:36.570
value but they have a prediction.

60

00:04:36.660  -->  00:04:37.830
And this is the fun bit.

61

00:04:37.830  -->  00:04:43.920
This is the important bit that Grettel will follow even knowing well without knowing what is going to

62

00:04:43.920  -->  00:04:49.190
happen to these records it built the model on the other records as we discussed in the previous tutorial

63

00:04:49.230  -->  00:04:52.490
and now it has applied the model to the new records.

64

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:54.600
And as you can see there are probabilities here.

65

00:04:54.600  -->  00:05:01.490
Now what is the interesting bit is how right has Grettel gone in there or how right has this model gotten

66

00:05:01.500  -->  00:05:02.240
them.

67

00:05:02.280  -->  00:05:06.900
How correct is demographically mutation because we actually know the result.

68

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:09.780
We just did it included in the file it's in a separate file.

69

00:05:09.850  -->  00:05:11.390
That's exactly what we're going to do now.

70

00:05:11.610  -->  00:05:16.650
So we're going to say these records this is not going to be exit hat.

71

00:05:17.280  -->  00:05:31.200
This is going to be hacked as we discussed the hat and maybe we can call it test data and here we're

72

00:05:31.200  -->  00:05:36.350
going to say for probability.

73

00:05:38.380  -->  00:05:39.290
Okay.

74

00:05:40.050  -->  00:05:43.370
So we've said that you don't need that.

75

00:05:43.380  -->  00:05:46.140
So there's our new data new column.

76

00:05:46.140  -->  00:05:49.570
I know we're going to explore that file.

77

00:05:49.800  -->  00:05:54.150
We're going to export data so all we need is row number.

78

00:05:54.420  -->  00:05:56.710
We don't need customer ID.

79

00:05:56.880  -->  00:06:03.160
We own the road number and heart test data CXXVI Khama.

80

00:06:03.270  -->  00:06:12.320
Okay I'm going to say it here and at the end I'm going to add as last time for cost safe don't you do

81

00:06:12.320  -->  00:06:13.280
that anymore.

82

00:06:13.680  -->  00:06:14.190
All right.

83

00:06:14.220  -->  00:06:18.920
So there is our data said let's open up excel and have a look.

84

00:06:20.160  -->  00:06:21.260
There it is.

85

00:06:21.930  -->  00:06:28.210
So and a means that these records didn't have a prediction because we didn't ask for them to predict

86

00:06:28.210  -->  00:06:28.490
it.

87

00:06:28.500  -->  00:06:28.910
That's right.

88

00:06:28.910  -->  00:06:31.230
That's the first 10000 records.

89

00:06:31.230  -->  00:06:33.120
And then as you can see the predictions begin here.

90

00:06:33.120  -->  00:06:42.440
So what we're going to do is we're going to remove these records that don't have predictions.

91

00:06:42.440  -->  00:06:42.870
All right.

92

00:06:42.870  -->  00:06:47.330
So this is our test data predictions.

93

00:06:47.460  -->  00:06:52.330
Now what we're going to do is we're going to open up our previous test data file.

94

00:06:52.440  -->  00:06:54.870
So the original one.

95

00:06:55.830  -->  00:07:01.910
And now what we want to do is get rid of this one.

96

00:07:02.250  -->  00:07:06.930
We want to copy the actual exit value from here into here.

97

00:07:06.930  -->  00:07:12.480
So normally what you would do is look up right but I'm not going to waste your time with that because

98

00:07:12.480  -->  00:07:15.350
I know that I can and I can really see that they are.

99

00:07:15.450  -->  00:07:21.060
They are lined up correctly so I can just take this call them exit it and copy it in to here and I can

100

00:07:21.060  -->  00:07:22.370
close this.

101

00:07:23.190  -->  00:07:29.790
And now what you'll see is that our we don't just only have the ability but we also have the exited

102

00:07:29.810  -->  00:07:35.430
Ballis So this value didn't participate in the modeling but we have appended it now and we can verify

103

00:07:35.760  -->  00:07:41.770
how well what you the when they want to do is copy it and just put it before this column.

104

00:07:41.810  -->  00:07:44.500
So I've done that anyway.

105

00:07:44.550  -->  00:07:51.180
So now we can see that row number exit and then we had not to because that's the order in which we need

106

00:07:51.180  -->  00:07:53.320
to copy them into our template.

107

00:07:53.340  -->  00:07:58.980
And that is going to we're going to use our cap curve template in the next tutorial to build the cap

108

00:07:58.980  -->  00:08:02.710
curve and then compare the results on the train and test data.

109

00:08:02.850  -->  00:08:08.860
So don't forget to save the file and once you're done I will see you in the next tutorial
