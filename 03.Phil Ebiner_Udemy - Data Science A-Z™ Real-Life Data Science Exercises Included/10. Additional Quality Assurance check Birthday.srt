1

00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:03,540
Today will perform one final check.

2

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:09,540
So to illustrate how you can run these if you have some additional knowledge about 2 data.

3

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:13,280
So let's move on to our birthday column.

4

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:24,600
We're going to select star from cinephile table and then we're going to look for columns where let's

5

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:35,080
say birthday is just ridiculously far away meaning for instance where Let's find all the records representing

6

00:00:35,130  -->  00:00:37,040
people over 100 years old.

7

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:43,160
So in this case it will be 19 15 0 8 13.

8

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:49,210
So 100 years ago was their birthday and let's have a look at that.

9

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:51,140
So hero not.

10

00:00:51,390  -->  00:00:54,840
Strangely enough we did find one record where there was one.

11

00:00:55,050  -->  00:01:03,220
The year 1900 and it's the 30th of January so that doesn't look right.

12

00:01:03,360  -->  00:01:10,440
This person is would be 100 and 15 years old now over that going on to his 116.

13

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:19,500
So a good thing to do here is obviously exclude but just in case just in case this is a real client

14

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:26,700
to go ahead and verify although I highly doubt that this would be a real client.

15

00:01:26,700  -->  00:01:30,140
So in this case we're going to just exclude the stroke.

16

00:01:30,150  -->  00:01:36,300
Once again you can copy this record maybe in reality this is just an error most likely is just an error

17

00:01:36,300  -->  00:01:36,830
in the birth.

18

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:37,380
They call them.

19

00:01:37,380  -->  00:01:40,850
So you would go and investigate and find out what the correct birthday is.

20

00:01:40,950  -->  00:01:46,500
Or send his daughter back along with all other records and those you found to get them fixed.

21

00:01:46,500  -->  00:01:51,690
However we're not going to focus on that in this tutorial so we're just going to exclude it now as we

22

00:01:51,720  -->  00:02:02,040
did before replay select star of did eat run the query again copy result underneath for future reference

23

00:02:02,040  -->  00:02:03,450
.

24

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:05,270
All right so we've done the low birthdays.

25

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:11,990
Now let's look at the highborn this same concept select star from the working table once again.

26

00:02:12,120  -->  00:02:14,160
And here we're going to say where birthday

27

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:18,080
is greater than.

28

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:21,990
So depending on your intrinsic knowledge of the data you might know that nobody.

29

00:02:22,000  -->  00:02:27,930
Your company doesn't deal for anybody under 35 or your company or this particular segment that you're

30

00:02:27,930  -->  00:02:31,530
looking at is only 40s to 50s or something like that.

31

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:36,930
So in this case we don't have any of those restrictions so we're just going to go for the essential

32

00:02:36,930  -->  00:02:46,680
ones that perhaps this unless this is you know some school record there's no customers in here in this

33

00:02:46,950  -->  00:02:49,530
financial institution that are under 10 years old.

34

00:02:49,530  -->  00:02:52,340
So how about how we look at that just as an example.

35

00:02:52,340  -->  00:02:59,090
So in this case will be 2005 0 8 13.

36

00:02:59,100  -->  00:03:05,550
So let's see if anybody has a birthday that what happened after that date so we ran that by clicking

37

00:03:05,550  -->  00:03:06,120
on five.

38

00:03:06,240  -->  00:03:11,160
And you can see that there's none here so you can alter this condition once again based on your intrinsic

39

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:12,490
knowledge of the data set.

40

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:18,050
You might look for anybody who's under 20 so we can do that.

41

00:03:18,060  -->  00:03:23,810
But for this data set it should be fine for people to be 20 years old.

42

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:26,170
So let's have a look at that.

43

00:03:26,390  -->  00:03:31,430
You see here we have quite a few records where people born in 96 and 95.

44

00:03:31,710  -->  00:03:37,110
So in this case it's not it's not a valid exclusion we don't need to exclude anything we haven't found

45

00:03:37,110  -->  00:03:37,470
anything.

46

00:03:37,470  -->  00:03:41,260
So in this case we'll just leave it to 2005.

47

00:03:41,880  -->  00:03:43,110
We'll run it.

48

00:03:43,110  -->  00:03:44,040
And just to.

49

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:48,250
So for all disability purposes so that we know it we did run this check.

50

00:03:48,260  -->  00:03:52,970
We'll just say and a hair meaning we did not actually exclude in euros.

51

00:03:53,270  -->  00:04:01,020
And so that's all for this part of the section we were done with the DTL of Phase 3 error handling part

52

00:04:01,110  -->  00:04:02,510
of the course.

53

00:04:02,700  -->  00:04:07,500
And in the next tutorial we will sum up what we learned in this section
