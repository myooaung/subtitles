00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:03.590
Today we're talking about dummy variables.

2

00:00:03.990  -->  00:00:08.820
As you can see here I've copied the top five rows of our data set and have moved the profit column to

3

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:09.610
the left.

4

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:15.780
So basically the information that we have in our data is the profit of each company or of each startup

5

00:00:15.830  -->  00:00:15.910
.

6

00:00:15.930  -->  00:00:22.260
Then the R&D spend the admins spend the marketing spend So those three are expenses that the company

7

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:26.620
incurred and then the state in which it operates either in New York or California.

8

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:33.120
And as you recall the challenge that we're faced with is that the venture capitalist Fund wants to see

9

00:00:33.120  -->  00:00:40.140
if there's any correlations between profit and the months that have been spent on different expenses

10

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:46.640
R&D admin and marketing and also with on which in which stage the company operates.

11

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:53.520
Is there a correlation between profit and all these variables and how would you go about creating a

12

00:00:53.760  -->  00:01:01.050
model to understand how knowing R&D spend admin and marketing and stay to predict profit and so therefore

13

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:06.870
profit is our dependent variable and the rest the blue ones are all independent variables.

14

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:10.930
And what we need to do is build a linear regression.

15

00:01:10.980  -->  00:01:17.790
So let's go ahead and get started as we would with multiple inner aggression we would start by saying

16

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:20.910
Y which is profit is equal to what.

17

00:01:20.910  -->  00:01:21.650
What does it equal to.

18

00:01:21.650  -->  00:01:24.090
Well first of all there is a constant.

19

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:28.950
In this case it's been zero and I've put it under the profit column just because I needed to fit it

20

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:29.710
somewhere.

21

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:33.630
And then we would start adding on these variables into our equation.

22

00:01:33.630  -->  00:01:39.480
So then we've got the Bhiwani coefficient times the X-1 variable which is R&D spend in this case and

23

00:01:39.480  -->  00:01:44.850
X-1 is actually the amount the dollar amount that you see in the R&D column.

24

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:50.420
Then you've got the admin variable which is x 2.

25

00:01:50.410  -->  00:01:54.930
It's got a collection of BE2 once again adman's or in this case X2 is going to be the dollar amount

26

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:56.430
you see in the admin column.

27

00:01:56.430  -->  00:02:01.760
Then you've got the marketing spend X 3 which will be the dollar amount you see in the marketing column

28

00:02:01.760  -->  00:02:02.010
.

29

00:02:02.100  -->  00:02:04.800
And then you've got the state variable.

30

00:02:04.830  -->  00:02:12.110
And here when we get here we're questioning what should we place in our equation for the state column

31

00:02:12.120  -->  00:02:17.670
because we don't actually have a number we don't have a dollar value or any other type of number to

32

00:02:18.450  -->  00:02:21.780
add into our equation we can just add a word into the equation.

33

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:28.230
And the thing here is that the state is actually a categorical variable so we talked about types of

34

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:33.960
variables before and we understood that there's categorical variables and there's numeric variables

35

00:02:33.960  -->  00:02:34.290
.

36

00:02:34.290  -->  00:02:39.810
Well in this case state is a categorical variable and therefore we can add it to our equation we need

37

00:02:39.810  -->  00:02:46.380
to do something about this situation and the approach that you need to take when you face categorical

38

00:02:46.380  -->  00:02:50.370
variables and regression models is you need to create dummy variables.

39

00:02:50.370  -->  00:02:52.760
Let's see how we we can do that.

40

00:02:52.830  -->  00:02:57.300
First you need to go through your column and find all the different categories you have.

41

00:02:57.300  -->  00:03:00.900
So in this case we have two categories in all of our data there's only two categories.

42

00:03:00.900  -->  00:03:02.370
New York and California.

43

00:03:02.550  -->  00:03:09.240
And they are essentially categories so basically they're categorizing Aldara into two classes.

44

00:03:09.240  -->  00:03:11.400
One is companies in New York.

45

00:03:11.400  -->  00:03:16.910
Another one is companies in California in a very similar way we could have had a different column them

46

00:03:16.940  -->  00:03:21.630
sort of stated could have been company size for instance could have been small medium and large and

47

00:03:21.630  -->  00:03:27.210
that would have classified our companies into three different classes and so on so you can have any

48

00:03:27.210  -->  00:03:29.670
type of categories.

49

00:03:29.670  -->  00:03:32.730
In this case it's the state in which they operate.

50

00:03:32.730  -->  00:03:37.560
So for every single category that you followed you need to create a new column for New York to create

51

00:03:37.560  -->  00:03:42.210
a column called New-Yorker for color for immigrants create a calm California so we were kind of expanding

52

00:03:42.210  -->  00:03:46.370
our data set and adding some additional columns into it.

53

00:03:46.440  -->  00:03:47.700
And how do we populate the column.

54

00:03:47.700  -->  00:03:50.550
So this is the fun part to populate these columns.

55

00:03:50.660  -->  00:03:55.800
The start of the New York column and you find all of your rows where state actually says New York and

56

00:03:55.800  -->  00:04:03.180
you need to for those Rosing to put a 1 in the your column and then in California for all the rows that

57

00:04:03.180  -->  00:04:04.130
say California.

58

00:04:04.230  -->  00:04:09.540
Basically for all the rows that don't say new or whatever else they say you just put a zero and then

59

00:04:09.540  -->  00:04:13.010
for California for the column California you do the same thing.

60

00:04:13.050  -->  00:04:19.980
Wherever a row says California in the state column you place a one in the California column and for

61

00:04:20.280  -->  00:04:24.890
any other values in the state column you place a zero in the California column.

62

00:04:25.110  -->  00:04:27.570
And so you end up with a daughter set like this.

63

00:04:27.570  -->  00:04:34.350
And these two new columns are called dummy variables and building your regression model from here is

64

00:04:34.350  -->  00:04:35.300
very simple.

65

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:41.130
All you have to do is use the New York column and you're going to be using it instead of states you're

66

00:04:41.130  -->  00:04:49.250
not going to be using state anymore and basically you add a variable which is before times D1 and D1

67

00:04:49.260  -->  00:04:55.980
in this case is your dummy variable for New York and you don't use the California column either.

68

00:04:56.460  -->  00:05:01.880
So as you can see here all the information in our data is preserved.

69

00:05:02.010  -->  00:05:07.710
If we just stick to the one New York column because you can tell right away if one is a one then it's

70

00:05:07.710  -->  00:05:09.860
a company that works and it operates in New York.

71

00:05:09.930  -->  00:05:12.600
If one is a zero it's a company that operates in California.

72

00:05:12.600  -->  00:05:17.520
So we didn't lose any information by including only the New York call.

73

00:05:17.640  -->  00:05:23.610
And we will actually talk more about why you should never include all of your dummy variable columns

74

00:05:23.940  -->  00:05:25.390
in your regression model.

75

00:05:25.380  -->  00:05:32.120
We'll talk more about that in the next tutorial when we're talking about the dummy variable trap.

76

00:05:32.250  -->  00:05:39.600
But for now I would like to discuss two things so first of all the New York column or all of the dummy

77

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:41.650
variables they work as switches.

78

00:05:41.760  -->  00:05:45.990
In this case let's look at the New York column which we're including in our regression.

79

00:05:46.050  -->  00:05:53.160
It works like a light switch so if it's a one then you know that this company is in New York.

80

00:05:53.160  -->  00:05:59.340
If it's a zero sold off in this case in the case of the picture then you know that the company doesn't

81

00:05:59.340  -->  00:06:00.300
work in New York.

82

00:06:00.480  -->  00:06:01.590
And so then you go.

83

00:06:01.590  -->  00:06:06.720
Obviously it works in California because you only have two options so the dummy variables work like

84

00:06:06.720  -->  00:06:11.640
light switches and that's why they're ones and zeros and they don't need any other values in them.

85

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:15.330
And the second thing is that when you look at this approach it might seem biased.

86

00:06:15.330  -->  00:06:19.250
So we are including a variable for New York and there's a coefficient for.

87

00:06:19.270  -->  00:06:25.560
So we basically have this benefit of having a coefficient in our equation for New York which is before

88

00:06:26.190  -->  00:06:31.920
but for California there's no coefficient because when D-1 is 0 that whole loss part of the equation

89

00:06:31.920  -->  00:06:37.610
becomes zero and there's no benefit of a coefficient in our equation for California.

90

00:06:37.650  -->  00:06:42.720
Might seem biased at first but in reality that's not the case because the way regression models work

91

00:06:42.750  -->  00:06:49.710
is that they will take by default that state or that variable that dummy variable that you have not

92

00:06:49.710  -->  00:06:55.170
included will become the default situation for this regression model.

93

00:06:55.170  -->  00:07:03.090
So basically what that means is that the coefficient for California is going to be included in the constant

94

00:07:03.120  -->  00:07:04.270
and be zero.

95

00:07:04.560  -->  00:07:12.390
And by default when D-1 is equal to zero this whole equation will turn into an equation you can think

96

00:07:12.390  -->  00:07:14.510
of it as it will turn into equation for California.

97

00:07:14.640  -->  00:07:22.830
But then when Diwan becomes one you're adding before which is once again like this is a very basic explanation

98

00:07:22.860  -->  00:07:27.450
but you're adding a coefficient which is the difference between New York and California.

99

00:07:27.450  -->  00:07:27.910
So.

100

00:07:28.020  -->  00:07:33.660
So basically you're altering from California to New York by flipping this light switch if it's on off

101

00:07:33.690  -->  00:07:38.070
then kind of default state and the whole equation is working for California.

102

00:07:38.070  -->  00:07:45.270
If it's on on then by adding that before you're altering the equation from the default state of California

103

00:07:45.300  -->  00:07:46.160
to New York.

104

00:07:46.290  -->  00:07:52.110
So that's a intuitive way to think of dummy variables so there's nothing wrong with the fact that we're

105

00:07:52.110  -->  00:07:53.370
only including one.

106

00:07:53.730  -->  00:08:00.780
And once again in the next tutorial We'll talk more about why it is a bad idea to include both dummy

107

00:08:00.780  -->  00:08:01.370
variables.

108

00:08:01.680  -->  00:08:02.810
Look for the next time.

109

00:08:02.820  -->  00:08:04.350
Until then happy analyzing
