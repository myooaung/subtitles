00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:02.430
Sometimes you have to go to the top.

2

00:00:02.460  -->  00:00:06.530
The good old if you can do it for me I will go talk to your boss.

3

00:00:06.570  -->  00:00:11.910
Now the way I see a data scientist in an organization is like a doctor who walks around finds problems

4

00:00:11.910  -->  00:00:13.260
and efficiencies and fixes them.

5

00:00:13.500  -->  00:00:18.210
And sometimes you can see him as a magician because he can save a company a million dollars out of thin

6

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:18.750
air.

7

00:00:19.110  -->  00:00:25.320
Well things that Siddarth scientists do the projects that we are involved in often have to be very agile

8

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:25.990
and quick.

9

00:00:26.130  -->  00:00:31.860
And whether you like it or not inevitably you will come across people who consciously or unconsciously

10

00:00:32.130  -->  00:00:36.000
will be putting roadblocks in your way and you got to deal with it somehow.

11

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:41.280
And if you can't deal with it with the person directly then my personal approach and once again this

12

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:42.720
will work for everybody.

13

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:47.250
But the way I deal with things is I don't hesitate to go to the person's manager.

14

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:49.930
I don't hesitate to go to the person's manager's manager.

15

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:56.070
I don't hesitate to go to the General Executive for this department and I don't even hesitate to go

16

00:00:56.070  -->  00:00:56.900
to the CEO.

17

00:00:56.910  -->  00:00:58.550
In fact in all my previous roles.

18

00:00:58.680  -->  00:01:00.050
I was constantly one.

19

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:06.270
Well one of the most frequent visitors in the CEO's office was just chatting to him on a monthly basis

20

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:13.620
just making sure that my projects have priority and they are getting traction with the business because

21

00:01:13.710  -->  00:01:20.670
you will find people who are slow who are slow to adapt to this changing environment that doright is

22

00:01:20.700  -->  00:01:23.220
driving everything in this day and age.

23

00:01:23.250  -->  00:01:25.470
And you got to work on that how.

24

00:01:25.590  -->  00:01:31.290
Now having said that I did get a bit of feedback saying that I rubbed quite a lot of people the wrong

25

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:33.480
way and made quite a few enemies along the way.

26

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:35.300
But that's the reality of life.

27

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:38.440
The important thing is that I got the job done.

28

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:42.160
I delivered value for the business and everything else doesn't matter.

29

00:01:42.180  -->  00:01:47.190
At the end of the day it's about how much value delivered to the business and personally.

30

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:54.300
That's my philosophy about my work that I believe that the work over Dallasites is way more important

31

00:01:54.420  -->  00:01:56.690
than other people perceive it to be.

32

00:01:56.790  -->  00:02:02.970
And unless you can win them over and help and make them into allies then you have to go around them

33

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:04.820
and still get the job done.

34

00:02:05.010  -->  00:02:10.920
Once again this will be dependent on the set up in your company so maybe you have a large data size

35

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:16.410
team where you have some predefined functions that you have to fulfill and you don't have that level

36

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:20.850
of autonomy where you walk around business and you decide the work that you do and what projects you

37

00:02:20.850  -->  00:02:22.550
want to focus on.

38

00:02:22.710  -->  00:02:27.720
In that case maybe this approach will work but if you do have that level of autonomy and you do need

39

00:02:27.720  -->  00:02:31.090
to get the job done well that's that's the way I do it.

40

00:02:31.110  -->  00:02:36.360
And you can you can make your conclusions from that and see what will work best for you.
