00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:07,480
In this tutorial we will continue dealing with our corrupt cxxviii File.

2

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:12,690
We're not we're not going to do any modifications to this slide because obviously we don't have this

3

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:15,020
data we don't know how to return it.

4

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:22,110
The only thing we can do is exclude it completely from our analysis and not uploaded and but we definitely

5

00:00:22,110  -->  00:00:24,600
have to still keep it for our own records.

6

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:26,070
So I'll show you how to do that.

7

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:30,080
We're going to open up our folder again.

8

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:37,980
And then here in uploader daughter actually in uploader Darwood we need to do is we'll do that later

9

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:39,660
we'll delete this file.

10

00:00:39,810  -->  00:00:45,390
Well we'll do that just now actually we first met you go to analysis and we need to create here a folder

11

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:51,690
which will call daughter anomalies or let's call a daughter errors same thing.

12

00:00:51,690  -->  00:01:00,860
So here we want to create a folder we need to create a folder or we'll call it manually excluded results

13

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:07,680
and into this folder we want to copy just disrobe but not from our prepared file from the original file

14

00:01:07,680  -->  00:01:07,710
.

15

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:09,830
So here we've got this copy of the original.

16

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:15,410
So what we're going to do is we're going to take everything out from here.

17

00:01:15,660  -->  00:01:22,180
To take everything out all the way to the end.

18

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:26,290
Just make sure you don't delete anything in this row.

19

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:26,960
There we go.

20

00:01:26,970  -->  00:01:36,180
And now we're going to take this row and we'll save it as manually extruder results.

21

00:01:36,660  -->  00:01:42,990
And here we will say Fakenham original something like this so it's up to you how you name this because

22

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:48,510
these are anomalies and you never know what you come when you come across so row 81.

23

00:01:48,720  -->  00:01:51,040
So there it is it's a very small one kilobyte.

24

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:53,620
That's that's our specific Rovere we want to look at it.

25

00:01:53,640  -->  00:01:59,860
And now from our prepared data file We're going to go to row 81 this we can close this.

26

00:02:00,180  -->  00:02:03,390
We're going to go to row 81 and we're going to this one.

27

00:02:03,390  -->  00:02:04,330
That's it.

28

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:08,490
That's the one with the arrows and we're going to get rid of it.

29

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:10,330
So now we've got 80 82.

30

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:16,050
But we know that we've excluded this role from our analysis Roe 96.

31

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:22,380
Once again this 96 this row 96 we have fixed it up and there shouldn't be any problems with that rule

32

00:02:22,400  -->  00:02:22,820
.

33

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:27,420
OK so that's that's that's the last thing that we need to have a look at.

34

00:02:27,420  -->  00:02:30,290
Here is why is this column here.

35

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:36,150
Well this column is here is here because exactly of things like that when browes got shifted to the

36

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:36,460
right.

37

00:02:36,460  -->  00:02:38,480
In Excel Excel didn't cut them off.

38

00:02:38,490  -->  00:02:40,600
It created a new column for them.

39

00:02:40,720  -->  00:02:45,630
And in a way we should thank Excel for that because otherwise we would have lost this data.

40

00:02:45,930  -->  00:02:48,940
So we're not going to remove this column at all or anything.

41

00:02:49,020  -->  00:02:54,840
We're going to upload our data and then we will look for more anomalies because these are the first

42

00:02:54,840  -->  00:02:56,280
100 rows right.

43

00:02:56,310  -->  00:03:00,190
That can be much more of these anomalies or doora discrepancy.

44

00:03:00,190  -->  00:03:06,660
And by the way give you a hint there are there because I put them there because this is training and

45

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:10,350
we're going to have to find ways to deal with them along the way.

46

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:14,560
So this is how data upload works.

47

00:03:14,940  -->  00:03:19,080
And to finish off today's tutorial we're going to cancel this because this upload failed we're going

48

00:03:19,080  -->  00:03:20,390
to have to redo it.

49

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:23,430
Now we're going to go to our notepad.

50

00:03:23,430  -->  00:03:24,150
Plus plus.

51

00:03:24,150  -->  00:03:31,050
And we need to remember to save this file where we modified row number 96 so we made it work and we

52

00:03:31,050  -->  00:03:34,290
deleted row number 81 So let's go ahead and save that.

53

00:03:34,290  -->  00:03:36,920
This is the prepared daughter fake names.

54

00:03:36,930  -->  00:03:39,410
Yes we were saving not good.

55

00:03:39,450  -->  00:03:40,610
Close that.

56

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:45,450
And now we're going to go to our folder.

57

00:03:45,450  -->  00:03:48,670
This is our excluded result.

58

00:03:48,690  -->  00:03:54,870
Now we're going to go back to analysis fake names so here in the prepared data for that we don't need

59

00:03:54,870  -->  00:04:00,380
this anymore we're just using that to compare and then to extract extract that Roe 81 which we excluded

60

00:04:00,380  -->  00:04:01,330
from our analysis.

61

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:08,100
So we're just going to delete this and this fake name file We're going to copy it and we're going to

62

00:04:08,100  -->  00:04:09,370
go to upload a daughter.

63

00:04:09,390  -->  00:04:10,580
Still today's date.

64

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:15,480
So we want to get rid of this file because that's the one with the errors.

65

00:04:15,480  -->  00:04:21,210
Now we're going to paste our file that we've corrected in here and we're not keeping the old one if

66

00:04:21,210  -->  00:04:21,540
there is.

67

00:04:21,540  -->  00:04:27,240
Because in your uploaded dotted folder in here you never want anything that wasn't actually uploaded

68

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:29,750
so you want only the things that got uploaded.

69

00:04:29,770  -->  00:04:31,970
So there you go so that's the file in there.

70

00:04:31,970  -->  00:04:39,690
Now if we create a new connection manager if you go to browse and you find this new file there it is

71

00:04:40,770  -->  00:04:42,500
you put your delimiter in.

72

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:44,530
So now everything should be fine.

73

00:04:44,580  -->  00:04:47,140
Scroll to the right and scroll down.

74

00:04:47,280  -->  00:04:51,120
There's nothing in column 46 good so that's around 96.

75

00:04:51,120  -->  00:04:54,170
Let's have a look at it for you scroll.

76

00:04:54,170  -->  00:04:55,400
Here you can see.

77

00:04:55,800  -->  00:04:57,480
Thank you great experience that's great.

78

00:04:57,480  -->  00:04:58,620
It's working.

79

00:04:58,620  -->  00:05:00,110
And then row 81.

80

00:05:00,150  -->  00:05:01,170
It's not even here.

81

00:05:01,200  -->  00:05:02,870
We've excluded from analysis.

82

00:05:02,940  -->  00:05:05,910
So that's how you deal with errors like this.

83

00:05:06,000  -->  00:05:07,460
One more thing to finish off.

84

00:05:07,460  -->  00:05:13,410
You probably want to keep track of a rose that you've corrected manually so if you go back to this folder

85

00:05:13,410  -->  00:05:22,170
here which is an analysis of errors manually exclude results so here you might want to create another

86

00:05:22,170  -->  00:05:23,100
file and just say

87

00:05:25,740  -->  00:05:29,760
adjusted row.

88

00:05:30,060  -->  00:05:32,700
What is it 96.

89

00:05:32,730  -->  00:05:38,860
And then here just say manually manually corrected the feedback field.

90

00:05:39,110  -->  00:05:41,270
So just so you remember just in case.

91

00:05:41,330  -->  00:05:49,290
So actually an excluded road so you might want to like create another folder here manually corrected

92

00:05:49,290  -->  00:05:51,260
rows.

93

00:05:53,160  -->  00:05:55,420
So get rid of that and put it in here.

94

00:05:55,500  -->  00:05:58,190
So just you keep track of these things as well.

95

00:05:58,470  -->  00:06:01,490
So that's it that's how daughter preparation works.

96

00:06:01,510  -->  00:06:03,680
Once again this is just the first hundred.

97

00:06:03,690  -->  00:06:07,740
Are we going to have to find a way to deal with the rest and I'll show you how to do that later in the

98

00:06:07,740  -->  00:06:09,610
section.
