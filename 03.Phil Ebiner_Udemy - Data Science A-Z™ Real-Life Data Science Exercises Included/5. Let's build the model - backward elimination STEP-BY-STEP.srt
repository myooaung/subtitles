00:00:01,020  -->  00:00:07,740
Glad to see you back here today we are commencing our step by step elimination and as I mentioned there

2

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:09,440
will be a lot of steps.

3

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:11,340
So prepare yourself for this.

4

00:00:11,330  -->  00:00:20,130
This is going to take a while and we're going to be really diving into creating a proper robust logistic

5

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:20,840
regression.

6

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:22,360
So let's get started.

7

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:25,600
This is our first iteration that we did last time.

8

00:00:25,620  -->  00:00:29,760
Once again we're not discussing it efficiency right now because a lot of these variables are going to

9

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:30,480
be eliminated.

10

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:33,110
The coefficients are going to change P-value are going to change.

11

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:34,530
Everything is going to change.

12

00:00:34,650  -->  00:00:38,280
Then we've got over here stats around the model.

13

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:40,710
So what we are looking at is adjusted r squared.

14

00:00:40,710  -->  00:00:45,750
We want to see that we follow steps is it going to improve or is it going to deteriorate and that will

15

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:51,780
help us keep track of whether we're doing the right thing every single time or not.

16

00:00:51,810  -->  00:00:56,040
We've got to our accuracy rate here 81 percent.

17

00:00:56,070  -->  00:01:02,100
We can also look at that and see if it improves or drops off as we remove variables.

18

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:03,740
Here you've got your confusion matrix.

19

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:08,540
So you can see a few Type 1 errors and quite a lot of type 2 errors.

20

00:01:08,550  -->  00:01:13,630
So those of false negatives when we said they won't leave but they actually left.

21

00:01:13,890  -->  00:01:22,110
And so as we go through this process we're going to be trying to improve the parameters and statistics

22

00:01:22,110  -->  00:01:28,160
of this model but most importantly get rid of the variables that don't have a significant impact.

23

00:01:28,440  -->  00:01:35,500
And at the bottom we have a message from Grettel actually telling us that excluding the other constant

24

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:41,340
excluding the constant the top one we hear P-value was highest for variable 18 Spain.

25

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:48,750
So there it is actually telling you which P-value is the highest here you can see 0.6 1 8 1 and it is

26

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:50,300
indeed the highest of all them.

27

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:51,470
Why does Grinnel tell you that.

28

00:01:51,480  -->  00:01:58,110
Well that's because griddles smart it already knows what you are probably going to do and that is the

29

00:01:58,110  -->  00:02:03,330
backward elimination method and it knows for the backward elimination method you need the highest P-value

30

00:02:03,540  -->  00:02:04,680
as you remember.

31

00:02:04,890  -->  00:02:12,390
We take the highest P-value we excluded from our model if it is greater than our threshold and then

32

00:02:12,390  -->  00:02:16,850
we redo that step again looking for the next highest P-value.

33

00:02:17,040  -->  00:02:19,280
So that's what we're going to be doing right now.

34

00:02:19,410  -->  00:02:20,640
Let's get straight into it.

35

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:27,120
I'm going to move this model over here because we're going to have a lot of them and I'm going to create

36

00:02:27,120  -->  00:02:27,840
a new one.

37

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:30,750
So we're excluding Spain right.

38

00:02:31,290  -->  00:02:33,030
Limited logic binary.

39

00:02:33,900  -->  00:02:36,420
Let's find Spain and get rid of it.

40

00:02:37,200  -->  00:02:38,820
OK.

41

00:02:38,820  -->  00:02:47,580
So there's our second iteration and here you can see Grettel is telling us variable 18 has the highest

42

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:49,340
has credit card.

43

00:02:49,420  -->  00:02:54,870
Let's have a look at that has credit cards 0.44 that is greater than our threshold so let's exclude

44

00:02:54,870  -->  00:02:56,370
that as well.

45

00:02:56,460  -->  00:03:00,360
It's going to start taking up some space limited logic.

46

00:03:00,390  -->  00:03:01,460
Binary.

47

00:03:02,370  -->  00:03:07,150
And we want to get rid of has credit card.

48

00:03:07,830  -->  00:03:12,650
So meaning that living in Spain all the outlets that's right let's go through them.

49

00:03:12,930  -->  00:03:17,700
First one was that if you live the baseline is France right.

50

00:03:17,700  -->  00:03:24,380
So then we have Spain and Germany we have a dummy for Spain and we have a dummy for Germany.

51

00:03:24,420  -->  00:03:27,900
The fact that this one is significant and this one is not.

52

00:03:27,930  -->  00:03:28,520
What does that mean.

53

00:03:28,530  -->  00:03:37,770
Well that means that people who live in Germany are substantially different in terms of their probability

54

00:03:37,770  -->  00:03:43,380
to leave the bank to people who live in France whereas people who live in Spain because this variable

55

00:03:43,380  -->  00:03:49,260
is not significant what that means is people in Spain are as likely to leave the bank as people who

56

00:03:49,260  -->  00:03:50,100
live in France.

57

00:03:50,100  -->  00:03:56,430
So all other things equal if you take three people one from Germany one from France one from Spain.

58

00:03:56,430  -->  00:04:00,120
Then the person from Spain and France are going to be as likely to leave the bank.

59

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:04,560
So they will be they'll have the same likelihood to leave the bank whereas the person who lives in Germany

60

00:04:04,560  -->  00:04:08,020
because this variable is greater than zero.

61

00:04:08,070  -->  00:04:12,020
That person will have a higher likelihood to leave the bank.

62

00:04:12,120  -->  00:04:17,760
So that means that perhaps maybe there's a competitor in Germany that is taking all of the people maybe

63

00:04:18,350  -->  00:04:23,580
the departments in Germany not performing as well or the customer service is not as good or the product

64

00:04:23,580  -->  00:04:29,090
that was rolled out in all of these regions and it didn't succeed for some reason in Germany.

65

00:04:29,100  -->  00:04:35,910
So something is going on there and that's what we did we took out Spain because it's the same as the

66

00:04:35,910  -->  00:04:37,440
baseline as France.

67

00:04:37,620  -->  00:04:44,790
But we left Germany because as you can see it's very significant the next step what we're doing now

68

00:04:44,790  -->  00:04:47,330
is we're taking out a credit card right.

69

00:04:47,340  -->  00:04:51,070
So let's have a look here has credit card as you can see it's got a fish.

70

00:04:51,090  -->  00:04:55,770
But before you look at the coefficient whether it's positive negative small or large.

71

00:04:55,770  -->  00:05:02,130
Always look at the value of the pure use is not in your threshold or is like in this case very far from

72

00:05:02,130  -->  00:05:05,460
your threshold threshold is 0.05.

73

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:09,180
Here is 0.44 So that means it's not a significant variable.

74

00:05:09,310  -->  00:05:16,030
That means that we're not we can say with confidence that this effect is is predicting anything.

75

00:05:16,020  -->  00:05:19,750
So what we're doing now is we taking this variable out.

76

00:05:19,890  -->  00:05:26,680
And in terms of logic what that means is that people who have credit cards are not either less or more

77

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:27,810
likely to save a bank.

78

00:05:27,810  -->  00:05:31,240
It doesn't matter if you take two people and hold everything else equal.

79

00:05:31,260  -->  00:05:36,060
Then whether or not that person well one person has a credit card with the bank the other one doesn't

80

00:05:36,060  -->  00:05:36,230
.

81

00:05:36,270  -->  00:05:41,170
Then they'll be as they'll be they'll have the same likelihood or probability of leaving the bank.

82

00:05:41,160  -->  00:05:44,000
So that's why we're taking out his credit card.

83

00:05:44,010  -->  00:05:46,590
And I think I've already taken it out right.

84

00:05:46,990  -->  00:05:49,740
Yep salesclerk OK.

85

00:05:49,870  -->  00:05:53,160
That's our third one.

86

00:05:53,160  -->  00:05:57,150
Now let's see where we're up to next one is estimated salary.

87

00:05:57,150  -->  00:06:00,430
So we need to remove this variable because it's not significant.

88

00:06:00,450  -->  00:06:04,080
It's the highest P values and the value is above the threshold.

89

00:06:04,080  -->  00:06:05,780
Why are we removing estimated salary.

90

00:06:05,790  -->  00:06:11,580
Well there could be a lot of reasons for instance it actually doesn't affect how likelihood of people

91

00:06:11,580  -->  00:06:18,010
leaving or not or that another reason is that it could be calculated incorrectly that the algorithm

92

00:06:18,000  -->  00:06:21,240
that calculates estimated salary might not be the best one.

93

00:06:21,600  -->  00:06:28,040
And therefore we can see that this variable is not having any influence.

94

00:06:28,140  -->  00:06:33,790
So maybe we can investigate that further later on or put that into our report that estimated Allergan

95

00:06:33,840  -->  00:06:35,490
and have an effect.

96

00:06:35,500  -->  00:06:41,210
However if you did expect it to have an effect then perhaps review the formula for estimates.

97

00:06:41,380  -->  00:06:47,130
So let's run another one binary estimated salary take it up.

98

00:06:47,600  -->  00:06:48,770
Okay.

99

00:06:49,620  -->  00:06:54,670
So by the way we should be also we should be looking at all our squared.

100

00:06:54,690  -->  00:07:00,300
So here you can see 0.1 5 or 7 0.1 5 0 9 and went up.

101

00:07:00,300  -->  00:07:01,020
Right.

102

00:07:01,020  -->  00:07:02,170
That's good.

103

00:07:02,340  -->  00:07:08,000
Then here you can see zero point 1 5 0 9 0 point 1 5 1 1 goods is going up.

104

00:07:08,010  -->  00:07:15,360
As you remember when our square increases that's good the models is these variables fit the model better

105

00:07:15,370  -->  00:07:16,480
than these variables.

106

00:07:16,710  -->  00:07:19,650
And also you can see that the actress says she's going to growing up as well.

107

00:07:19,650  -->  00:07:21,850
So here we got eighty one point one percent.

108

00:07:21,880  -->  00:07:23,790
Here it was only 81 percent.

109

00:07:24,210  -->  00:07:25,360
That's also good.

110

00:07:25,620  -->  00:07:26,810
And now what do we have.

111

00:07:27,090  -->  00:07:34,450
We have ours at R-squared Zero Point 1 5 1 1 9 7 so it went up a little bit and accuracy actually went

112

00:07:34,440  -->  00:07:35,520
up a little bit as well.

113

00:07:35,550  -->  00:07:39,350
So that means we're not we have an X with a variable that we shouldn't have excluded.

114

00:07:39,780  -->  00:07:40,950
Good.

115

00:07:40,950  -->  00:07:42,530
So what are we excluding this time.

116

00:07:42,730  -->  00:07:43,450
Is it.

117

00:07:43,920  -->  00:07:50,250
Griddle hasn't given us any hint on what we should exclude and what that means is that all variables

118

00:07:50,670  -->  00:07:56,090
have a p value of 0.1 or less so less than 10 percent 10 percent or less.

119

00:07:56,380  -->  00:07:59,690
But for us it's not sufficient because our threshold is there are five.

120

00:07:59,700  -->  00:08:04,020
So let's have a look through these and see if there's a variable that we need to exclude.

121

00:08:04,020  -->  00:08:06,400
So first of all we look for the one of the highest P-value.

122

00:08:06,450  -->  00:08:15,660
It's just one €10 here and it's got 0.0 8 7 3 so that's above our threshold and I not that far above

123

00:08:15,660  -->  00:08:15,690
.

124

00:08:15,690  -->  00:08:17,490
So here we got to be careful.

125

00:08:17,500  -->  00:08:23,070
This might be one of those variables that we should exclude according to our rule but in reality does

126

00:08:23,230  -->  00:08:24,020
help the model.

127

00:08:24,120  -->  00:08:26,880
So that's where our adjusted R-squared will help us out.

128

00:08:27,060  -->  00:08:30,260
Let's go ahead and see if we need to exclude it.

129

00:08:30,300  -->  00:08:32,930
We're going to go limited logic binary.

130

00:08:33,210  -->  00:08:36,260
And here we'll take tenure and take it up.

131

00:08:36,530  -->  00:08:37,260
Okay.

132

00:08:37,650  -->  00:08:40,540
And now just compare these side by side.

133

00:08:40,600  -->  00:08:42,590
So what happened we took out tenure.

134

00:08:42,810  -->  00:08:44,720
Did the R-squared go up or down.

135

00:08:44,760  -->  00:08:50,100
So 1 5 1 1 9 7 1 5 1 1 0 6.

136

00:08:50,130  -->  00:08:51,720
So it actually went down.

137

00:08:52,000  -->  00:08:56,490
What happened to the accuracy accuracy was eighty one point two percent went down to eighty one point

138

00:08:56,500  -->  00:08:57,120
one percent.

139

00:08:57,120  -->  00:08:57,590
It's not a.

140

00:08:57,600  -->  00:08:59,860
Just three people but.

141

00:09:00,250  -->  00:09:06,900
So this is not your main criteria your predominant criteria should be the adjusted R-squared or any

142

00:09:06,900  -->  00:09:09,980
other coefficient that you are following over here.

143

00:09:10,000  -->  00:09:13,860
So it says that it went down.

144

00:09:13,870  -->  00:09:16,420
It didn't go down that much went down a little bit.

145

00:09:16,620  -->  00:09:24,990
So it's kind of borderline You can take it out if you like if you feel that it doesn't have any sense

146

00:09:25,000  -->  00:09:26,140
to keep it in.

147

00:09:26,400  -->  00:09:33,360
I'm going to I'm actually going to keep it in because I believe that tenure should be a factor because

148

00:09:33,750  -->  00:09:38,990
the longer you've been a bank right you develop loyalty over time so you should the longer you've been

149

00:09:39,000  -->  00:09:42,570
should be less likely to leave and here that's why we see it's a negative sign.

150

00:09:42,580  -->  00:09:43,850
So they are less likely to leave.

151

00:09:44,030  -->  00:09:49,500
But the fact that it's such an insignificant variable What is that is telling us is that the bank is

152

00:09:49,500  -->  00:09:55,080
not doing a really good job of developing loyalty in their customers.

153

00:09:55,090  -->  00:09:58,800
So there is something wrong with there and that is definitely something that should go in the report

154

00:09:58,810  -->  00:10:06,210
that we were expecting and from maybe industry standards benchmarks that tenure is a good indicator

155

00:10:06,210  -->  00:10:09,590
that you're going to stay off the bank but in this case it wasn't.

156

00:10:09,850  -->  00:10:15,450
So that's basically what we will decide about and we'll leave it in for now but we'll definitely include

157

00:10:15,450  -->  00:10:19,110
a comment or a footnote about this observation.

158

00:10:19,120  -->  00:10:24,330
So now we're going to bring this over in here and you can see there's nothing else to exclude because

159

00:10:24,660  -->  00:10:27,900
they're all above our thresholds.

160

00:10:28,170  -->  00:10:30,270
So I'm going to return tenure

161

00:10:30,270  -->  00:10:36,060
.

162

00:10:36,070  -->  00:10:37,820
There we go.

163

00:10:37,840  -->  00:10:40,220
So this is our model.

164

00:10:40,890  -->  00:10:45,830
And if you think that this is the final model then it's actually not.

165

00:10:45,850  -->  00:10:49,290
It's way too early to celebrate.

166

00:10:49,290  -->  00:10:54,670
We still have some extra steps and I will show you some really cool tips and tricks starting from next

167

00:10:54,670  -->  00:10:55,670
to total.

168

00:10:55,950  -->  00:11:01,500
Next time we will talk about transforming independent variables should the variables be included in

169

00:11:01,500  -->  00:11:06,230
their original form or should we actually do something with them before including in the model.

170

00:11:06,290  -->  00:11:09,280
It's going to be a fun tutorial and I look forward to seeing you then.

171

00:11:09,270  -->  00:11:10,890
Until next time happy be analyzing
