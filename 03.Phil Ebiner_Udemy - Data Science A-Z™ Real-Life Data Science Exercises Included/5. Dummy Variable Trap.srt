00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:06,500
Dummy variable trap last time we learn how to create dummy variables to replace our categorical predictors

2

00:00:06,500  -->  00:00:08,440
state in the model.

3

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:12,530
We also discuss that you can never include both dummy variables at the same time.

4

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:15,700
In our example we are made in the California dummy.

5

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:17,210
Now why is that.

6

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:21,770
What will happen if we include the second dummy variable in the model as well.

7

00:00:22,110  -->  00:00:26,830
Let's see the intuition here is that you're basically duplicating a variable.

8

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:35,670
This is because D-2 always equals to one minus D1 the phenomenon where one or several independent variables

9

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:41,310
in a linear regression predicts another is called multicollinearity as a result of this effect the model

10

00:00:41,310  -->  00:00:46,130
cannot distinguish between the effects of Diwan from the effects of D-2.

11

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:48,750
And therefore it won't work properly.

12

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:51,450
And this is called the dummy variable trap.

13

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:57,480
If you do the math behind the scenario you will see that the real problem is that you cannot have these

14

00:00:57,480  -->  00:01:02,890
three elements in your model at the same time the constant and both the dummy variables.

15

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:07,130
I will leave it up to you to figure this one out on your own and let me know if you have any trouble

16

00:01:07,140  -->  00:01:08,700
I'll definitely help here.

17

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:15,840
So to sum up whenever you're building a model always image to one dummy variable and this applies irrespective

18

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:20,310
of the number of dummy variables they are in that specific dummy set.

19

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:23,940
If you have nine then you should only include 8 if you have 100.

20

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:26,260
Then you should only include 99 of them.

21

00:01:26,460  -->  00:01:31,170
Also note that if you have two sets of dummy variables then you need to apply the same rule to each

22

00:01:31,170  -->  00:01:32,100
set.

23

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:37,470
For instance we could have had a column which specifies the industry in which the companies operate

24

00:01:38,100  -->  00:01:38,850
to build the model.

25

00:01:38,850  -->  00:01:44,100
In that case we would have had to perform exactly the same steps and create another set of dummy variables

26

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:46,010
specifically for that call.

27

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:51,750
And then we would include all but one of those dummy variables in our actual model.

28

00:01:51,750  -->  00:01:56,310
I hope this explanation was useful and you will never fall victim of the dummy variable trapping your

29

00:01:56,310  -->  00:01:57,240
modeling.

30

00:01:57,240  -->  00:02:00,690
Next time we're going to cover the different ways you can build a model.

31

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:06,370
We will learn all about backward elimination of forward selection stepwise regression and much more

32

00:02:06,380  -->  00:02:06,620
.

33

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:10,010
It's going to be an exciting tutorial and I look forward to seeing you then.
