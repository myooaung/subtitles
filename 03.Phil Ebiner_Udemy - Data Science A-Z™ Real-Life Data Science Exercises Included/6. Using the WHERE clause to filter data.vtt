00:00:01.140  -->  00:00:04.020
This tutorial we will talk about the where clause.

2

00:00:04.020  -->  00:00:09.450
Here you can see in front of you a select from statement which is selecting everything all the columns

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:11.900
from the order breakdown table.

4

00:00:12.090  -->  00:00:14.290
And here at the bottom you can see the result.

5

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:18.430
There is a total of eight thousand and forty seven rows in this table.

6

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:22.650
Now let's say we want to select a subset of these rows.

7

00:00:22.650  -->  00:00:28.650
We don't want everything we only want the rows that have furniture in the category column what are we

8

00:00:28.650  -->  00:00:32.690
going to do is we going to add a WHERE clause to the select statement.

9

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:40.600
All we have to do is type in where and here we're going to specify a column named category.

10

00:00:40.620  -->  00:00:45.780
I recommend putting square brackets around your column names because if your column name happens to

11

00:00:45.780  -->  00:00:54.210
have the same name as a keyword or a reserved word in SU then you won't be able to use it because square

12

00:00:54.210  -->  00:00:59.580
brackets will give you an example if you type in state the word state then you can see this highlighting

13

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:00.330
in blue.

14

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:05.700
So if your column is called State then the only way to use it is actually put square brackets around

15

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:06.710
it.

16

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:13.230
So here we've got where category and we want to specify the kind of rules so we will use a simple equal

17

00:01:13.230  -->  00:01:20.170
sign here and then we will specify the kind of you we're interested in which is furniture.

18

00:01:20.820  -->  00:01:27.310
And notice how I put the single quotation marks around the word furniture because all strings and ask

19

00:01:27.320  -->  00:01:30.630
you will need to have single quotations around them.

20

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:33.080
That's how you specify strings in this school.

21

00:01:33.090  -->  00:01:40.620
So now for on this query you will see that only the rows where categories furniture have been selected

22

00:01:40.630  -->  00:01:40.840
.

23

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:46.420
And there's a total of one thousand two hundred and thirty eight of these rows.

24

00:01:46.530  -->  00:01:48.530
That's a basic use case for the where clause.

25

00:01:48.690  -->  00:01:54.840
But now let's see what happens if we want to add on more conditions that for instance here we can see

26

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:58.150
that there's lots of different types of sales.

27

00:01:58.170  -->  00:02:02.910
Let's say that we want only the cells that were over $100.

28

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:09.540
So naturally you would type in and and is your logical operator which you can use with where just like

29

00:02:09.560  -->  00:02:10.200
or.

30

00:02:10.560  -->  00:02:19.350
So in this case and sales as put square brackets around it I will show you a method that won't work

31

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:20.230
in this scenario.

32

00:02:20.430  -->  00:02:23.260
And I'll explain why so and sales is over 100.

33

00:02:23.280  -->  00:02:24.840
That is what you would normally do.

34

00:02:25.050  -->  00:02:29.220
But in this case if you execute you will see that this brings an error.

35

00:02:29.430  -->  00:02:35.900
And the reason for that is because the way we uploaded all of this data is where uploaded as text.

36

00:02:35.910  -->  00:02:40.770
So all our data is currently as is recognized or is stored as a string.

37

00:02:40.770  -->  00:02:42.180
So sales.

38

00:02:42.330  -->  00:02:46.920
Now if we go back if we highlight this we can actually highlight elements that we want to execute.

39

00:02:46.920  -->  00:02:51.690
So if you highlight that and execute it we'll ignore this last bit will only execute the highlighted

40

00:02:51.690  -->  00:02:52.490
part.

41

00:02:52.590  -->  00:02:57.100
So if we execute this part then you'll see that even though it looks like a number.

42

00:02:57.240  -->  00:03:04.710
In reality it's been stored as a text and therefore the skill count can compare your sales to a number

43

00:03:04.730  -->  00:03:04.890
.

44

00:03:05.040  -->  00:03:09.000
So there is a solution to that which is a temporary solution for us.

45

00:03:09.000  -->  00:03:17.670
Are we going to convert sales into a number in this in this select statement while it's running and

46

00:03:17.670  -->  00:03:19.250
I'll show you how to do that.

47

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:28.960
So before sales just type and convert and then your target type for us will be float which is a skill

48

00:03:28.990  -->  00:03:37.680
at a data type with decimal points and then just close the brackets off sales and click execute now

49

00:03:37.690  -->  00:03:37.900
.

50

00:03:38.100  -->  00:03:44.400
So now you can see that there's even less rose only 1022 rose and that's because we are only seeing

51

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:47.450
rows where the sales are over 100.

52

00:03:47.610  -->  00:03:50.710
Once again this is a quick solution.

53

00:03:50.940  -->  00:03:55.250
In reality your doors should be stored properly so it should be.

54

00:03:55.250  -->  00:03:59.200
Sales should be obviously already in the float type.

55

00:03:59.310  -->  00:04:00.840
But we haven't gotten to that yet.

56

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:07.080
We will talk about converting daughter further down in this section of the course.

57

00:04:07.230  -->  00:04:12.970
So that's how you use a WHERE clause with the and logical operators so let's do one more now.

58

00:04:12.990  -->  00:04:17.840
What if we want to add an OR operator and just will follow for any reason.

59

00:04:18.060  -->  00:04:27.390
Let's say we want all of the rows that are in the technology category and we don't really mind what

60

00:04:27.990  -->  00:04:29.220
level of sales they have.

61

00:04:29.220  -->  00:04:32.480
So in that case these two will work together.

62

00:04:32.580  -->  00:04:38.090
Category furniture over 100 or it has to be in technology.

63

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:44.520
So that way we what we're going to do is we're going to put brackets around these like that and you

64

00:04:44.520  -->  00:04:49.950
can see scale highlights of breakfast food to make it visually easy to understand what's going on.

65

00:04:50.160  -->  00:04:53.820
And here we will add another clause or category

66

00:04:57.780  -->  00:05:03.040
is in this case it's technology.

67

00:05:04.920  -->  00:05:11.940
So now you're on that you will see that everything from furniture which is above $100 has been selected

68

00:05:12.450  -->  00:05:20.430
and plus everything from technology regardless of the sales as we like to you can see here $88 $86.

69

00:05:20.460  -->  00:05:27.990
So visually it might be better if you structure it this way and you are free to do this as well because

70

00:05:29.590  -->  00:05:36.870
as Phil doesn't doesn't mind how you structure your queries in terms of how they're written and where

71

00:05:36.870  -->  00:05:38.940
you put the spaces and tabs and so on.

72

00:05:38.940  -->  00:05:44.610
So basically you're checking either this clause should be correct or this clause and returning all the

73

00:05:44.610  -->  00:05:49.500
rows and that is how you use your where clause in a old
