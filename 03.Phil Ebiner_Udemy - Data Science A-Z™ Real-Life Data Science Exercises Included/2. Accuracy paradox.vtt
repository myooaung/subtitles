00:00:01.020  -->  00:00:07.200
Here I've got a confusion matrix and this confusion matrix has 10000 records in it and it represents

2

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:13.230
scenario number one which we'll be looking at as you can see this model has made 150 type 1 errors and

3

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:14.660
50 top 2 errors.

4

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:17.910
And but overall is predicted quite a lot correctly.

5

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:20.770
Now let's calculate the accuracy rate in this scenario.

6

00:00:21.040  -->  00:00:26.640
The accuracy rate is the total correct word but overall total and it's nine thousand eight hundred divided

7

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:28.640
by 10000 which is 98 percent.

8

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:34.740
Okay great but what are we going to do now is we going to tell the model to stop making predictions

9

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:34.760
.

10

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:37.730
What are we just going to abandon them all completely.

11

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:41.350
And we going to say that from now on our prediction is always zero.

12

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:45.100
We're always going to predict that the event is not going to occur.

13

00:00:45.300  -->  00:00:49.980
So basically what will happen to the confusion matrix is these records will move from the right call

14

00:00:49.980  -->  00:00:54.030
them to the left column and our new confusion matrix will look like this.

15

00:00:54.060  -->  00:01:00.870
Nine thousand eight hundred fifty 150 and then nothing in the predicted column where we predicted that

16

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:02.170
something will occur.

17

00:01:02.550  -->  00:01:04.700
And of course that moves against all logic right.

18

00:01:04.710  -->  00:01:09.590
Why would you abandon a model but let's calculate the accuracy rate in this scenario.

19

00:01:09.780  -->  00:01:14.290
So in order to accuracy rate has the same formula in this case accuracy rate is nine thousand eight

20

00:01:14.290  -->  00:01:17.070
hundred fifty divided by 10000.

21

00:01:17.130  -->  00:01:22.800
So it's ninety eight and a half percent the accuracy rate went up by half a percent.

22

00:01:23.250  -->  00:01:29.190
And as you can see what we did is we just completely stopped using a model but the accuracy rate went

23

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:29.740
up.

24

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:38.430
And that is why you should not base your judgment just on accuracy right because things like this can

25

00:01:38.430  -->  00:01:45.990
happen and even though obviously you're not using a model anymore which means that you're not applying

26

00:01:45.990  -->  00:01:52.680
any kind of logic into your decision making process your accuracy rate is going up so it's misleading

27

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:59.580
you into a wrong conclusion that you should stop using models and this effect is called the accuracy

28

00:01:59.580  -->  00:02:00.350
paradox.

29

00:02:00.510  -->  00:02:05.880
And starting from the next tutorial I will show you a much better way to assess your models using the

30

00:02:05.880  -->  00:02:09.470
cumulative accuracy profile of forcing you then.

31

00:02:09.480  -->  00:02:11.610
Until next time happy analyzing
