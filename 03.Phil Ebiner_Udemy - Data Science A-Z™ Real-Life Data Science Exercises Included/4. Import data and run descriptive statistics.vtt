00:00:01.190  -->  00:00:07.650
All right so let's launch Grettel and import Aldara to launch Grinnel DoubleClick that I can.

2

00:00:07.690  -->  00:00:13.440
And here now go to File Open data user file.

3

00:00:13.560  -->  00:00:18.260
And here we're going to need to locate where we are storing a data set.

4

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:23.100
So mine's on my desktop in my modeling section simple linear regression.

5

00:00:23.230  -->  00:00:30.350
And here just at the bottom in the dropdown select all files you can so it's history but I usually search

6

00:00:30.420  -->  00:00:32.220
all files and there it is.

7

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:38.130
That's all files so let's double click that and open it up and right away we've got a message here saying

8

00:00:38.130  -->  00:00:43.780
that they imported Dora have been interpreted as data to cross sectional.

9

00:00:43.950  -->  00:00:47.950
Do you want to give the data a time series of panel interpretation so here just click.

10

00:00:47.950  -->  00:00:51.230
No we don't want to Times-News or panel interpretation.

11

00:00:51.350  -->  00:00:54.900
Q You got some stats on what data was imported.

12

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:56.570
So that's normal.

13

00:00:56.580  -->  00:01:02.110
And here you have your Basically your variables and the constant.

14

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:09.030
So what we can do here let's start getting used to Grettel and you'll get more and more familiar with

15

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:10.680
the interface as we go along.

16

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:17.780
It's very simple after a few of these materials you'll be swimming here very very easily.

17

00:01:17.990  -->  00:01:18.460
OK.

18

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:23.930
So what are you going to do is we going to go to you.

19

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:27.960
And here we want to look at some statistics of our data.

20

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:34.240
So if you go you summary statistics here you can select the variables that you want to view So let's

21

00:01:34.250  -->  00:01:41.010
start with one for instance say years experience who want to see what the population we're looking at

22

00:01:41.010  -->  00:01:45.790
here or what's what sample we look at here and here you can see the mean.

23

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:55.440
So on average is five point three years experience the median the minimum one point one maximum 10 and

24

00:01:55.440  -->  00:01:56.610
a half.

25

00:01:56.610  -->  00:02:03.570
Standard deviation stuff like that and you've got the percentiles of your years experience and no missing

26

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:06.020
observations so that's quite useful.

27

00:02:06.030  -->  00:02:11.430
Now think we can do is we can do the same but with both variables so summerise sticks and we could just

28

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:17.070
put both variables in here so you can see is like a drag and drop interface or more just probably a

29

00:02:17.070  -->  00:02:25.470
very handy visual interface not really drag and drop but you can take things out so you can like put

30

00:02:25.470  -->  00:02:29.360
things in are very intuitive I guess.

31

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:31.040
So here you click ok now.

32

00:02:31.380  -->  00:02:36.450
And they go so now you have your statistics for both variables.

33

00:02:36.450  -->  00:02:43.190
So you've got a means your median minimum is maximums percentiles and deviation the rest of them we

34

00:02:43.190  -->  00:02:46.380
won't be that interested in.

35

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:51.070
So that's basically the most basic thing you can do probably in Grettel.

36

00:02:51.090  -->  00:02:57.240
You can also like right click your variable here and say display values and will show you the exact

37

00:02:57.240  -->  00:03:02.130
values that were imported If you want to look at them what else you can.

38

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:08.370
For instance edit values if you want that will allow you to actually manipulate your values which I

39

00:03:08.370  -->  00:03:12.720
don't recommend doing but if you need to adjust something you can do it right in here you don't have

40

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:17.100
to go back to the CAC file.

41

00:03:17.400  -->  00:03:24.070
Then what else you can edit attributes so you can change the name of the variable.

42

00:03:24.060  -->  00:03:25.810
You can add some description so on.

43

00:03:25.980  -->  00:03:32.550
And by the way like we'll see later on if you make changes to data that can really be stored and see

44

00:03:32.550  -->  00:03:39.060
as we file descriptions and other things like that then you can always when you save your data you have

45

00:03:39.060  -->  00:03:41.430
an option to save it as a griddle daughter file.

46

00:03:41.530  -->  00:03:47.340
And that way Grettel will actually store all these modifications you're making and they won't be lost

47

00:03:47.340  -->  00:03:52.520
so Grendal does have its own type of files it creates.

48

00:03:52.520  -->  00:03:57.690
So that's basically the most simplest thing you can do in Grettel if you like play around you know click

49

00:03:57.690  -->  00:04:04.230
around here what else you can find there's lots of stuff even if you break the data you just modify

50

00:04:04.230  -->  00:04:06.120
it or something doesn't really matter.

51

00:04:06.120  -->  00:04:11.520
This first section we're just getting to know Grinnel just do a simple linear regression and next tutorial

52

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:19.530
so nothing bad can happen even if you play around with it just as long as you're comfortable if this

53

00:04:19.530  -->  00:04:24.750
interface and we'll get straight into it in the next Tauriel and all approach and then
