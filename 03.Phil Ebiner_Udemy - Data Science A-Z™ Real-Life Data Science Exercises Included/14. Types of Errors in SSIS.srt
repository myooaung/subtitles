00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:06,750
Let's have a look at some of the errors that could happen in essence has we've already experienced these

2

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:08,310
three truncation.

3

00:00:08,310  -->  00:00:13,110
That is when your record in a cell is too long.

4

00:00:13,410  -->  00:00:19,100
The number of characters is greater than the number of characters that you're allocating for that column

5

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:25,950
in your database in your table and therefore that specific cell gets truncated you get an error.

6

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:27,690
We know how to deal with that.

7

00:00:27,960  -->  00:00:30,030
Next the bad input file format.

8

00:00:30,060  -->  00:00:38,520
An example of bad input file format is when remember when we did not specify the quotation marks and

9

00:00:38,760  -->  00:00:40,820
went on to upload the data.

10

00:00:40,830  -->  00:00:46,890
There would have been a right but in our case we had commas within the columns and therefore they were

11

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:47,930
unqualified.

12

00:00:48,210  -->  00:00:52,920
And that meant that everything got skewed either left or right and so on.

13

00:00:52,920  -->  00:01:00,750
So that's an example of bad input file format you need to make sure that you specify the text qualifiers

14

00:01:00,760  -->  00:01:01,000
.

15

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:10,560
Another example is when you have two columns with the same name you cannot import data when there are

16

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:12,370
two columns of the same name.

17

00:01:12,390  -->  00:01:18,790
You will get an error at the stage of the flat file source.

18

00:01:18,790  -->  00:01:20,250
Manager.

19

00:01:20,250  -->  00:01:24,960
So make sure your daughter doesn't have two calls with the same name and code page mismatch.

20

00:01:24,970  -->  00:01:26,490
She saw me get that error.

21

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:32,370
That's because I have two languages installed on my computer and you also now know how to deal with

22

00:01:33,120  -->  00:01:34,530
that error when it comes up.

23

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:43,650
Just make sure that after the upload you don't have any weird symbols in your final table you need to

24

00:01:43,650  -->  00:01:50,310
make sure that the data is uploaded correctly in the correct code page so that way you will get the

25

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:54,660
right you'll be able to see the right text in the final table.

26

00:01:55,020  -->  00:02:02,640
And here another three errors that you could potentially get out of memory or database logfile too big

27

00:02:02,650  -->  00:02:02,750
.

28

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:09,210
When skill stops inserting data and connection fails so those are normal errors that are associated

29

00:02:09,210  -->  00:02:15,980
with technology and capacity of your S-sh Siskiyou else servers and so on.

30

00:02:16,020  -->  00:02:20,640
So potentially you could get those errors and you would have to deal with them on the case.

31

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:22,180
Case by case basis.

32

00:02:22,380  -->  00:02:26,620
And now here's a list of errors that you won't get.

33

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:33,360
If you use this blueprint some metadata changes data type mismatch primary key unique index violations

34

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:37,660
permission issues configuration file missing and deadlocks.

35

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:44,130
If you use the blueprint that I have provided you you will not get these errors in as it has.

36

00:02:44,280  -->  00:02:44,650
Why.

37

00:02:44,670  -->  00:02:52,110
Well simply because the way we're doing things we're uploading daughter as a text format so we're not

38

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:58,710
converting data into different formats insofar as we're going to be doing that in as well and we'll

39

00:02:58,710  -->  00:03:01,770
talk more about that in the summary of this section.

40

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:05,780
And we're not using any complex transformations.

41

00:03:05,820  -->  00:03:11,550
The only transformations that we're using are conditional splits and simply the way this whole blueprint

42

00:03:11,550  -->  00:03:19,230
is structured is to minimize the amount of work that is done in Sosias we're transferring all of the

43

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:27,270
hard core calculations and conversions and D'Attoma manipulations into his kill because you have more

44

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:28,160
control over it.

45

00:03:28,170  -->  00:03:34,170
In my view you have more control over it in Eskew all that is and a great advantage of this blueprint

46

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:36,930
that we studied in this section of the course.

47

00:03:37,230  -->  00:03:45,160
You can only experience six out of the 12 Sosias errors listed here and maybe perhaps these these are

48

00:03:45,160  -->  00:03:51,810
not all of the errors that can happen in our society but these are the more common or most popular errors

49

00:03:51,810  -->  00:03:55,380
that happen in this piece of software.

50

00:03:55,380  -->  00:03:59,880
My advice to you is stick to the blueprint you will save yourself lots of time.
