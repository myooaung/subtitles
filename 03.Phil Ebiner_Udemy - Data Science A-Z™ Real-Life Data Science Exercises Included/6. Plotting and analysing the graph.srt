1

00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:03,620
All right so now what we're going to do is look at the graphs.

2

00:00:03,960  -->  00:00:09,030
The first way you can bring up the chart of the linear regression model is you go to graphs and you

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:13,680
go to fitted actual Plaut and then just go actual versus fitted.

4

00:00:13,680  -->  00:00:19,690
And here you've got your observations which are in red and the model the fitted model in blue.

5

00:00:19,770  -->  00:00:23,550
Before we continue I'm going to bring up the other chart or show you the other way you can bring up

6

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:24,170
the chart.

7

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:29,680
So if you cancel that and you go to analysis and then you get to four costs and then don't fall for

8

00:00:29,690  -->  00:00:32,350
costing anything you just click OK.

9

00:00:33,220  -->  00:00:39,330
Then hear what you'll see is two things came up so the chart which will look at and the second and also

10

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:40,950
the forecasts.

11

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:46,870
So basically what happened here is Grettel took your existing record.

12

00:00:46,870  -->  00:00:53,180
So here you got through your records and it's didn't print any information on the independent variable

13

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:57,370
so years of experience is not here as you can see but it does have salary.

14

00:00:57,370  -->  00:01:04,080
So the actual salary that was in your file and then has got the predicted salary so the salary that

15

00:01:04,080  -->  00:01:10,560
the models predicting for that record and you can just visually compare them here see the standard errors

16

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:13,550
95 percent confidence intervals if you like.

17

00:01:13,710  -->  00:01:17,930
And also what this would have done if you in terms of prediction was it called prediction.

18

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:25,650
Well if you did have some records where there was an empty value for salary say 31 32 33 then it would

19

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:30,790
actually populate them for you it would create it would generate would still generate a prediction.

20

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:37,910
And that way you could for instance extrapolate what you have this line on to new salaries.

21

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:43,920
So you could see what the salary would be for people with four more years of experience than you have

22

00:01:43,920  -->  00:01:45,130
in your data set.

23

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:48,170
So we're going to close that and we're going to look at the graph now.

24

00:01:48,180  -->  00:01:54,420
So this graph is a bit more involved because it has a 95 percent confidence intervals here in green

25

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:55,500
.

26

00:01:55,530  -->  00:02:02,100
So in in short in a quick summary what happened here is originally we only had the red dots of Krause's

27

00:02:02,520  -->  00:02:07,190
meaning that that's how salary is dependent on years of experience.

28

00:02:07,190  -->  00:02:16,710
So basically if you take nine years of experience then you can using this blue line you can predict

29

00:02:16,710  -->  00:02:21,840
where the salary for nine years of experience will be and what the confidence interval is telling us

30

00:02:21,840  -->  00:02:30,360
is that there's a 95 percent chance that that salary will actually be somewhere between these two green

31

00:02:30,360  -->  00:02:33,720
lines on this vertical nine year line.

32

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:39,630
So basically doesn't have to be on the blue line and as you can see a lot of the actual valves are not

33

00:02:39,630  -->  00:02:42,220
on the blue line some are but mostly they're not.

34

00:02:42,300  -->  00:02:48,000
But we know that according to our data with a 95 percent chance it's going to be between these two green

35

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:48,700
lights.

36

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:55,710
And also what we can see here is that the blue line if it were to cross the vertical axis it crossed

37

00:02:55,710  -->  00:03:03,750
somewhere at that's a constant value that we looked at which is twenty nine thousand and something.

38

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:06,070
So here we have it.

39

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:08,480
It's actually twenty five thousand seven hundred ninety two.

40

00:03:08,640  -->  00:03:13,540
That's where the blue line would have crossed the vertical axis.

41

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:19,260
And as you can see well of course like there's not enough space here but because this access should

42

00:03:19,260  -->  00:03:23,910
be a bit more to the left there zero would be somewhere here so there would be enough room for it to

43

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:26,680
cross and years of experience.

44

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:32,070
That's the slope that's basically the angle at which this blue line is going if.

45

00:03:32,070  -->  00:03:33,700
Years of experience.

46

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:37,830
So basically the coefficient for years of experience.

47

00:03:37,830  -->  00:03:44,490
So if this value was more than 9000 $449 then the slope of the blue line would have been higher if it

48

00:03:44,490  -->  00:03:50,150
were lower the slope would have been lower so it wouldn't be as steep.

49

00:03:50,160  -->  00:03:56,790
So this is basically saying that whenever you move from say from three years to four years from here

50

00:03:56,790  -->  00:04:03,780
to here your salary increases by approximately nine and a half thousand dollars from here to here.

51

00:04:04,380  -->  00:04:08,250
So that's how this whole simple linear regression works.

52

00:04:08,280  -->  00:04:09,900
Hope it'll make sense.

53

00:04:09,930  -->  00:04:14,270
Play around with the data maybe run a few more of these just to get comfortable with it.

54

00:04:14,400  -->  00:04:19,470
And remember that we'll be working with this screen quite a lot going forward and I look forward to

55

00:04:19,470  -->  00:04:20,370
seeing you next time.

56

00:04:20,370  -->  00:04:21,900
Until then happy analyzing
