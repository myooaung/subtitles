00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:04.880
Slowly but surely we're getting to the end of this first part of the course on visualization.

2

00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:11.250
And in today's tutorial we will learn how to combine two charts and Tablo which will allow us to conduct

3

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:14.230
our data mining procedures much more efficiently.

4

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:18.540
But before we proceed I wanted to ask you for a quick favor if you're enjoying the course so far and

5

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:22.690
if you're learning quite a bit from these tutorials then would you mind leaving a review.

6

00:00:22.830  -->  00:00:25.530
It's very easy to do just on the course page up at the top.

7

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:29.820
There's a button here eight course and all you have to do is just click it and select the number of

8

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:31.860
stars you think the course deserves.

9

00:00:31.860  -->  00:00:34.700
Perhaps you could write a quick note if you'd like to comment on something.

10

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:40.380
But even just leaving the number of stars would mean a lot to me and I'm asking you now because a lot

11

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:46.590
of people don't get to the end of this course provided it is a 200 plus lecture course and more importantly

12

00:00:46.860  -->  00:00:52.350
it is a very valuable tool for students who are considering this course to see what you have to say

13

00:00:52.350  -->  00:00:54.370
about the course and see your rating.

14

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:59.010
And also if for any reason throughout the course you change your mind you can always come back here

15

00:00:59.040  -->  00:01:00.830
and change your rating.

16

00:01:00.840  -->  00:01:04.260
Hope you can do that and help me out with a review.

17

00:01:04.290  -->  00:01:08.150
And let's get straight back into the show.

18

00:01:08.740  -->  00:01:12.290
In the previous two tutorials we created two independent charts.

19

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:20.460
One is kind of like a test like an AB test or a classification test which tells us which age bands are

20

00:01:20.460  -->  00:01:26.100
more at high risk of living in a company based on the sample and observe period of time based on the

21

00:01:26.100  -->  00:01:27.960
test that was conducted basically.

22

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:32.750
And the other charge so we're told is the distribution of age overall.

23

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:37.240
So today we're going to learn how to combine these two charts into one.

24

00:01:37.290  -->  00:01:42.360
And so there we can draw insights from them at the same time and we're going to be combining them on

25

00:01:42.450  -->  00:01:48.700
this age chart so we're going to be adding the distribution to this age classification chart.

26

00:01:49.310  -->  00:01:52.620
And let's go ahead and do that in order to add a second chart.

27

00:01:52.620  -->  00:01:58.650
All you have to do is decide on what exactly you're you want to add to the chart.

28

00:01:58.650  -->  00:02:00.630
So we want to keep the beans right.

29

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:07.200
We want the columns to be the same because they're the same across both charts here and here they're

30

00:02:07.200  -->  00:02:08.260
exactly the same.

31

00:02:08.430  -->  00:02:15.150
And so all we want to add is a new type of role is in this case we have the percentage of total which

32

00:02:15.150  -->  00:02:23.490
is our table calculation here and now we want to add another type of row which is going to be just the

33

00:02:23.490  -->  00:02:25.190
number of a record.

34

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:31.020
So now I'm going to take number of records and drag it onto the rows pane over here. As you can see

35

00:02:31.020  -->  00:02:32.250
new char has appeared.

36

00:02:32.520  -->  00:02:38.820
And in order to make more space just drag find this delimiter between the charts and drag it up words

37

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:43.000
a little bit so that we have sufficient room that looks like it's good.

38

00:02:43.200  -->  00:02:43.520
OK.

39

00:02:43.530  -->  00:02:49.450
Before we do anything else I would like to point out a few things that have changed in our workbook

40

00:02:49.470  -->  00:02:51.230
or on this worksheet overall.

41

00:02:51.390  -->  00:02:54.630
So first thing we had now have rows in.

42

00:02:54.630  -->  00:02:57.260
We have a new measure in rows.

43

00:02:57.270  -->  00:03:03.000
Of course we have this new char but also if you look at this Marks area now it looks very different

44

00:03:03.000  -->  00:03:03.090
.

45

00:03:03.090  -->  00:03:07.600
Now we have all a tab which is also for all the charts.

46

00:03:07.710  -->  00:03:14.630
Then we have a tab for our first chart and we also have a tab for our second chart right.

47

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:19.450
So that is very interesting and gives you control if you want to control everything you can control

48

00:03:19.500  -->  00:03:20.070
here.

49

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:27.660
So for instance I could what can I do here I could change the colors right and there would change everywhere

50

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:31.550
so I could say stay to be green exited would be red.

51

00:03:31.620  -->  00:03:32.460
OK.

52

00:03:32.600  -->  00:03:33.960
It changed everything.

53

00:03:33.960  -->  00:03:42.060
Or I can go into one of them and let's say the new chart and I can remove exited if I don't want it

54

00:03:42.090  -->  00:03:42.180
.

55

00:03:42.240  -->  00:03:44.440
And as you can see doesn't affect the top chart.

56

00:03:44.610  -->  00:03:49.300
I can remove the label if I don't want it that doesn't affect the top chart again.

57

00:03:49.540  -->  00:03:52.800
Then it can go and change the color here which I'm going to do.

58

00:03:52.830  -->  00:04:02.250
I'm going to change it to just like we had previously to a type of brownish color and then I can add

59

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:02.870
something here.

60

00:04:02.870  -->  00:04:11.040
So as you remember we had a percentage Oh sorry a the color was dependent on the number of records so

61

00:04:11.040  -->  00:04:16.460
let's take number of records and hold control and dragged into the color.

62

00:04:16.830  -->  00:04:20.630
Once again I'm going to have to change the brown.

63

00:04:20.670  -->  00:04:22.600
There we go that's all brown.

64

00:04:22.650  -->  00:04:23.670
OK.

65

00:04:24.090  -->  00:04:29.050
Now what I wanted to do is I don't like this red actually so let's go back to now.

66

00:04:29.070  -->  00:04:34.080
This chart this top chart here so you can see how what it's like to work with several charts you can

67

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:35.400
have many more than that.

68

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:39.240
And here you can quickly go into colors and stayed.

69

00:04:39.240  -->  00:04:40.760
What did we have for state.

70

00:04:40.800  -->  00:04:44.530
It was blue that it was orange applied.

71

00:04:44.820  -->  00:04:46.470
That's what our chart looked like.

72

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:47.910
And that's looking good.

73

00:04:47.910  -->  00:04:48.440
Much better.

74

00:04:48.450  -->  00:04:52.180
But now we want to add a label to this chart over here.

75

00:04:52.650  -->  00:04:57.920
So let's add a label which is some number of records will take the same number records hold on control

76

00:04:57.950  -->  00:04:59.520
drag dragging on to label.

77

00:04:59.520  -->  00:05:00.080
There it is.

78

00:05:00.080  -->  00:05:01.720
That's our number of records.

79

00:05:02.100  -->  00:05:04.540
And what else do we want to do.

80

00:05:04.800  -->  00:05:10.740
Well from here what I would suggest doing is like this is kind of a bit separate To be honest I like

81

00:05:11.070  -->  00:05:13.440
when this chart is on top of the other one.

82

00:05:13.650  -->  00:05:15.470
So let's try an experiment with that one.

83

00:05:15.600  -->  00:05:20.630
Let's try and do that in order to switch their order.

84

00:05:20.640  -->  00:05:22.630
You just have to switch the order over here and row.

85

00:05:22.620  -->  00:05:26.850
So I would take the new chart and drag it before the old chart over here.

86

00:05:27.120  -->  00:05:33.930
As you can see they've switched their order and also the panes or the tabs in the marks pane have switched

87

00:05:33.930  -->  00:05:34.800
their order as well.

88

00:05:34.800  -->  00:05:36.670
Now this is the top chart.

89

00:05:36.690  -->  00:05:42.060
This is the bottom chart you can always tell by this triangle the triangle signifies a table calculation

90

00:05:42.060  -->  00:05:44.810
which we have over here.

91

00:05:44.880  -->  00:05:47.980
So there we go that's our two charts.

92

00:05:48.360  -->  00:05:49.850
And what can we see from here.

93

00:05:49.860  -->  00:05:56.160
Well we can see that as we knew before our customers the most that are represented by these two age

94

00:05:56.160  -->  00:06:00.470
groups so between 30 and 40 or 45 years old.

95

00:06:00.810  -->  00:06:07.320
And also in these two age group in these three age groups the probability of leaving is the lowest in

96

00:06:07.320  -->  00:06:11.010
the 30 to 35 it's high 35 but still below average.

97

00:06:11.070  -->  00:06:17.160
And then at 40 45 it goes above average then the probability of living increases for these age groups

98

00:06:17.160  -->  00:06:17.180
.

99

00:06:17.190  -->  00:06:20.900
But the number of customers in these age groups reduces.

100

00:06:21.030  -->  00:06:26.430
And then what we're talking about these anomalies over here as we suspected there is a very low number

101

00:06:26.430  -->  00:06:33.300
of customers overall in this in these bands in these age bands and therefore these anomalies may not

102

00:06:33.300  -->  00:06:37.900
be statistically significant probably aren't just like this one over here.

103

00:06:37.980  -->  00:06:41.780
So customers between 15 and 20 years old.

104

00:06:42.840  -->  00:06:47.060
And that gives us some quick insights or additional insights into the chart.

105

00:06:47.060  -->  00:06:51.810
This is how you can very quickly and efficiently analyze two charts.

106

00:06:51.810  -->  00:07:00.030
But the main focus I guess of this trial was to get comfortable working to have two charts on one worksheet

107

00:07:00.090  -->  00:07:05.850
like this because you know which one you put at the top which you put at the bottom what college you

108

00:07:05.850  -->  00:07:06.140
said.

109

00:07:06.150  -->  00:07:12.000
But most poorly of course how to work these separately so remember that that you can control the charts

110

00:07:12.120  -->  00:07:15.660
together or separately and here you can see that the colors are grayed out.

111

00:07:15.660  -->  00:07:23.100
The labels are great out there because that tells us that each of these charts has their own color palette

112

00:07:23.190  -->  00:07:28.820
and their own labels that have been applied to them and then you can go into these separately.

113

00:07:28.890  -->  00:07:30.540
So have a play around with that.

114

00:07:30.540  -->  00:07:36.480
Have a look at what you can do can change around because after all even if you break something you can

115

00:07:36.480  -->  00:07:37.900
just quickly recreate the chart.

116

00:07:38.040  -->  00:07:44.070
No problem at all just try to get as comfortable as you can with this new feature of Tablo that we've

117

00:07:44.070  -->  00:07:45.130
just discussed.

118

00:07:45.270  -->  00:07:48.000
And in the next tutorial we'll discuss something very interesting.

119

00:07:48.000  -->  00:07:50.340
I will show you how to.

120

00:07:50.610  -->  00:07:56.490
Well I'll give you some ideas about how to assess the statistical significance so we keep talking about

121

00:07:56.490  -->  00:07:56.740
.

122

00:07:56.970  -->  00:08:02.930
And there'll be quite an interesting tutorial a bit more statistical but also quite important.

123

00:08:03.030  -->  00:08:09.630
It will give us that additional leverage in terms of what the analysis that we can extract from these

124

00:08:09.630  -->  00:08:10.530
shots.

125

00:08:10.530  -->  00:08:13.790
Hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I hope you're enjoying the course overall.

126

00:08:13.890  -->  00:08:16.600
If you are please do not hesitate to review.

127

00:08:16.620  -->  00:08:21.520
It would mean a lot to me if you just click the number of stars you think the court deserves.

128

00:08:21.540  -->  00:08:27.270
You can do it in the top or right part of your screen on the page and it takes literally 10 seconds

129

00:08:27.270  -->  00:08:27.450
.

130

00:08:27.540  -->  00:08:29.690
And I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

131

00:08:29.700  -->  00:08:31.160
Until then I'll be analyzing
