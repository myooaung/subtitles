00:00:00.740  -->  00:00:05.160
In the previous few tutorials we learned how to deal with errors that can occur while applauding a daughter

2

00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:09.700
from a raw table into your working table.

3

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:16.290
And we use these Gnumeric these they tend to lend functions to achieve the desired results in the next

4

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:17.310
few tutorials.

5

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:22.170
I'm going to show you how to perform additional Q8 checks on your door.

6

00:00:22.530  -->  00:00:24.890
So let's get ahead and jump straight into it.

7

00:00:24.900  -->  00:00:30.900
We're going to copy this comment header at the top and we're going to replicate it under the insert

8

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:36.800
into part and this time we're going to call it additional exclusions.

9

00:00:36.880  -->  00:00:39.880
Next we're going to look at the balance code.

10

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:46.290
So sometimes you and your daughter said you might have additional knowledge about it and you might know

11

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:49.070
that for instance the balance cannot be less than zero.

12

00:00:49.070  -->  00:00:54.240
So let's go ahead and check if there are any columns in our daughter where the balance is less than

13

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:54.980
zero.

14

00:00:54.990  -->  00:01:01.350
This time we're going to select star from and not the raw table but the working title because it's been

15

00:01:01.350  -->  00:01:03.320
popular and we can work it now.

16

00:01:03.780  -->  00:01:06.000
So again so I start from the working table.

17

00:01:06.030  -->  00:01:13.020
And here we're going to type in where baluns or actually to be fair I should copy this balance because

18

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:18.900
this is now the name of the column where the balance is less than zero.

19

00:01:18.900  -->  00:01:21.250
And so let's go ahead and run just as bit.

20

00:01:21.930  -->  00:01:25.630
So here you can see that there's one row where balance is less than zero.

21

00:01:25.860  -->  00:01:30.270
And once again it might be OK for your daughter to have negative balances and that's fine.

22

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:35.430
But in this case Number one I happen to know that the balance cannot be less than zero.

23

00:01:35.430  -->  00:01:36.660
I have that domain knowledge.

24

00:01:36.660  -->  00:01:43.710
This is just an example so you might have different domain knowledge about a specific numerical column

25

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:45.710
in your daughter and you might want to check that.

26

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:49.500
Maybe it can be greater than zero or it cannot be.

27

00:01:49.590  -->  00:01:57.090
It has to be between 10 and 100 so you might have to check that's some specific quality of your daughter

28

00:01:57.100  -->  00:01:57.320
.

29

00:01:57.540  -->  00:02:06.090
And number two is that it gives you kind of kind of a hint when one out of thousand rows matches a criteria

30

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:06.260
.

31

00:02:06.270  -->  00:02:07.960
Usually that's an anomaly.

32

00:02:07.980  -->  00:02:16.530
So if if negative balances were OK then probably I would have a bit more rows that had negative balances

33

00:02:16.560  -->  00:02:23.020
but one out of 200000 does not sound right when you think about it that way.

34

00:02:23.190  -->  00:02:24.680
So we're going to school this.

35

00:02:24.690  -->  00:02:33.930
But before you do if you want to investigate it further in this case we're not going to go into the

36

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:38.750
depths of investigating further and creating a file to store store the Sarah.

37

00:02:38.760  -->  00:02:43.890
But if you do want to investigate further then you obviously need to copy Destro the easiest way is

38

00:02:43.890  -->  00:02:50.760
to just copied from here and put it copy of headers obvious and then put it into a text file in that

39

00:02:50.760  -->  00:02:55.560
folder where we're saving all the rows that we want to investigate.

40

00:02:55.560  -->  00:02:57.530
Or you can copy it into a separate table.

41

00:02:57.750  -->  00:03:05.310
But at this stage we're not going to focus on that because it's quite simple to do this which is going

42

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:07.050
to exclude it as is.

43

00:03:07.110  -->  00:03:13.530
And then in the conclusion of the section I will actually show you that this information is not lost

44

00:03:13.530  -->  00:03:19.270
that we don't know if we ever need to we will know how to find this row one more time.

45

00:03:19.350  -->  00:03:25.860
So we're going to delete this row now and to do that you need to select the select star part of your

46

00:03:25.860  -->  00:03:33.150
query replace it with simply delete without a star and then you highlight this bit that you want to

47

00:03:33.150  -->  00:03:37.050
run and you execute it and you can see that one row has been affected.

48

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:43.770
So let's copy that and put a comment and paste that in so we know in the future that it was exactly

49

00:03:43.770  -->  00:03:45.300
one row that we deleted.

50

00:03:45.660  -->  00:03:50.580
So that's how you run additional exclusions in the next digit or else I'll show you a few more examples

51

00:03:50.590  -->  00:03:51.080
.
