00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:06.140
Welcome to the homework challenge for this part of the course on daughter Prep.

2

00:00:06.270  -->  00:00:06.950
And that's right.

3

00:00:06.960  -->  00:00:13.110
It's not homework just for this section it's homework for the whole part of the course which will require

4

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:18.620
you to apply a lot of the skills that you learned in this whole part.

5

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:21.260
OK so let me show you where to find the homework.

6

00:00:21.300  -->  00:00:27.800
If you go to superdog Assad's dot com slash training and you scroll down and you go to part three to

7

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:36.720
prep over here you will find Section 7 homework challenge vehicle service dock and homework data set

8

00:00:36.780  -->  00:00:38.470
me a culture izip.

9

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:46.020
So these two files they are quite large so the doc file is normal is quite small but the vehicle service

10

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:47.700
file is actually huge.

11

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:51.010
It's twenty three megabytes.

12

00:00:51.210  -->  00:00:58.170
And when you unzip it it's even bigger it's a serious view which is sixty point seven megabytes so massive

13

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:00.150
data set for you this time.

14

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:08.650
And while you're downloading that let me explain what the background is for this whole project.

15

00:01:08.670  -->  00:01:17.460
So you're doing some analysis for a company which services vehicles in a lot of locations it's a huge

16

00:01:17.460  -->  00:01:25.590
company with millions of customers and it does a service for them across lots of different countries

17

00:01:25.600  -->  00:01:25.760
.

18

00:01:26.020  -->  00:01:31.690
And what they're doing this time is they do some forecasts for 2016.

19

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:34.730
So I'm going to open up the file but I'm not going to walk you through it.

20

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:37.290
I'm just going to open up so that we can see the headers.

21

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:39.820
So we know what's in the data.

22

00:01:39.870  -->  00:01:44.700
So here you have customer I.D. the idea of the customer.

23

00:01:44.890  -->  00:01:45.590
How long.

24

00:01:45.590  -->  00:01:53.820
When he became a customer since when he's a customer since what year what vehicle he services he or

25

00:01:53.820  -->  00:02:03.040
she services what the revenue was for 2014 for that customer or for the company from that customer.

26

00:02:03.240  -->  00:02:11.670
What the revenue was for 2015 and what they expected the projected revenue for 2016 is or what it will

27

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:12.720
be in 2016.

28

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:17.570
So they basically use two years to create a model and extrapolate on to 2016.

29

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:21.890
So you could upload all this data and I won't say anything more.

30

00:02:22.470  -->  00:02:26.990
It's up to you to look through that file and understand everything that's going on in there.

31

00:02:27.060  -->  00:02:32.040
So it's up to you to upload the data on and you have this file of the challenge with some additional

32

00:02:32.040  -->  00:02:32.590
information.

33

00:02:32.590  -->  00:02:37.510
So let's open that up and we can talk about this in a bit more detail.

34

00:02:37.650  -->  00:02:45.960
So the vehicle service challenge what do we know the customer ideal the customer ID field does not contain

35

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:53.370
duplicate records which that's that's information given to you by the person who supplied this data

36

00:02:53.370  -->  00:02:53.420
.

37

00:02:53.430  -->  00:03:00.900
They're saying that the data set is structured in a way that we don't keep a custom duplicate customer

38

00:03:00.900  -->  00:03:04.190
ID fields or roles.

39

00:03:04.200  -->  00:03:05.940
There is no duplicates in this field.

40

00:03:05.940  -->  00:03:12.030
It's a guarantee from them and that's just like that's intrinsic knowledge.

41

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:18.480
That's an example of some domain or intrinsic knowledge that you might have about the business as you

42

00:03:18.480  -->  00:03:25.790
know the exact structure of his dataset so you can you can assume that you know this or that's that's

43

00:03:25.950  -->  00:03:27.150
how it's supposed to be.

44

00:03:27.150  -->  00:03:28.680
That's a hint there for you.

45

00:03:28.680  -->  00:03:31.340
That's how it's supposed to be.

46

00:03:31.770  -->  00:03:37.100
And you know obviously that's something you've got to you've got to look into it anyway.

47

00:03:37.590  -->  00:03:40.950
So there are five errors in this data.

48

00:03:40.950  -->  00:03:41.560
Find them.

49

00:03:41.580  -->  00:03:50.030
So I pro-Shia hectic data set it is going to be hectic in the sense that there's only five errors.

50

00:03:50.250  -->  00:03:55.070
It's so it's not like one of the ones we saw Preuss where there's heaps and heaps of errors and you're

51

00:03:55.230  -->  00:04:00.320
just you just finding like tons all the time here is only five.

52

00:04:00.340  -->  00:04:02.230
And you you'd be you know in advance.

53

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:03.100
There's only five.

54

00:04:03.210  -->  00:04:04.120
You've got to find them.

55

00:04:04.140  -->  00:04:07.830
And it's it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

56

00:04:07.830  -->  00:04:09.630
That's that's all it's going to be hectic.

57

00:04:09.630  -->  00:04:15.710
That's why there's going to you guys have to be very alert and creative to find these errors.

58

00:04:16.050  -->  00:04:20.940
Then once you find them you have to suggest explanations how each of the errors could have occurred

59

00:04:21.000  -->  00:04:28.560
and what you think the best way to fix each one of them is so that you don't only need to just locate

60

00:04:28.560  -->  00:04:29.630
the errors and send them back.

61

00:04:29.640  -->  00:04:35.400
You actually have to based on what we've discussed in the course you have to think of ways how could

62

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:40.190
those errors come to be what you know what happened that caused that error.

63

00:04:40.200  -->  00:04:45.240
So that's that's good practice of the knowledge that you've developed.

64

00:04:45.240  -->  00:04:52.530
And also it's a good good way to understand data and understand what the things that can happen to data

65

00:04:52.540  -->  00:04:52.830
.

66

00:04:53.130  -->  00:04:55.600
And finally and this is important part.

67

00:04:55.620  -->  00:05:00.530
You know that the total projected revenue for 2016 equals this value.

68

00:05:00.540  -->  00:05:05.760
So this is an example of when you're actually supplied a quality assurance check that you have to conduct

69

00:05:05.760  -->  00:05:06.090
.

70

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:08.810
You need the uploader daughter to match this value.

71

00:05:08.970  -->  00:05:11.470
And this means that every role is important.

72

00:05:11.640  -->  00:05:13.830
So a bit more on that.

73

00:05:14.130  -->  00:05:20.550
Basically what they're saying is that the last call them the 2016 expected values which they calculated

74

00:05:20.580  -->  00:05:24.860
they know exactly what the total of their projection is.

75

00:05:24.870  -->  00:05:30.570
And it's that now rose you know there might be errors and might be you know anomalies in the data and

76

00:05:30.570  -->  00:05:35.940
so on but this this role that they populate they are 100 percent certain that the value the exact sound

77

00:05:36.030  -->  00:05:42.180
should be this and if it's not that then you have to run to them and say Hey guys you're actually mistaking

78

00:05:42.180  -->  00:05:48.270
it as a problem but you have to triple quadruple check everything before you say that that's not correct

79

00:05:48.270  -->  00:05:54.150
because when they say that the file that they supplied They've double triple check that this is the

80

00:05:54.150  -->  00:05:56.970
correct value in the file.

81

00:05:57.000  -->  00:06:01.230
Then maybe it is the case and when you upload the data you have to get that value.

82

00:06:01.230  -->  00:06:06.090
So basically when you upload the data if you don't see the sum equaling that then you've done something

83

00:06:06.090  -->  00:06:10.100
wrong and you have to redo it and look for errors.

84

00:06:10.440  -->  00:06:14.490
So aim to get that and this this bit is important.

85

00:06:14.490  -->  00:06:21.620
This is a specific type of dozens of projects when every road is important when you're looking at soms

86

00:06:21.630  -->  00:06:26.730
you're not looking at averages and you're not looking at statistical behavioral patterns and things

87

00:06:26.730  -->  00:06:28.620
like that when you're looking at the actual sum.

88

00:06:28.770  -->  00:06:36.450
And for instance when you have an accounting book or balance sheet or income statement or things like

89

00:06:36.450  -->  00:06:45.290
projected revenue statements like this one when the actual But you upload has to match dollar for dollar

90

00:06:45.300  -->  00:06:51.750
cent for cent even to what you've been supplied or to what is recorded in other systems that is when

91

00:06:51.750  -->  00:06:57.480
you have to be super hyperreal or because if you make one mistake even if one of the rows has a problem

92

00:06:57.800  -->  00:07:03.080
and that it will match and you can continue if the project because what you're reporting in your project

93

00:07:03.110  -->  00:07:09.030
and in your analysis is going to be different towards reported in analysis conducted through other systems

94

00:07:09.030  -->  00:07:09.840
of the company.

95

00:07:09.990  -->  00:07:14.550
And so going to match up auditors and are going to be happy executives and are going to be happy.

96

00:07:14.640  -->  00:07:21.030
You might not pass some industry quality standards or you know some customers might not get paid some

97

00:07:21.030  -->  00:07:29.040
customers might not get their receivables or incomes or tax receipts or whatever it can happen.

98

00:07:29.040  -->  00:07:34.350
So this is a specific type of project where you have to be very extremely very alert.

99

00:07:34.410  -->  00:07:35.250
So there we go.

100

00:07:35.250  -->  00:07:37.280
Good luck with that is going to be quite a challenge.

101

00:07:37.350  -->  00:07:44.040
And otherwise I look forward to seeing you on the other parts of this course until next time happy analyzing
