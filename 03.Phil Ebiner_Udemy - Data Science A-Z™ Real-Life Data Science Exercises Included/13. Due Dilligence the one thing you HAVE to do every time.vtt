00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.590
Today we will see how to do all due diligence process up to the upload.

2

00:00:05.590  -->  00:00:09.300
It's a very simple step but it can save you lots of time.

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:13.940
It can save you from lots of errors it can even save your career sometimes.

4

00:00:13.950  -->  00:00:21.870
So here you can see that we were starting to upload 50000 for those some of them went into the insufficient

5

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:28.980
data flat file some someone to bad records flat file and some of them went into our database.

6

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:35.850
So what we're going to do is we're going to compare the number of rows in the database to the number

7

00:00:35.850  -->  00:00:40.440
of rows that we see here that went into this database.

8

00:00:40.680  -->  00:00:45.770
And you might say Well Carol this is obvious as well.

9

00:00:45.850  -->  00:00:47.220
Where else could have they gone.

10

00:00:47.220  -->  00:00:49.530
They obviously went into that table.

11

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:51.090
Why do we need to compare.

12

00:00:51.090  -->  00:00:53.060
There's definitely going to be that number rose.

13

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:58.420
Well let's first do it and then I will explain why we're doing it.

14

00:00:58.830  -->  00:01:01.590
So we're going to open up Asgill.

15

00:01:01.900  -->  00:01:04.090
We're going to find out table fake names.

16

00:01:04.230  -->  00:01:11.070
Select top 1000 rows and now instead of the thousand rows what we're going to do is we're going to get

17

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:13.740
rid of everything between select and from.

18

00:01:13.740  -->  00:01:22.560
And now we're going to replace that with a simple command which is count and then we'll put a star which

19

00:01:22.560  -->  00:01:30.960
means count all of the rows count basically everything from this table and then will execute.

20

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:34.000
Here it says the number of rows right away.

21

00:01:34.020  -->  00:01:37.410
Forty nine thousand eight hundred sixty eight.

22

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:44.070
So let's go back to ISIS and understand and see if that's the right number.

23

00:01:44.070  -->  00:01:45.980
Forty nine thousand eight hundred sixty eight.

24

00:01:45.990  -->  00:01:46.710
That is correct.

25

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:50.290
So that is the very basic.

26

00:01:50.370  -->  00:01:57.330
The very first essential check that you have to do after you run an sss project now answering the question

27

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:59.620
why you need to perform this check.

28

00:01:59.910  -->  00:02:05.730
Well there might be reasons technical reasons why some of the data might have not been uploaded but

29

00:02:05.790  -->  00:02:11.650
I'm hopeful that Sosias would pick something up like that and tell you about it.

30

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:15.520
The main reason why we check is the human factor.

31

00:02:15.540  -->  00:02:20.930
It's the most common and most obvious reason and I'll give you a simple example.

32

00:02:21.210  -->  00:02:26.850
Say for instance you're developing this package as we were throughout the section and at some point

33

00:02:26.880  -->  00:02:30.260
you know you run it and then you decide to add a conditional split you added in.

34

00:02:30.480  -->  00:02:35.760
And then you run it again and you forgot to truncate the table you completely forgot that you need to

35

00:02:36.150  -->  00:02:39.150
empty the table first and then run the package.

36

00:02:39.150  -->  00:02:40.050
What would happen then.

37

00:02:40.080  -->  00:02:47.430
Well as you remember these files get overwritten but the table the database the table in the database

38

00:02:47.430  -->  00:02:55.770
it doesn't get truncated romantically and that means that you would add more rows into your table and

39

00:02:55.890  -->  00:03:04.050
that can cause lots and lots of problems meaning that you know you'll have duplicate records all of

40

00:03:04.050  -->  00:03:08.910
your Montse will be double for instance if you're analyzing sales then your sales will be double.

41

00:03:09.030  -->  00:03:16.020
Our real loss will be double and you know the number of people that work in your company or customers

42

00:03:16.020  -->  00:03:18.090
or whatever you are analyzing will be double.

43

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:24.960
And every time you run a little ill increase increase increase and people lose careers over this just

44

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:29.340
because of a simple mistake like that just because they didn't check that the number of road matches

45

00:03:29.640  -->  00:03:33.090
to what they applauded.

46

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:37.720
People can lose their jobs people report the wrong things.

47

00:03:37.730  -->  00:03:40.580
And you know it's a very easy mistake to make.

48

00:03:40.580  -->  00:03:48.300
So if you get into the habit of performing the simple very easy count after your upload and hopefully

49

00:03:48.300  -->  00:03:55.440
you know even recording it somewhere that when you uploaded the count was correct then you might save

50

00:03:55.440  -->  00:03:58.170
yourself a lot of trouble one day.

51

00:03:58.170  -->  00:04:00.800
So that's how you check.

52

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:01.880
That's a basic check.

53

00:04:01.890  -->  00:04:06.810
Other checks that you could do is you know select top thousand rows you could look through this here

54

00:04:07.200  -->  00:04:12.570
and just make sure that you know it looks right you're not looking for anomalies or anything you just

55

00:04:13.110  -->  00:04:17.640
know you're looking at it's been uploaded in English or that if it's in another language that there's

56

00:04:17.650  -->  00:04:19.770
no problems with the text.

57

00:04:19.890  -->  00:04:23.940
Something obvious that jumps out straight at you.

58

00:04:23.940  -->  00:04:29.970
And depending on what type of daughter you're working with in your career and your job you will develop

59

00:04:29.970  -->  00:04:35.280
you know you'll naturally come up with these simple things that you should look out for you know maybe

60

00:04:35.640  -->  00:04:39.160
every time you upload data there has to be.

61

00:04:39.330  -->  00:04:45.330
There just has to be a phone number and you can check that the wrong number is present in your daughter

62

00:04:45.330  -->  00:04:47.020
said or something like that.

63

00:04:47.040  -->  00:04:51.060
And so that's your basic check for uploading data.

64

00:04:51.120  -->  00:04:56.770
I highly encourage you to get into the habit of counting neuros once the data has been uploaded.
