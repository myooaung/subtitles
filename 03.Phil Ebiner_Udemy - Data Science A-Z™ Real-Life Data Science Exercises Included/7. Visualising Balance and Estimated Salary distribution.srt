1

00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:02,810
All right so I think have had enough stats for now.

2

00:00:02,890  -->  00:00:06,480
And let's get back to building these charts.

3

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:09,760
First of all we're going to do is we're going to look at some balance.

4

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:10,860
We were done one for eight.

5

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:15,650
Now there's a simple one for balance to really solidify in this technique.

6

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:19,770
So an interesting balance and we're going to create a bin.

7

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:22,780
And there's been many.

8

00:00:22,790  -->  00:00:28,210
We're going to say that the size of the bill should be about ten thousand and click OK.

9

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:28,950
There we go.

10

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:33,840
So what we need to do is duplicate this chart duplicate sheet.

11

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:36,680
We'll call it balance.

12

00:00:38,100  -->  00:00:42,910
And here all we need to do is take Brown's brain and replace age.

13

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:45,240
And as simple as that.

14

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:46,240
Right.

15

00:00:46,860  -->  00:00:54,780
So one thing we notice here right away is that there's a lot of $0 balances or wild balances in the

16

00:00:54,780  -->  00:00:56,960
zero dollar category.

17

00:00:56,970  -->  00:01:03,930
They might be to anywhere between zero to 10000 but if you right click and click you data you will notice

18

00:01:03,930  -->  00:01:09,170
that you go to underlying here you will notice that baluns been.

19

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:11,270
That's baluns that's the been.

20

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:14,610
And then if you look at balance you'll notice that they're actually mostly zero.

21

00:01:14,610  -->  00:01:17,900
So even if we order them there is one.

22

00:01:18,040  -->  00:01:18,860
Wait a second.

23

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:21,940
There's one balance three thousand seven hundred sixty eight dollars.

24

00:01:22,260  -->  00:01:25,270
And the rest are zeros completely zeros.

25

00:01:25,290  -->  00:01:27,210
So what does that tell us.

26

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:33,540
Well that tells us this normal like sometimes people in a bank they have zero balances and that's you

27

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:39,030
know just because they have other accounts or maybe they move the money out but did close this account

28

00:01:39,060  -->  00:01:41,120
and things like that.

29

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:46,860
So in this case what we're going to do is we can just exclude this from our analysis of course we have

30

00:01:46,860  -->  00:01:51,990
to put in a note that you're excluding something from your analysis but it just doesn't make sense because

31

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:55,030
you want to look at the actual value.

32

00:01:55,040  -->  00:01:59,610
So people have bounds is how are they behaving what's going on there are they leaving or are they staying

33

00:01:59,610  -->  00:01:59,640
.

34

00:01:59,640  -->  00:02:00,290
And so on.

35

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:06,210
So just right click this call and Mitchell and exclude and select exclude and that's it.

36

00:02:06,230  -->  00:02:07,040
It's gone.

37

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:08,580
So here you can see a filter.

38

00:02:08,710  -->  00:02:14,480
We won't be talking about filters per se in this course.

39

00:02:14,490  -->  00:02:19,100
It's a whole separate topic and I covered that off in a separate course from Tablo.

40

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:25,080
But basically what this filter does is if you just click here and show click filter you'll see the shock

41

00:02:25,170  -->  00:02:26,880
Schalkwyk filter pop up on the right.

42

00:02:27,030  -->  00:02:33,480
It's excluding a certain category which is the zero to ten thousand dollars bin.

43

00:02:33,630  -->  00:02:36,940
And that's allowing us to just analyze everything else about it.

44

00:02:37,620  -->  00:02:41,870
So what we can do now is perform our analysis as per usual.

45

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:44,280
Here you can see a very interesting picture.

46

00:02:44,280  -->  00:02:47,980
It's a bit different to what we saw previously so I'll just show you age over here.

47

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:49,270
This was age right.

48

00:02:49,590  -->  00:02:57,290
And you could see like there was obviously people who are not like our difference of theirs.

49

00:02:57,330  -->  00:02:59,810
They're not conforming with the average in here.

50

00:02:59,820  -->  00:03:01,170
They are higher.

51

00:03:01,170  -->  00:03:05,770
There's a high chance of these people leaving lower chance of these people living in balance.

52

00:03:05,820  -->  00:03:09,750
It's a bit different they're kind of more uniform here so you can see across the board it's around 20

53

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:14,110
percent some are higher so these early ones and the later ones are higher.

54

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:19,470
But once again here you can see that you have less records so there's a higher chance that this will

55

00:03:19,470  -->  00:03:24,610
be a just you know a random error or just like some some sampling error.

56

00:03:25,050  -->  00:03:31,500
And same thing over here you can see that this is just due to the way the sample was selected.

57

00:03:31,530  -->  00:03:35,360
You can't really rely on these things for for instance for a two and a one.

58

00:03:35,380  -->  00:03:36,720
You can't run a chi squared test.

59

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:43,030
You have to have at least four or five units or five observations in each cell to run a square test

60

00:03:43,040  -->  00:03:43,170
.

61

00:03:43,350  -->  00:03:44,720
So you can still run one for here.

62

00:03:44,880  -->  00:03:51,480
But overall here you can see that there isn't that much of a difference maybe a bit over here.

63

00:03:51,480  -->  00:03:54,420
More likely to leave a bit over here more likely to leave.

64

00:03:54,780  -->  00:03:56,770
So that's that's very interesting.

65

00:03:56,770  -->  00:03:57,100
We're good.

66

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:03,690
What we can do now is out to change the color of the top chart over here because it's balance and I'm

67

00:04:03,690  -->  00:04:07,250
kind of used to using bounce as green.

68

00:04:07,260  -->  00:04:07,980
There we go.

69

00:04:08,130  -->  00:04:16,710
And so that's pretty much it for balance what you can do from here is the way the situation's different

70

00:04:16,710  -->  00:04:21,450
is that you don't you don't observe something that is like screaming out at you.

71

00:04:21,450  -->  00:04:28,440
You can continue investigating these discrepancies if you like and if that is important to your company

72

00:04:28,440  -->  00:04:32,300
to understand like OK so that's 29 percent that's 25 percent.

73

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:33,400
Why is that higher.

74

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:38,190
So if you feel that that is an important step and see then you can apply the techniques that we've talked

75

00:04:38,190  -->  00:04:43,160
about to this specific case and take it further.

76

00:04:43,170  -->  00:04:48,180
However if you feel that this is more or less conforming with average and you'd rather focus on other

77

00:04:48,180  -->  00:04:54,420
things you can simply leave it at that you can just say that from you know from our analysis it doesn't

78

00:04:54,420  -->  00:05:03,130
seem that there is a a very high change across different categories in terms of probability of people

79

00:05:03,130  -->  00:05:08,210
leaving and you know you just go from there and you focus on other things of course would be great to

80

00:05:08,200  -->  00:05:13,060
cover everything but that's what we call it data mining you want to find the gems you want to find the

81

00:05:13,060  -->  00:05:19,330
real golden nuggets rather than spending your time on things that won't give you much value so if you

82

00:05:19,610  -->  00:05:26,860
target people with special offers who are in this age group between 45 and 60 you can really impact

83

00:05:27,520  -->  00:05:31,630
the amount of people that's leaving your company but do bear in mind.

84

00:05:31,640  -->  00:05:37,210
You have to also take into account the actual number of records so this distribution helps so you can

85

00:05:37,210  -->  00:05:42,400
see that you might want to target these people more than these people because there's more of them whereas

86

00:05:42,400  -->  00:05:45,980
in balance yes these do have a higher percentage of living.

87

00:05:46,210  -->  00:05:51,940
But how much return on investment are you going to get if you try to fix this instead of fixing the

88

00:05:51,940  -->  00:05:56,360
problem that you can perceive with the different age demographics.

89

00:05:56,360  -->  00:05:58,540
So that's balance.

90

00:05:58,550  -->  00:06:03,110
The other one I wanted to look at today was estimated salary Let's have a look at that because it's

91

00:06:03,110  -->  00:06:05,560
kind of related to balance.

92

00:06:05,560  -->  00:06:14,330
So we'll just duplicate this as we normally do because because it's fast and here we'll just say estimated

93

00:06:15,010  -->  00:06:16,160
salary.

94

00:06:16,970  -->  00:06:19,360
And let's take estimated salary and drag it.

95

00:06:19,490  -->  00:06:25,190
Oh the Binz we haven't created a business so let's create have been created been.

96

00:06:25,250  -->  00:06:30,980
So something 10000 and here just take the filter off.

97

00:06:31,000  -->  00:06:33,120
So the there's no more exclusion.

98

00:06:33,350  -->  00:06:38,590
So we just want to keep the filter on that sheet not on the sheet and estimate salary just drag it instead

99

00:06:38,600  -->  00:06:41,100
of bondsmen.

100

00:06:41,200  -->  00:06:44,230
And here you can see a different picture one more time.

101

00:06:44,240  -->  00:06:50,550
So I'm just going to change the color here quickly color up to you.

102

00:06:50,600  -->  00:06:57,650
Honestly what what color you think is the best de-select that color it's a gray.

103

00:06:58,000  -->  00:07:04,960
So here what you can see is a very interesting picture a very uniform distribution here very uniform

104

00:07:04,970  -->  00:07:06,220
distribution over here.

105

00:07:06,400  -->  00:07:10,600
So first things first you look at this chart and you say all right.

106

00:07:10,750  -->  00:07:20,080
Obviously there is no impact whatsoever from salary upon the probability of the person any all upon

107

00:07:20,090  -->  00:07:24,090
the decision of the person to leave the bank so salary is not an important variable.

108

00:07:24,230  -->  00:07:25,370
And we would leave it at that.

109

00:07:25,370  -->  00:07:27,930
I've only had this chart like this chart.

110

00:07:28,120  -->  00:07:30,760
This chart is selling something very interesting.

111

00:07:30,910  -->  00:07:38,950
It's actually telling us that well look the there is an equal number of people in every single being

112

00:07:38,970  -->  00:07:44,890
for estimated salaries so we're saying that you know bank there is the same number of people that earn

113

00:07:45,010  -->  00:07:52,790
between 180000 $190000 as the number of people that earn between 30000 and 40000.

114

00:07:52,880  -->  00:07:57,020
And as the number of people who earn between 80000 $90000.

115

00:07:57,010  -->  00:08:03,740
So this really kind of contradicts the whole balance situation where we have this nice normal distribution

116

00:08:03,750  -->  00:08:03,780
.

117

00:08:03,790  -->  00:08:11,530
And like as it probably should be this is lots of people here probably like you can say that they earn

118

00:08:11,890  -->  00:08:13,670
somewhere in the mid range.

119

00:08:13,690  -->  00:08:16,120
These are people earning a lower range.

120

00:08:16,120  -->  00:08:22,040
These people are earning in a higher range and you would think that balance would somehow be related

121

00:08:22,030  -->  00:08:24,060
to estimates salary or at least.

122

00:08:24,470  -->  00:08:31,130
Well you got a hint here that estimated salary is actually has the word estimated meaning probably that

123

00:08:31,120  -->  00:08:35,900
the bank doesn't know what they're earning and they're estimating what these people are earning.

124

00:08:36,160  -->  00:08:42,650
And you'd think that you'd use the balance to estimate what a person's earning rights somehow in the

125

00:08:42,640  -->  00:08:43,960
calculation would figure there.

126

00:08:44,140  -->  00:08:48,620
But doesn't look like it because there would be a trace of a normal distribution but there isn't here

127

00:08:48,630  -->  00:08:48,820
.

128

00:08:49,000  -->  00:08:54,910
So one thing you can report from here is that this is going above and beyond your task.

129

00:08:54,910  -->  00:08:58,450
So here you know you've already said that no significant impact.

130

00:08:58,510  -->  00:09:06,080
But then look at this you can say hey by the way it looks like the estimated salary calculation is completely

131

00:09:06,130  -->  00:09:12,100
wrong or out of whack because it's not giving adding any value just putting people uniformly across

132

00:09:12,400  -->  00:09:17,900
all bands and although that's not related to it that's how data mining works.

133

00:09:17,990  -->  00:09:26,800
You will find that you will uncover very interesting insights about completely unrelated things to your

134

00:09:26,810  -->  00:09:29,010
analysis while you're doing analysis.

135

00:09:29,140  -->  00:09:33,500
And this is one of them so you can go back to the department that runs the system itself and say hey

136

00:09:33,500  -->  00:09:38,330
your calculations are dated or is an error or something is wrong with it.

137

00:09:38,330  -->  00:09:39,210
Let's have a look at it.

138

00:09:39,210  -->  00:09:45,100
I can show you that this is not normal this is not how it's supposed to be and you know maybe just by

139

00:09:45,110  -->  00:09:49,400
doing things like that you will add way more value than just by delivering a project.

140

00:09:49,390  -->  00:09:54,440
And that's happened to me heaps of times that I was doing one thing and then I noticed something in

141

00:09:54,430  -->  00:09:57,110
the data that led me to uncover something else.

142

00:09:57,230  -->  00:09:59,540
And then something else and then BAM.

143

00:09:59,650  -->  00:10:04,770
I actually delivered so much more value than I just delivered on the project.

144

00:10:04,880  -->  00:10:08,690
Just because a project you're doing people already know what value they'll probably get from it.

145

00:10:08,810  -->  00:10:13,450
Here you can uncover completely random things and that's just fantastic.

146

00:10:13,450  -->  00:10:17,510
I personally find that that is the fun part in data mining.

147

00:10:17,750  -->  00:10:22,570
You have a problem that you need to solve along the way you find additional insights and lots of them

148

00:10:22,610  -->  00:10:23,040
.

149

00:10:23,410  -->  00:10:27,510
So there we go that's what we found about estimated salary that probably the calculations wrong.

150

00:10:27,560  -->  00:10:32,770
But the way the calculations are structured right now we can see that this variable does not have a

151

00:10:32,770  -->  00:10:42,510
significant impact upon our variable or our probability to likelihood of person to leave or decision

152

00:10:42,520  -->  00:10:43,810
of the person to leave.

153

00:10:44,260  -->  00:10:45,410
So that's all for today.

154

00:10:45,400  -->  00:10:53,000
And as a homework exercise I'll like to suggest that you look at the remaining two variables that we

155

00:10:53,000  -->  00:10:58,000
have so there will be credit score and tenure and see what you can find there maybe you'll find some

156

00:10:58,000  -->  00:11:01,130
anomalies and maybe you will try some insights.

157

00:11:01,120  -->  00:11:02,500
I look forward for you next time.

158

00:11:02,540  -->  00:11:04,100
Until then happy analyzing
