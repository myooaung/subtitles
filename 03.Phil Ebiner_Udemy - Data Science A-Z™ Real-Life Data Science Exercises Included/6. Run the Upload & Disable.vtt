00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:03.270
Finally we have prepared everything.

2

00:00:03.270  -->  00:00:07.530
And to day we will run our first data upload via SOSIAS.

3

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:11.670
I hope you're as excited as I am without any further ado.

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:13.250
Let's get straight to it.

5

00:00:13.390  -->  00:00:14.240
To run upload.

6

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:17.640
Simply click this green start button up at the top.

7

00:00:17.730  -->  00:00:19.140
That was quick wasn't it.

8

00:00:19.140  -->  00:00:24.060
That is because this is a training file and only has 20 rows further in this course.

9

00:00:24.070  -->  00:00:27.760
We'll be working with much much larger files.

10

00:00:27.780  -->  00:00:33.360
The package has been executed successfully and to turn to design mode we can either click the stop debugging

11

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:37.480
button at the top or click on the success message at the bottom.

12

00:00:37.590  -->  00:00:42.440
By the way if errors occur during the upload this message at the bottom will tell you about it but we'll

13

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:45.360
deal with that in the next section of the course.

14

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:52.620
Let's turn to the design mode now let's have a look at our table in the database and check if the rules

15

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:53.830
are really there.

16

00:00:54.210  -->  00:00:58.490
Right click and choose select top 1000 rows options.

17

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:01.850
We can see that all â‚¬20 are present perfect.

18

00:01:01.860  -->  00:01:03.870
We have one more thing left to do.

19

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:06.920
SS Let's go back to the control flow.

20

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:13.440
The idea is that for every analytics project you're working on you will create a new society project

21

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:17.560
within every SS project for every new data file you upload.

22

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:21.270
You will create a new data flow task just like this one.

23

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:27.330
This means that the number of data flow tasks in your control flow will be equal to the number of files

24

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:29.340
that you upload to a database.

25

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:34.170
The reason this is important is because when you click the Start button youre launching the control

26

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:36.560
flow and not an individual data flow.

27

00:01:36.720  -->  00:01:41.420
It doesn't matter if you're browsing inside a specific data flow you want to launch.

28

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:46.150
You will still always launch the control flow when you click the green button.

29

00:01:46.230  -->  00:01:52.320
That means if you have 500 to flow tasks within your control flow then all five of them will be executed

30

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:52.880
.

31

00:01:52.890  -->  00:01:57.760
We have already executed this data flow once and we don't want it to run again ever.

32

00:01:57.930  -->  00:02:01.930
If that happens then the dot in the table will be duplicated.

33

00:02:02.070  -->  00:02:05.880
A lot of starting our data scientists and analysts make this mistake.

34

00:02:05.970  -->  00:02:07.950
And I have made it before too.

35

00:02:08.160  -->  00:02:13.530
And that's why I want to caution you against it to avoid duplicating the data we need to disable this

36

00:02:13.530  -->  00:02:14.680
data flow.

37

00:02:15.060  -->  00:02:20.580
To do that simply right click the data flow and select disable and now save your project.

38

00:02:20.580  -->  00:02:21.000
That's it.

39

00:02:21.000  -->  00:02:24.800
The upload has been completed and the data flow task has been disabled.

40

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:29.910
By the way we're not deleting the data flow task simply because we want to keep it for future reference

41

00:02:29.910  -->  00:02:31.020
.

42

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:32.020
That's all for today.

43

00:02:32.040  -->  00:02:38.280
Hope you enjoyed the tutorial and next time we will talk about quality assurance of this phase of your
