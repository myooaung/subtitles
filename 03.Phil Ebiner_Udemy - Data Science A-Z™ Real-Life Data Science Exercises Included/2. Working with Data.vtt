00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:06.840
What is working with data in order to get from raw data to insights your data has to undergo a journey

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:07.080
.

3

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:10.830
And broadly speaking this journey consists of four major steps.

4

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:16.110
These are e-tail database analyze and visualize.

5

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:19.190
Now analyze and visualize are pretty straightforward.

6

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:23.670
These constitute the creative part of the work of a data scientist.

7

00:00:23.910  -->  00:00:29.490
Whereas working with data comprises of the DTL and database steps.

8

00:00:29.640  -->  00:00:33.280
And this is what we will be talking about in this part of this course.

9

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:39.410
This is the preparation phase and I will share a secret Ruffino from my experience.

10

00:00:39.450  -->  00:00:45.840
You'll spend approximately 70 percent of your time as a data scientist on any given project.

11

00:00:45.900  -->  00:00:53.160
In this preparation phase and that is if you know what you're doing and only 30 percent of the time

12

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:57.780
is spent in the exciting part which is analyze and visualize.

13

00:00:57.930  -->  00:01:02.780
And so this is why this part of the Course is so volume's and also so important.

14

00:01:03.060  -->  00:01:09.540
I will be giving you the exact step by step blueprints and tools so that you can sail smoothly through

15

00:01:09.540  -->  00:01:14.600
the e-tail and database work and move onto the fun stuff faster.
