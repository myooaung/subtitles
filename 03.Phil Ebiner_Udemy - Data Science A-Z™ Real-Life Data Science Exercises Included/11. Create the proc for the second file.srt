1

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:06,780
As you recall we have to row files that we're working with in this section and so far we have only created

2

00:00:06,780  -->  00:00:09,690
a proc and a working file for one of them.

3

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:18,020
So let's go and create a second proc and a second working file and we'll do this for our row for our

4

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:20,910
table which is called transactional data.

5

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:24,540
So let's open up the table and there it is.

6

00:00:24,540  -->  00:00:34,380
So those are all rows as you can see we've got row number order id date custom ID region wrap item units

7

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:35,310
and unit price.

8

00:00:35,310  -->  00:00:36,420
So we've got a good mix here.

9

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:46,500
We've got dates we've got tech so this will as we agreed this will stay as a text and so will order

10

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:49,350
ID and region and we'll talk about that in a second.

11

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:54,970
This will definitely says text units is an integer it can be a.

12

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:56,780
It can have a decimal point points.

13

00:00:56,780  -->  00:01:03,810
So it's definitely going to be a whole number and unit price is going to be a float type so great mix

14

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:06,020
of types of variables here.

15

00:01:06,510  -->  00:01:11,880
What are we going to do next is we're going to show you a way that she can look at these two files or

16

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:13,380
two scripts at the same time.

17

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:20,010
By the way we we're not going to recode all of this as you understand where we have this prepared and

18

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:25,470
we don't want to rewrite all of this script from scratch so we're going to actually use this file as

19

00:01:25,560  -->  00:01:29,610
our basis to create the new Proc..

20

00:01:29,610  -->  00:01:31,230
So you'll see that in a second.

21

00:01:31,230  -->  00:01:39,420
Right now what I would like to do is just take this script that shows you the table and drag it to the

22

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:43,470
side and then select a position where you want for it to be.

23

00:01:43,480  -->  00:01:47,910
If you can put it to the right you can put it under your file to the left to the top.

24

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:52,690
I'm going to put it to the right of my existing file and now I can see it to fall side by side.

25

00:01:52,920  -->  00:02:00,750
And if I close this window here which I never actually use then you will see that I have enough space

26

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:02,710
to work with both for the same time.

27

00:02:02,700  -->  00:02:09,210
I don't think you can do is you can unpinned this object Explorer and then it will be like popping up

28

00:02:09,210  -->  00:02:15,490
when you need it and when you don't need it you will have all this room to work with your files.

29

00:02:15,660  -->  00:02:18,930
So actually am going to keep my objeck Explorer.

30

00:02:18,930  -->  00:02:21,610
I think this is enough room for me.

31

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:24,120
Maybe make it a bit smaller like that.

32

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:30,480
So let's go ahead and do this first thing that I want to do is I want to make sure that I'm not going

33

00:02:30,480  -->  00:02:36,940
to modify my existing product so I'm going to change this word to create.

34

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:43,140
And I'm just going to change the name here right away as it's been highlighted in red because I can

35

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:45,630
create this Procrit exists and that's fine.

36

00:02:45,630  -->  00:02:49,560
I don't want to create this proc I want to create a proc just like it.

37

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:55,400
But for this other file so I'm gonna take the name of the file here between role and the date.

38

00:02:55,800  -->  00:02:57,910
Al capias and I'll put it in here.

39

00:02:57,920  -->  00:02:59,770
After the word work.

40

00:03:00,300  -->  00:03:02,960
And as soon as I execute that I'm safe.

41

00:03:03,000  -->  00:03:06,230
That means that I'm no longer working in the old proc.

42

00:03:06,240  -->  00:03:09,840
I'm working in the new proc which you can see here so transactional data.

43

00:03:09,870  -->  00:03:12,190
I'm working on that one right now.

44

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:21,810
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to set this proc up for accepting this data because we don't

45

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:24,460
even have the table prepared yet the work table.

46

00:03:24,630  -->  00:03:34,630
So today's date is the 11:30 time flies and let's take this again copy and we will pasted everywhere

47

00:03:34,640  -->  00:03:34,720
.

48

00:03:34,740  -->  00:03:35,730
We need to.

49

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:41,270
So here here you can use a Find and Replace functionality.

50

00:03:41,310  -->  00:03:46,480
I'm just not doing that so that you can see exactly what I'm doing.

51

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:52,440
So here obviously get rid of all of the columns except for the first one because it's going to be the

52

00:03:52,440  -->  00:03:53,670
same.

53

00:03:53,670  -->  00:04:02,560
Then here replace again the truncate replace get rid of all the columns get of all the columns.

54

00:04:02,560  -->  00:04:09,270
And here you need to put in your RAW file so take the whole name of the whole file and just place it

55

00:04:09,270  -->  00:04:09,470
here.

56

00:04:09,480  -->  00:04:14,370
And here I usually just put an X back to remind me that I need to put in the correct number of rows

57

00:04:14,370  -->  00:04:15,330
when I'm done.

58

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:20,300
And at the bottom it's going to be again the final file.

59

00:04:20,300  -->  00:04:22,490
So sorry this is the raw file.

60

00:04:22,800  -->  00:04:24,680
So get rid of that.

61

00:04:24,720  -->  00:04:28,030
And also I like to actually put it here.

62

00:04:28,260  -->  00:04:36,140
The final file in fact will put at the top because it's a bit more important from.

63

00:04:36,200  -->  00:04:38,220
And what is it going to be.

64

00:04:38,670  -->  00:04:41,670
The final file is going to be the one I'm creating here.

65

00:04:41,690  -->  00:04:42,610
There you.

66

00:04:43,290  -->  00:04:45,180
So just so that at the end we can compare.

67

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:48,640
So that's how our proc looks currently.

68

00:04:48,660  -->  00:04:50,160
Now we want to populate it.

69

00:04:50,160  -->  00:04:52,280
We have the correct rows.

70

00:04:52,320  -->  00:04:54,600
So we'll start off with the create table part.

71

00:04:54,810  -->  00:05:02,940
Obviously we want to take these same columns and create create them in our table once again as we discussed

72

00:05:03,030  -->  00:05:08,010
you might want to rename them you might not want all of the columns although I do advice for the working

73

00:05:08,010  -->  00:05:12,690
table took all the columns but there might be cases when you have like a thousand columns and you were

74

00:05:12,700  -->  00:05:13,390
all fine.

75

00:05:13,420  -->  00:05:20,210
You only need 10 for analysis and in that case you don't really need to bother with everything so same

76

00:05:20,210  -->  00:05:22,350
trick shift tab and then tab.

77

00:05:22,560  -->  00:05:24,130
Oops forgot about this guy.

78

00:05:24,670  -->  00:05:25,810
OK.

79

00:05:26,000  -->  00:05:30,350
Next we're going to give these columns their designated types right.

80

00:05:30,560  -->  00:05:38,060
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring up this file over here so that I can zoom in comfortably

81

00:05:38,210  -->  00:05:39,500
and you can see everything.

82

00:05:39,750  -->  00:05:41,030
So that's this file

83

00:05:43,670  -->  00:05:47,570
and I'm working on this table.

84

00:05:47,570  -->  00:05:53,350
So here Order ID it looks like an integer.

85

00:05:53,370  -->  00:05:58,500
And this one is probably one of the trickiest ones or one of the most tempting ones.

86

00:05:58,580  -->  00:06:00,420
It looks like an integer.

87

00:06:00,440  -->  00:06:02,370
It's sequenced you know.

88

00:06:02,600  -->  00:06:09,140
In this particular case is going from one to 43 it looks like a great opportunity and it's also me a

89

00:06:09,140  -->  00:06:10,710
meets the date.

90

00:06:10,730  -->  00:06:17,030
There are cases like maybe in this particular case you could use it as an integer because you if you

91

00:06:17,100  -->  00:06:26,810
if you have knowledge that it is sequenced and sequenced by date and there are no discrepancies So it's

92

00:06:26,810  -->  00:06:33,010
always the case that if the or the great order ID means it was that order was created later.

93

00:06:33,560  -->  00:06:39,980
So maybe in this case you might use it as an integer because that will allow you to order this column

94

00:06:40,340  -->  00:06:44,100
ascending descending and you know compare orders between each other.

95

00:06:44,300  -->  00:06:50,540
However I'm not going to do that because I have the philosophy that if something is not meant to be

96

00:06:50,540  -->  00:06:55,970
an integer I'm not going to make it an integer it's like not a whole number it's it looks like a whole

97

00:06:55,970  -->  00:06:58,410
number but in reality for me it's text.

98

00:06:58,500  -->  00:07:04,130
For me it would have been the same if these were letters if these were ABC all the way up to Zed and

99

00:07:04,130  -->  00:07:06,550
then you know a B B and so on.

100

00:07:06,750  -->  00:07:09,200
It doesn't make a difference that it's simply an idea.

101

00:07:09,200  -->  00:07:12,760
So I can identify this order and may be connected to other tables.

102

00:07:12,770  -->  00:07:14,150
That's all it's there for.

103

00:07:14,150  -->  00:07:24,350
So for me it's not actually doesn't carry a numerical weight that numbers you know numbers and databases

104

00:07:24,830  -->  00:07:27,150
have what they're used for here.

105

00:07:27,170  -->  00:07:32,020
It's simply a text for me so I'm going to I'm going to keep it as a bar chart.

106

00:07:32,370  -->  00:07:38,540
You can perhaps maybe select something else if if you're more comfortable with that.

107

00:07:38,550  -->  00:07:40,640
Whoops excuse me.

108

00:07:40,640  -->  00:07:46,040
So var char and I'll just give it a 100 meaning it doesn't go.

109

00:07:46,110  -->  00:07:47,810
Not that it goes up to 100 music.

110

00:07:47,840  -->  00:07:49,170
You can have 100 characters.

111

00:07:49,170  -->  00:07:50,240
That's a lot.

112

00:07:50,250  -->  00:07:53,410
That's good order date.

113

00:07:53,420  -->  00:07:56,460
So this is just going to be a date.

114

00:07:56,450  -->  00:07:59,060
If you have a date and time than any date time.

115

00:07:59,060  -->  00:08:03,560
But we only have date customer id is going to be a VAR charm

116

00:08:06,170  -->  00:08:14,150
and here it's evidently going up to seven in previous Tauriel or previously when we were talking about

117

00:08:14,150  -->  00:08:19,880
the other table you saw that we didn't know how long they were and we put a 100 so I'll put 100 here

118

00:08:19,880  -->  00:08:20,550
as well.

119

00:08:20,630  -->  00:08:28,040
But we'll talk about customer ID in a seperate video so region once again looks like a number but you

120

00:08:28,040  -->  00:08:33,240
can take an average of region you can add them up compare them you know it doesn't mean anything here

121

00:08:33,240  -->  00:08:33,410
.

122

00:08:33,500  -->  00:08:41,220
It's a purely categorical variable so we're going to keep it of our char and looks like it is only it

123

00:08:41,300  -->  00:08:45,970
only goes up to 3 so we'll only give it one symbol rep.

124

00:08:46,080  -->  00:08:56,490
It's a VAR char it's a name so a 100 item it's also name but items can be long so you get a thousand

125

00:08:57,090  -->  00:09:00,800
units units as an integer.

126

00:09:00,800  -->  00:09:03,800
As we discussed you can have a fraction of a unit.

127

00:09:03,950  -->  00:09:11,390
So that's how a first integer and unit price is going to be a float because that's a dollar a dollar

128

00:09:11,390  -->  00:09:12,050
amount.

129

00:09:12,050  -->  00:09:12,260
All right.

130

00:09:12,260  -->  00:09:14,160
So that's creating a table.

131

00:09:14,210  -->  00:09:16,680
Next we're going to truncate the table yes that's good.

132

00:09:16,740  -->  00:09:18,960
Now we're going to insert into a table.

133

00:09:19,220  -->  00:09:23,020
This is the tedious Bidwill you just take and copy this part you put it.

134

00:09:23,080  -->  00:09:28,730
Oops you put it here and you just get to get rid of these

135

00:09:31,400  -->  00:09:32,690
types.

136

00:09:33,090  -->  00:09:35,060
Could have we could have done that actually before.

137

00:09:35,070  -->  00:09:37,240
Yeah you can do that before you specify the tabs.

138

00:09:37,250  -->  00:09:39,930
You can just copy it in here maybe a bit faster.

139

00:09:40,290  -->  00:09:48,810
Now you need to select from here so I'm going to copy these columns so these columns from here.

140

00:09:50,210  -->  00:09:52,470
OK.

141

00:09:52,460  -->  00:09:52,780
All right.

142

00:09:52,780  -->  00:09:55,100
So that's us pretty much done.

143

00:09:55,160  -->  00:09:56,790
Let's save the proc.

144

00:09:56,780  -->  00:09:58,490
Just execute the whole proc.

145

00:09:58,520  -->  00:10:01,700
So what's what is it telling us that I didn't change just to alter.

146

00:10:01,910  -->  00:10:06,900
Let's changed that to alter because this proc is already existing in the database.

147

00:10:06,890  -->  00:10:07,740
There we go.

148

00:10:07,970  -->  00:10:16,880
And now we're going to execute everything between Begin and then we go execute down 43 rows affected

149

00:10:16,910  -->  00:10:17,430
again.

150

00:10:17,420  -->  00:10:20,790
So this just so happens that the tables both have 43 rows.

151

00:10:21,170  -->  00:10:22,460
All right.

152

00:10:22,460  -->  00:10:25,730
Now I've changed part of the pro-corporate a combination executed again.

153

00:10:26,070  -->  00:10:28,330
And let's refresh.

154

00:10:29,100  -->  00:10:29,810
That's good.

155

00:10:29,850  -->  00:10:32,350
And here's your file.

156

00:10:32,540  -->  00:10:34,410
Let's see file.

157

00:10:35,070  -->  00:10:35,400
All right.

158

00:10:35,420  -->  00:10:36,030
There it is.

159

00:10:36,060  -->  00:10:39,520
So here you can see that everything is good.

160

00:10:39,580  -->  00:10:45,270
And since this file actually has lots of different types of data I thought it'd be quite handy to share

161

00:10:45,260  -->  00:10:52,350
another trick like here you can see that they're there types property but if you right click the file

162

00:10:52,760  -->  00:11:00,150
and you click design you don't often do this but here you can actually see the data type so you can

163

00:11:00,140  -->  00:11:04,690
see that we've specified the data the target types who specified are reflected here.

164

00:11:04,690  -->  00:11:09,930
So Ron number is always going to be an intern that's our identity column.

165

00:11:09,950  -->  00:11:17,480
And here are the actual columns that we specify so all your ideas are char 100 then date customer IDs

166

00:11:17,480  -->  00:11:22,730
of var char region rep item units these are in a float.

167

00:11:22,940  -->  00:11:30,000
So just if you want to ever check the data types of a table just click that design option and there

168

00:11:30,000  -->  00:11:34,540
we go we've created our second proc and our second a working table
