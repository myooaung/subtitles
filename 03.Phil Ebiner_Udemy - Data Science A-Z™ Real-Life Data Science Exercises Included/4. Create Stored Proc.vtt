00:00:00.890  -->  00:00:06.970
Now that we've uploaded the file we can move on to e-tail face 3 and we should start preparing the Proc.

2

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:07.120
.

3

00:00:07.230  -->  00:00:08.410
So let's go ahead and do that.

4

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:13.560
We'll go to programmability stored procedures and we'll actually use our template.

5

00:00:13.560  -->  00:00:16.400
So right click modify.

6

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:23.030
And here we will right it changes to create get rid of the word template.

7

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:29.400
What is our table name or table name is fake names.

8

00:00:29.400  -->  00:00:30.100
Canada.

9

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:31.970
So it's copy that.

10

00:00:32.340  -->  00:00:40.430
And here we'll just press highlight press control h replace of fake names and Replace All.

11

00:00:40.500  -->  00:00:41.460
Great.

12

00:00:41.580  -->  00:00:48.570
And now we also need the data so actually need the full row of file name.

13

00:00:48.600  -->  00:00:50.590
And here are all table name.

14

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:53.430
Here we can replace that one.

15

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:54.590
Whoops.

16

00:00:55.110  -->  00:00:58.810
So that again one two.

17

00:00:59.160  -->  00:00:59.480
OK.

18

00:00:59.490  -->  00:01:03.990
So that's all the tables really going to drag this to the right.

19

00:01:03.990  -->  00:01:09.230
This is all raw table and we're going to obviously you type in.

20

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:10.760
Author hello.

21

00:01:10.770  -->  00:01:13.870
That's me.

22

00:01:14.010  -->  00:01:24.120
If you haven't met me yet the date day is 11 August and now we'll just copy all the rows except for

23

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:28.970
row number and make some space here.

24

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:32.230
Put them in a magic trick.

25

00:01:32.300  -->  00:01:32.630
Know.

26

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:34.350
We need a comma.

27

00:01:34.710  -->  00:01:38.250
No magic trick done.

28

00:01:38.370  -->  00:01:39.200
OK.

29

00:01:39.650  -->  00:01:42.300
Now and now we need to select the types.

30

00:01:42.330  -->  00:01:47.620
So number as we discussed is going to be the numbers are going to be a bar chart.

31

00:01:47.840  -->  00:01:53.100
Our numbers are up to 200000 So that's six digits.

32

00:01:53.130  -->  00:01:57.500
We'll just give it 100 just in case gender.

33

00:01:57.850  -->  00:01:58.140
OK.

34

00:01:58.160  -->  00:01:59.840
So it's not one letter as male female.

35

00:01:59.850  -->  00:02:09.120
Give it 10 name and you give them a hundred symbols although sometimes it's safer for them and sometimes

36

00:02:09.510  -->  00:02:11.340
they are very long names.

37

00:02:11.340  -->  00:02:19.560
Surname thousands street address thousand city thousand zip code OK zip codes interesting here because

38

00:02:19.560  -->  00:02:20.860
this is Canada.

39

00:02:21.450  -->  00:02:28.170
I'm not a professional of Canadian zip codes but you can see here that there are all three of them a

40

00:02:28.170  -->  00:02:30.260
space and three so they're all seven.

41

00:02:30.270  -->  00:02:36.510
So here for security purposes we can put in seven actually.

42

00:02:36.510  -->  00:02:42.320
And that way we'll protect ourselves from anything more than seven getting into this table.

43

00:02:42.330  -->  00:02:44.740
We'll get an error if something happens like that.

44

00:02:44.930  -->  00:02:49.830
And that's another level of protection which we talked about before so quality assurance.

45

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:52.060
So let's put a 7 here.

46

00:02:52.380  -->  00:03:00.420
Good good control control a country full of so will you it another thousand although I don't know of

47

00:03:00.420  -->  00:03:04.750
a country that has a very long name longer than 100 characters.

48

00:03:04.950  -->  00:03:06.770
So you get 100 birthday.

49

00:03:06.910  -->  00:03:08.100
Ok this is interesting stuff.

50

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:10.220
So there's going to be a date.

51

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:17.540
Balance is going to be afloat and interest rates are going to be afloat.

52

00:03:17.950  -->  00:03:19.180
OK.

53

00:03:19.200  -->  00:03:27.150
So this is a good example of the fact that floats they don't have to have only two digits they can have

54

00:03:27.240  -->  00:03:29.510
many digits after the decimal.

55

00:03:29.520  -->  00:03:31.150
All right so that's how create table.

56

00:03:31.220  -->  00:03:32.790
And now we need to copy this.

57

00:03:32.790  -->  00:03:38.000
As you remember except for the phone number and put it into the insert statement.

58

00:03:38.370  -->  00:03:40.110
How good is this template right.

59

00:03:40.140  -->  00:03:43.030
Just get rid of this.

60

00:03:43.080  -->  00:03:46.230
This is probably the most tedious.

61

00:03:46.290  -->  00:03:52.470
I always forget should have the columns in first before I put in the types anyway.

62

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:58.420
So there is the insert into and now we need to select from our roundtable.

63

00:03:58.460  -->  00:04:00.150
Let's do that.

64

00:04:00.150  -->  00:04:06.330
It's go to our costs and converge here but we're going to totally rely on the implicit conversion because

65

00:04:07.110  -->  00:04:13.620
we believe that everything is set up correctly and it's it should pick up pick everything up okay.

66

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:15.590
So there we go.

67

00:04:15.870  -->  00:04:19.860
That is our Proc..

68

00:04:19.900  -->  00:04:22.970
It's it's really just have a look through it.

69

00:04:23.370  -->  00:04:24.700
Take names scanned.

70

00:04:24.840  -->  00:04:26.550
Yep yep yep.

71

00:04:27.000  -->  00:04:31.800
So now just execute this script to save the Proc. good.

72

00:04:32.430  -->  00:04:38.500
And now let's get rid of this and let's launch it and see what we get.

73

00:04:38.580  -->  00:04:46.090
It's quite quite obvious what it will get at this stage and we get an error.

74

00:04:46.560  -->  00:04:48.410
Surprise surprise you get an error.

75

00:04:48.720  -->  00:04:49.260
What does it say.

76

00:04:49.260  -->  00:04:49.910
It says error.

77

00:04:49.920  -->  00:04:53.270
Converting data type in a bar chart to float.

78

00:04:53.560  -->  00:05:03.480
OK so something is not converting well and this is where we get into the dirty stuff we start fixing

79

00:05:03.480  -->  00:05:04.140
up errors.

80

00:05:04.270  -->  00:05:08.630
We will continue if this in the next Tauriel and I look forward See you there.
