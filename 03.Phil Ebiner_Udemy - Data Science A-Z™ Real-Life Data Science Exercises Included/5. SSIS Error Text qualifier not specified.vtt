00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:05.110
Hey there welcome back as always this is cure or make or your daughter coach.

2

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:09.250
And today we're starting the SSA as part of the EPL.

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:10.960
This is the real deal.

4

00:00:10.980  -->  00:00:15.870
Over the course of the next few tutorials there will be lots of errors and corrupt data which will be

5

00:00:15.870  -->  00:00:18.190
tripping us up just like in real life.

6

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:19.330
But don't be worried.

7

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:23.630
I will still be holding your hand all the way and show you how to deal with all the issues.

8

00:00:23.790  -->  00:00:27.310
It's a homework at the end of the section that you should be worried about.

9

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:32.430
So follow along carefully and take notes and you'll be prepared for the challenge.

10

00:00:32.430  -->  00:00:36.990
All right so we're going to start off with by opening our daughter's science folder and going to our

11

00:00:36.990  -->  00:00:37.890
project.

12

00:00:38.080  -->  00:00:39.120
We will take them.

13

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:41.800
Not the original data will take to prepare Dora.

14

00:00:41.940  -->  00:00:48.870
We will copy it and we will place it in the uploaded data in its own folder which will create for today

15

00:00:48.880  -->  00:00:48.990
.

16

00:00:49.160  -->  00:00:53.120
So 15 August 05 OK.

17

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:56.170
Now we will place it in here.

18

00:00:56.700  -->  00:00:59.070
All right so now we want to upload this file.

19

00:00:59.070  -->  00:01:03.530
We need Sosias and therefore relaunching Microsoft Visual Studio.

20

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:12.540
Now create a new project and select Integration Services project give your project a name going to call

21

00:01:12.540  -->  00:01:18.100
it ITIL error handling Phase 2 click OK.

22

00:01:19.080  -->  00:01:20.550
Your project has been created.

23

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:23.460
You can get rid of this window up here now.

24

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:29.010
Drag a data flow task into your workspace before we open it up.

25

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:33.500
We want to give it a name so as usual follow the convention.

26

00:01:33.780  -->  00:01:37.860
Start of the date and then give it the name.

27

00:01:39.240  -->  00:01:48.480
OK so now let's open the data flow and inside the data flow we want to create a flat file source and

28

00:01:49.450  -->  00:01:51.930
and all the DBI destination.

29

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:53.020
Let's connect the two.

30

00:01:53.040  -->  00:01:57.540
So same thing as we're used to from the previous sections of the course.

31

00:01:57.570  -->  00:02:04.860
Now we want to set up our floodwall source open up the flat file source create a new file flat file

32

00:02:04.860  -->  00:02:13.050
connection connection manager and here we will want to find our files so I've already got this folder

33

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:13.440
open.

34

00:02:13.450  -->  00:02:19.860
Just make sure you are looking for all the files you files a file open it up right away.

35

00:02:19.860  -->  00:02:27.210
Copy the name of the file put it into the connection manager name and let's pretend that we forgot to

36

00:02:27.210  -->  00:02:32.670
do the rest on this page and just continued forward so let's just go to the column section and let's

37

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:34.520
see what we will find here.

38

00:02:34.620  -->  00:02:42.430
If we scroll over to the right everything looks ok so far until something starts happening.

39

00:02:42.480  -->  00:02:44.280
The rows are starting to get skewed.

40

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:51.000
For instance the credit card number here is is in the correct place but the credit card number in the

41

00:02:51.000  -->  00:02:56.580
first row in the SEC in the third row there are not in the correct place and it's the same for these

42

00:02:56.580  -->  00:03:03.280
rows and then this row is even further and then in this row in the fifth row it's even further.

43

00:03:03.390  -->  00:03:09.800
So as you can see the rows are being skewed quite a lot and the data is has turned into a mess.

44

00:03:09.840  -->  00:03:10.930
So what happened here.

45

00:03:11.130  -->  00:03:18.540
Well the reason is that we forgot to specify a TX qualifier so if we go back here you'll see that we

46

00:03:18.540  -->  00:03:25.040
didn't specify a text qualifier so I'll just put in the text qualifier now and if we go to columns you

47

00:03:25.050  -->  00:03:27.410
will see that everything is much better.

48

00:03:27.420  -->  00:03:31.220
Everything is nicely structured so let's investigate that for a second.

49

00:03:31.230  -->  00:03:35.130
This will help us understand what the text qualifier does to start off with.

50

00:03:35.130  -->  00:03:42.630
Let's quickly go to the comments section over here the feedback and look at the feedback in the first

51

00:03:42.630  -->  00:03:45.930
five rows so the first three rows are empty.

52

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:50.700
And then we've got feedback in the fourth and fifth rows.

53

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:56.160
Here you can see that there is a comma and then if we expand this you'll see that there is a comma here

54

00:03:58.860  -->  00:04:02.480
and there is another comma here so there's a couple of commas in the fifth row.

55

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:07.470
So now let's go back and get rid of the text qualifier and see what happens.

56

00:04:07.470  -->  00:04:15.120
So when we go to the columns and we find our feedback I'll just make this smaller for now

57

00:04:19.230  -->  00:04:25.050
so you can see here is that this feedback in the fourth row.

58

00:04:25.200  -->  00:04:26.500
It got split.

59

00:04:26.820  -->  00:04:29.190
So now that you can see the quotation marks there.

60

00:04:29.190  -->  00:04:31.140
Been there part of your daughter now.

61

00:04:31.410  -->  00:04:35.450
And the comma between these two parts of the phrase has disappeared.

62

00:04:35.460  -->  00:04:41.730
Well what happened is because we have unchecked text qualifiers so we have not specified the text qualifier

63

00:04:41.740  -->  00:04:42.370
.

64

00:04:43.320  -->  00:04:51.320
SOSIAS no longer recognizes the quotation marks as something that encapsulates text or a string.

65

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:52.590
Right now what is it.

66

00:04:52.650  -->  00:04:58.580
Recognizing this element of data is as two separate cells separated by a comma.

67

00:04:58.770  -->  00:05:03.630
One cell starts for quotation mark which is part of the data than has three words.

68

00:05:03.630  -->  00:05:09.360
Then there is a comma which means that's and you call them and then there's five more words.

69

00:05:09.360  -->  00:05:11.250
Exclamation mark quotation marks.

70

00:05:11.280  -->  00:05:18.750
So before the quotation marks would encapsulate dadda and segregated from the rest of the world and

71

00:05:18.750  -->  00:05:23.580
say whatever is between these quotation marks cannot be a tech cannot be a delimiter.

72

00:05:23.580  -->  00:05:27.420
It cannot tell Sosias that there is and you call them.

73

00:05:27.420  -->  00:05:33.750
It is within those quotation marks and therefore it segregated Microsoft Visual Studio should not recognize

74

00:05:33.750  -->  00:05:35.850
it as a text delimiter.

75

00:05:35.850  -->  00:05:43.560
Same thing happened here but here every time there was a comma society thought it was a new column and

76

00:05:43.560  -->  00:05:46.970
so therefore the this text.

77

00:05:46.980  -->  00:05:52.260
This part of the text shifts the rest of the columns a bit to the right and here same thing so everything

78

00:05:52.260  -->  00:05:57.780
on this in this role will be shifted by four columns to the right are actually by three columns to the

79

00:05:57.780  -->  00:05:59.760
right and that's what's happening here.

80

00:05:59.760  -->  00:06:02.990
That is why the text qualifier is so important.

81

00:06:03.000  -->  00:06:11.250
It allows you to segregate any column delimiters from the rest of the world and allows you to basically

82

00:06:11.520  -->  00:06:12.480
use them in your daughter.

83

00:06:12.480  -->  00:06:18.750
So let's go ahead and get rid of these problems by returning the text qualifier which is our quotation

84

00:06:18.750  -->  00:06:19.490
marks.

85

00:06:19.500  -->  00:06:27.300
So now if you look at columns you will see that everything is fine and even when we get to the feedback

86

00:06:27.750  -->  00:06:30.220
everything is great and the commas.

87

00:06:30.240  -->  00:06:38.100
There are no quotation marks anymore because they're not recognized by Sosias as text qualifiers and

88

00:06:38.160  -->  00:06:44.100
also the commas are within your text so everything looks great until we get to the end where where is

89

00:06:44.100  -->  00:06:48.000
this column which is completely by itself.

90

00:06:48.150  -->  00:06:54.290
So if we scroll down now you will see that further in this column there is a value.

91

00:06:54.330  -->  00:06:58.940
So one row still got skewed this one over here.

92

00:06:59.010  -->  00:07:01.290
Row 96.

93

00:07:02.040  -->  00:07:07.780
And also if we scroll back up a bit you will see that there is an empty space here and this row here

94

00:07:07.800  -->  00:07:15.580
got skewed to the left row 81 so we will talk about what happened here in the next tutorial.
