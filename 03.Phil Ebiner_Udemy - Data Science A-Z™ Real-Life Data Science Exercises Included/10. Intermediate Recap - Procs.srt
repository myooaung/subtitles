00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:04,100
In the previous tutorial we successfully completed creating our first Proc..

2

00:00:04,320  -->  00:00:10,320
And I thought I'd throw in this short tutorial to quickly recap on what prox are and how we're using

3

00:00:10,320  -->  00:00:15,930
them and what the advantages of using them are just to make sure that we're on the same page before

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:20,310
we proceed to creating the proc for our second row table.

5

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:21,550
All right so here we go.

6

00:00:21,660  -->  00:00:29,130
This is the part of the diagram that is responsible for transferring a role table into a working table

7

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:31,040
in e-tail face 3.

8

00:00:31,170  -->  00:00:37,200
And you can see here that in order to save our BLD process we're using a proc.

9

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:45,570
Now what we did in the past few tutorials is we in our Proc. we created the table and brand new empty

10

00:00:45,570  -->  00:00:53,610
table for all working Daro we specified the columns as we wanted with their correct types.

11

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:59,910
Then we took the raw table and we use the select statement to select the data that we want from that

12

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:01,290
were on table.

13

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:07,170
And before that's like say when there was an insert statement that allowed us to insert what we selected

14

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:11,320
into the empty columns of the working table so that's important to understand.

15

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:13,930
That's the way our construction.

16

00:01:13,970  -->  00:01:15,690
It's got two parts.

17

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:23,340
First part is it's creates the table that we want to insert into and then the second part is broken

18

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:25,080
down into two bits.

19

00:01:25,210  -->  00:01:33,270
If you select the data from the RAW file and then you insert it into the working table.

20

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:34,710
Even though it all happens all together.

21

00:01:34,890  -->  00:01:43,290
But that's how it's all broken up into those two major parts create the table and select an insert and

22

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:49,260
then the selected answers obviously consist obviously of two bits the select and insert.

23

00:01:49,470  -->  00:01:55,190
And now let's quickly recap on the advantages of using prox so we've mentioned them briefly but now

24

00:01:55,190  -->  00:01:57,510
this put put a line under them.

25

00:01:57,520  -->  00:01:59,710
Advantages of using stored procedures.

26

00:01:59,850  -->  00:02:03,950
Number one it allows you to save your script in a secure server management studio.

27

00:02:04,530  -->  00:02:08,460
And that is important because there are other ways to save your scripts.

28

00:02:08,460  -->  00:02:13,290
For instance you could save it as a file on your hard drive as a text file.

29

00:02:13,290  -->  00:02:15,350
You could copy the code and things like that.

30

00:02:15,360  -->  00:02:22,920
But this in my view is the most quickest way to save your files or your scripts through prox And also

31

00:02:22,920  -->  00:02:25,910
it allows other people to access your scripts.

32

00:02:25,950  -->  00:02:27,550
They don't have to ask for them.

33

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:32,190
They're all in that same place where the tables are located as well.

34

00:02:32,190  -->  00:02:37,560
The Mattew is you can easily modify your building process when you need to change something.

35

00:02:37,590  -->  00:02:44,640
And we will see this later in the section of the course how we can easily come back and change our stored

36

00:02:44,640  -->  00:02:51,690
procedures so that the upload or the conversion from raw to work is a bit different to what it was previously

37

00:02:51,700  -->  00:02:51,880
.

38

00:02:52,050  -->  00:02:59,180
And finally what procedures allow for audit ability repeatability and reliability.

39

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:07,600
So the main things here are that you can always get somebody to queue a work and check your work.

40

00:03:07,710  -->  00:03:15,900
Also if something if somebody else needs to do your work for you then they can easily repeat the process

41

00:03:15,930  -->  00:03:21,060
because the code is saved and you know if you are comments in your scripts as well that will help them

42

00:03:21,060  -->  00:03:21,540
out.

43

00:03:21,780  -->  00:03:28,290
And if you even need to perform this work this kind of a similar upload or similar conversion from raw

44

00:03:28,290  -->  00:03:34,500
to work in another table then you can just copy most of the code from this where you can copy the whole

45

00:03:34,500  -->  00:03:41,570
proc and be basically you're just repeating the same code but you don't have to type it up again.

46

00:03:41,730  -->  00:03:42,500
And reliability.

47

00:03:42,500  -->  00:03:49,540
So all of that together Presby of reliability that code is saved that you can you know that if you need

48

00:03:49,550  -->  00:03:55,110
to you can easily modify the proc and so other people can Q8 your work.

49

00:03:55,260  -->  00:04:03,240
All of that all together gives you reliability and your confidence in what you're doing with all this

50

00:04:03,240  -->  00:04:03,870
data.

51

00:04:04,080  -->  00:04:06,080
So hopefully that all makes sense.

52

00:04:06,120  -->  00:04:10,450
And in the next tutorial we will start creating our second proc.

53

00:04:10,470  -->  00:04:15,270
You'll be much faster from there and we will learn a few tips and tricks and the toils after that as

54

00:04:15,270  -->  00:04:15,830
well.
