1

00:00:01,200  -->  00:00:08,490
My brainstorming method this is going to be like an insight into how I come up with the text for my

2

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:09,120
presentation.

3

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:13,800
So it might not work for everybody but this is how I call for presentations.

4

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:19,640
First of all I have a Dallasites project and I know like I came what I started where I finished right

5

00:00:19,640  -->  00:00:22,530
so that's going to be my journey for the audience I want to show them.

6

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:23,870
I went from here to here.

7

00:00:24,030  -->  00:00:28,710
And by audience once again we mean be a massive audience and be a small as can be when your manager

8

00:00:28,770  -->  00:00:29,660
is talking to a manager.

9

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:33,800
So you went from here to here in order to convey this.

10

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:39,330
As we discussed previously you don't use minimal text don't put text on your slides your slides should

11

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:43,480
be assisting you not using your slides and put pictures.

12

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:47,520
So go through your journey mentally how did you get from here to here.

13

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:53,370
And remember like I think of the images that are the best portray that journey.

14

00:00:53,370  -->  00:00:56,580
So you had different checkpoints that you went through.

15

00:00:56,970  -->  00:01:02,160
What results did you have and find out the images that are best conveying those messages put them into

16

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:03,150
a presentation.

17

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:06,080
And after that the last thing to do is some of the text.

18

00:01:06,270  -->  00:01:11,020
So how does a person call the text when you're putting in the images when you think about all of this

19

00:01:11,020  -->  00:01:11,590
project.

20

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:16,300
You're very tense you've got all of this information in your head and you're trying to come over it

21

00:01:16,300  -->  00:01:17,420
takes longer to work out.

22

00:01:17,430  -->  00:01:21,660
It's going to be too technical or too detailed or too boring.

23

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:24,400
What you have to do is you have to relax.

24

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:30,390
That's why when I prepare my text I wait until the evening so when I'm really tired so after that I

25

00:01:30,390  -->  00:01:35,400
know eight hours 10 hours of work I'm just sitting there and I just want to go home want to say but

26

00:01:35,400  -->  00:01:39,150
then I forced to actually write out this text when I'm tired.

27

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:43,190
My brain switched off and I'm just riding like I would be talking to a normal human being.

28

00:01:43,230  -->  00:01:50,460
It takes you down to that you know like just non-technical level so you can communicate to people better

29

00:01:50,460  -->  00:01:51,480
or you wouldn't be.

30

00:01:51,570  -->  00:01:56,190
You have to be in a state where you're not you're not endorsing the scene where you're just a normal

31

00:01:56,190  -->  00:02:00,810
person so try to communicate your insides their When you're tired maybe you might want to have a glass

32

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:05,040
of wine in the evening or you know maybe just came back from the movies on the weekend or something

33

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:05,250
.

34

00:02:05,250  -->  00:02:11,400
Like when your brain is not functioning in that super hyper alert state that it normally is when you're

35

00:02:11,400  -->  00:02:11,990
at work.

36

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:15,390
And once you've got that you write down the text in the evening.

37

00:02:15,460  -->  00:02:21,000
So really when you wake up in the morning then you look through it and then you you know take out some

38

00:02:21,200  -->  00:02:26,280
where when you have too much text you take some of that out or you add some details some technical things

39

00:02:26,280  -->  00:02:28,850
that you forgot to think of that night before.

40

00:02:29,000  -->  00:02:30,470
Personated that's how I do it.

41

00:02:30,470  -->  00:02:31,890
I that's the first draft.

42

00:02:31,890  -->  00:02:36,670
And from there I take it forward and I rehearsed rehearsed like I recreate it.

43

00:02:36,690  -->  00:02:42,720
I show it to a small audience practice audience and maybe your peers and so on just to make sure that

44

00:02:42,960  -->  00:02:43,890
you know everything is going well.

45

00:02:43,980  -->  00:02:50,040
So that's my tip to you in creating your presentation or your text or presentation.

46

00:02:50,130  -->  00:02:52,140
Make sure you're not.

47

00:02:52,260  -->  00:02:56,660
My advice is don't be too tense when you're creating.

48

00:02:56,670  -->  00:03:03,000
Like be in a more normal kind of human being state when you can communicate properly.
