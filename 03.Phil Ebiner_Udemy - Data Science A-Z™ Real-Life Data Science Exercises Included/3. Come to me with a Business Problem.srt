00:00:00,690  -->  00:00:06,330
Come to me with a business problem this is an interesting one because all the time you will have it

2

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:10,350
on the scientist you will have people come to you and say hey I have this data can you give me some

3

00:00:10,350  -->  00:00:11,720
insights into it.

4

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:17,930
That is the worst thing a person can possibly come to you with the worst requests you can get from persons

5

00:00:17,950  -->  00:00:18,210
.

6

00:00:18,300  -->  00:00:19,950
Give me some insights into my dad.

7

00:00:20,160  -->  00:00:21,700
What are we looking for.

8

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:23,540
What are you interested in.

9

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:28,530
What are the challenges you faced no admissions just give me some insights insights are not born out

10

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:35,930
of nothing the way people should approach and you should make this clear as you are building this data

11

00:00:35,930  -->  00:00:41,730
size capability or you know becoming important in an organization to people the way people should approach

12

00:00:41,730  -->  00:00:46,170
is a business problem is much easier to find insights and data when you are looking.

13

00:00:46,290  -->  00:00:50,790
You're really looking for something so the person might come to you and say hey look I have this bottle

14

00:00:50,790  -->  00:00:54,400
neck we're not able to service our customers on time and I don't know what to do.

15

00:00:54,450  -->  00:01:01,530
The problem is that we are not being able to deliver these communications our customers or the products

16

00:01:01,530  -->  00:01:05,620
or customers on time or a factory is not delivering enough good.

17

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:09,350
So here's the data can you help us look for it and solve that problem.

18

00:01:09,360  -->  00:01:14,560
So when you're solving a problem when you have a starting point which is your data set or data sets

19

00:01:15,210  -->  00:01:18,810
and all the interviews that you have to conduct and all the ground work that you have then you have

20

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:24,500
a finishing point ending point where you find the solution to the problem has been identified.

21

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:31,380
That journey that is there a sense that is the fun part and along that journey you will find so many

22

00:01:31,380  -->  00:01:36,210
insights even insights that are completely irrelevant to the problem that will add additional value

23

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:36,870
to the business.

24

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:43,680
And as I mentioned through out the course at times those insights will be even more valuable will drive

25

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:49,120
even more value than the solution to the problem you're actually solving.

26

00:01:49,110  -->  00:01:55,970
So make sure that when people come to you talk to them and try to identify the pain points their problems

27

00:01:55,970  -->  00:02:01,290
that they're facing exactly what they want from you because that will allow you to structure your approach

28

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:04,170
and understand what to look for in the data.

29

00:02:04,170  -->  00:02:09,780
And along the way along the way you will find the insights that they aren't even expecting
