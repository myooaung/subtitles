00:00:00.670  -->  00:00:04.310
Arrive so multiple linear regression data set.

2

00:00:04.380  -->  00:00:05.390
Let's get straight into it.

3

00:00:05.390  -->  00:00:06.870
This was going to be fun.

4

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:14.160
We've got multiple regression here same same euro parching modeling Section 3 months holding a regression

5

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:15.580
of 50 startups.

6

00:00:15.580  -->  00:00:18.890
This is going to be a venture capitalist fund challenge.

7

00:00:18.890  -->  00:00:19.710
All right.

8

00:00:19.830  -->  00:00:24.720
So once you've downloaded the file let's put it into our folder multiple in your regression there it

9

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:25.230
is.

10

00:00:25.310  -->  00:00:31.440
And we're going to bring up Excel and we'll open up in Excel right away.

11

00:00:31.440  -->  00:00:31.930
All right.

12

00:00:31.990  -->  00:00:33.430
Zoom in a bit.

13

00:00:33.480  -->  00:00:34.980
So what do we have here.

14

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:38.090
We've got we've only got five columns.

15

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:46.620
But the real interesting thing about this data is that this is like an very realistic lifelike business

16

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:47.460
challenge.

17

00:00:47.460  -->  00:00:52.400
So you've got 50 companies here 50 companies in total.

18

00:00:52.530  -->  00:01:01.620
And what they have is they have some extracts from their profit and loss statements from their income

19

00:01:01.620  -->  00:01:02.020
report.

20

00:01:02.020  -->  00:01:06.960
So how much did the company in this given financial year that you're analyzing and for how much in that

21

00:01:06.960  -->  00:01:12.510
year did it spend on research and development how much it is spent on an administration like paying

22

00:01:12.510  -->  00:01:16.280
employees paying executives and so on and how much it is spent on marketing.

23

00:01:16.410  -->  00:01:24.450
So those are the true three major operational spins I guess and which state it works and does it work

24

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:28.500
in your code as a work in operating in New York or California.

25

00:01:28.830  -->  00:01:30.900
And finally what is the profit.

26

00:01:30.900  -->  00:01:34.970
What was the profit of that company for that financial year.

27

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:40.800
And the challenge here is this is a data set is totally anonymize so we don't know the companies.

28

00:01:40.980  -->  00:01:49.980
And also there's only 50 companies so there is a venture capitalist fund that has hired you as a data

29

00:01:49.980  -->  00:01:56.670
scientist to analyze these 50 companies or analyze this data set and create a model that will tell the

30

00:01:56.670  -->  00:02:01.020
venture capitalist fund which types of companies it should.

31

00:02:01.350  -->  00:02:06.580
It is most interested in investing and their main criteria is the profit.

32

00:02:06.690  -->  00:02:09.710
So profit is their dependent variable.

33

00:02:09.710  -->  00:02:12.870
The most important variable for them and these are all independent variables.

34

00:02:12.870  -->  00:02:18.060
So you have to create a model which will tell you about profit based on R&D spend in the station market

35

00:02:18.060  -->  00:02:22.560
spend and state and bear in mind that the come the venture capitalist fund is not looking to invest

36

00:02:22.560  -->  00:02:28.470
in these 50 companies per se it's not just giving you a data set and then like obviously and then they

37

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:31.120
would invest in this one because it's got the highest profit profit.

38

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:38.100
But what they're looking for is there this is a sample and they want to understand for instance where

39

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:43.860
companies perform better in New York or California all other things held equal or which companies perform

40

00:02:43.860  -->  00:02:46.210
better if you hold these columns equal.

41

00:02:46.270  -->  00:02:46.690
Right.

42

00:02:46.740  -->  00:02:51.300
Will a company that spends more on marketing perform better or a company spends less on marketing.

43

00:02:51.300  -->  00:02:57.000
Also they want to understand the main thing probably and what I understand is how when they assess companies

44

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:03.080
do they look for companies to spend more on R&D spend or on research and development or companies that

45

00:03:03.080  -->  00:03:04.370
spend more on marketing.

46

00:03:04.370  -->  00:03:11.970
So which of these two spends yields better results of profit brings more results of profit.

47

00:03:12.420  -->  00:03:18.480
And based on your model that you'll create they will have a They'll set up a set of guidelines for their

48

00:03:18.480  -->  00:03:23.700
own venture capitalist fund and they'll be like OK so we are more interested in companies this is just

49

00:03:23.700  -->  00:03:30.180
an example that work in New York or operate in New York and that have a very low administration spend

50

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:32.450
and a very high R&D spend which.

51

00:03:32.550  -->  00:03:37.140
So the R&D spend has to be much higher than Administration marking spend something like that.

52

00:03:37.140  -->  00:03:45.420
So basically you're helping them create a model based off of this sample that will allow them to assess

53

00:03:45.750  -->  00:03:52.530
where and in which into which companies they want to invest to achieve their goal of maximizing profit

54

00:03:52.540  -->  00:03:52.960
.

55

00:03:53.370  -->  00:03:58.940
So there you go it's it's already not an obvious daughter so he's got many variables got many records

56

00:03:58.950  -->  00:04:01.030
you can't just tell off the top of your head you can.

57

00:04:01.080  -->  00:04:03.440
You probably can see that they're ordered by profit here right.

58

00:04:03.450  -->  00:04:05.980
But there is kind of a mix all over the place.

59

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:11.040
So let's get into this is going to be a fun and exciting section and I look forward to seeing you on

60

00:04:11.040  -->  00:04:11.840
the first tutorial.
