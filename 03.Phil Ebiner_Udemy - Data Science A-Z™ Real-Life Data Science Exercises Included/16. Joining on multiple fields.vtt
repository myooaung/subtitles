00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:01.290
Hello and welcome back.

2

00:00:01.290  -->  00:00:05.640
Today we'll be talking about joining on multiple fields to start off with this tutorial.

3

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:11.550
I will show you an example when it is necessary to join on multiple fields and I will show you what

4

00:00:11.550  -->  00:00:15.340
happens when you accidentally forget about joining on multiple fields.

5

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:21.840
And finally we will look at how we can rectify the situation and actually in fact join on several fields

6

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:24.070
to get the right result.

7

00:00:24.330  -->  00:00:26.560
So let's get straight into it.

8

00:00:26.790  -->  00:00:33.340
Here we've got two tables table and table B Table A lists the orders that were conducted in our two

9

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:38.790
stores which are north and south as you can see we had two orders in the north store order number one

10

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.290
and Order Number two.

11

00:00:40.470  -->  00:00:44.680
And in the soft store we had only order number one.

12

00:00:44.880  -->  00:00:47.970
And also it lists the customers Mike Jack and Susan.

13

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:52.250
Table B lists the itemized description of those orders.

14

00:00:52.260  -->  00:00:59.130
So we've also got the store location we've got the order number and we've got the item within that order

15

00:00:59.130  -->  00:01:01.200
and the sale made on that item.

16

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:07.530
So here you can see right away that order number one in the Norton store had two items sold a laptop

17

00:01:07.560  -->  00:01:13.260
and a mass order number two had one item which was the montor and Order Number one in the salad and

18

00:01:13.260  -->  00:01:16.810
store had only one item which was a camera.

19

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:25.970
So now we want to connect the two tables and basically what we're after is we want to see how the sales

20

00:01:25.970  -->  00:01:30.060
that we're made for each of the customers the total sales for each of the customers.

21

00:01:30.090  -->  00:01:34.430
So visually you can see right away how that works but let's see how we can do it through joint.

22

00:01:34.500  -->  00:01:36.980
So if we were to go ahead and do a left join.

23

00:01:36.980  -->  00:01:40.440
So basically we want to attach the table in the right to the table left.

24

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:48.880
And if we were to just do a normal left join using one field we would try to join on order number.

25

00:01:48.990  -->  00:01:54.330
So here if we want to match order number in the table to the right table it will look something like

26

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:59.520
this order number one will be matched to order number one in the first row of the right table in the

27

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:00.080
second row.

28

00:02:00.120  -->  00:02:06.660
And in the fourth row and as we can see that's already incorrect because we're matching order number

29

00:02:06.660  -->  00:02:11.340
one from the north and store to order number one from the Soudan store.

30

00:02:11.590  -->  00:02:16.500
Via this third match but let's let's see what happens further down.

31

00:02:16.500  -->  00:02:22.740
So now if now order number 2 from the northern store will be matched toward Number two that's because

32

00:02:22.740  -->  00:02:26.550
there's only one order number two in both of those tables.

33

00:02:26.760  -->  00:02:32.070
And then order number one from the south and the store will actually be matched to three rows in the

34

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:37.530
second table which are Order Number one Ordon from the northern store.

35

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:40.300
Then the second item from Order Number one unknown store.

36

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:45.750
And finally the only item from or number one in the southern store.

37

00:02:46.110  -->  00:02:49.590
So in total the result in table will look like this.

38

00:02:49.650  -->  00:02:54.700
We will have three rows for North or number one.

39

00:02:54.750  -->  00:02:58.710
One row for North order number two and three rows for south.

40

00:02:58.740  -->  00:03:00.130
Order number one.

41

00:03:00.300  -->  00:03:02.790
And as you can see this is a mistake.

42

00:03:02.800  -->  00:03:06.540
There's an error because this highly inflates our sales.

43

00:03:06.540  -->  00:03:12.630
It looks like we've sold two laptops it looks like we're sold two mice and two cameras whereas in fact

44

00:03:12.660  -->  00:03:13.810
that's not true.

45

00:03:14.010  -->  00:03:19.940
So joining on a single field here can lead to incorrect results.

46

00:03:19.950  -->  00:03:21.260
So let's see how we can fix that.

47

00:03:21.540  -->  00:03:28.260
What we need to do and this you can see naturally from these tables is we have to include information

48

00:03:28.260  -->  00:03:29.980
about the store in our joint.

49

00:03:30.120  -->  00:03:37.950
So we know that the order numbers are unique for each store and so therefore if we include the store

50

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:40.770
in our joint then we will avoid this whole problem.

51

00:03:40.770  -->  00:03:42.160
So let's see how that works.

52

00:03:42.180  -->  00:03:47.430
At the on the top left here and circled in red you can see that we're joining on order number from table

53

00:03:47.490  -->  00:03:53.580
a equals order number from table beat and store from table a Eco's store from table B.

54

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:55.800
Let's see how this works.

55

00:03:55.860  -->  00:04:05.310
In fact here we've got the North order number one been matched to two rows in the second table.

56

00:04:05.310  -->  00:04:10.620
So North order number one which is the laptop and North order number 1 which is the mass and that's

57

00:04:10.620  -->  00:04:17.850
correct next door to number two from the northern store is matched to only one row in the second table

58

00:04:17.850  -->  00:04:22.980
which is the monitor for the north in order number two which is also correct.

59

00:04:22.980  -->  00:04:29.580
And finally the solve them number one order is matched to only one row in the second table because there's

60

00:04:29.610  -->  00:04:36.120
only one row that contains both the word south and the number one for the order and that is the camera

61

00:04:36.210  -->  00:04:37.590
for that Susan.

62

00:04:37.740  -->  00:04:44.440
So now if we perform that join then the final result in table will look like this.

63

00:04:44.490  -->  00:04:52.200
And as you can see here the one row in the table on the left was duplicated to match the quantity of

64

00:04:52.200  -->  00:04:54.650
items which was two items bought by Mike.

65

00:04:54.690  -->  00:05:00.540
And so in total you can see that this time we've got the correct result.

66

00:05:00.570  -->  00:05:07.740
We can also assess how much each customer has bought and there are no mistakes because of an incorrect

67

00:05:07.740  -->  00:05:08.150
turn.

68

00:05:08.160  -->  00:05:13.700
So that was a good example of how to use and joins in multiple fields.

69

00:05:13.740  -->  00:05:18.150
And more importantly why you need to do that in certain cases to avoid errors.

70

00:05:18.150  -->  00:05:21.420
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
