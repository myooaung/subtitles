00:00:00,570  -->  00:00:05,970
Confusion matrix don't just of these terms sometimes that they come up with like why would you call

2

00:00:05,970  -->  00:00:10,860
something the confusion matrix when it's designed to explain things.

3

00:00:10,870  -->  00:00:14,940
Anyway let's get into the confusion matrix.

4

00:00:14,940  -->  00:00:22,320
So last time we left off over here where we discussed false positives and false negatives type 1 errors

5

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:23,290
and type 2 hours.

6

00:00:23,310  -->  00:00:28,770
So the false positive is when you predict that something will happen but it actually doesn't happen

7

00:00:28,970  -->  00:00:34,440
and that's a type 1 error and a false negative is when you predict that something won't happen.

8

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:38,110
But it does actually happen and there's a type 2 here.

9

00:00:38,490  -->  00:00:41,420
So let's see what we can do with these.

10

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:47,430
Let's start building a matrix and we'll understand what it is exactly saying as we go along with it

11

00:00:47,450  -->  00:00:47,640
.

12

00:00:47,820  -->  00:00:55,320
So we've got the y hat at the top of the predicted dependent variable so whether or not we're saying

13

00:00:55,320  -->  00:01:05,970
that event will happen at the top and on the left we've got the y y actual dependent variable so there

14

00:01:06,550  -->  00:01:10,940
it's telling us whether or not that event actually did happen.

15

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:14,590
Now under each one of them let's put the two different options that are available.

16

00:01:14,940  -->  00:01:21,200
You can have a 0 or 1 so 0 for Y had one for Y had 0 for y and 1 for Y.

17

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:25,410
And in that space between them there's four more squares there.

18

00:01:25,440  -->  00:01:27,370
That's where our confusion matrix will be.

19

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:30,980
So we'll start off the first square right away here.

20

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:38,830
That's is the intersection of when y had is 1 so we're predicting something will happen or the person

21

00:01:38,910  -->  00:01:41,440
will take up the offer or the event will occur.

22

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:44,620
And at the same time it actually did happen.

23

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:53,970
So let's say for instance we had 50 observations in or out of our observations the ones that we said

24

00:01:54,060  -->  00:01:56,500
will happen and actually did happen.

25

00:01:56,500  -->  00:01:57,880
There's 50.

26

00:01:58,110  -->  00:02:01,180
Now let's look at the ones that didn't happen.

27

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:03,020
And we also said that they won't happen.

28

00:02:03,020  -->  00:02:05,890
So basically we said that won't happen and they actually didn't happen.

29

00:02:06,090  -->  00:02:10,100
So let's say that in there we have three five.

30

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:17,810
So 35 of the observations and say we have a hundred and fifty of them actually did happen.

31

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:19,980
And our prediction was that will happen.

32

00:02:19,980  -->  00:02:22,490
And 35 five of them they didn't happen.

33

00:02:22,500  -->  00:02:25,670
But we also said that they won't happen based on our model.

34

00:02:25,980  -->  00:02:28,200
Now let's look at the other two squares.

35

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:35,430
So can you guess from here which one is the false positives and which ones are false negatives.

36

00:02:35,430  -->  00:02:36,740
I'll give you a second to do it.

37

00:02:36,750  -->  00:02:39,850
You can post a video if you want to try.

38

00:02:39,840  -->  00:02:41,260
Try this on your own.

39

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:48,720
So the false positives are the type 1 error are at the top on the right because a type 1 error is when

40

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:51,720
you're saying that something will happen but actually doesn't happen.

41

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:57,200
I remember the way the way I remembered is it's not as bad as saying that something won't happen and

42

00:02:57,210  -->  00:02:58,870
actually does happen.

43

00:02:58,980  -->  00:03:02,300
Although that might not necessarily be the case but it's an easy way to remember it.

44

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:07,710
So that's how Type 1 era it's up at the top over there on the right now on the left at the bottom we've

45

00:03:07,710  -->  00:03:11,450
got the false negative for the type 2 era when we were saying that something won't happen.

46

00:03:11,460  -->  00:03:14,100
But it actually does happen.

47

00:03:14,100  -->  00:03:17,630
And let's say we had 10 and five in them respectively.

48

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:24,420
So this is your confusion matrix and what it's telling you is it's giving you a quick overview of how

49

00:03:24,420  -->  00:03:26,200
well your model is performing.

50

00:03:26,220  -->  00:03:34,080
If you look at the diagonal the last what it won't be colored probably in in your report that you'll

51

00:03:34,080  -->  00:03:34,740
be studying.

52

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:38,720
But if you look at the top left in the bottom right just if you just remember that.

53

00:03:38,760  -->  00:03:41,280
That way those are the good things.

54

00:03:41,280  -->  00:03:44,240
So in total that's how much you predicted correctly.

55

00:03:44,460  -->  00:03:49,140
And the other diagonal so the top right and the bottom left those are the bad things those those are

56

00:03:49,140  -->  00:03:52,030
the observations that you weren't able to predict those are your errors.

57

00:03:52,200  -->  00:03:57,360
So the more you have in the first diagonal the better the more you have in the second Agel the worse

58

00:03:57,930  -->  00:03:59,130
you Mallos performing.

59

00:03:59,400  -->  00:04:03,420
And let's have a look at two ratios that you can calculate.

60

00:04:03,420  -->  00:04:10,080
So one the first rate is the accuracy rate and you take the correct predicted divide by total.

61

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:16,890
In our case we predicted correctly 85 the total is 100 so if we do the 500 we get an 85 percent accuracy

62

00:04:16,890  -->  00:04:17,310
rate.

63

00:04:17,550  -->  00:04:22,650
And you can tell it right away just by looking at the confusion matrix especially if you know the total

64

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:28,200
number of observations right away so you don't have to do a calculation and add up all the values in

65

00:04:28,200  -->  00:04:30,190
the Matrix.

66

00:04:30,360  -->  00:04:32,220
That way you can just divide by 100.

67

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:39,240
But even by looking at the confusion metrics you can quickly understand what the accuracy rate is and

68

00:04:39,240  -->  00:04:40,180
also the error rate.

69

00:04:40,170  -->  00:04:47,820
So you take the total that you were wrong about and you divide by the entire total So in this case it's

70

00:04:48,780  -->  00:04:50,080
15 to 100.

71

00:04:50,100  -->  00:04:52,530
It's 15 percent error rate.

72

00:04:52,530  -->  00:04:56,550
That's all for today we'll be using the confusion matrix in our next tutorial.
