00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.145
Welcome back guys. This video is all about creating the search template.

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:08.940
A few videos ago when we created the sidebar widget,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.070
we also added a search box.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
If you search for something in the search box,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.715
such as news, you can see that it should work pretty much straight outside the box.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.360
There's nothing we really need to do to make that work.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.810
But one thing we can do is give our theme a custom search template because at the moment,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.935
it's just default back to the index page.

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:36.440
Which is why we've got the pretty similar layout to the blog.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.450
Which is fine for now because we want the search page to look like the blog.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.360
But we'll create a custom template so we can add

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
the feature text at the top and we'll also show

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.930
the term in the feature section that the user researched

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.645
for and also print out a statement in case there has been no search results found.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.100
over to the Text Editor, new page,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.270
save as a search.php.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.860
It looks pretty similar to the blog page.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.575
Copy the contents of the index page to get started, and paste that in.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:24.460
Just to check that the search template is actually working and it's overriding

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.530
the index page just type in some random text in there and save and then refresh.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.380
There we go. we can just see that the text that we created is at

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.745
the top there and this means that the template is taking effect.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:43.920
We're going to move that now.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.285
Pretty much all the work we need to do now for this template is in the functions page,

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:53.800
because we are going to be working in the header section to create the feature text.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.970
Go over to the functions.php and then below the 404,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.550
we'll add another elseif statements just on the curly brace there.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.100
So elseif is_search.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.910
At the very top of the text,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.855
we'll just do a Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:29.980
Copy that and then paste that in and let's see if that's working.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:42.660
Below that we'll add a break tag and a semicolon at the end there.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.925
Then underneath this we're going to print out

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.240
the search results or the search term that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.630
the user has searched for and instead of echoing this to the browser,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.040
we're going to use printf and then

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.105
in the brackets we're going to start by typing some plain text.

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:06.030
search results for and then the colon.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.840
Then to show in the results of the search query use

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.600
the percent and the s and then put a comma after this section,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.600
and then use the get_search_query function,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.850
so get_search_query and this whole thing needs to be surrounded by brackets.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.445
So one before, one at the very end with a semicolon.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:38.240
The reason why we're using printf instead of the echo is because we use it in

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.920
formatting in the search results and printf allows us to do that.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.170
Save that and check if it's working by hitting "Refresh".

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.170
You can try this a few more times to check it's working.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.620
we've got the news as the current search term,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.930
so let's change this to hair and that seems to be working fine.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:09.180
I'll do one more. I'm not going to post that,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.600
so we'll just check Lorem the Lorem Ipsum and we should get lots of post for this.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.205
That's all working fine. If you notice when we search for something before such as hair,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:28.395
we got the error message of sorry no posts matched your criteria.

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:34.310
We want to make this a little bit more specific to the search rather than the posts.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.710
Go over to the search.php and then scroll down to the bottom,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.210
and so we find the error message there,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.175
so just delete that and instead we'll add our own custom message of sorry,

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:58.425
no matches for and then it's pulling the word that the user searched for.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.560
We'll just add onto the end there the function

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:11.595
of get_search_query and then the dot to concatenate,

00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:15.090
small text onto that so start by opening up the quotes

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.340
again and a comma of please search again.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.030
Let's save that and take a look.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.195
There's an error message there so let's take a look at that.

00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:35.655
It was a spelling mistake there,

00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:38.830
that should be get_search_query.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.650
Now that's working we've got the error message.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.600
Sorry, no matches for,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.595
I'll just need to the space after the word for and then refresh.

00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:56.475
For hair, please search again.

00:05:56.475 --> 00:06:01.909
Thanks for watching, and that's how we create a custom search page in WordPress.
