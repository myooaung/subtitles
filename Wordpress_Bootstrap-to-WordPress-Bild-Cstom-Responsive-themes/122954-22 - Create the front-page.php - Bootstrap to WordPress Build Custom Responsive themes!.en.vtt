00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.140
Welcome back everybody. In this video,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.795
we are going to be taking a look at how WordPress deals with

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:12.570
templates and hierarchy system for selecting which template to use.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.265
We head over to Google and we search for WordPress template hierarchy.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.340
The first link that comes up should be the one that you need.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.270
If we select that, so we'd be taken

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.290
over to the WordPress website and if we just scroll down,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.020
we can find the list of the templates that WordPress

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.535
recognizes and I'll give you an idea of how WordPress uses this.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.480
There's a visual diagram which we'll take a look at in just a moment.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.340
But if we scroll a little bit further down the page,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.110
we can find out some more details about how WordPress deals with templates.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.000
By default, WordPress uses the front page or the home page to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.920
display the latest blog posts and that's really not what we want for this design.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.880
In our Bootstrap design,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.995
we've got a front page and then we keep our blog post separate in its own blog page.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.370
We need to change our WordPress theme,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.230
we need to use the front-page.php as our new home page.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.890
In this video, we'll be taking the contents of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.740
the index page and we'll be creating the front-page.php.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.450
We'll then use our index page to be the default page

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.140
for displaying blog posts or WordPress content.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.340
Scrolling down, you'll get an idea to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.470
some of the templates that we're building in this course.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.960
There's a template for the single post which has

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.035
the index page as a fallback template if none of these exist,

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:44.210
we'll also create a page template which WordPress will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.500
use if it can't find a more specific template.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.610
Again, if none of these can be found,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.730
it will default back to the index page and there's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.210
various of a custom templates we can build.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.260
We'll look at them later on in the course.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.245
If you want to take a look at the visual overview

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:07.700
which gives you a nice visual diagram of how WordPress deals with templates,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.320
what templates it looks for in a more particular order.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.970
Let's get started creating our new front page.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.640
If you go back into the WordPress dashboard

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.339
and then on the dashboard on the left if you go down to pages,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.070
I'm just going to delete the sample page, we don't need that.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.025
Then we're going to click ''Add New.''

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:37.600
We're simply going to call this page home and then click on "Publish."

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.720
Then head over to the text editor and we'll create

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.005
the front-page.php that we looked up before.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.080
First of all, go into the index page,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.380
select all and copy and then Command N or

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.805
Control N to create a new page and then paste that in,

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:01.210
and then save that straight away as front-page.php.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.320
This is now going to be our front page of the website.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.265
We can delete all the content in the index page,

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:18.325
everything between the get header and get footer tags right to the very bottom.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:21.225
Just select all the content,

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.735
and then scroll down and delete,

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:28.050
leaving just the header and the footer.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.860
We'll just save this page for now and we'll come back to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.170
this in the next video where we'll start creating

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.795
the WordPress loop to loop through all the contents of the blog posts, so save.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:44.434
Then if you go back over to the dashboard and then on the settings,

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:47.610
select the "Reading tab."

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.295
If we go to the front page which is at the top,

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:55.670
we mentioned at the start of this video that by default,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.900
WordPress uses the front page to display the latest blog posts.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.500
We're going to change that to be a static page.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.805
I'm going to change that to the homepage to be created.

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:09.675
I will change that and then click on ''Save changes.''

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:13.020
Hopefully that should be all working again.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.520
Click on ''Visit Site'' refresh and now it seems to be working fine.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.430
We just got a few menu links at the top,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.800
so I'm just going to get rid of those now.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.060
Back into appearance on menus,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.445
we can delete the sample page.

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:40.545
We don't need that in the menu and also the homepage link and then save the menu.

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:43.680
Then back to our front page,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.780
so it's all working again.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.240
Thanks for watching. I will see you in the next video.
