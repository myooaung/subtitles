00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.665
I'm going to show you how to make our sidebar more modular by adding WordPress widgets.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:14.115
A sidebar widget is essentially just one of the blocks that we've already created,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.140
but we're going to put it into WordPress.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720
That gives the site administrator the chance to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.440
reorganize and change things about in sidebar if they want.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.045
The way to get started,

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:30.870
is if we go over to the Codecs and if we look for the section on Wigdetizing Themes.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.860
It's pretty easy to get the widgets working in our theme.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.655
At the minute, if we go over to the Dashboard,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.390
and then if we go into the Appearance,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.400
there's currently no option for the widgets.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.805
We going to change that by adding it to our functions file.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:52.235
If we look for the section on how to register a widget area,

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.720
and then copy the sample code,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.950
and then go over to the functions.php.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.925
I'm going to paste this in just before the feature text function. Paste that in there.

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:11.960
We don't need the php tags because they are already at star on

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.390
the end of the functions file. We can remove them.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.015
Then it's just a case of changing some of the values,

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:24.665
so the name of our sidebar is going to be sidebar.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.310
Then the ID, we can change it to anything we

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.285
want because we used the sidebar in the block section on this side,

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.820
I'm going to call it the sidebar.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.550
I'm going to call this a blog. Then when

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.655
it's a WordPress what goes before and after the widget.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.605
If you go into the sidebar.php,

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:49.285
and what we're basically doing is replacing these sidebar modules.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:52.340
We need to tell WordPress all the content within

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.030
these modules is surrounded by the div with a class of sidebar module.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.350
Let's change the div before the widget to have the class equal

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.870
to sidebar module, and this is the closing div.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.020
Now that's fine. Then before and after the title,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.400
we go back into the sidebar.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.830
The title as a h4 or level 4 heading.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.360
Change before title to be h4,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.780
and then h4 after the title and then save that.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.625
If you go back over to the WordPress codecs,

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:40.340
and then scroll down to the how to display new widget areas,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.020
we need to copy the sample code and paste it into our sidebar.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.850
Copy this section. In fact,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.925
I'm just going to copy all without the php tags.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:56.535
Copy and go to the sidebar.php,

00:02:56.535 --> 00:03:02.190
and then scroll to the very top and paste this in just before all the rest of the code.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.990
We give our sidebar the ID of sidebar_blog.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.935
Change it to areas where the home right is.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:17.080
We'll change this to sidebar_blog,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.080
and the same at the bottom, we'll change it to sidebar_blog too.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.400
Then save that. Now if we go back into

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.905
the Dashboard and hit "Refresh," you should see that when we go to the Appearance,

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.290
we've now got a widgets option.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.560
Select that. Now we can see a list of all the available widgets,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.450
and we can also make custom ones.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.710
All we need to do is just drag these over to the sidebar,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.075
and most of the widgets we add they're going to be the custom ones,

00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:53.175
so that they're the same as our bootstrap site.

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:55.860
But the first we want to add is a search box.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.950
We haven't got a search box in the site yet,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.100
so why not use a pre-made widget?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.375
Simply drag the search box on to the sidebar,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.670
and I'm going to create the About Us widget.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.250
We'll do that with the text box.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.330
Drag the text over to the sidebar.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.780
The title for this was About.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.460
For the content, we can copy the text from the sidebar.php.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.280
Copy all the tags,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.410
then paste them in there.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.300
We don't need the p tag so we can remove those.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.515
I want to close in p tag there.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:52.325
Save those, and select "Automatically Add Paragraphs."

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.605
We can close that one down now,

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:57.280
and also the Search box.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.760
Before we go any further,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.755
let's just check out the site,

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:02.840
and see if it's all working okay.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.705
Head over to the blog. It looks as though we've got error in the sidebar.php.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:19.050
Head over to the sidebar.php and it's on line 5.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.205
That looks we're just missing some php opening, closing tags.

00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:27.460
At the top, open up the php,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.530
and then that much is the closed inside there.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.670
With starting the tag, closing and starting tag there.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.640
We just need to close that off and save,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.505
and that should be okay now, so refresh.

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:45.185
Good. Now we've got the Search box in the sidebar.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:47.885
We've got the About Us section showing twice.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:58.870
Go into the sidebar and delete the sidebar module for the About Us section and save.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.245
Now we're just left with the About Us widget.

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:07.800
Next we'll do the archives and the categories.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.515
Back into WordPress, into the Dashboard, Appearance and Widgets.

00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:20.920
WordPress makes it really easy for us at the archives and categories.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.885
You can see on the left the archives and categories has already been created for us.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:30.050
Drag in the archives and give it title.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.870
Then save, and do the same with the categories.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.790
Drop the end just below.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:48.460
Give it a title of categories, and save.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.215
Then we can delete these now from our footer.

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.864
The sidebar module for archives,

00:06:55.864 --> 00:07:03.700
I can go and also for the categories, we're going to do that too.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.290
Lastly, we will do the Followers section,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.505
this is going to be a text widget like the About Us section.

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:14.145
While we are in the sidebar, let's copy the content.

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:18.710
We need to copy the font of some icons for Facebook,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.420
Google, Pinterest, and YouTube. Cut them out.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:29.590
I can actually just delete the module now, and save that.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.030
Back into the widgets,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.460
drag one more text box into the sidebar.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.610
The title is Followers.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.110
Paste in the content and hit "Save."

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.040
Then back into the blog and check, it's all working.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.195
Good with the Search, the About,

00:07:57.195 --> 00:08:01.380
the Archives, Categories and the social media section.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.035
Great. A lot of these sidebar looks pretty much the same as before,

00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:08.920
it's now a lot more modular and it allows the logged in user

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.570
or the site administrator to be able to change the about or add new widgets.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.150
That's pretty much everything done do this bit.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.089
I just want to add a little bit of CSS,

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:20.425
particularly for the Search box

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:23.375
just because the Search button needs a little bit of room.

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:26.510
I will also make the Search box look more like

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.265
the input buttons that we used in the Bootstrap website.

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:33.630
Let's go over to the style.css,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.970
and then copy a comments.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.470
Then we'll make a sidebar section.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.085
Just above the mobile styling,

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:49.530
change the comment to be sidebar.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:59.230
Each one of the sidebar modules has a class of sidebar module. We'll start with that.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.765
The class of sidebar module,

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:07.530
and then we'll start with the input.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.505
To space out, we are going to have some margin of 10 pixels.

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:22.935
I'll set the maximum width to be 100 percent.

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:25.960
Save and take a look.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.010
Now there's a little bit of spacing around the inputs.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.155
Next we need to get the ID of the class for the input button.

00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:42.540
Go into the developer tools and then select

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.810
the magnifying glass, and click there.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.780
We can see that we've got the ID of searchsubmit,

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.140
and then back over to the style sheet.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.140
Create the ID. In fact,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.445
instead of putting the styles or duplicating the styles in the sidebar,

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:05.825
we'll just add these,

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:07.915
open the global section.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.560
If we look for the styles for the button,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.095
Default, we're going to be using the exact same styles for this.

00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:16.585
We can also add this onto the end.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:24.335
The ID was searchsubmit, and then save that.

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.640
We'll also add the hover.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:34.115
ID of searchsubmit, and then hover.

00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:39.095
Save that, then refresh.

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:43.010
Now that's working, so we've got the same styling for the button,

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.355
and hover works too.

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:51.660
That goes, that's all working and that's how you add custom widgets to WordPress themes.
