00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.900
Now, we're going to make our head section and

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.560
the footer more dynamic, WordPress-friendly.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
Back in a text editor if you go to the header.php file.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.765
At the moment, we've only got static HTML.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:21.045
We'll want to make this dynamic by adding some WordPress functions and some PHP.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.285
Let's start by making the language dynamic.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:27.735
Rather than having the language at the top,

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:35.950
we're going to open up the PHP tags in exactly the same way as we had done before.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.765
Then within the PHP,

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.399
we're going to add language_attributes,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.710
and then because it's a function,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.760
we use the brackets and the semi-colon,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.665
and this allows WordPress to add the language dynamically,

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:59.480
and then next we're going to add the character set dynamically.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.860
Rather than having the character set equal to UTF-8,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.660
we can allow WordPress to do this dynamically.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.670
Again, the PHP opening and closing tags.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860
Now, if you want to copy these and paste them in rather than retyping you can do.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.345
I'm going to use the bloginfo function,

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:26.270
and then inside the brackets,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.850
and then we add the charset back in between the quotations,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.465
and then a semicolon at the end.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:38.255
Now, be careful when typing the PHP functions out

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:42.245
because as you've seen in the last video with the debugging,

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.920
if we just have one character mistyped or out of place,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.275
the chances are that you're going to get a white screen,

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:53.565
so be careful of that, and then rather than our static Tranquil Spa title,

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.820
let's change that to allow WordPress to include that.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.220
Again, between the PHP tags,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.100
we can add the WordPress title with wp_title,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.715
and then inside the brackets,

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:10.265
just leave the empty quotation marks,

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.860
and then the semicolon at the end,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.525
and then scroll down just before the closing head just at the end there.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.625
If we just find the line just before,

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.680
and then I'm not going to include the wp_head function,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.770
which basically allows WordPress to add

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.640
scripts to data back into the head section when it needs to.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.490
Again, between the PHP tags typing wp_head,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.290
then the brackets and the semicolon.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.235
Then in the opening body tag,

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.890
we can add the WordPress body class.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.465
Between the PHP, we use the body_class function,

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.915
and the brackets and the semicolon,

00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:02.565
and then WordPress will add the body_class into the right section.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.655
Let's scroll down to the header section.

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:09.140
The next thing we're going to change is the Tranquil Spa.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.595
The Tranquil Spa link is the one at the top left of the homepage,

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:18.210
which is our logo section and our link back to the homepage.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.305
There's two pieces of PHP we need to include here.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:25.325
I'm just going to get rid of the sidebar for now just to give us some more room.

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:29.495
First of all, we need to change the name of the website,

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:31.205
which is Tranquil Spa.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:35.405
We need to include the PHP to make this name dynamic.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:40.150
Paste in the PHP opening and closing tags,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.520
and I'll put it on a separate line just so it's more clear.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.255
There we go. Between the PHP.

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:54.620
PHP uses the echo name to echo the contents of the browser,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.470
and then we use the WordPress function of get_bloginfo.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.520
The bloginfo we want is the name of the site.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.305
Put in naming there and the semicolon at the end.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:17.345
Now, WordPress is generally in the name of our website,

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:18.890
which is Tranquil Spa.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.500
That's going to be the text which appears in the top left-hand corner where the logo is.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.790
But we need to make this text an active link.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.290
Because we don't have an index.html anymore,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.190
because we're using PHP.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.620
We need to tell WordPress to link this name back to our home_url.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.305
Again, we'll do that between the PHP tags, and then echo.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:47.930
There's a couple of different ways that we can do this in WordPress.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.160
But I'm going to use the escape URL,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.620
which sanitizes the URL and make sure that there's no malicious code in there.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.905
Echo esc_url.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:03.135
Then in the brackets afterwards,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:06.130
we're going to put the link to the home_url.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.555
Then the opening and closing curly brackets again,

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:13.625
and then the semicolon.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.040
There's our two pieces of PHP.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.180
The first one provides the link to the home_url,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.355
and the second one provides the name of the website.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:27.465
Then back up to the head section.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:31.795
We are going to add the CSS links in a slightly different way.

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:38.180
If we delete the link for the Custom CSS and also the Bootstrap CSS.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.730
We'll add those back in in the functions file in just a moment.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.770
Save that and then open up our sidebar and head over to the footer.php.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.960
There's not a lot we need to deal with the footer.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.180
One of the things we want to change is the year.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.240
Because we want this to change dynamically each year,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.650
we can add some PHP to the bottom of here.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.150
Rather than having 2015 hard-coded,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.900
we can echo out to the browser the date.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.915
Then between the brackets,

00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:14.105
we can put the capital Y,

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.855
which is the way PHP adds the year.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:22.410
Using PHP, you can also add the days and the months in various formats.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.365
We'll look into that in more detail when we do the blog posts.

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.940
Then right at the very bottom of the page,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.985
and then just before the closing body tag.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:35.420
In here, we're going to add another PHP function,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.930
which is the wp_footer.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.310
This allows WordPress to add scripted data to the footer section.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.695
Save that. Then we can delete the Bootstrap JavaScript.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:57.105
We'll link this with the CSS in the functions file.

00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:00.719
Because WordPress already comes with jQuery,

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.040
we can delete this too.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.865
Tie this up a little bit and then hit "Save".

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:18.855
Now, we've taken out the CSS of the header section and the scripts of the footer section.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:22.790
We need to allow WordPress to add these back into the website.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.240
We're going to do this in the way the WordPress recommends by enqueuing the scripts.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.170
The way we do that is if we go to the functions.php.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.300
If you go to the bottom section after the add_action,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.770
make sure you're still within the PHP tags.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.060
Let's create a new PHP function.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:52.290
This one is going to be called tranquil_scripts.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.640
Then the brackets, and then afterwards the curly braces.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.585
Just add a comment in here so we know exactly what we're doing.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:11.820
This section is going to be adding the styles to the function.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.325
To properly add these back into the theme,

00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:25.660
we need to use the WordPress or wp_enqueue_style.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.310
Then within the curly brackets,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.380
and also between the quotes,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.425
we're going to give the first style sheet a name.

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:36.230
This is the bootstrap-core,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.330
then separated by a comma.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.275
The second parameter we need to include is the file path to the Bootstrap CSS.

00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:50.165
Let's add this in WordPress.

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:54.690
We type in get_template_directory_uri,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.410
and then the brackets.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.225
Then we add the file path by using the dot.

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:13.950
Then within the quotes, we add the link to our bootstrap file, so

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.940
/CSS/bootstrap.min.css. Then a semicolon at the end.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.130
We'll just get rid of a sidebar for now.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.325
In here, we're giving the style sheet a name.

00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:34.225
Then we're adding the template directory.

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:36.424
Then adding to the template directory,

00:09:36.424 --> 00:09:39.155
the file path for the CSS.

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:44.480
Because we got a Bootstrap CSS and we have also got the Custom CSS.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.180
We can just copy this and then paste it straight in below.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.980
We just need to change the name and the file path.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.890
This is for our custom file.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.670
Then we also include get_template_directory.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.355
Then we need to change the file path.

00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:10.475
Because our custom style sheet is in a document root rather than the CSS folder,

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:15.570
we can just change this to style.css.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.645
Then we do a very similar thing to add the scripts back in.

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:26.015
Add comments of add scripts.

00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:28.485
It's JavaScript back in,

00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:31.785
it works in a similar way to the stylesheet.

00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:35.240
We just copy this link and paste it in.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.630
But this time, instead of enqueue style,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.530
we enqueue the script.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.775
Then we add the name of the start.

00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:47.920
I'm going to call this the bootstrap-js.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.365
We use get_template_directory in the same way.

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:58.720
But this time the file path is in our JS folder.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.980
Don't forget the forward slash before.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.300
Then we need to link this to the bootstrap minified version.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.780
Bootstrap.min.js.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.800
This replaces the JavaScript from the footer section.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.690
After that add a comma. We've included the script name, the script source.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.065
Now next we need to include any dependencies.

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:29.855
Now, because Bootstrap requires jQuery,

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:33.320
we need to make sure that jQuery loads before Bootstrap.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.540
We do this by adding an array.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.110
Then in brackets we put the name of the dependency,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:46.465
which is jQuery, separated by comma.

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:50.890
The last value I'm going to put in is a Boolean of true.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.880
This enables the scriptable link to the footer section.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.200
In the footer.php, we included the wp_footer function.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.860
Because we added this in,

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.250
WordPress knows exactly where to add the script now.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.180
Now, this function is all set up.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.955
We need to do a similar thing that we did early on.

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:14.410
For the theme setup,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.705
we need to add the action.

00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:21.675
Outside the function, below the last curly brace,

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:27.030
we can paste in the add_action and replace after_theme_setup,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:34.240
we have wp_enqueue_scripts.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:41.605
Then the second parameter is the name of our function, which is tranquil_scripts.

00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:48.165
We can copy that and paste it in and save that.

00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:50.770
Because you've got debugging to be enabled,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.810
if we refresh the browser,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.900
hopefully we shouldn't get any problems.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.955
You can start to see that some things are changing.

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.650
We've got some colors appearing,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.395
which means that the Custom CSS must be linked properly.

00:13:03.395 --> 00:13:07.005
Also the Bootstrap CSS must be linked correctly.

00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:09.935
Because you can see that the grid system,

00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:11.885
such as the free sections,

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:13.655
are set up properly.

00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:16.745
We're missing the images, but we'll take care of those soon.

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.875
That's nothing to worry about.

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:22.745
Lastly, if we just shrink the browser down to a smaller size,

to the mobile or tablet size,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:30.950
we can check that the JavaScript is working by clicking on the drop-down button.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.720
If that's all working fine for you, that's great.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.910
If you've got a drop-down,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.555
that means that the JavaScript is working.

00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:39.890
Congratulations on getting this far,

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.240
and I'll see you in the next video,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.190
where we'll add the WordPress navigation.
