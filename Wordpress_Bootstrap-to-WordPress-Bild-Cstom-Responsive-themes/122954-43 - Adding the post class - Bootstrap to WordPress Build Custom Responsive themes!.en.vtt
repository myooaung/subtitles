00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.550
Welcome back. Our WordPress theme is beginning to take really good shape.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.240
This video is all about making the blog posts even

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.930
more customizable by adding the post class function.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.960
If you want to find out some more information about the post class,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.140
just head over to the WordPress Codex and search for the function of post class.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.770
Well, basically, adding a post class for our theme allows

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.250
the WordPress theme authors to have better CSS control over the posts.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.000
So for example, we can set CSS values for the posts by their ID or by the category name.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.120
So we can maybe have the blog with

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.035
different background colors depending on the category name or the tag.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:46.265
So as an example,

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.380
I'm going to put this into our theme,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.080
and allow styling by the ID.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.600
So currently if we go into our blog,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.135
and if we go into the blog section.

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:00.555
Then if we go into the Chrome Developer tools,

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:03.045
right click Inspect Elements,

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:05.750
and then if we use the magnifying glass,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.875
and if we search for one of the blogs which has the class of blog post,

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:16.240
and then take look, you can see that the div has a class of blog post,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.325
but there's no individual ID.

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:21.714
So if we wanted to style individual posts,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:25.090
we couldn't do that because all the posts have the same class.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.590
So let's add an individual ID to each one of these blog posts.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.180
So I'll just close that down for now,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.000
and then if you go back over to the Codex,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.295
and underneath the usage heading, copy the PHP.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:44.620
Then go to the index page,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.605
and then find the div with the class of blog post,

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:52.080
and then just delete this line,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.660
and then paste in the PHP.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.910
So this will now add a custom ID to each one of the blog posts.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.405
We just deleted the class of blog post.

00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:09.540
So let's add that back in now, and then save that.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.760
Then if we refresh the blog,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.725
and it'll go back into the developer tools,

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:25.990
as we've done before, and then hit the magnifying glass and select the blog post.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.840
Now if you look on the right-hand side,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.235
you can see that the postal has the class of blog post,

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:34.600
but straight after it,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.140
there's now a generated ID.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.190
So if we wanted to style this individual post,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.785
we've now got a reference for the CSS,

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:45.380
and you can use this in a similar way,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.805
if you wanted to use the category name or any of the other values on there.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.520
We'll just head over to the CSS and check this is working okay.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.550
So we've got a blog post ID of 50 there,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.815
and then we shove a unique one below.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:02.825
So this is the post all 40,

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:06.710
and you can see this is 38, 36, 34.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.315
So we'll just head over to the style.css.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.400
Then if you go to the blog section,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.105
we're just going to add one style into here.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:21.020
So the id of post-50,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.480
which is the top one, and to check it's working,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.020
we'll just give it a background color.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.664
Now I'm going to set this to bbb,

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:36.555
and save that, and 50 was the top one.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.595
So I'll hit Refresh.

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:42.570
So there we go. So the background colors changed to gray,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.215
and that's because this has a unique ID.

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:49.920
So therefore the styling will only take place for this blog post.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.805
So hopefully that's give you some ideas of how you can customize and style your theme.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:04:00.000
So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
