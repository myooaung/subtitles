00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.090
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.735
we are going to be finishing off our index page by adding the CSS for the footer section.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:16.000
If we head into our custom CSS and then copy the comments.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.880
Just for the mobile styling section,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.670
we call this the keep in touch section.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.670
The footer section will wrapped in the footer tags.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.045
We're going to add a background color of purple.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.830
To make the text standout,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.140
we'll set the color to be white,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.120
and then change the background color to be purple, which is 97689c.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.060
Next we need to change the divider to be the silver color.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.140
In HTML, we'll change the divider from divider

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.040
purple to be divider silver.png and then,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.635
let's create some space in between the lines for the address and also the list items.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:19.910
Back in the CSS,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.345
we can do that by selecting the footer list items,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:29.550
and also the address section,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.710
and let's increase the line height to be 2ems,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.170
and that gives us a bit more spacing vertically.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.235
The social media icons are a little bit punched up,

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.140
so I'm going to add some margin on

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.190
the right-hand side just to separate them a little bit.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.300
I'll select Font Awesome icons with the i.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.320
Let's add some margin,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.960
on the right-hand side,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.230
15 pixels. That looks a little better.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.240
Then we want to change the background color for the copyright section

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.155
at the bottom and align the text in the center.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:15.020
For the copyright section,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.140
we'll give that an ID of copy.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.545
Let's start by setting the text-align to be center,

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.110
the background color to be white,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:39.015
and we'll set the font color to be 494646,

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:43.964
and the heights of the div to be 60 pixels,

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:51.590
and also set the line height to be 60 pixels to align the text, and then finally,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.720
we'll add some margin to the top of the div,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.485
of 30 pixels, refresh up.

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:06.790
It seems to be working, so we'll just see what the problem is.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.240
I've got the ID of copy.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.360
When it's changed the spelling mistake that back to ID and save

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.530
that and refresh. That's looking better.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.735
We've now got to separate its copyright section at the very bottom of the page.

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:30.020
So next we need to do some work with the list items.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.710
We need to change the color and also remove the bullets from the left-hand side.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.230
We'll do this in the Global section at the top.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.470
Let's add this at the end of the Global section.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.275
First to remove the bullet points,

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:51.479
we'll remove the list-style,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.990
we can set that to none.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.110
Because these are links,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.715
we can select the footer list item link,

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:09.170
and change the color of the link to be white.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.160
Then do the same for the hover state,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.630
footer, li a, and then hover.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:28.130
The hover color is going to be the gray color we've used in the text, so that's 494646.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.400
Let's take a look. It's all working fine, good.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.170
All looks fine for the desktop view,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.330
so let's shrink it down to the mobile view and see if any changes need to be made.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.490
Yeah, we've got some defaults padding on the left hand side,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.105
and we also need to align the text to be in the center.

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:54.175
It will move the default padding,

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:56.220
open the Global section.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.215
Let's do that just above the list items.

00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:06.820
The UL, let's set the padding to be zero,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:16.050
that looks better, and set the text-align down in the media query.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.630
We'll do that in the footer,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.380
text-align to be center.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.005
To separate the address and the footer unordered list,

00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.315
I want to add a border bottom.

00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:40.700
So again, we'll do on the media query,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.775
so footer, unordered list,

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:49.580
and also the address tags.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:00.640
Border-bottom, we'll set at one pixel and the line to be dotted.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.980
Let's take a look. That's looking fine.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.120
If we expand the browser,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.890
everything seems to be working fine.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.010
That's the end of our index page for our bootstrap website.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.440
We've only got a few more pages to do,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.835
such as the blog,

00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:22.340
the contact and page.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.590
Thanks for listening I will see you in the next video.
