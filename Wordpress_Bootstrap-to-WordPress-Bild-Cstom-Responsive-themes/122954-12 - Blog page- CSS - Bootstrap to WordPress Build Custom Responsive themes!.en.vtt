00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
So we've got our blog page all in place now.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.160
So now let's make it look a little bit more like the finished project by adding the CSS.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
So we need to add a divide image below the blog title for each post.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.885
We'll also be adding the outline for each of the individual posts on the sidebar.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:23.675
Now, we'll also be adding some margins and paddings to make it look a little bit better.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.350
So let's get started with the blog post title.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.050
We need to make that look a little bit better and also at the image just below.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.740
So the way we do that,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.200
if we look at each individual post,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.250
the level 2 heading has a class of blog-post-title.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.830
So let's head over to our CSS section.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.485
So let's start with our blog section just below the Keep In Touch section.

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:54.075
So I'll copy the comment and paste that in.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:57.645
We'll call this the Blog section.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.660
So we'll start with the blog-post-title.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.845
So to get the background image just below the level 2 heading,

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:13.910
we can add the background url.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.085
Then in brackets, we're going to put the path to

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:20.120
our divider purple that we've used in the index page.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.400
So we use dot dot.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.245
Then in the Images folder,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.265
we should have the divider purple.png.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:32.100
Then to set the position,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.739
let's add center and with the sidebar,

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.745
and then set the image to be no-repeat.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.740
So let's take a look at that.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.285
So we've got an image now,

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.535
but it's spreading the full width of the level 2 heading.

00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:53.740
So we need to change the positioning.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.245
So first of all, we'll set the height to be

00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:03.600
80 pixels and this is the height of the full div.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.580
So next, we can set the size of the image and we can do this in background size.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:19.870
So set the background size to be 300 pixels wide and 40 pixels high. Let's take a look.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.270
So it's looking a little bit better,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.280
but it's still overlapping the text.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.800
So let's move the background position.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.380
So first of all, we'll set the x position to be center and then the y,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.795
we'll set that to 35 pixels.

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.385
I should push the image down a little bit.

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:46.285
There we go. So now, the image is clear of the level 2 heading.

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:48.910
So next, I'm just going to add a little bit of margin on

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.890
the bottom of the div just to push the text away.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.640
So we'll set the margin bottom of 30 pixels.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.885
Then next, lets add the outline to the post.

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:03.895
So if you look at the finished website,

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:09.325
each individual blog post has got the one-pixel outline with the rounded corners.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.660
So let's do that now.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.915
So if we take a look back in the blog.html,

00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:21.695
you can see that each individual blog post has a class of blog post.

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:27.210
So let's copy that and paste that in.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.400
So first of all, we'll add the border.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:42.090
That's going to be one pixel solid line and the color is going to be 494646.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.010
Let's get the rounded corners,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.870
let's add the border-radius of 10 pixels.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.690
Then next, we'll add some margin.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.500
So to make sure that the blog posts have some spacing on the top and bottom,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.290
we can add a margin of 30 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.895
Then a little bit of padding just inside the div of 20 pixels.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.890
Let's see how that's looking.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.120
So it's looking a lot better now.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.310
So next, we'll move on to the sidebar.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.390
I will make the sidebar modules look a little bit more like the blog posts.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.480
So first of all, let's copy the comment.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.790
This can be the blog sidebar.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.060
So to style the sidebar,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.370
we can use the class of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.460
sidebar module because we're

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.705
going to be using the same style of border that we just used in the blog post.

00:04:52.705 --> 00:05:01.060
We can just copy that CSS and paste that in there. Let's take a look.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.720
There we go. So now the sidebar modules,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.060
now match the styling of the blog posts.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.030
That's it for this video, thanks for watching and I'll see

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.700
you in the next video where we'll be creating the About wall page.
