00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.150
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.845
we are going to be creating the WordPress menu for the footer section.

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:10.200
Currently, if we scroll down to the footer which has got

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.605
the unordered list that we put in in the Bootstrap template,

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:19.380
we want to make the footer menu more dynamic like the menu up the navigation bar.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.175
So let's go into the Dashboard and create a new menu.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:28.239
Head over to Appearance and then Menus,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.470
and then select Create New Menu.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.090
I'm going to call this menu the Footer Menu,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.460
and then create the menu.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.520
On the left, under the Pages tab,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.105
we can select which links we want to add to this menu.

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:51.720
We've not created the About Us page or the Contact Us page yet,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.395
but we can add the Blog and the Latest News.

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:58.890
Select those two and then select Add to Menu,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.650
and the blog just goes above the Latest News.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.185
Save that, and then if we head over to the functions.php,

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:09.285
we can register the menu.

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.390
So back into functions.php,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.610
and then look for the register_nav_menus section that we done early on in the course.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.110
Then underneath this, we need to add the footer menu.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.275
We just copy the primary menu and then paste this in just below.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.235
The nickname is the footer,

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:33.810
and then the menu name is the Footer Menu.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.109
Save that back over to the dashboard,

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.005
and then refresh the menu's page.

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.480
Now the page is refreshed,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.810
make sure you're still in the Footer Menu,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.890
and then select the Footer Menu tab under the Theme Locations and save that.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.360
Then we'll add the navigation walker to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.095
the footer file in the same way as we've done in the head section.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:00.110
So go over to the header.php,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.930
and then if we look for the navigation bar,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.670
which is everything from wp_nav_menu all

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.240
the way down to the closing brackets, which is just there.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.250
So copy that section,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.535
and then go over to the footer.php,

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:24.920
and then look for the navigation which is just above the social media icons.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.230
If we locate the unordered list,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.115
and then we can delete all of the unordered list section with the About,

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.465
the Contact, the Blog,

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.115
and the Latest News Section.

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:42.125
So delete them, but make sure to leave the outside container then add the PHP tags.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:47.220
Then within the tags, paste in the navwalker.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.695
This one doesn't need as much information as the header one.

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:53.570
For the menu name,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.925
this is going to be the footer.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:00.650
We can delete the theme location and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.990
also the depth because it's only one level. I'll just bring that up.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.040
The container is the unordered list that were deleted before.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.680
So change from div to UL.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.700
We don't need to up the menu class,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.835
the container ID or the container class for this one,

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:21.735
so we can remove them,

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:25.600
and everything else we can leave as it is, and then save that.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.730
Just to finish off the Footer Menu,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.485
we'll add the last two pages,

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.195
so Go to pages and then Add New.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:35.685
Then we're going to add in the About Us page,

00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:42.940
so About Us and then hit "Publish", and then "Add New".

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.285
The last page that goes into the Footer Menu is the Contact Us page,

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:51.820
so Contact Us and then "Publish".

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.005
Then add these last two pages to the footer,

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.020
so Appearance and Menus,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.275
and select the Footer Menu,

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:07.020
then select the Contact Us page and the About Us page we just created here,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.765
"Add to Menu", and then rearrange these into the correct order.

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:13.460
So the top page was About Us,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.210
then it was Contact Us,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.840
then the Blog, and the Latest News,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.520
then hit "Save Menu",

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.295
and then go over to the site.

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:29.380
So It looks as though we've managed to add these pages,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.580
the top menu too,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.770
so we'll remove those in just a moment.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.030
But if we go down to the bottom,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.160
we can check if it's all working correctly.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.285
So select the Blog,

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:43.390
there's our blog section and the Latest News.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.280
That looks fine. We've not created the About Us page or Contact yet.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.205
We'll just remove these menu links from the top.

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:58.780
So back into the Dashboard, Appearance and Menus.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.535
Then select the Main Menu from the top,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:06.645
and we can easily remove these from the menu by selecting them.

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:08.625
Then select and remove.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:11.540
Do the same for the Contact Us page,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.220
and then save that menu.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.955
So that's looking how it should now.

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:24.025
Now, I've got all the menus working correctly on the website.

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:26.990
Thanks for watching. Take care.
