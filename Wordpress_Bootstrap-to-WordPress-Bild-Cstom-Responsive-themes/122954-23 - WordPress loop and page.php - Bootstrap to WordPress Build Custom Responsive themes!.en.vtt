00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.015
So in this video, we're going to be taking a look at the famous WordPress loop.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:11.895
So if you just head over to Google and then you will search for WordPress loop.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.155
We should be taken straight to the codex.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.545
So click on the first link,

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:21.780
which takes us to the WordPress website.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.030
So the loop is PHP code used by WordPress to display posts.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.070
Using the loop WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.765
format according to how it matches specify criteria within the loop tags.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:45.455
Any HTML or PHP code in the loop will be processed on each post.

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:48.755
So basically, what that means is,

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:52.055
rather than what we're doing in our bootstrap blog template,

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:55.075
where we create three separate blog posts.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.040
To save repeating this code over and over again,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.720
we just create one sample blog post within the loop.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.240
WordPress will keep looping through,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.555
pulling in all the contents of the blog posts until there's no more posts to display.

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.910
So scrolling down.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.550
So to start using the WordPress loop,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.520
we need to copy the opening loop tags.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.760
So if we copy where it says the loop starts here,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.980
copy the first line of PHP.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.750
Then between the get header and get footer,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.940
paste this in and then copy the loop ending,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.440
which is just below.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.030
Then paste this in leaving a little bit of space in between for the content.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.475
So if you know a little bit of PHP,

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:47.245
this should look quite familiar.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:51.430
If not, basically all that's happening is WordPress is

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.720
checking if posts are available and while posts aren't available,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.025
it's going to loop through the content that we pull in here very soon.

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.335
Then if there's no more posts,

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.115
it then ends the loop.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:07.945
Then else if there is no posts equal to the browser.

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:11.174
The word sorry, no posts match your criteria.

00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:12.870
So now the loop is in place,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.125
we need to pull in the contents of the column post.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:20.700
We'll do that by open up the PHP tags.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.295
Then in between these tags,

00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:29.839
we pull in the content and the brackets and semicolon.

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:34.850
So this will print out the content of the posts while posted available.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.560
We don't currently have any posts in

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.845
the WordPress website but we'll create those in the next video.

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:41.780
So let's save that.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.375
While we're going to be using this as the backup or the default template for posts,

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:53.389
we also need to create a default template for pages if no more specific template exists.

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.175
So let's create the page.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.365
PHP that we looked at at the start of this video.

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:07.800
So if we just select all the content and copy and then make a new page and paste there.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.685
This page is going to be saved as the page.PHP.

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.375
So save that, there we go.

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:19.610
Because this is the default template for pages rather than posts,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.700
we need to change the error message, to sorry,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.345
no pages matched your criteria, and save that.

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:28.955
So if you join me in the next video,

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.130
we'll start creating some WordPress blog posts.
