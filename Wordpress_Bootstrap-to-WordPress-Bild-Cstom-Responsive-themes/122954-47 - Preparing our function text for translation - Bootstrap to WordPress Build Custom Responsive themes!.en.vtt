00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.255
Okay, welcome back. Now we've got all of the strings available for translation.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.839
We're going to move on and do the same for functions.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.435
We mentioned in the last video,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:18.180
the functions such as the pager for the next and the previous posts.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.640
They also have text inside the brackets,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.180
so we need to do this in a slightly different way than we did before.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.905
It's still very easy to do.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.785
We start with a similar way to before.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:34.840
We use the comma and then put in the text domain of tranquilwp,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.650
but this time, before and after,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.940
we're going to surround these in some extra brackets and then use

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.030
two underscores and then close up bracket off at

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.855
the end and then do the same in newer posts.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:53.915
The comma, the text domain, tranquilwp,

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.765
and in the opening brackets,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.320
add the two underscores,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.680
and then close our second bracket off there.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.585
We've also got a pager in the news template.

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:10.920
Head over to the page-news and then down at the bottom,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.545
we'll do exactly the same.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:14.630
For the older posts,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.385
add in the text domain of tranquilwp,

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:29.335
and then the extra surrounding brackets with the two underscores, close off,

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:31.020
and the same for the newer

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.740
posts,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.165
there we go.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.000
Then I just wanted to change in the functions file.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.970
So head over to the functions.php.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.370
Now we need to change the browsing text,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.700
but it looks as though we jumped the gun in the last video and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.185
added the text domain in there,

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:57.465
but this is actually a function.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:03.455
We need to do the same interval with the brackets, the two underscores,

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.265
and then close the second bracket off,

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:09.510
and then let's look for the printf statement,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.890
so scroll down to the bottom.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.410
The way to do this with a variable in there is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.530
by adding the two underscores in there and then after the string,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.485
add in the text domain of tranquilwp, and then save that.

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:31.265
That's it, that's just a slightly different way

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:34.565
of preparing the text if it's part of a function.

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.545
Set our theme now translation ready.

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:43.180
We've now told WordPress which words we want to make available for translation.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.810
So that's it. We'll leave that video there.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.330
If you join me in the next video,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.490
we'll download some software which

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.240
will pull out these words which you've made translatable.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.220
It'll put them all into a template and allow

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.160
us to actually translate the words. We'll see you there.
