00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.630
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.955
we're going to create the Latest News page.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.290
Now, the Latest News page is going to be pretty similar to the Blog page.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.615
But we're just going to add a WordPress filter,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.670
which we'll fill at the column post to display

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.895
just the ones that are tagged with the news category.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:23.415
To get started, head over to brackets and create a new page,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.820
and save this page as page-news.php.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.460
Then because it's going to be pretty similar to the blog page,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.700
we can just copy the index page.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.130
Select all the content and copy,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.900
and paste that in the news page, and save that.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.585
Unlike the last few templates we've made,

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:51.030
this is going to be a single-use template,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.640
so we're only going to link this to the Latest News page.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.460
To make sure we can link this to a WordPress page,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.750
right at the very top,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.980
we'll add a comment which will give it a template name.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.140
So add the comments at the top,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.210
and then add a template name.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.310
This displays in the dashboard,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.575
and this is going to be called the Latest News, and save that.

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:27.600
Now, we'll give this a template name.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.965
If we head over to WordPress and then go over to the dashboard,

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.695
select the pages on the left,

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.870
and then go to Add New,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.540
and let's create the Latest News.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.810
This time, if we go to the Page Attributes on the right-hand side,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.240
we can select a template to use.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.285
This time we can select the Latest News template

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:55.450
because we've added the template name at the top.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.710
Select the Latest News and then Publish,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.065
and this should be automatically added to the homepage.

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.180
So we've got the home, the blog,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.875
and now the latest news.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.630
I think we've got a spelling mistake there.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.900
We'll just edit that title there.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.180
Add the "t" on to the end and update.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920
Great, so now we've got the homepage,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.930
the blog, and the latest news.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.610
Now we've used the index page as the template for the latest news.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.185
We need to now filter these down to only show the posts which have the category of news.

00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:40.590
Head back over to the page-news.php.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.385
To add the category filter,

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.050
open up the PHP,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.250
and then we use the WordPress function,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.130
which is query_posts, and then within the brackets,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.740
we'll tell WordPress which posts to query;

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.170
the ones with the category name.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:11.100
So category_name equal to news and a semicolon at the end, and save.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.825
If we go back over to the website and refresh,

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.585
so now when we click on the "Latest News" section,

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:23.340
we should just be displayed with the posts which have the category of news.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.075
That's working fine, so that's good.

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:31.585
You may have noticed we need to add the text or the feature text at the top.

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:35.170
We'll do this dynamically in the functions.php.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.640
This time we'll do it a little bit differently.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.990
We'll get WordPress to pull in the name of the website,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.790
which will be Tranquil Spa,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.590
and then we'll add a break tag.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.230
Then underneath, we'll add the title of the page,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.510
which should be Latest News.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.490
Go over to the functions file.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.205
We'll add another else-if statement.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:04:03.190
Make sure that you don't add else-if onto the closing curly brace for the if statements.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.470
Go to the next one down.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.030
Else-if, in brackets is page template.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.640
The page template is going to be the page-news.php.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.110
This time the else-if statement is checking the name of the actual template,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.345
then the curly braces.

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:36.245
If it's a page template of page news,

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:42.235
we'll add the site name by grabbing the blog info.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:46.545
In the brackets, simply type in a name,

00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:49.590
and that will pull in the name of the site,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.705
and then we'll echo to the browser a break tag,

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:56.670
let's put this on a separate line,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.265
and then we'll get the page title of Latest News.

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:10.140
Just type in the_title and save and refresh.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.320
There we go. Now we've pulled in the title of the website and then the title of the page.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.985
If we're ever to change any of this information,

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:22.575
it would now be displayed automatically.

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:25.310
There we go. So that's the Latest News section finished.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.650
Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.
