00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.755
In this video, we're going to create the About Us page.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.265
We've already got the template for that in the bootstrap design,

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.410
so it's going to be pretty straightforward to make.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.765
Go into your text editor,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:17.955
create a new page, and save this page as a page-about.php,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:24.720
and to get started,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.540
we're going to copy the page news template.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.850
So copy the contents and paste this into the about template.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.465
We don't need the sidebar or the blog section,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.810
so we can pretty much delete everything off this page.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.430
We'll delete that and change

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.120
the comments at the top for the template name to be About Us.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.580
Then go over to the WordPress Dashboard, and then next,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.065
we're going to add this template to the page that we created.

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:03.450
So go to the pages and then look for the About Us page and hit Edit.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.005
Then we can change the template to the About us template,

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.570
and then update that page.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.525
Now we can go over to the Bootstrap site.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:23.420
If we open up the folder and then open up the About Us page in the text editor.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.815
I'll shrink that down, and then drag about.html into the text editor,

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:39.060
and then we can copy all of the section and copy all of the About Us section.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.650
We don't need the header.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
We've already got that. We don't need feature section.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.485
That's done in WordPress.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.830
Copy the About Us section,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.670
all the way down to the closing section tag.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.750
Copy that, and then go back into

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.320
the About Us page and paste that between the header and footer.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.505
Next we just need to correct the image file path,

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:15.300
so I'm just going to copy the PHP from the index page.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.425
Just look for a image.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.690
In fact, we need the front page for that.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.675
So copy the PHP file path and then go into the About Us page.

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:32.550
We'll start from the top.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.330
We'll go with the divider image to start with,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.250
so paste that in, and make sure you've got the forward slash before the images folder.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.120
Then scroll on down.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.020
Add this to all of the rest of the images.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.480
Then hit Save, and then head over to the About Us page and see if that's working.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.390
So down to the bottom in the footer menu, the About Us section.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.755
That all appears to be working.

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:17.350
We only need change the text on the featured image and we do the in the functions,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.970
the same way as all the rest.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.925
So find the feature text function.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:24.220
We're going to allow WordPress to pull in

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.120
the page title in the same way as we've done with the news template.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.935
So we'll have the site name of Tranquil Spa,

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:34.465
and then the next line is going to be the page title.

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:38.060
If we add this to the same elseif statement,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.660
so copy the page template.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.975
Copy each page template,

00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:45.015
and then the brackets,

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:46.955
and put in the all symbol,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.665
which is the two pipes,

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.180
and then paste this in.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.040
But this time, the page template is for the page-about.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.670
Save that and refresh the page. That's all working.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.435
We've got the site title,

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:10.140
and then the page title below.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.560
That's all finished now with the About Us page.
