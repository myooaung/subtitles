00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.425
In the last video, we completed the HTML and the CSS for the header section.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.470
Next, if we take a look at the finished website,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.670
we're going to start with the welcome section.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.630
It's quite a simple section,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.520
there is just a level 2 heading at the top,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.100
there's also a divide image,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.120
and then four links to different parts of the website.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.300
Let's get started. Head over to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.040
your index page and then copy the comment for the feature section.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:45.815
We're going to start working just below the closing header tag and paste that in.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:50.680
This is going to be the welcome section.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.535
The welcome section is going to be in the section tags,

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:03.375
and the section tag is going to have an ID of welcome,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.405
so we can use that in the CSS.

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:12.900
The whole div needs to have a class of container.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.540
Unlike the previous sections,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.215
we're just going to use a set width container.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.405
We don't want to stretch in too wide.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.624
Then within the container,

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:27.210
we add the usual div with the class of row.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.330
Then we'll set the number of bootstrap columns.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.770
We want the level 2 heading and also the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.940
divider image to be half the width of the web page,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.350
so we'll set the number of columns to be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.215
six and we'll add an offset of three on the left-hand side.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:52.430
We'll surround the text on the image with a div,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.140
with a class of col-sm-6

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.460
and also for the offset, col-sm-offset-3.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.105
Then the level 2 heading,

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:21.870
which is "Welcome to Tranquil Spa," then just below the heading,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.895
we'll add the image,

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:25.705
so the image source,

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:34.130
this image is also in our images folder, images/divider-purple.png.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.900
If we look at the finished project,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.620
you can see that the divider-purple is on the white background color.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.700
But further down, we've got purple background color,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.585
we've also got a divide with the silver pots.

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:53.900
We'll use the divider-silver on the sections.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.375
After the file path,

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:02.169
we can add the alt-text of divider,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.980
and close that image off,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.415
and then let's just copy the closing div comments.

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:13.480
The first one is for the columns,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.480
the next one is for the rows,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.030
and the last one is for the container.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.665
Let's see how that's looking,

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:29.050
back into the browser and refresh.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.025
There we go. The image on the text is centered.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.385
We need to do a little bit work with the CSS,

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.505
but that's okay for now.

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:49.105
Then next, we'll create the four images and the four links just below.

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:51.305
Back into the text editor,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:57.330
we start just below the last closing row but still within the main container.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.055
Let's create a new row.

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:03.200
A div class of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.000
row and we'll also

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.965
add a custom class of facilities,

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:17.460
we can use that on the CSS.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:24.080
Each of the individual links is going stake of three columns,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.340
so we can create four different divs with a class of col-sm-3.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.660
The first one, div class of col-sm-3,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.705
so both the image and the text is going to be a link,

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:47.165
so we'll just leave a blank.

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:51.900
Within the link, let's add the image first.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.450
The image source of images and the first image

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.435
is makeup.png with the old text,

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.130
let's get rid of the sidebar.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.110
The old text is, "Hair and Makeup".

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.500
Then just after the image,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.775
you can add the text for the link,

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:22.744
so hair, and then to get the and symbol,

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:24.650
we use the ampersand,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.910
then amp; then Make Up,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.830
then let's add some comments to the closing divs.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:47.070
The outside one is for the row and then the inner one is for the three column div.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.080
Because we are going to be using these three column div four times,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.390
let's copy the section and then paste it in below three more times,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:08.970
save that, and check out on the browser, and refresh.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.410
Great, that's working. We've got the four images, all hyperlinks.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.890
We can see the underline once you hover over and also the text is there.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.255
Let's now change the images on the text.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.625
The first div is fine,

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.800
let's move down to the second image.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.780
The second image has a name of candles.png,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.190
the alt text is "Spa

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:45.100
Facilities" and also the text is Spa Facilities.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:58.720
Then the third section has an image called lake.png and the text is "Lakeside Retreats",

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.830
and also the same for the alt text.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.855
Finally, the last one,

00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:16.410
the image name is pool.png,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:27.970
the text is "All Our Facilities" and we'll copy that for the alt text too.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.615
Let's see that in the browser and refresh.

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:38.640
That's fine for now.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.010
Next, I'm going to move on and add some CSS for this section.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.450
We want to make sure that the level 2 heading is centralized,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.990
we need some spacing above and below the images.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.395
We're also going to centralize the text and remove the underline when hovered over,

00:07:56.395 --> 00:07:59.335
and we'll also change the text color.

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:03.365
Let's do that in the Custom CSS.

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:06.195
We're going to start with the level 2 heading

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:09.585
because we'll be using this many times over on the site,

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:13.225
we want to put this in the Global section at the top,

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:15.570
so just below the image,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.255
we can have h2 there.

00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:22.570
We need to text-align, center.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:28.480
On the font size to be 2em,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.000
and also to create a little bit of space on the top and bottom,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.820
let's add a little bit of margin.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.800
Margin top, 30 pixels,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.870
and also some margin on the bottom to be 20 pixels.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.220
Let's save that and check that out in the browser.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.640
Now, we got the text in the middle,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.575
and also a little bit of space above and below.

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:59.150
While we are also in the global section,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.950
we can remove the underline from the hyperlinks when we hover over.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:11.580
Just below the h2, let's select a:hover.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.915
We can remove the underline by setting the text decoration to be none.

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:23.970
Let's also set the text color while we're here.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.560
When hovered over, it needs to be 97689c.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.995
Now, when I hover over,

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:38.770
the text changes to purple and the underline being removed.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.245
Because we've set the h2 font size to be 2em,

00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:47.450
that's probably going to be a little bit too big when we get down to the mobile size,

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.790
so let's head down to the media query.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.349
Below the feature text,

00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:57.870
lets add the h2.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:04.540
We'll just reduce the font size to be 1.6em.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.020
Now, we've added the global styles,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.675
we can start by adding a Welcome section and add some of the Welcome-specific styles.

00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:17.240
Let's copy the comment for

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.010
mobile styling and we'll paste it just above the mobile styling section.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.430
Let's call this the Welcome Section.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.485
The Welcome section, we give a ID of "welcome".

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:42.480
Welcome section has got a white background color.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.020
Let's add some padding to the bottom of

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.805
the section so everything below doesn't get too close.

00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:54.695
We'll set the padding bottom to 30 pixels.

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:59.860
We will also set only text in this section to be in the center.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.725
In the global section, we change the color of the links when we hovered over them.

00:11:08.725 --> 00:11:13.570
But now, we need to set the color to override the default blue.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.630
Welcome and then a,

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:27.125
because they're links and the color is going to have the value of 494646,

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:30.450
which is a darker gray color.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.290
Next in the section with the images and the text,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.605
we want to make the text a little bit bigger and also the individual images,

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:45.280
we're going to make them a little bit smaller and add some margin on the top and bottom,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.110
just spacing a little bit more.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.605
Surrounding this row, we'll look back in the HTML.

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:55.845
The four individual divs were all surrounded with

00:11:55.845 --> 00:12:01.000
a row and we give that row a custom class of facilities.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.280
Let's use our now. Let's increase the font size.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.090
Font size, let's set that to 1.5 em,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.480
and also the facilities image,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.910
let's set the display to be block.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.830
To make them a little bit smaller,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.370
we can set the maximum width to be 60 percent,

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.555
so it looks a little bit better.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:39.010
Then to add a space here,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.550
we'll set the margin,

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.060
we want to put 30 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.300
and set the left and right to be auto.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.335
There we go, that's what's finished now with the Welcome section.

00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:01.625
That's the end of this video and if you join me in the next video,

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:04.070
we'll continue with the website and we'll move

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.950
down to create the latest Office section. See you there.
