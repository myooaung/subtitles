00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.310
we're going to be concentrating on getting our navigation open and running.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.215
Because WordPress and Bootstrap use different custom classes for the menu setup,

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.220
we need to include a way of converting our Bootstrap classes to WordPress.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.745
Now luckily, somebody has already created a useful tool called the Bootstrap nav walker.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:31.569
If you go over to Google and have a search for Bootstrap navwalker,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.000
then you should get the first link,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
which is the GitHub page and you can see that nav walker is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.340
a custom WordPress nav walker class to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.675
implement Twitter Bootstrap into our WordPress custom themes.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.360
We can start by hitting the "Download" button.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.120
It should download quite quick,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.590
it's just a zip file.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.770
Then if you go down to the installation,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.790
the installation is pretty simple to follow.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.240
We start by copying the function.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.120
So we copy that, and then head up to the functions.php.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.335
This is going to be included within the tranquilwp_setup function.

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:20.940
Just underneath the title-tag function, paste that in.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.095
This includes the navwalker file into our project.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:29.870
Back over to the browser.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.774
Then for the usage,

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:34.530
copy the nav walker array,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.090
and then go over to a text editor into the header.php.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.310
It will locate the navigation.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.370
We need to find the main navigation which is on the homepage,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.875
which has the links to the index page,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.290
the blog, and also the latest news.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.520
We need to replace the full unordered list.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.270
So we can delete all of this section.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.200
But make sure you leave the surrounding div with the class off collapse.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.140
Then paste in the array between these tags.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.960
We'll just tie this up a little bit.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.210
This array correctly formats our WordPress theme to include a bootstrap drop-down menu.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.035
We can leave all the defaults as they are on the right-hand side.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:29.600
The only thing we need to change is the menu class.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.670
Our bootstrap menu classes when nav, navbar-nav,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.220
and then also navbar-right,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.080
because our menu was right aligned.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.230
Everything else we can leave as default.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.510
Then back over to the browser.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.130
Next we need to register the menu.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.140
Copy the register_nav_menus and then into functions.php,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.480
just below where we've included the navigation walker link.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.160
Just below that, we can paste this in there.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.225
This registers the navigation with the theme.

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:17.885
We just tie this up and then change the THEMENAME to tranquilwp and save that.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.950
This sets the menu with the home link and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.550
the blog links at the top of the webpage to be our primary menu.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.285
We'll come back to this later on in the course and will register the photo menus.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:33.890
The last thing we need to do is hopefully that's downloaded for you now,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.060
head to your downloads and then unzip the package that we just downloaded, and open up.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.625
Then we need to the drag the PHP file into a custom theme.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:55.040
Then also open up your theme folder and then drag

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.860
inside the PHP folder and paste it in at the root directory,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.930
the same as the index page.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.205
I'm going to do that now. Now that should all be working.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:11.735
If we go to the text editor and then save that,

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:20.220
and then into Chrome and into WordPress and then refresh WordPress.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.385
Then we can create our main menu.

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:27.890
In the dashboard on the left-hand side,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.740
go to appearance and then menus.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.070
Then create a menu and then change the menu name to Main Menu.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.300
Then scroll down when it's checked the two boxes at

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.570
the bottom and this makes sure that the main menu is

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.090
the primary menu and also that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.995
the new pages that we create automatically get added to the menu.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:59.990
Save that. Then let's visit the site and see if

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.540
the menu is working okay. Our menu is working.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.940
We can see it's appeared at the top of the page.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.510
We've only got the Home and the Sample Page link for now because

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.860
we haven't created the blog or the latest new section. But that's fine.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.140
That means everything is working correctly.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.210
That's it, we'll leave this video for now.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.535
I'll see you in the next video.

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:25.920
We will fix all the links for the images.
