00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.100
So now our theme is all ready to be translated.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.185
I'm going to show you next how to do a process called localization.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:15.150
This mainly consists of creating a template file called a POT file,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.910
and it stands for portable object template.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.990
This will basically be a directory or

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.440
a catalog of all the translatable words in the theme.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.035
Then, we'll use the contents of this POT file to create a PO file,

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:35.300
which will actually hold the translated strings in in a language of your choice.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.930
So we're going to get started with some software called Poedit.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.280
So I'm going to go to Google and search for Poedit.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.280
Then select "poedit.net", which should be the top one.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.700
Poedit will be the software we use to actually do the language conversion.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.405
It's free to download for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:03.170
There is a pro version which makes it a little bit easier,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.670
but we don't need that for now.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.850
So simply click on the "Free Download" for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.740
your operating system and give it a few moments just to download.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.045
So once that's downloaded,

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:23.410
unzip the file and download it in the usual way.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.220
So I'm going to put mine in the Applications folder.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.850
So once you get started,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.910
you should see a, welcome window, similar to this.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.170
Now we're going to create our POT or template file in Poedit.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.705
Go to File and then New and then select the language of your theme.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:51.900
So mine is English and then press "Enter".

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.290
So then if you go up to the Catalog at the top and then go to Properties.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.030
So start with some project information.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.070
So I'm going to call mine Tranquil-new.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.315
Then, we need to tell Poedit the sources of the translatable words.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:15.615
So go to the sources keywords tab and then to add some keywords,

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:16.990
select the second button,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.715
which is for the new item.

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:22.500
So I'm going to get started with the two underscores.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.635
The two underscores was the prefix that we use for the functions.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.660
So add that and hit "Enter".

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.990
Then, I'm going to add one more, which was the _e,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.390
which was the echo function. So enter.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.475
I'm going to also add one more for escaped strings.

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:50.340
So escape esc_attr_e.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.450
So we'll also add that one in.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.260
If there are any keywords that you use in your themes,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.805
make sure you add these in too,

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.195
and then go to "OK".

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:04.275
Then go to, "Extract from sources".

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:07.370
Actually need to save this file first before we do that.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.625
So go to File and then Save As.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.860
Then, this is going to be our POT file.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.730
So we're going to save this into our theme,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.510
open up the theme folder,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.165
and make sure that the languages folder that we created is open.

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:27.240
So the theme name we added was tranquil_new.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.800
Then, we need to save this as a POT file.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.145
But by default, it shouldn't let us do that.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.670
It will automatically save as a PO file.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.790
So we can just use PO and then we can just

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.325
manually change the extension if we go into the languages folder.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:49.730
So just click on the file what was created and change

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.390
the file extension to POT and then use that.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.595
So then go back into Poedits and we're going to extract the text to be translated.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:05.395
So select, "Extract from sources" at the bottom.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:09.780
So next, we'll add the path to our theme?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.160
So underneath the paths,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.900
click on the "Plus" icon and go to "Add folders" and then select

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.635
the theme folder and then select the tranquilwp theme and then open.

00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:25.450
Then, click on "OK".

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.625
So now our POT file has extracted all the text strings from our theme.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.185
This is now our catalog that we can use as a template.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:37.155
So save that.

00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:40.930
Next, we can use this template to create a PO file,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.330
which will hold the translated strings.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.145
So go to "Create New Translation".

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:50.125
Then, we need to select the language of the translation that we want.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:54.550
So we can just select a language that you'd like to translate to.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.265
So I'm just going to pick a random one.

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:02.415
So it will for Greek and then, "OK".

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:05.230
So now if you look at the top of the page,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.515
we've got a PO file called EL,

00:05:08.515 --> 00:05:10.495
which is a Greek prefix.

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:12.740
So I'm going to save that.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.370
Again, make sure this is in the languages folder and then hit, "Save".

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.010
So now when we go through the strings,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.040
we can see that some translation suggestions appeared on

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.685
the right or we can manually type them in at the bottom.

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.670
So it's just a case of selecting the text that we want to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.925
translate and then add it in there.

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:38.360
I can go for these mainly admin or click on

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.905
the suggestions and then you get the Greek translation appearing on the right.

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:44.705
So once you finish it up,

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.250
just hit the "Save" button.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.095
So now when you go back into the theme and the languages folder,

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:55.040
we should now have the POT file which is the template and then we should

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.750
have two files with the file name of the country you've selected.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.295
One should end in PO, which is the translation and then we've also got a MO file,

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:09.525
which if you go back into the documentation,

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:15.245
you can see this is the actual compiled machine-readable version of the PO file.

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:18.680
So we also need that too. So that's it.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.310
That's how you translate your theme into different languages.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.825
You may not necessarily have to add the PO files into your theme,

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:30.170
but as long as you've got the template file or the POT file,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.900
we can allow end users to translate into their own particular language.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.900
So thanks for watching and that's the end of the translation section.
