00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.330
Welcome back. In this video we're going to add theme support for

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.420
post thumbnails and this will allow users when creating

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.445
a new post to also upload

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.725
a featured image to make the post look a little bit nicer so it's not just plain text.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:21.130
The way to do that is we need to go to our functions.php,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.620
and then we need to add theme support for post thumbnails.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.875
Go over to functions.php,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.175
and then back up to the top within the setup.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:38.250
We do this in a similar way to the feeds and the title tag that we added at the start.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.790
So in the setup add theme support.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.310
Then inside the brackets,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.100
we're going to put in the post-thumbnails

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.890
and the semicolon and save that.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.895
Now we've included theme support.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.835
If we go over to the WordPress dashboard,

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:07.160
and then if we go into the blog section.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.810
Choose one of the blog posts,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.580
and then select "Edit Post".

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.825
Then scroll down to the bottom.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:20.890
You should see that there's now a featured image box appeared.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.940
We can use this to set an image to attach to the post.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.200
Just select that, we can have an Upload Files or we can use the Media Library.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.150
For now I'm just going to go to the Select Files in the upload section,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.140
and then on the desktop in the bootstrap folder,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.515
and the images, I've included an image called the thumbnail.jpg.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.960
We can use that if you want,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.255
or you can choose one of your own.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:55.460
Then I'm just going to put some alt texts of lake image and then

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.450
set the featured image and then update the post.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.360
Then we'll go back into the blog and just do one more.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.970
This time I'm going to select the second post

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.290
then add the featured image in the same way.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.695
This time we are just going to go to the Media Library and use the same one if you want,

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:25.410
and then set that and update.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.740
If you go into the blog at the minute,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.930
don't worry that you can't see the image just yet.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.830
There's a couple of little steps we need to take first.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.980
Go over to the index.php and then we need to look for the excerpt,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.630
which is the text.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.710
Scroll down to the PHP tags with the excerpt.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.045
To show the image just above the excerpt,

00:02:53.045 --> 00:03:00.600
open up the PHP tags and then we set the post thumbnail,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.960
the brackets and the semicolon, and save that.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.405
If you refresh the browser now you should get the images appearing.

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:16.150
There we go. That's the first two images that we set before.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.320
This just makes the post look a lot better.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.710
We can add a little bit more color to the post.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.980
That's added to the index page,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.965
but we've also got blog posts appearing in the news page and also the single.php.

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:37.810
Go over to the index page and copy the post's thumbnail.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.770
Then if you go into the single.php,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.170
and this time rather than the excerpt,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.720
this will go just above the content.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.840
Don't forget to save. Also in the page news,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.060
this will go just above the excerpt.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.250
Paste that in and safe.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.545
That should now be our images displaying on the post in the news,

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.885
the index, and also the single page.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:13.025
If you want to change the default size of the image that displays,

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:14.929
we can do that on the dashboard.

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.315
So head over to the dashboard,

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:20.250
settings and then media.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.415
You can set the default images for the thumbnail, medium or large.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:27.080
If you want to set, for example,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.110
the thumbnail as the default image in the blog,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.110
head over to the blog and then in the index page would

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.245
then put inside the brackets the thumbnail and then save that.

00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:48.190
Then if you refresh the blog we should now get the small thumbnail image by default.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.065
You can do the same for medium or large.

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:58.100
But I'm just going to delete that for now and just leave the standard image sizing.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.300
This page is nearly done.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.370
Just a little bit of CSS to add.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.155
I just want to add some margin to the bottom of the image

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:10.665
and also make the image 100 percent of the container.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:14.500
If we go into the style.css,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.100
and then we'll add this in the blog section.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.375
Let's take a look for the blog section.

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:24.525
Then at the bottom of this section,

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:32.830
we can reuse the blog post class but then select the image.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.440
I will add some margin onto the bottom of the image.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:47.250
Just of 20 pixels and set the width of the image to be 100 percent.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.580
Save and then refresh the blog. There we go.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.630
That's to looking a lot better and let us now finished with the blog section.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.550
I'll see you in the next video where we'll add the WordPress menu to the footer.
