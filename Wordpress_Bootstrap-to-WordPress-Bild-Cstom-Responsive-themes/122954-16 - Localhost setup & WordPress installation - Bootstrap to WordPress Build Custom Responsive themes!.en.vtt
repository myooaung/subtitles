00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.975
Welcome back to this brand new section

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.970
when I get into the exciting part of the course where we're

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.285
going to start converting our Bootstrap template to a WordPress theme.

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:15.150
Just before we start, [inaudible] we'll need to download a web server onto our machine.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.435
To develop WordPress websites on our machine locally,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.850
we need to install a web server.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.890
If you head over to MAMP,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.680
M-A-M-P,.info, and a build to install the latest version of MAMP.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.500
If you just click on the download button,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.410
this is available for free on both Mac and Windows.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.010
Click the download button to get us started and then download the latest version there.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.335
Up to now, we've been building our website in Bootstrap,

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:49.959
which includes HTML, CSS,

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.710
and JavaScript, all of which run in the browser.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.785
We don't need any special tools for the website to appear in the browser.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:00.370
But because we're using WordPress and WordPress is built using

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.080
PHP and uses a MySQL database,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.960
we need to install MAMP to create a local server on our machine.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.475
This will enable us to build WordPress websites without having them live on the internet.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:18.350
Just pause the video for a minute while that's downloading and we'll see you in a minute.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.330
Welcome back. Hopefully, you've now got MAMP downloaded.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.210
If we just head over to our downloads and double-click on the installer,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.870
this should take you through the installation process.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.450
It should be pretty similar on both Mac and Windows.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.090
You should get the installation script.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.490
If we just continue through and accept the license and agreement.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.770
Then we're going to install for all users on this computer.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.830
Then click install,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.310
and it shouldn't take too long to install,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.790
so we just give that a moment to finish installing.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.180
We've got a MAMP and MAMP Pro has been installed successfully.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.830
We're just going to be using the free MAMP version.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.410
That's all you're going to need for this course,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.430
we don't need to pay for the pro version.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.385
Once that's finished installing,

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:23.710
just click on close.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.775
Now we've got MAMP installed.

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:30.435
If you're using a Mac,

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:33.100
if you go over to the applications,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.755
it should be saved inside there.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.700
If you're using a Windows machine,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.750
it should be stored in your usual location such as the C Drive.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.310
If we just go over to MAMP and double-click on the MAMP with the elephant icon.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.795
Then you should get a window which looks like this.

00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:00.525
If we go into the preferences and then click the ports tab,

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:06.000
the Apache ports, which is the web server is used on port 8888.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.210
Then if you click on the web server.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.985
By default, the path for the document root should be the htdocs.

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.800
If it's not, just click on the folder.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.590
Then, once you're in the folder,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.445
if you just find your way to the drive where MAMP is installed.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:26.465
Then if we go down to find MAMP and then open up.

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:31.230
Then if you look for the htdocs folder, then select that.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.850
Any website which we are going to be using PHP for,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.465
we need to put the project folder into the htdocs,

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:40.445
but we'll do that in just a bit.

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:47.795
If we start by clicking start servers and hopefully if everything installed okay,

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.350
you should get the starter page

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.080
which tells you that MAMP has been successfully installed.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.780
Okay, great. Now MAMP is installed.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.400
If we head over to Google and if you search for WordPress.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.700
Then, once that's searched,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.920
we need to go to wordpress.org.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.880
If you want to take a look at the WordPress homepage,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.155
feel free to do that.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:21.110
But I'm just going to click on download WordPress and then download the latest version,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.600
which is currently 4.3.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.710
WordPress doesn't take long at all to install.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.990
It only takes about 10-15 seconds if you've got good internet connection.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.835
Once that's downloaded, we can just get rid of that and then head over to

00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:49.070
the downloads and then click on the WordPress zip file and unzip that.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.310
Now, this is our new project folder for our website.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.320
I'm going to rename this tranquil-wp.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.199
Just so there is no confusion,

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.250
the original Bootstrap folder,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.020
I'm going to change this to tranquil-bs.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.955
Then we need to move this into our htdocs.

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:14.250
I'm just going to open up a new window.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.630
Then I'm going to find the htdocs.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.625
If we go back into the MAMP folder and then into htdocs,

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:28.180
and then drag into htdocs the WordPress folder.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.710
Now we've got WordPress installed in our document root or the htdocs.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.285
If we go back to MAMP and then click on the open start page,

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:43.970
this should take us back to the MAMP welcome screen.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.350
Then, if click on the tools at the top and click on phpMyAdmin.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.530
This should take us to the admin area for creating databases.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.490
We need to create a new database for WordPress.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.050
The way we do that, if we select the databases tab

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.620
at the top and then under create database,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.165
I'm going to put our database name in there.

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:10.860
I'm going to call mine tranquil-spa,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.150
and then click on create.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.715
Then down the left, we should get the tranquil-spa database appear in the list.

00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:24.050
Then next we'll create a user for that database.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.680
Then if we go to the tabs at the top of the page and click

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.080
on privileges and then we'll select the new user,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.920
or add user, which is at the bottom.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.640
Then we can enter the user's information.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.735
The username will give us the text field.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:45.690
I'm going to call my user spa-admin.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.585
Then for the host,

00:06:48.585 --> 00:06:50.970
we want to select local.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.155
Then you can either type in the password of your choice or you can generate a password.

00:06:57.155 --> 00:07:01.765
Make sure if you generate a password that you copy it up.

00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:04.170
We'll use that just in a moment,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.130
and then scroll over down the page and hit go.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.775
There's our spa-admin user created.

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:15.350
Then now we need to go back over to WordPress and tell WordPress

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.985
the database information and the user information that we've just created.

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:26.260
We'll close the browser for now and then open up your text editor.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:38.085
Then if we go back over to the htdocs where we've saved our tranquil-wp folder.

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:41.680
If you just drag that into the text editor.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.925
It's configured the WordPress database.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:55.400
If we go into the WordPress folder and select wp-config-sample.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.824
Then we can enter our database information.

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:01.940
Scroll down to the database name.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.955
Then you can see we just need to include our database name here.

00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:14.490
Delete that. We called our database tranquil-spa, so tranquil-spa.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.105
Then underneath the database name,

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.555
we can include the username.

00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:22.370
Delete the username here.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.875
We called our user spa-admin.

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:30.315
Put in spa-admin or whatever name you created.

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:35.565
The password, which you should have copied to the clipboard. We can paste that in.

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:39.600
We use the localhost, so we can just leave the host as it is.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.460
Then next, we need to generate the keys on salts for the authentication.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.010
Where the website link is,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.420
which we just copy this.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:09:00.410
Then head over to your web browser and paste that in.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.115
This should generate the keys which are unique.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:07.500
Select all on the page and copy.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:14.890
Then replace these with the ones we've just copied. Paste those in.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.675
Then the last thing we need to do inside this file

00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:20.725
is to scroll down to the bottom of the page.

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:26.135
We can change the database table prefix from the standard WP.

00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:29.160
I'm going to change mine to tranquildb.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.645
This can be anything you like, it doesn't really matter.

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:42.015
Save that. Then the last thing we need to do for this file is remove the sample word.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:50.010
We need to rename it wp-config.php. Make sure that's saved.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.940
If you remember when we first downloaded MAMP,

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.360
we went inside the preferences on the ports.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.720
If you remember that the port was 8888.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.395
We can use this to go into our web browser.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:11.930
If you go into the web browser and then type in localhost, and then a colon,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.440
and then 8888 and then enter,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.360
this should give you an index of all the website which is stored inside the htdocs.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.360
For now, we've only got the tranquil-spa.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.170
If we click on that, and hopefully if everything's gone well for you,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.405
you can get the WordPress installation script.

00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:34.535
It's really simple to follow along.

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:38.345
First of all, we need to select our language,

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:44.070
which mine is English, UK and then select continue.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.445
Then we just need a little bit of information about the site.

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:54.430
The site title is going to be Tranquil Spa.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:03.220
I've already got my username saved as tranquil_admin and then create a password.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.185
Bear in mind, this password is going to be different from your database.

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:12.305
This is going to be to log into the WordPress admin.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.900
Create a strong password of your choice.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:27.270
Then type in an email and then privacy,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.695
we can uncheck this for now.

00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:31.400
We can change that later on in the settings once we have finished

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.310
the website and then click install WordPress.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.235
There we go, it starts WordPress installed.

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:42.965
That's how quick and easy is to get WordPress started on your machine.

00:11:42.965 --> 00:11:48.480
If you just go to login and we [inaudible] to go to the control panel.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.630
Put username and password in,

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.020
and we've been taken to the WordPress dashboard.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.670
If you want to check out how

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.140
the WordPress website is looking so far using the default theme,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.345
we can just click on the Tranquil Spa home icon at the top.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:15.365
This is our website, and this is just the standard theme which comes with WordPress.

00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:18.155
There we go, that's WordPress now installed.

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:20.810
Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video where we will

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.600
start importing our Bootstrap files into WordPress.
