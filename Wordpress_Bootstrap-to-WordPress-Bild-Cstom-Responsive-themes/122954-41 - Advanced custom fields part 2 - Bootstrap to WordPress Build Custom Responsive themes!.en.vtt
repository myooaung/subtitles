00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.320
Now we understand a little bit more about how to use

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.300
advanced custom fields by changing the featured text area.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.800
We're going to continue with the front page and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.295
I'm going to show you how to do it for the latest offers section.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:17.040
Go back into the Dashboard,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.260
and then the Custom Fields tab,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.790
and then click on the "Front Page".

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.000
Because we are going to be creating the free special offer actions,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.050
what you're going to be pretty similar,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.195
I'm going to add a tab to section is off.

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:41.420
Add a new field and the label for this can be Offer 1 and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.240
the field type is going to be a Tab, and then add that.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.345
Then a second tab for the Offer 2,

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:58.030
and change the text field to be a Tab,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.000
and the same for the offer number 3.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.230
Again, change that to be a Tab, and then close up.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.320
Now, let's get started with the Offer 1.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.465
This time we'll add a field.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.940
This field will be the offer price.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.260
We'll choose the generated field name.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.100
Because this is the price, we need change it from text to be number, required?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.725
Yes. I will just close the field.

00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:40.475
So now we've got the offer price.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.830
This is going to be for the first offer.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.860
So we can just drag and put this under the Offer 1 tab.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.910
So then we'll create now the offer name.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.650
This can be okay as text, required?

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.860
Yes, and then close up.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.130
Then put is offer name just underneath the offer price.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.775
Then because each one of these special offers has two lines of text,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.295
we'll do two separate fields.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:20.190
So Offer Line 1,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.585
we'll put that as required too.

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.850
Then, also add Offer Line 2,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.190
it's okay. Is text required?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.860
Yes. I'm going to close our fields and also close that one.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.170
Then drag these up in the first tab.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.825
Now, because we're going to use the same fields for the offer 2 and offer 3.

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:53.570
If we just go into the offer 1 fields,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.465
we could just click on "Duplicate".

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:58.805
I'm going to keep the offer price text as the same.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.355
But we need to change the field name,

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:08.040
which I need to offer_price_2, then close up.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.400
The one that we just created,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.350
which is the offer_price_2,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.620
then drag this down underneath the Offer 2 tab, which is just there.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.915
Underneath the offer price,

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:23.790
we'll duplicate the offer name.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:33.730
I just remove the copy and change this to offer_name_2 for the unique field name.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:44.400
Then close this. Offer_name_2, drag this down to the Offer 2 tab underneath the price.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.985
So I'm going to need to duplicate the Offer Line 1 and Offer Line 2.

00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:50.535
So duplicate that one.

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:52.995
Offer Line 1, keep it at that.

00:03:52.995 --> 00:04:03.200
This I'm going to change the unique name to offer_2_line_1, and then close up.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.185
So offer_2_line_1, drag this down into the second section again,

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:15.320
just below the name, and we can duplicate this.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.820
This time, its Offer Line 2.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.120
This time, its offer_2_line_2, and close up.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.460
So I hope that makes sense so far.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.810
So we've got the tab for offer line 1 and the first offer has a price,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.495
a name, and then the two lines,

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:44.320
and then a second tab for the offer 2 and again,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.400
we've got the price,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.645
name, and the two lines,

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:51.200
making sure that each one has a unique field name.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.070
Now, we just need to do a third time for the offer 3.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.350
So duplicate the price,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.490
keep the name the same below offer_price_3.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.480
Then close that field,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.590
and drag the offer_price_3 down to the offer 3.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.695
After offer price, we need offer name again.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:24.670
So we duplicate offer_name_3.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.495
Then close that and drag offer name 3 down below the price.

00:05:33.495 --> 00:05:35.390
Then, we're nearly finished now,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.740
we just need to copy the line 1 and line 2.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.270
So offer line 1 and then the field name is offer_3_line_1,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:06:00.015
and then close, and drag that into its right place and duplicate line 2,

00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:03.760
this time the unique name is offer_3_line_1,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:15.390
and then drag that down to the very bottom.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.165
Now, we did not hit the "Uptake" button.

00:06:21.165 --> 00:06:24.375
I'll show you why we'll put it in tabs now.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:29.880
If you go over to the homepage and then select "Edit Page",

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.850
now we've got the Offer 1, Offer 2,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.940
and Offer 3 in individual tabs whereas if we didn't put the tabs in,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.585
we'd have a long list of fields and it may get confusing for the user.

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.855
So then if we go into the

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:53.280
front-page.php and then we can add the PHP to link to the custom fields.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.610
So go down to the latest offers section

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.400
which is going to really decide but to give you a small room.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.144
First of all, if we delete the price of the first offer and then open up the PHP,

00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:10.280
and then we use the same as the last video,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.040
the_field, and then in brackets,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.735
type in the field name.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:23.500
The first one, if we go back into the Dashboard on the Custom Fields,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:31.085
the offer price had the field name of offer on this call price.

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:34.850
We'll link that in there, and then copy

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:42.095
this and then paste this in place of the level 3 heading.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:45.210
This is called the offer name.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.990
So change offer_price to offer_name.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.925
The Family Pool, paste the PHP in,

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:59.650
and that is the offer_line_1.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:14.440
Great Day Out is changed to offer_line_2.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.100
That's it for the first field,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:28.090
so if we save that and then go over to the homepage and scroll down.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.795
You should now see that we've got an empty latest offers section

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:36.775
because we've not put in the text in place on the Edit page.

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:39.165
Offer 1, because this is all blank,

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:42.190
we've got nothing showing up, but we'll fix that soon.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.830
Keep going down to the second offer.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:57.920
This is offer_price_2, then offer_name_2.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.840
The first line text.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.380
We need to change that to offer_2_line_1,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:23.070
then offer_2_line_2, then down to the third one.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.170
Lastly, the price.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.640
So offer_price_3.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:37.335
Then underneath it, offer_name_3.

00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:39.960
Then the text.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.820
So its offer_3_line_1.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:56.130
Then lastly, it's offer_3_line_2. So save that.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:02.955
Now, our homepage should be blank or at least the offer should be blank anyway.

00:10:02.955 --> 00:10:08.215
All that's left now is put the content back in in the Edit Page section.

00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:11.650
So if you want to go off and do that yourself, feel free to do that.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.210
If not, follow along with me.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.840
First of all, the offer price was $60,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.700
the offer name was FAMILY OFFER,

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.970
line 1 was Family Pool,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.270
then Great Day Out,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.650
then go to offer 2.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:45.310
This was $120, the offer name was FOR THE BRIDE,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.440
offer line 1 was Hair & Make Up,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.180
line 2 was the Full Pamper Package,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.285
and then onto offer 3.

00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:11.740
The price was $90, and this was WEEKEND PASS,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.820
line 1 was Modern Facilities,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.610
then line 2 was Perfect Gift.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:33.150
Then Update that and go to the homepage. Let's take a look at that.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.810
We're just missing one of the fields there.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.220
Let's see what the problem is.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.845
Offer_3_line_2, that looks okay.

00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:49.240
Let's go into the dashboard into Custom Fields.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.760
Let's take a look at that and see what the problem is.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.575
I think we've got two underscores there.

00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:09.520
Let's just update that and head back to the front page, refresh.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.820
Still nothing in, no minutes added back in,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.920
I'll change the field name.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:27.400
Offer number 3, which needs to add the perfect gift into that and Update that.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.545
There we go. That's all working now.

00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:41.255
I just want to add a white horizontal rule just to separate the two lines there.

00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:47.045
Just add this between the offer_line_1 and offer_line_2.

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:50.580
Offer_line_1, just after the closing p tag,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.140
add a hr in there. Then copy.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.560
Then the same after offer_line_2,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.040
do the same in the second offer.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.965
After line 1 and 2, the same in the third offer 2.

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:13.620
Save and then refresh the browser. There you go.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.330
So that's how you use advanced Custom Fields in WordPress themes.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.230
Feel free to carry on and add as many fields as you want to the website.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.165
But I'm going to leave that there for now.

00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:26.670
Thanks for listening and will see you in the next video.
