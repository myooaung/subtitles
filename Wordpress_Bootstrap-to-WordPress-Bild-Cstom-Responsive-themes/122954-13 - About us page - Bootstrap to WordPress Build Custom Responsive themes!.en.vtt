00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.070
Moving on from the blog page that we finished in the last video.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.570
In this video we're going to be creating

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.885
the About Us page which is going to be pretty simple.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:14.835
It's going to reuse the header and the footer section from previous videos.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.635
We're going to have a pretty consistent level two heading and divide image.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.725
We will place it in some Lorem Ipsum text,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.960
which you can change to whatever text you want.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.510
Then we'll also have the links which we used on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.035
the homepage to various parts of the website.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.065
Then the Footer section at the very bottom.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:40.200
So let's go over to our text editor and we'll copy the index page.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.540
So Select All and Copy.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.665
Then command and N or Control N to make a new page.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:52.570
Paste that in and save this as about.html,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.040
again at the same level as the index page and save that.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.010
So from the bottom of the page we can keep the Footer section.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.590
This is going to be the same as the index page.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.590
We can remove the Shop Online section.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.610
We don't need that. We can also remove the Latest Offers section.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.270
We can keep the Facilities section.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
This is going to be our four image links.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.910
In fact, we can keep all of the Welcome section.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.625
We can just reuse the level two heading and the image.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.940
So let's start by renaming the Welcome section to About Us section.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.990
But make sure we change the id of the section to about.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.190
So we can keep the same container row on the same number of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.410
columns and change the level two heading to About Us.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.040
I can keep the purple image.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.150
So let's see how that's looking. That's okay.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.670
For now we can solve the alignment issues in CSS soon.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.090
So next we want to add a few paragraphs of text.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.070
So if we go over to Google and do a search for Lorem Ipsum,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.540
I click on the first link and we can use this page,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.020
to get some sample text.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.120
So I'm just going to generate two paragraphs.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.310
Select the first paragraph for now and copy it up.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.250
Then after the class and row tag for the level two heading,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.395
I'm going to create one more row.

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.970
So the div with the class of row.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.135
In the first paragraph,

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.085
I'll create some P tags.

00:02:58.085 --> 00:03:01.260
Then paste in the paragraph.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.950
Then just below this we'll create another paragraph.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:16.560
Then head back over to the sample text and copy the second paragraph and paste this in.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.150
Let's check that on the browser. There we go.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.105
So next we'll head over to our Custom CSS.

00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:31.510
So to start, we want to add some padding on

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.455
the very bottom of the page just to separate this section from the footer,

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:37.360
the link text is all out of place,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.730
so we'll set the text-align to be center.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.360
We'll also create a little bit of margin on the top and bottom of the paragraphs.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.960
So if we head back over to our custom.css,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.290
then create a About Us section.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.895
So give this section a id of about.

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:11.335
So let's start by adding the padding onto the bottom of the div.

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:20.560
I'll fetch pixels and then text-align to be center. Let's take a look.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.210
So the text-align has aligned the text into the center of the page.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.440
It's also made sure that our divide image is in the middle and also

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.070
the link text below is now 30 pixels off margin on the bottom of the div.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.200
So the last thing I want to do is add some margin to the top and bottom of the text.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.295
So let's select the about id and then the p tags.

00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:52.470
The only thing we want to do in this p is add

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.250
some margin of 30 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.530
and zero on the left and right.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.455
Then refresh. There we go.

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:08.860
So that's the text separated out and the About Us page finished.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.375
So thanks for watching.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:13.955
In the next video we'll create the final page for our Bootstrap template,

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:16.740
which is going to be the Contact page.
