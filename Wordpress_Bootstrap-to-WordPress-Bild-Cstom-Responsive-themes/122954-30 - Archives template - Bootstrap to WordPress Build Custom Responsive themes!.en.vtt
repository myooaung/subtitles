00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back. In the last video,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.100
we fixed the sidebar modules.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.309
When we select the month of the year or the categories,

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
WordPress and [inaudible] is down in the blog posts to what we've selected.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
In this video, we're going to create the archive.php,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
which is going to be the template which controls the look of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.915
the blog when we select on any of these archives.

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.530
To get started, head off to brackets or your text editor,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.400
and then create a new page and save this page as archive.php.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.025
Make sure that's in the project directory.

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:45.525
We're going to use the single.php as a starting point.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:52.550
Select all, copy, and then paste this back into our new page,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.575
which is the archive, and save that.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.580
Then back to the top of the page,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.305
we're going to create the comments.

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:06.200
The comment we need, we're going to call this The template for displaying

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.840
archive pages, and save that.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130
The page is going to look pretty much the same when we click on

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.760
the archives as when we clicked on the blog post.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.500
Let's take a look at the full view.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.180
We don't need to do anything in the archives template for now,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.750
but we do want to go into the functions page and make sure that the text

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.055
over the featured area is changed back to Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.835
But we're going to do something a little bit different this time.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:43.330
We're going to add a little bit more PHP,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.065
which will display just underneath the text.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:51.360
It will show us which category we've selected or which month we're displaying.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.430
Back into the text editor,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.245
and go over to the functions.php,

00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:59.485
and then it should be at the end of your Functions page.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.530
We should have the feature text function.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.475
We're going to continue this section with another elseif statement,

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:08.695
just after the last one.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:15.980
Type in elseif, and then the condition and the curly braces.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.739
The condition that we want to check is if the page is archive,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.010
and if it is, we're going to echo out to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.110
the browser to start with the same text of Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.100
We're going to copy and paste that.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.505
As we mentioned before,

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.670
underneath the text, we're going to put a new line.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.080
This line is going to show the month or the category that we're displaying,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.480
so let's make sure it goes on the next line.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.880
I'm just going to echo out a break tag,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.470
and make sure this goes to in quotations, just like that.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.635
To start with, we're going to echo out the category or the tag name.

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:05.810
We'll do that by typing single_term_title,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.430
and then the text we want to appear before the title is,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.300
browsing, and then a colon and a space.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.610
Let's save that and see how that's looking. Refresh the browser.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.435
Now, we've got the Tranquil Spa Official Blog text,

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:31.580
then the break tag, and straight

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.750
afterwards we've got the browsing text that we've just put in.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.355
The browsing text is then followed by the category,

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:40.260
which is, currently, offers.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.075
Let's click on news and check that's working.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:47.150
Now we've got the news section.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.340
I'm going to just try one more.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.130
Promotions. Good. Now, that was pretty straightforward to get that in there,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.020
but it's going to be a little bit more difficult to pull in the month of the post,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.670
but I'll show you how to do that now.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.470
First of all, we need to put in another if statement,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.495
which checks if the archive is being filtered by the current month.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:15.570
We put in the brackets, if is month,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.810
and then the brackets afterwards,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.615
and then create the curly braces.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.865
To get started, we need to find out which month of the year it currently is.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:29.495
I'm going to store that into a variable, so the $ sign.

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.750
I'm going to call this variable the monthNum,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.929
and let's set this equal to get_query_var,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.925
and then in brackets,

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:44.835
and the parenthesis, and the quotations.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.250
We're going to put in the month number,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.950
and then a semicolon at the end there.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.459
Next, we're going to create two variables,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.905
one for the month and one for the year.

00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:57.245
We'll start with the month.

00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:01.955
We're going to set that equal to the PHP date,

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:06.980
and the first parameter we're going to pass it in is the format.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.945
The formats that we want to return is a F,

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:13.915
which returns the current month in the long form,

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:16.615
such as January or February,

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.785
and then separated by a comma.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:22.820
Then next, we want to return the unit timestamp.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.920
We're going to do that by typing in mktime,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.850
and then we need to pass in some parameters.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.785
The first one is the hour.

00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:33.975
We don't need to put anything in there.

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:36.600
The second one is the minute.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.385
Again, that's zero. The third one is the second.

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:46.605
That's going to be zero. The fourth one is for the month.

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.955
Because we've created a variable called monthNum,

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:54.180
we can just copy that, and we can paste that in.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.105
That should return the current month.

00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:59.655
Then we create the year variable.

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:02.205
Year is going to be equal to,

00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:07.540
and we'll do the same as the month number, so get_query_var.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.330
This time we'll pass in the word,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.215
year, and a semicolon at the end.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:19.460
Now we'll create two variables with the month and the year.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.860
We need to echo this to the browser.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.290
Echo, first of all,

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.400
the text, which is going to be,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.010
post from, with a space straight after,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.105
and then periods at the variable.

00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:36.370
The first one is going to be the month,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.730
and then we'll add on a space.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.370
Put the single quotes with one space in between,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.200
and then we'll add on the last variable,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.610
which was the year,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.375
with the semicolon, and hit "Save".

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:55.160
Then head over to WordPress and refresh.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.350
We'll select one of the archives and see if this is working. That looks good.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.435
We've got the post from text,

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:06.105
and then we've added on the month variable,

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:08.350
and then the variable for the year.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.440
Let's just check the August ones and see if that's working.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.770
All appears to be working correctly.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.730
We've got the post shown from the current month.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.970
We've also got the categories of the current tag shown.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.525
Now, if you join me in the next video,

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:29.720
we'll continue with the website by adding the latest news page.
