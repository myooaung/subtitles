00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.630
Welcome to the last video in this Bootstrap template section.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.900
We've added the HTML for the Contact Us page,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.800
next we'll add the CSS to make it look a little bit more like the final project.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.980
So let's head over to our custom CSS.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.995
If we copy the comments,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:29.385
and we paste this just below the About Us section,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.890
we're going to call this the Contact Us section.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.715
We'll give this section a ID of contact.

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:49.184
To get started, I'm going to add some padding onto the bottom of the div of 30 pixels,

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:52.255
just to give it some space from the footer.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:56.210
We'll also add the text-align of center,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.145
and this will make sure that the divide image is in the middle of the page.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.055
Then next we'll start in the left-hand div.

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:07.555
So let's get started by adding some styling for the address section.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.390
If we go back into the contact page,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.080
we added a custom class of address.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.455
This class was surrounding the whole of the address section.

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:21.290
So back into the Custom CSS, we can use that now.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.995
First of all, we'll make sure the text is aligned to the left.

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:30.855
We'll add a bit of space into the top,

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:34.890
so that's a margin top of 30 pixels.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.980
To make the font-size a little bit bigger,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.910
we just increase the font-size to be 1.2 ems.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.620
To space out the lines,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.710
let's set the line height to be 2 ems.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.540
Let's take a look, and refresh.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.520
Okay, so next I want to change the color of the icons to match the rest of the website.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.115
Within the address class,

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.915
we could target the icons with the I.

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:15.040
So let's change the color of the icons to be 97689c.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.405
Let's take a look at that. Okay, good.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:24.480
That's changed the icon to the pinky purple color.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.745
That's all fine for now.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.980
So the next thing I want to do is match

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.265
the 30 pixels margin so the iframe is aligned at the top.

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:36.055
For now the iframe's stretching a little bit too big,

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:41.120
so we'll add the maximum width of a 100 percent to keep that within the container.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.260
Let's select the contact ID and the iframe.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.065
Let's match the margin top of the left-hand div to be 30 pixels.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:01.050
So the iframe doesn't get too big,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.205
we'll set the maximum width to be 100 percent.

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.470
Let's save and take a look at that.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
Great, so it looks a lot better.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.630
We've now got the two divs aligned from

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.260
the top and also the iframe doesn't stretch too wide.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.320
So the last thing I want to change is just add a little bit of

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.940
padding or margin onto the top of the message section,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.860
so it keeps that consistent with the rest of the website.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.185
We'll set that to be 30 pixels.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:34.470
So we'll give this section a custom class of message area.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:47.070
We just need to add some margin onto the top of 30 pixels and refresh.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.300
Great site, looks good on the desktop view.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.290
If we just shrink the browser down to the mobile view,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.380
there's not a lot we really need to do,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.680
there's just one thing that I want to change.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.015
We need to add the text line to be center on the mobile view.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:08.500
So we can do that down in the media query.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.295
Because we've also got the footer class of the text-align center,

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.635
we could just add this onto the end.

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:18.715
So we can add our class of address,

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:25.460
and save and take a look at that. Great. So there we go.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.810
So it looks a lot better.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.220
Now that's the Bootstrap template finish for our projects,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.880
and that's the end of this section.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.685
So thanks for listening. If you join me in the next section,

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:38.910
we can start by converting our Bootstrap template to WordPress.
