00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.850
When building WordPress themes it is really important we

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.660
consider non-English speakers who may be using our themes.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.525
This section is all about preparing our theme,

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:18.180
and providing the ability for people to translate the theme into different languages.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.625
Now most of us don't have the ability to fully translate the theme ourselves.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:26.940
However, what we can do is develop whole theme so it can

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.750
be easily translated by others or in other words,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.015
make our theme translation ready.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:36.735
This process is known as internationalization,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.050
and there's also another term that you may come across called localization.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.505
We'll look at this more in the next video.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:47.545
This is the process of actually translating the words in the theme,

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:48.980
but in this video we're just going to look at

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.595
the actual preparation or the internationalization.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.325
Actually making our theme translation ready.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.670
It's not as difficult as it may sound.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.855
There's a few steps to need take such as adding a function to our functions file,

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.500
creating the languages folder,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.825
to store all the translations in.

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.480
We also need to look through our theme templates,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.675
to let WordPress know which words we'd like to make available for translation.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:22.265
To get started, over to the text editor or actually you can go over to the themes folder.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.205
We're going to the tranquilwp folder.

00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:27.700
Then we're going to add one new folder,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.640
and call this languages.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.150
Then we need to go into the functions file and link this in the theme setup.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.290
So over to the functions.php.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.290
I'm going to add this within the tranquilwp setup function.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.550
Right at the top, we need to use a function,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.380
load_theme_textdomain, and then the brackets.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.180
If you remember the text domain,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.835
we set that in the style.css,

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.190
in the comment at the very top.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.575
We need to make this the same as the text domain, which we put in there.

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:14.560
We can copy that. Then back into the functions.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.240
The first parameter within the quotations is the text domain.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.430
Then we need to put inside the file path to our languages folder that we just created.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.220
We separate it by a comma,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.770
get_template_directory, then the brackets.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.350
Then we need to concatenate onto the end, the languages folder.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.555
I spelled that right. Within the template directory,

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.625
we then have the languages folder.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.635
Use the forward slash,

00:02:54.635 --> 00:03:01.350
and then languages, and then end that with a semicolon.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.940
Now the next step is to locate any texts or strings which we want to make translatable.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.210
In this video we'll just be concentrating on the text strings,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.275
but in the next video we'll take a look how to translate function calls.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.795
For now, let's start by going into the 404 page.

00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:21.570
I want to start from the top.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.250
So we'll start with the 404.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.540
We need to identify any text strings.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.310
In the 404 page,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.700
at the top we echo into the browser, some text there.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.970
We want to make this available for translation.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.170
The way to do that, is just after the text, add a comma.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.325
Then simply between quotations,

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:51.455
paste in the text domain of tranquilwp, and then save that.

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.885
Then down to the archives page,

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:58.665
we need to locate any text strings. So scroll on down.

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:00.000
There's an echo function there,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.280
so we need to translate this text.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.475
Again, we'll just separate the text with a comma.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:10.035
Then in the quotations put in the text domain.

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.350
So WordPress can identify it, and that should be off.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.540
Now we'll look at the functions in the next video. Save that.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.105
Then moving down to the comments,

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:24.500
because this is the comments file for the twentyfourteen theme,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.355
I'm just going to use a search and replace.

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.329
We can see that some of the functions,

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:34.385
it's already there include the twentyfourteen text domain.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.080
So we need to replace all of these.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.845
I will go through and do those individually or do a search and replace.

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.325
In brackets, you just go to Find,

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:49.005
Replace, and look for the word twentyfourteen,

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:53.580
and replace that with tranquilwp or your text domain,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.065
and hit "Batch" There's eight matches isn't there.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.020
Hit "Replace" and then save that.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.420
The next one is the content-facilities.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.955
We need to do the links for this page.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:13.785
At the minute, we just got plain text for the four links.

00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:17.550
We want to change that to be a php echo function.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.515
Start with the php tags,

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.145
and then we use the shorthand,

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.525
which is the underscore,

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:30.325
and then e. Then surround the text in the brackets and a quotation,

00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:35.010
with the semicolon at the end [inaudible] and.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.230
Now we've got the text ring.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.155
Use the comma to separate that,

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:42.615
and then put in the text domain.

00:05:42.615 --> 00:05:44.870
Just to speed this process up,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.520
I'm just going to copy this,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.040
and then move down to spa facilities,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.000
and replace the hair and make up with the spa facilities text.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.710
Paste that in, and don't forget to close the php tags off there, and just there too.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.590
Copy that. Then next we've got the lakeside retreat.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.370
Again, copy the text,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.340
and replace spa facilities with the lakeside retreat text.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.110
Then we do the same for the very last link.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.360
Cut that text, and paste the last one into there. That's the last one there.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.170
Again, because we've got the text domain immediately following the string,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.675
WordPress knows that we want to translate this.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.290
We'll show you how to do that in the next video.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.275
Save that file, and we'll move on to the footer.php.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:56.280
Let's start with the level 2 heading at the top of keep in touch.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.355
We need to transform this to an echo,

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:05.025
so php, I will see shorthand underscore e,

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:08.500
and then the text in brackets.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.405
Also put this in single quotes.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:14.595
Then straight after the string,

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:17.110
put in the text domain.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.170
So tranquilwp, and then after the brackets,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.960
semicolon and then close off the PHP.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.750
So it's just a couple more to do on this page.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.660
The first one is the Follow Us text.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.925
So we should be getting the hang on this now.

00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:37.660
So PHP and then echo,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.145
then surround the string in the brackets.

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.500
Don't forget the quotes.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.765
Then separated by a comma,

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:51.010
paste in the text domain, tranquilwp,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.740
and then the semicolon and close it off.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.095
Then in the footer section,

00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.990
there's the Tranquil Spa name at the very bottom.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.325
So we'll just copy this php, just to speed that up.

00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:11.450
Then in the place of the Tranquil Spa text, paste that in.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.510
Then change back the text to Tranquil Spa.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.060
Save that, that's all the text for the footer area.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.785
So after the footer,

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:29.270
it's the front page.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.245
So from the top, we need to change the level two heading.

00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:38.050
So I'm just going to paste in the php.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.270
I'll just tidy this up a little bit and indent,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:49.840
and then copy or cut out the title and replace the Follow Us section.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.095
Save that. So let's copy this again.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.830
Then scrolling down the page for more strings,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.170
we need to do the same with latest-offers.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.370
So I'll do exactly the same as before,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.140
I'll just cut out this level two heading and paste this in.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.650
Then keep going down the page,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.660
so scroll down further down.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.140
The next one is the level two heading again of Shop Online.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:32.570
So I'll cut this out and add this to the string.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.425
Then just going on down a little bit further,

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:40.120
we've got the Shop Here text,

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.100
which is part of the button.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.250
Again, pasting the php and change the text to be Shop

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.995
here There we go.

00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:57.130
So hit Save and we'll keep moving down the page.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.605
We don't need to do anything in functions.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:02.170
So next it's the header.php,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.380
and I don't think there's anything we actually need to change in the header.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.535
We've got the title which is dynamic,

00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:12.340
we've got the navigation menu at the top,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.730
but all the page names are pulled in dynamically.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.480
So they'll be set to whatever language the user preferred anyway.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.685
So keep going down.

00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:24.460
Notice there's nothing to change in the header.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.415
So next is the index page.

00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:31.164
So scroll down and take a look for any echo functions.

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.265
We've got the category there,

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.710
so straight after the category name,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.350
put in the text domain of tranquilwp.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.445
Then keep going further down the page.

00:10:42.445 --> 00:10:45.085
There's also the Read more text.

00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:47.930
So exactly the same in there, tranquilwp.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.820
Then that's it for the index page.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.620
Next we've got the page-about.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.960
So we've got the about us level two heading.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.420
In fact instead of making this translatable,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.935
we'll actually make it dynamic,

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:12.535
so we'll change up to the_title as we've done with some of the other sections.

00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:15.460
So that's fine to leave as it is.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.945
We've got the main paragraph of the About Us text.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:23.680
So I'm just going to leave this section because this will probably be better as

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.505
a custom field to allow the user to type in their information.

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:34.400
So we'll just save this one for now and take look at the page-contact.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.410
We've got the title already in there and I think that's actually okay to leave.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.195
There's nothing to change on there.

00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:49.045
So down to the news page.

00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:52.970
Let's take a look for any strings to translate.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.915
So we've got the category.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:12:01.430
So change that to have the text domain in, the tranquilwp.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.310
Again, the same as the index page,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:12.380
we'll do the same for the read more text. So tranquilwp.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:19.225
The pager, the older and newer post will actually need translated too.

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:21.820
But we'll do that in the next video in a slightly different way,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.565
so we can just leave the news page for now.

00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:27.910
So down to the page.php,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.430
so our basic page template.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.800
We've got the echo function there,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.190
so we're going to add the text domain straight after there.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.690
So tranquilwp, and don't forget to save that.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.590
Then next after the page is the search template.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.355
So take a scroll down.

00:12:48.355 --> 00:12:51.200
Again we've got the category.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.310
So we change that. We've got the Read more.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.575
Okay, so now we'll move on to the sidebar.

00:13:08.575 --> 00:13:11.275
So there's no strings to translate in there,

00:13:11.275 --> 00:13:16.510
so we move down to the single.php and take a look at that.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.025
So we've got the dynamic title.

00:13:18.025 --> 00:13:21.080
I think again, we need to do the category.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.425
Scroll down further down,

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:28.705
we've got the error message.

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:31.610
So add the text domain into there.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.580
So that's as pretty much finished.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.780
I just want to actually go over to the functions page because we did

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.430
add some strings into there with our featured_text function.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.730
So just one or two strings we need to change in there.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.920
So I'll do exactly the same.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.165
Add the text domain, and if I'll just copy this one.

00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:59.245
So paste that one in just below.

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:04.910
We could do the same for the browsing text, so paste that in.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.000
Then just one or two more at the bottom.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.765
Because this one's got formatting,

00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:19.420
we're going to actually leave that and do that in the next video.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.160
We're going to do that in a slightly different way.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.735
I think that's it for all the text strings.

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:27.430
So we'll save that page.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.630
So when we download the software to make this translatable later on,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.765
we should get all these text strings available to translate.

00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:37.060
So that's it for all of the text strings,

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.305
but if the text is part of a function,

00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:41.540
we need to do this in a slightly different way.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.115
If you join me in the next video,

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.180
I'll show you how to do that.
