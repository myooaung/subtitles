00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.190
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.160
we are going to be creating the footer section for our index page.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.550
If we go back into our text editor and underneath the shop online section,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.060
let's just copy the comments and paste them below,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.190
and we'll call this the Footer Section.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.820
We don't need to use the section tags like

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.845
previous sections because there is a footer tag we can use in place.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.380
We use the footer tags.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.560
Because the level 2 heading on the image

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.255
for the footer section is pretty similar to the last few sections,

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.210
we can just copy that section from above.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.890
We've copied the container from the shop online section,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.850
and paste it in-between the footer tags.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.900
We don't need the button.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.760
So we can delete that section.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.110
The shop online section is going to be "Keep in

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.530
touch" and just after text-center,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.930
we're going to reuse the margin-bottom class,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.080
which we used earlier on up in the latest offers section.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.020
This is going to push the content away from the divider.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.065
Let's save and take a look at that, and refresh.

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.785
There's our level 2 heading and the divider.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.475
Next, we need to create a new row,

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.140
which is going to have the address on

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.710
the left and some of the navigation links in the middle,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.285
and then some of the social sharing buttons on the right.

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:54.690
To put these three sections in,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.820
we'll create a new row just underneath the last one.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.750
So a new div with the class of row,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.450
and then within the row we're going to create three more divs,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.380
which are going to be four column divs.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.630
Div class, then col-sm-4.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.760
We can copy this div,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.635
paste it in two times.

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:29.415
The first div has the addressing,

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:33.675
so we are going to be semantic and use the address tags.

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.800
The first line is Tranquil Spa,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.075
and then add the break tag.

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:44.895
Let's add some address lines,

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:50.160
so address line 1 then the break tag.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.630
Duplicate this two more times to create address line 2 and 3.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.860
Then the second div had the unordered list with the navigation.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.470
Between the ul tags,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.120
we'll create four list items and between the list tags we'll create some links.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.685
So a href, and the first link is going to be about us.

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:26.175
This will link to about.html and we'll put that link in there for when we create that,

00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:29.410
and the text is About.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.015
Copy and paste or duplicate this three more times.

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:40.050
The second link is the Contact Us.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:49.450
Let's change that now and the link is going to be contact.html.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.415
The third link is to the blog.

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:56.445
The link is blog.html,

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.010
and the text of Blog.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.380
Then lastly it's the Latest News.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.430
We can just delete the link there because we are going to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.145
be generating that dynamically in WordPress.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.870
So let's take a look in the browser.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.505
There we go, we've got our first two sections.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:21.770
Now, we just need to create the social media section on the right.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:30.250
For the div, we'll begin with p tags and the text of Follow Us,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.440
and then below the Follow Us text,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.980
we're going to use the Font Awesome icons for links to social media.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.395
We add the Font Awesome icons with the i tag,

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:46.330
and then add a class.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.055
So the first class is fa.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.615
We need that for all the icons.

00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:56.920
Then the Facebook icon is fa-facebook.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.195
Then to make the icon slightly larger than normal,

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:08.430
we add the class of fa-lg, and then close up.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.790
Then create four more links.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.895
The second one is the link to Twitter.

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:20.535
We need fa-twitter.

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:24.550
Icon 3 is Google Plus,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:37.900
and then Pinterest, and then finally it's YouTube.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.735
So let's save that and see how that's looking now.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:48.500
Good, we've got the five social media icons where they should be.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.530
Then the last thing we need to do is add the copyright section at

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.495
the very bottom of the page. Let's add that now.

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:03.515
So just below the container but stored in the photo section,

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:09.700
we'll add a new div with a class of container-fluid,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.985
so it spans the full width of the web page.

00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:22.420
We'll also add an id of copy for copyright,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:35.680
and then a div with a class of col-sm-12 to make a 12-column container.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.150
Then the text between the p tags,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.270
we'll add the copyright symbol,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:50.350
which is ampersand, and then copy; 2015 Tranquil Spa.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.550
Then let's add some comments.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.670
This is the closing div for the row.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.990
This is the 12-column container and finally the fluid container.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.810
Let's take a look. Great, so that's all the HTML I did for the homepage.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.355
If you join me in the next video,

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:25.920
we'll finish off our homepage by adding the CSS.
