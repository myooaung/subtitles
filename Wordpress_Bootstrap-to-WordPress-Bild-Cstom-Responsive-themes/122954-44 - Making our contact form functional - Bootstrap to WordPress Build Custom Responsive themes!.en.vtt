00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.970
Welcome back. Earlier on in the course,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.280
we created the Contact Us page,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.220
and the link is down at the bottom in the footer.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.635
If we go into the Contact Us page,

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:16.410
we've still got the bootstrap design at the very bottom for the Send us message section.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.090
But it doesn't actually work at the minute because it's just HTML and CSS.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.610
In this video, we are going to make sure that this

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.945
works by using a popular plugin called Contact Form 7.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:33.240
So we'll go over to the "Dashboard" and select the "Plugins",

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.730
and then in the search box,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.680
so we go to "Add New" first,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.160
then in the search box,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.890
search for contact form 7.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.940
Contact Form 7 is one of the most popular WordPress plugins for creating contact forms.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.630
Hit "Install Now", and just got a few moments to install,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.850
then go to"Activate Plugin".

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.655
Once you've got that installed,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:12.740
you should now see that there's a new option in the dashboard called Contact.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.160
Click on that, and by default there's already one contact form there as an example.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.975
Click on "Edit", and when we take a look out how it's constructed.

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:26.495
So this section here is going to be our contact form.

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:30.350
In just a moment, we're going to head over to the contact us template and then we're

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.910
going to cut out the contact section and paste it in.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.980
We need to replace some of the values in the form using

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.255
the same formatting the contact form requires.

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:42.185
When working with this form,

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.755
each one of the sections is a particular input.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:48.290
We need to put the input type

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.220
and also the rest of the information between the square brackets.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.030
To start with, let's take a look at the first example.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.015
This will create a input with the type of text,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.075
and then followed by the star.

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:06.135
The star means that this is required,

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:11.140
so the user must enter the name before they can submit that,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.360
and then your name, which is the name of the input,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.810
and then pretty similar examples below.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.710
We've got the type of the input type of email,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.495
which is a required field,

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.490
and the name is your email.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.670
We can also add values over inputs such as text areas and submit buttons.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.565
I'm just going to delete this for now,

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:39.145
and then we're going to go over to our Contact page.

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:42.710
We need to go to the page-contact.php,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.020
and then we're going to copy the full section for the contact form,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.645
and then look for the div with the class of well,

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.160
which is right at the bottom,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.795
so look for that, and then find the closing div or the closing tag.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.160
Copy all this section.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.665
In fact, I'm going to cut that out because you don't need it anymore,

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:09.625
and save that, then we can paste this into the contact form.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:12.680
The first thing we want to do is delete the form

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.835
tags because these added back in automatically.

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.925
Delete the opening and the closing tag.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:24.115
Then we need to replace our input types,

00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:27.065
so just delete the full input section,

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.185
first of all for the name.

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:34.430
Then we'll put these back in in the same format as we looked up before in the example.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.395
So between these square brackets,

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:40.730
the first one has a type of text and this is for the name,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.530
so we want this to be required,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.675
so put the star in there,

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:48.160
the name of your hyphen name,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.775
then we need to put our classes back in,

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:53.625
so the class and then a colon.

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:58.420
Then the first one is going to be form-control,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.540
and we also had an id in there,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.709
so id with the colon of inputs-name,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.765
and we can also add the placeholder text,

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:15.920
so placeholder, we don't need a colon after that,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.795
so just a space.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:19.835
Then between the quotes,

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:21.980
put the name of name.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.560
That's all we need to do for the name input.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.320
I'm just going to copy this and then go down to the next input,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.960
which is the email.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.895
So delete that and then replace that with the code in the square brackets.

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:39.810
This time, instead of text,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.695
this has got the type of email,

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:44.960
and we'll also leave this as required.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.955
The name this time is going to be your-email,

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.780
and we still need the class of form control.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.360
But this time the id is going to be inputs-email.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.200
On the placeholder text is simply email.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.115
Next, we'll replace the text area so delete that section,

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:10.350
and then paste in the new code.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.009
This time, the input type is going to be textarea,

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.485
we'll leave this field as required,

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.990
but this time change your name to your-message.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.210
The class of form control, we can keep that there,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.235
but we need to change the input,

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:34.020
it's from input name to input-message.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860
Then after that, we need to tell the form

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.595
how many lines for the text area to display as default.

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:42.320
So we're going to set mine to three,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.310
so we do that with an x and then 3.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.480
Then the placeholder text changed from name to Message.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.885
Then the last part of the fall is the input,

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:58.210
so delete the submit button from the bottom of the form,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.155
then open up the square brackets.

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:05.275
Inside, we give the type of submit,

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:10.105
the class is going to be the bootstrap class of btn,

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:14.500
and then the second class of btn-default.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.445
So there are the same as we've used in the bootstrap site,

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:26.280
and then the text in brackets of Submit, so "Save" that.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.330
Because we've taken the contact form out of the contact template,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.740
we need to put this back in.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.335
If you copy the short code,

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.125
so copy that part,

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:41.835
then head back over to the page-contact.php,

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:45.920
and in the same section that we'll just cut the code of,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.470
open up the php,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.570
and then we echo to the browser,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:00.320
do_shortcode, then in the brackets and the quotations,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.810
paste in the short code and say that.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.780
Now, if we go back into the WordPress sites and hopefully,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.220
if we go down to the Contact page,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.310
we should see the contact form all working correctly,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.220
which is, so that's good.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.960
So that's all displaying fine is

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.320
one or two little things we need to change in the "Dashboard",

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.230
so go to the "Contact" section again.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.455
It's actually get this form to send to the website administrator.

00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:33.350
We need to put in the email address to send to.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.255
That can be done in the Contact form under the Mail tab.

00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:41.060
We can change the default values and instead

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.240
the email address you'd like the messages to come through to.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.400
You can also go in the Messages section,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.685
and you can change the messages that the user gets once he send emails,

00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:54.375
and as default values already set in there,

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:56.970
but these are all available to change.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.890
Once you've changed up, hit "Save", and that's it.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.055
Now, we shall have a fully functional Contact to section.

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.380
Thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video.
