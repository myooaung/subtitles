00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.650
This is the Contact Us page that we created in the Bootstrap template.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.010
Now we're going to convert this over to WordPress in

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.180
a similar kind of way to the bow page we created in the last video.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.295
So it's going to be pretty straightforward to

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.645
convert now to most of the hard work in Bootstrap.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:26.170
So as usual, we're going to create a new page and services page-contacts.php.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.635
Then we're going to use the page news template to get started with.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:39.990
So copy all the contents and then paste it in.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.870
Then back up to the comments.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540
We'll do the same as before,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.195
but this time with changes to Contact Us. Then save that.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:55.550
If you go over to WordPress and then into the dashboard,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.750
and then look for the page that we created.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.040
So the Contact Us and edit.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.570
Then change the template that we're going to use to be

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.300
Contact Us and then obtain that page.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.680
Then backup to the text editor.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.785
So we are going delete all the block section and also the sidebar,

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.175
all the way down to the footer.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.985
So leaving the header and the footer in.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:29.900
Then next we need to find the Contact Us page we create in Bootstrap.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.125
So go back into the traquil-bs folder.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:38.335
Then dragging the contact or HTML into your text editor.

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:42.760
Then we'll copy this section which is the contact bar.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.930
So look for the Contact Us section comments.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.210
Then copy all the way down to the close and section tag,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.805
which is just before the footer. So copy that.

00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:00.750
Then paste this in between the header and the footer.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.155
Then back to the top of the page.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.145
So a couple of small changes to make on this page.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.785
First of all, we got the level two heading,

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:11.615
which is just static text.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:15.420
So we'll change this to be WordPress php.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.340
So php, the underscore title. Then close it off.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.325
Now use php, it's pull in the page title.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:30.200
We need to fix the image file paths.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.760
So I'm going to go back into

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.620
the front page and also copy the same part that we did last time,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.025
which is the php.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.045
Again, don't forget the forward slash.

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:49.200
So back into the contact page and paste this before the divide image.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.970
I don't see these anymore.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.205
No, I think that's okay.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:01.545
So let's see that's working.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:04.185
So go back to the site.

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:08.610
Then in the footer menu select Contact page.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.400
Okay, good. So the only thing to do is the feature tech section.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.200
So we should know how to do this by now,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.245
if you go to Functions.php,

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:25.850
and we'll use the same blog info name and also the page title.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.620
So it's pretty simple to add.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.940
We can add this to the same function.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.450
So copy this page template and then paste-up below.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.110
We need to put the awesome link and change page about the page contacts.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.870
Okay. So save and then refresh.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.380
So that's the Contact Us page now finished,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.690
and join me in the next video when we create the falloff page.
