00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.540
Okay. Now we've got our local host and WordPress all installed.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.640
We're now going to get to work on importance of

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.715
the bootstrap folders into our custom theme.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:17.100
If we go back to the MAMP folder and then under the HT docs,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.905
we can find our tranquilwp folder. Open this up.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:26.420
These are all the files and folders that's included with WordPress by default.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.320
Most of the work that we'll be doing for the custom theme will be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.630
inside WP Content and then inside the themes folder.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.685
Inside the themes folder,

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:42.185
there's the standard default themes that are included with WordPress.

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.705
2015 is the most current.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:48.730
That's one that we see when we opened up our website before.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.960
Inside the themes folder,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.795
let's get started with our custom theme.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.900
If you go to new folder,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.330
I'm going to call this tranquilwp.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.710
If we open up the tranquilwp folder and also our bootstrap folder,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.690
we can start putting in some of the folders into our custom theme.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.875
I'm just going to select all the files for now and copy,

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:25.585
and then paste these into our folder.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:30.875
We don't need about the blog or the contact page just for now.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.650
I'm just going to get rid of those.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.560
The index page, we need to change this to index.php so that WordPress recognizes it.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.310
We use a PHP extension there.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.210
We need to keep the images,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.110
the JavaScript, the CSS on the fonts folder.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.045
But within the CSS folder,

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.490
we need to move our custom CSS

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.845
file and we'll need to move it to be at the same level as our index page.

00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:03.320
If we select the custom CSS,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.010
and it moved up back one level,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.470
and with the index page on the folders,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.205
because that's where WordPress requires the CSS to be.

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:17.585
Also, it requires style.css,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.460
rather than the custom.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.600
We'll change that to style.css.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.110
As well as being our custom style sheet in our style.css,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.075
we can also include some important WordPress information about our theme.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.345
If we go back into our text editor,

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:42.825
you may need to refresh because we've changed some of the files and folders.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:47.705
On the tranquilwp, if we go to content,

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:52.140
themes, and then tranquilwp,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.565
we can then find the style sheet that we just renamed.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:58.640
Right at the very top of the page,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.785
if we just make some space,

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:04.590
we need to go back into the web browser.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.605
So head over to Google.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.115
I'm just going to do a search.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:13.425
If you search for codex,

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:17.480
codex is basically the WordPress documentation.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.910
We're using that quite a lot in this section,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.794
to find lots of information such as PHP functions.

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:29.380
For now, if you just search for the codex theme style sheets,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.780
so it's a top link we need,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.015
but if you just click the jump to theme style sheet,

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:40.430
and this will jump to the part of the page that we need.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.890
Under the theme style sheet heading,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.590
WordPress gives us a sample of

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.450
the comment that it needs to include at the top of the style.css.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.480
Let's copy that sample,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.780
and then paste it in at the top of our style sheet.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.970
Let's get rid of this sidebar and we can start editing the information.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.900
Right at the very top, under the theme name,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.215
we're going to put our theme name which is tranquil WP.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.435
Then the theme website.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.825
You can put in anything you want in there for now.

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.390
You just want to put something generic in there for now.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.710
tranquilspatheme.com.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.150
On the author,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.660
you put your name in or the name of your company.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.400
If you've got a website, you can also put that in there.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.170
Then you can put in a description for the theme.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:51.800
I'm just going to put in a fully responsive WordPress spa theme,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.140
built using Bootstrap 3.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.840
There we go. The version,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.460
we can leave at 1.0, and the license we can leave.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.709
We're going to change some of the tags.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.205
Now, bear in mind that the tags that were put in the style sheet,

00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:17.765
we can't just put in any tag that we choose.

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:20.285
They've got to be WordPress approved tags,

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.580
which you can find in the codex.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.670
For now, I'm just going to add the right sidebar.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.625
Then these are separated by commas.

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:35.200
Responsive layouts,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.920
custom header,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.850
and custom menu, featured images.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.770
Then in the end, translation really.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.020
Now, some of these, you may not understand what they are,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.530
but as we go through the course,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.320
you'll understand more and more of what each one of these is.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.720
We'll be adding things such as featured images and we're making

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.580
the theme ready for people to translate into different languages if they want to.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.090
The text domain, we are going to make it the same as

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.375
our theme name. That's going to be tranquilwp.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:25.130
We'll use that later on in this course when we're making the theme ready for translation.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.680
We can delete the information at the bottom.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.615
There we go. That's all we need to include in the style sheet for now. Save that.

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:38.540
If we go back to our theme folder,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.640
which is in the HT docs,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.820
then open it up, and then go, again,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.350
to WordPress content, themes, and tranquilwp.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.560
The last thing we need to do before we activate our theme in WordPress is,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.920
if we go to the images folder in our custom theme,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.880
if we locate the screenshot.png,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.580
we need to move this over up

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.280
one level into the same directory as we moved our style sheet into before.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.070
Then if we go to our web browser,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.015
and then back to our WordPress dashboard.

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:22.620
If we go to the Tranquil Spa in the corner and hover over,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.600
and then click on the dashboard.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.905
Basically, the dashboard is really simple to use.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:33.665
Down the left-hand side, we've got a list of all the links

00:07:33.665 --> 00:07:36.815
where we can add various posts, pages.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:39.665
We can change things such as the themes.

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:44.610
If you go down to the appearance and select themes,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.650
so as you can see, active is the 2015 theme,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.535
but we want to use the Tranquil Spa theme that we just created.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:58.445
If all goes well, you should see your theme appearing on this page,

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:03.450
and then click on Activate. There we go.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.540
Now if we click on the Home icon in the top left,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.620
on the Visit Site, hopefully,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.725
that all went well for you,

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.780
and your theme should now be activated.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.460
As you can see, it's all working,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.800
but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to make

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.545
it look like our Bootstrap template.

00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:24.115
Let's start by adding some of the folders that we need.

00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:26.875
Back into our theme folder,

00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:28.550
in the HT docs,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.110
one thing you may want to do is setup a shortcut on your desktop,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.430
or if you're using a MAC,

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.280
you can add one of the color tags so you don't need

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.130
to go through the process of finding every time.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.670
MAMP, and then the HT docs,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:53.085
tranquilwp, content, themes, and then tranquilwp.

00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:56.075
For this tranquil folder,

00:08:56.075 --> 00:09:00.010
I'm just going to create the blue tag,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.435
so I can just select the blue and find it a lot faster.

00:09:04.435 --> 00:09:06.500
If you're using a Windows machine,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.725
you maybe want to save a shortcut on your desktop.

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:14.060
We need to add a few more basic files into our folder.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.130
If we go over to brackets and bring up the sidebar,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.325
I'm going to press Command and N to create a new page.

00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:28.480
The first page we need to add is the header.php.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.480
Just save that as header.php,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.900
and make sure that's included in our custom theme,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.480
along with the index page.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.620
We'll save that for now, and then another new page.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.300
Save this as the footer.php.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.645
Then just two more to create.

00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:02.875
The next one is going to be for the sidebar,

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.900
and let's save the sidebar.php.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.805
I'm going to use a shortcut this time,

00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:13.310
and save that in with the index page.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.105
Then lastly, the last file we're going to save is for the functions,

00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:26.050
so a new page and save that as functions.php.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.420
Again, making sure it's in the right location.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.760
That's it for now. I will see you in the next video.
