00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.430
So if we go onto our website,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.610
all of the pages as it stands,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.280
say Full Responsive Premium Spa theme for WordPress at the top,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.420
and that goes for the homepage, the blog page,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.330
and any other pages that we're going to be creating such as the latest news,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.965
the Contact Us, and About Us.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.510
So I want to make sure that the feature text at the top of the page

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.485
reflects what page we're on rather than it just being static text.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:34.705
The reason it's the same text on every page is because if we go in the header.php,

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:37.409
we've just got static HTML.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:42.055
So I'm going to change that in this video by adding a php function.

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:45.110
So if we delete all the text between the P tags,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.420
but make sure the tags are still in place,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.045
and then open up the php,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.630
and then the closing brackets,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.130
we're going to add in our own custom function,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.260
and I'm going to call this featureText,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.755
and then the brackets and semicolon.

00:01:04.755 --> 00:01:07.670
That's all we need to do in the header section.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.400
We're going to create this feature text function in the functions.php.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.470
Then if you go down to the bottom of the functions page,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.320
just underneath the last function but still within the php tags.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.840
Let's make a little bit of room for those cells.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.730
So the function keyword,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.405
then a function name which was featureText,

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:34.920
and then the brackets, and then pair of curly braces.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.685
So inside this function is going to be an if else statement.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:45.125
So WordPress will be checking if a certain page is being viewed.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.105
If a certain page is being viewed,

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:51.400
then we're going to set the correct text display in the featureText.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.830
So we'll start off by using an if statement.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.780
So if is_front_page.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.460
So if we're currently viewing the front page,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.870
then want to echo to the browser,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.180
the text that we just cut out of the header section,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.944
which is Fully Responsive Premium Spa Theme for WordPress.

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:22.020
So FULLY RESPONSIVE, and then a break tag,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.170
and PREMIUM SPA THEME,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.390
followed by the break tag,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.010
FOR WORDPRESS, and then save that.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.475
Then just after the curly brace there,

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:43.240
we're going to use else if rather than else

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.060
because we can use as many else ifs as we want.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.160
So as we go through the website,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.035
every time we create a new page,

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:52.015
which is the Contact us page,

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:54.410
we'll create a new condition for that page,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.325
and then we'll print out the appropriate text.

00:02:57.325 --> 00:03:03.015
So elseif, and the curly braces.

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:08.960
So the condition for the blog is we check is_home.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.250
So WordPress class is the homepage as

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.715
the area where the main blog posts are being displayed.

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.620
So we've got the front page,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.970
and then we've got is_home,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.430
for the home of the blog posts,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.540
this one will echo out the browser,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.780
and a semicolon at the end of the first one too.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.705
So echo out to the browser.

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:37.500
If it's the blog, we want this to say Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.975
So let's save that and take a look if this is working.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:50.225
So refresh the WordPress website.

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:51.965
That seems to be working so far,

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:57.745
we've got the blog page selected and the text is changed to Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:00.125
Now, if we go back to the homepage,

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.920
we'll get the original text that we set so that's all working fine.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.590
So we'll leave that for now and we'll keep adding to

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.060
the functions every time we add a new page to the blog.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.610
So thanks for watching.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.010
In the next video, we'll create the page template to display the full single blog posts.
