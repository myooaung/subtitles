00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.345
In the last video, we moved down to the Latest Offers section of the website.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:10.545
In this video, we are going to be completing the Shop Online section.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:15.465
Now, the Shop Online section is a relatively straightforward section.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.515
We're going to use a similar level to heading on divider,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.230
as we have done in the last two sections.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.495
We're going to add a button,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.780
which is going to be a link to a Shop Here section.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.370
There's also going to be a large background image on it via the CSS.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.290
Over in the text editor,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm going to start in the index page and create a new section.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.710
I'm going to paste the comment just below the Latest Offers section.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.760
This is called the Shop Online section.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.570
This has a section tag with an ID of shop-online,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.260
and an usual bootstrap container on row.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.170
So div with a class of container.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.180
Then within the container, we have the row.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.755
We'll copy the heading and divide the section from the last section.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:37.360
We'll copy the six-column section and paste that within our own row.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.090
The level 2 heading is the Shop Online text.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.290
The image, we need to change to be the purple image because it's on a white background.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.660
Just below the divider,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.870
the a and href is going to be blank for now.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:10.480
The class is going to be the bootstrap button class, so btn btn-default.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.905
Then the role is going to be equal to button.

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:21.550
Then close the link off and not the Shop Here text,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.440
and let's take a look in the browser.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.080
This is our heading divider and also the button default.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.910
Now, we can easily make the button appear in the center of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.045
the page just by adding a bootstrap class.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:41.915
To the container, just after the number of columns,

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:47.070
we can add the bootstrap class of text center.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.930
Now pushes the button into the middle of the div.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.340
That's all HTML we need to add for this section.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.270
We'll just close off some of the divs with comments.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.120
This one is the closing row in the final container.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.450
Okay, so next, we need to go into the custom CSS.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.340
I'm going to add the styling for

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.235
the button defaults and also at the large background image,

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:24.100
just like the final website.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.455
Over to the custom CSS,

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:30.720
so let's get started with the button.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.885
So because we are going to be using the button later on in the course,

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:38.750
we're going to add it to the Global section at the top.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.275
I'm going to just underneath the image.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:46.630
The class was btn-default.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.980
Let's override the default bootstrap values which involve row.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.160
First of all, the background color of the button will not be the blue color,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.180
which is 8393ca, and we'll add a border,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.455
a free pixels border, solid.

00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:22.600
The color is going to be ecf0f1 and a 5-pixel border radius,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.165
and then some paddings to make the border a little bit bigger,

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:32.610
15 pixels on the top and button and 30 on the left and right,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.170
and the text color is going to be white.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.330
Let's take a look. The button is looking good,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.775
we just need to add the hover state.

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:54.890
If we go back into the CSS btn-default and then hover,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:07.050
we change the background color to be 97689c.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.090
When we hover over the button,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.730
we've got the same purple color as the background.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.740
Now, let's go back and create a Shop Online section.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.825
We'll copy the comments,

00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:25.030
and just above the MOBILE STYLING again,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.790
we'll call this the Shop Online section.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.835
Let's start with the background image.

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:43.030
The section had an ID of shop online.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.435
We can change the background by adding background and then url,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.480
and then, in brackets,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.370
we can add the file path.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.630
So dot dot to go back to the home directory, foward slash images,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.920
and then the images we want is products.jpg,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.415
but will not be in the center.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:19.280
Lastly, no-repeat. As it stands,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.720
the image is in place,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.925
but it's only taken up the same height as the content that's already in place.

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:29.855
We can change that by adding the minimum height.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:34.040
I will set the minimum height to be the same height of the image,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.585
which is 852 pixels.

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:43.125
Then let's change the text color of the Shop Online heading.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:50.980
The color is going to have the value of 494646.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.825
Then finally, just to separate the button from the divider,

00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:59.935
we'll add some margin to the top,

00:06:59.935 --> 00:07:08.970
so the shop-online ID and then the btn-default.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.760
Let's push the button down by adding some margin on

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.950
the top of 25 pixels and let's see how that looks in the browser.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.035
Okay, there we go, the button is now pushed down from the divider.

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:26.625
That's the end of the video.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.060
Thanks for watching, and if you join me in the next video,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.570
we'll finish off the bootstrap homepage by adding the footer.
