00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.645
Our custom WordPress theme,

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:05.235
it's starting to take shape now.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.210
One of the main problems that we can see is that the images that we included

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
in the Bootstrap template aren't appearing in the WordPress site.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.345
We need to fix that now.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:20.130
To start with, the majority of the images are in the index page.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.475
We head over to index.php.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.710
To get the images to appear,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.365
we need to correctly change the file path.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.200
The first one is in the "Welcome" section,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.615
and this is the divider-purple.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.780
Inside the image source,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.915
we're going to start the php tags,

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.420
the opening and closing tags.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.690
Then we use the same function that we used to include the file path for the CSS.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.200
So echo esc_url.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.670
Then in brackets, we'll

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.970
get_the_templates_directory_uri

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:06.645
and then a pair of brackets.

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:10.555
Make sure you put the semicolon at the end again.

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:12.810
Just open up the sidebar.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.570
We're getting the template directory uri,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.460
which is our theme folder.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.145
Then we'll include in the "Images" folder,

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.275
which is in the Root Directory.

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:25.260
Make sure that you've got a slash just before

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.560
there because that isn't added in automatically.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.490
Let's just save that and check that's working before we go any further.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.065
There we go. There's our purple image.

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.890
Let's just "Copy" this to save a lot of typing.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.770
If we just copy everything from the forward slash before

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.335
the images folder up to the Opening php tag,

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.175
and then go down to the Facility section,

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:58.440
and then just "Paste" this before each one of the images.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.110
The makeup, the candles,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.910
the lake image, and the pool.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.355
Then we have the silver image in the Latest Offers Section.

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:22.800
"Paste" that in and scroll further down to see if there's anymore we need to change.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.730
There's one more image in the Shop Online Section.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.770
Let's save that and see how that's looking and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730
"Refresh" the browser. We're getting somewhere now.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.470
That's looking better.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.090
We need to include the main background image,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.800
but that's in the header.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.930
We'll do that now.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.030
In the header.php,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.995
scroll down to the Feature Section and "Paste" that in front of the lakeside image,

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:55.145
and then save and then refresh that.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.780
Good. We're getting somewhere now.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.915
Let's scroll down to the footer section.

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:05.350
There's just a couple of images we need to include in the Footer Section,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.660
which is the divider image and also the "Shop Online" background image.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.440
The footer.php then scroll up for the divider.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.505
"Paste" that in and "Save" then "Refresh."

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:25.605
It says, "A divide image."

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.560
Then it's just the "Shop Online" section image

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.350
and we added this as a background image in the CSS.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.260
Head over to the "Style.css" and then scroll down to the Shop Online section.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.600
For this to work correctly in WordPress,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.590
we need to delete the slash and the two dots.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.150
Save that and then refresh.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.470
That's the image appeared in the background,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.610
which we need to make sure the "Shop Online" button is below the divider.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.635
I think we're just missing a break tag.

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:04.775
Back to the index page,

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:08.220
we've got the heading and the divider image,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.185
and then the button straight after.

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:15.690
I'm just going to add break tag into there and then refresh,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.860
and hopefully that should work.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.810
That's great. There we go.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.345
That's working perfectly now.

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:25.515
I think that's all the images covered in the index page.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.480
I'll just scroll up and down and see if anything's missing.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.630
Great. Our homepage now looks as it should do.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.360
We've got all the images now in place and it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.210
looks exactly like the Bootstrap template that we created.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.740
Thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video.
