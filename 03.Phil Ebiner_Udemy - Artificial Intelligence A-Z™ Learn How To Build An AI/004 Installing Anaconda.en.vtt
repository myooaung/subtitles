00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.990
Hi Guys welcome back to the artificial intelligence course we're going to implement our solution in

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.820
Spider Anaconda which is an idea that I highly recommend because it's like a studio.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.230
You'll have your editor where you implement your code.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.560
You have the console to execute code and some other features like a way to easily look at all your variables

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.520
that you create during your implementation.

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.370
So therefore it's all good to Google.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.990
And if you don't have a nick on that yet let's download it to you just type here.

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.400
I kinda just like this.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.020
And here we go you can take the second link download Anaconda and now depending on your system make

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.630
sure to choose the right system.

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.260
I think it should automatically be detected if on Windows.

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.400
Click here if you click here and if you're on Linux click here.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.080
I'm on Macs all good and now make sure to download bidon 3.6.

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.150
So make sure to click this download button for Biden 3.6.

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.730
And now the download just started is right here 40 seconds on my computer.

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.080
Here you have the option to get a cheat sheet.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.090
You can say no thanks.

18
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.380
You can close this.

19
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
We will need it for our implementation's.

20
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.030
All right.

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.240
So I'll accelerate until the download is over.

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.270
All right here we go.

23
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.440
Download over.

24
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.380
So now let's go to our downloads folder which is right here and here is the file that I just downloaded.

25
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.630
And so this is the installation fell that will install Anaconda.

26
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.310
So you just double click on it then you click Continue continue continue continue agree and install.

27
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.400
And this will install Anaconda.

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.140
It will just take a few minutes maybe less and you'll get an icon they'll get the spider studio on which

29
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.800
we will implement our AI solutions.

30
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.890
So again I'll accelerate until the end.

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.620
Perfect.

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100
The installation is over.

33
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.390
You don't have to install Microsoft virus codes.

34
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.460
You can just click continue here.

35
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.340
And here we go.

36
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.010
Let's just close it.

37
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.320
You can keep it or move it to the trash.

38
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.060
And now we have Anaconda.

39
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.630
So I'm on a Mac here.

40
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.670
So the way to get an I can do is just go to applications and then they'll click on Anaconda and then

41
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.380
begetter.

42
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.140
And for Windows users you'll find Anaconda in your list of programs you know by clicking the windows

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.160
button and then find an icon here or you can just type and I can dial in the research bar.

44
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.500
And again you have to open an account a navigator and for Linux users same you'll find an icon the navigator

45
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.880
in your list of programs or applications.

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.020
Well I'm sure you'll find that very easily.

47
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.520
So let's double click on that.

48
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.490
This will open Anaconda and inside an will find several IDs and will choose spider.

49
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.280
Here we go.

50
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.130
So we are inside on the.

51
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.660
And indeed there are several IDs including Jupiter notebook which is a very good one.

52
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.710
And of course spider which is the one will choose for this course as in fact any other of our courses.

53
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.240
So to open spider we just need to click launch and he we go this will launch spider and that is exactly

54
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.030
where we are going to implement our AI solution.
