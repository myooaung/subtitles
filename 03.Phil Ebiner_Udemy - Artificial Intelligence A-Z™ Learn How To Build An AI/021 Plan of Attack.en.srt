Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,220
In today's section we're tackling the topic of a deep Q learning.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,200
So let's see how we're going to attack this in this section.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,280
We will learn a deep learning intuition the learning side of things so we go into separate deep learning

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,840
the intuition behind it into two parts to learning and acting.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,620
And we're going to have to details on that.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,290
So first of all understand how the neural networks actually learn and how they update their weights

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,350
based on what we are feeding them in and how the whole concept of learning works or how we're going

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,140
to take the temporal difference concepts or rediscuss and simple learning and apply them into deep learning

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,550
and then we're going to talk about how deep learning algorithm actually decide what action to take in

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,530
what states we're going to talk about experience replay a very important addition on top of deep learning

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,420
which actually enables deep you'll learn to work properly and you'll see why it's important from that

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,100
tutorial.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,350
And then we're going to talk about action selection policies.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:11,190
We're going to talk about how deep kill earning agents are able to combine exploration with exploitation.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,960
So once they found something a good approach they can use that approach but also they need to explore

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,900
so that they don't get stuck in a local maximum.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,660
And one more thing I wanted to mention about the section is it is highly beneficial if you have a look

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,050
at an x number one artificial neural networks.

20
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,570
So if you go and explore all those topics we've got some very powerful intuition tutorials prepared

21
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,500
for you there.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,130
If you haven't done of course if you haven't done the deep learning course if you've done that you plan

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,400
of course and you already know all of these things and you can proceed with S..

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,950
But if you want to get that additional knowledge about neural networks before you proceed with this

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,020
part of the course this is highly advisable because it will help you understand exactly how neural networks

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,230
work and why they're so powerful why we're leveraging them in this deep cool learning algorithm.

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,450
And once you refresh your knowledge or gain that knowledge on neural networks from that annex and come

28
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,900
back here and we will proceed with particularly if you're pretty comfortable in neural networks then

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,160
let's get straight into it.

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,040
Let's start talking about deep learning intuition.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,450
And I look forward to seeing on the first tutorial.

32
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,840
Until then enjoy a.
