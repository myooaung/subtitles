00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.630
It all three.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.050
OK.

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.610
OK.

4
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.280
Hi guys.

5
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.460
Hi guys.

6
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.860
I'm the first to talk because I'm on the subject.

7
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.180
Hi guys.

8
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.710
Hey hey.

9
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.280
Tell me when you're ready.

10
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.230
Hi guys.

11
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.520
Welcome to the Statoil.

12
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.100
As I told you in the last it will surprise you.

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.420
What is it.

14
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.240
Hi guys.

15
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.990
Curious I get to say hey guys there is a surprise which is this life I guess.

16
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.770
Hi guys.

17
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.160
Welcome to the Statoil.

18
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.440
And as I told you in the previous Statoil I have a surprise for you.

19
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.150
Carol is here with me to surprise right next to me so.

20
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.440
Hey guys.

21
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.860
Surprise here.

22
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.370
Are you excited to see the results.

23
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.010
Subrace I learned together talking about it for a long time now.

24
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.550
Yeah.

25
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.350
And just so you know the students have been really struggling with me to write these lines of code.

26
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.250
We have 156 lines of girl now we're so relieved to finally watch the results.

27
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.240
Great job.

28
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.110
OK.

29
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.980
So to get the results was very simply we're going to select the whole code just before we execute.

30
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.600
And as a reminder you have the videos folder and do much too.

31
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.730
And right now this for a reason it's going to be populated as soon as we see us with some videos of

32
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.230
so it's happening in real time yes real time.

33
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.600
OK.

34
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.170
Good stuff.

35
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.560
OK.

36
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.960
All right.

37
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.850
Are we ready.

38
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.180
Yes let's do it.

39
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.240
Execute.

40
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.780
And there we go starting with the first video.

41
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.790
So first we are are you recording that's your first attempt at playing the game.

42
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.490
And there we go the first average we were negative.

43
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.580
That's pretty bad but that's totally normal.

44
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.610
Right now the eye is exploring and train line 41.

45
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.220
Yeah and remember we have to watch the 1500 too.

46
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.870
I think we were lucky on this one.

47
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.330
This is the first time I see this you know reaching such we want to as you see just do it just like

48
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.620
he was just like you.

49
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.210
OK.

50
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.000
Interesting.

51
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.650
Yeah.

52
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750
So what does it mean if it reaches 1500 Oh.

53
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.880
So if it reaches 1500 means that we know 100 percent that the eye will have reached the best.

54
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.140
This is the one way it's got to get to that best as soon as possible.

55
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.480
Yes.

56
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.720
Yes.

57
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.700
Actually we.

58
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.840
We have time to explore opening night.

59
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.340
Yeah.

60
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.520
You know we're playing this.

61
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.130
Do we ever do as you can see this mission to run as fast as possible to grab a target so you know it's

62
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.450
like we were super positive when it's reach you that's pretty fast.

63
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.780
Yeah.

64
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.310
So it really tried to reach us that doesn't like this is a special one because it doesn't really have

65
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.040
to even kill the monsters it has to figure out that it needs to run.

66
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.120
It has to figure out the best strategy to reach as soon as possible.

67
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120
Maybe it's best just to kill the monsters.

68
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.960
But I think so yeah maybe it's to avoid the monster maybe it's to run very fast labeling the monster

69
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.460
I don't know.

70
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.400
Yeah but yes that's definitely a goal to reach the best as fast.

71
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.020
OK that's interesting interesting.

72
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.100
There seems to be going down.

73
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.910
Is it going down.

74
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.680
No it's normal.

75
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.630
I think we're just at the beginning.

76
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.880
And it's you know you know there is the training and it's doing some stuff and I think you know it it

77
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.090
went far too far but it got killed.

78
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.880
And so it was not a good strategy because it took some directions you know towards the monsters that

79
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.360
got killed but still it got form because it reached more than 1000.

80
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.170
But we're going to see that video actually you know the video or recording so we're going to see that

81
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.190
to watch each one of them.

82
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.800
OK.

83
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.380
So unless they get points for stuff.

84
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.000
But the biggest Poinsett Yes the most prestigious for the best of us.

85
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.530
Well it's a continuous war.

86
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.670
You know when it's approaching the west it's getting a continuous OK.

87
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.560
If it's getting further away from the base it's getting it's getting the negative rewards.

88
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.410
For example at one Mannis 41 it got further away from the vest or it got killed.

89
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.740
Yes getting killed also gets you back to work.

90
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.470
Gotcha.

91
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.290
Gotcha.

92
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.650
OK so walk me through the main section of the code.

93
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.900
OK.

94
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.030
So so at first we made the brain the brain yeah.

95
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.240
Yes the convolutional areas which are the eyes of the eye and the forward function that propagates the

96
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.670
signal inside the brain.

97
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.210
OK.

98
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.430
OK then we have to we made the body and that is the part of the eye that plays the action.

99
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.040
OK.

100
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.820
So we see this we used the soft Max way of getting the airplane reaction of.

101
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.300
What's the best action you know.

102
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.160
Yes.

103
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.170
And so the cool thing about this next method is that definitely the best action is playing.

104
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.240
But the other actions are explored.

105
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.780
Yeah.

106
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.830
Because it works on a probabilistic approach.

107
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.930
You know the other actions have low probability to get played.

108
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.260
But still it's probably a yes or no no.

109
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.980
So sometimes since then we know we take a random drop from a distribution of probabilities of the actions.

110
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.860
Well sometimes these other actions are played.

111
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.420
And so that's a way of exploring that.

112
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.930
You know that's something we talked about on the Internet or else the fact that you got to combine exploitation

113
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.680
and exploration.

114
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.930
Right.

115
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.610
Exactly.

116
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.890
Otherwise you might get stuck and walk on that black smoke and you'll never find the other Maximals.

117
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.230
Exactly right.

118
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.270
And by the way guys as you can see I think that's the expression face being over because right now the

119
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.220
average word is definitely increasing.

120
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.590
Look you know we went up to 697 But then we went down then went down again.

121
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.490
But now we reach 525 then eight hundred and eighteen.

122
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.450
I think the ice starts to get smart and I think the average word might be increasing.

123
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.540
That's great either.

124
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.290
Take my soul.

125
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.880
Me too me too.

126
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.570
I was very surprised at the beginning because actually we oh I see.

127
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.900
Next ever increasing.

128
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.470
So I think now the exploration phase is over exploring and I think it's it might be reaching very soon

129
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.390
when exploration phase is over.

130
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.880
Is it fully over or is it so randomly sometimes not it's not fully over but is less likely to explore.

131
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.510
Yes that's likely to explore.

132
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.250
That's right.

133
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.480
Now I bet that the average work is going to keep increasing.

134
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.490
That's a reach you know the last checkpoint which is this 1500 rewards buys me off.

135
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.490
It's like when you come to your country you go to because they have new groceries different groceries

136
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.550
which you said you've got your grocery shopping experimental something something something you don't

137
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.280
like in your life.

138
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.760
And then sometimes figure out oh this is what I like to have for lunch and then if you're just buying

139
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.520
power.

140
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.640
But occasionally you'll go out and buy something new to see how you like it.

141
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.130
Yes I bet you do that often.

142
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.650
Exactly.

143
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.080
And then once in a while you'll find all are so cool and you'll change your pattern or have a little

144
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.960
bit yes.

145
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.890
I think that's that's kind of like something that's a good analogy.

146
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.760
Yes.

147
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.960
All right so we might reach the final average soon but let's continue on the cold.

148
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.380
Yes.

149
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.160
That's a great way to summarize it.

150
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.850
So as we made the brain in the body we assemble the brain in the body to make the whole day.

151
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.660
And that's the section Yeah.

152
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.950
And we have this whole fourth function that propagates the whole thing from you know the original input

153
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.630
image then through the brain and then through the body and then the actual space.

154
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.990
So it was actually an analogy you know to make your brain and thinking is actually a body.

155
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.530
Right now you would never see the eye with a brain in the body that any of the resorts.

156
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.970
It's just the way we're seeing it.

157
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.390
So the brain makes decision.

158
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.210
The body then acts on decision.

159
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.010
Yeah exactly.

160
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.200
That was just a way to play with the objects and object oriented programming to make it into his head.

161
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.700
OK.

162
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.370
OK.

163
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.390
So that's part one making the hand with the brain and the body.

164
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.690
And then part two is of course is of course the training of the.

165
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:44.460
So in the training of course the employment eligibility trace which is an instant cure and then the

166
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.290
deep convolutional Kiran is that instead of learning every step you're getting.

167
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.600
We want every step and getting to every step we compute accumulate if we win and cumulative targets

168
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.050
and steps.

169
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.830
And we did it on 10 steps and that improved the training a lot.

170
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.510
That's pretty good.

171
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.100
Yeah.

172
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.730
And then we make a movie average and that's.

173
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.400
It's like a school function.

174
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.750
And finally of course we train the eyes.

175
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.100
That's the cutting thing.

176
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:16.240
I know we have our inputs they go into the new one at work and then we get in there because we also

177
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.330
have a target we can get a prediction to the target that generates a loss than the last areas back propagate

178
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.640
into new network.

179
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.860
And then we place this into data weights to try to minimize the distance.

180
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.900
Well actually the square distance between the predictions and the time it's yes.

181
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.130
So that's exactly what we do here.

182
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:41.170
Plus again we're getting deeper in working with our networks basically.

183
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:50.190
And then finally we print this out to our inbox at each epoch so that we can see and keep track of how

184
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.550
the ice cream.

185
00:08:51.660 --> 00:09:00.480
And finally we print if we reach 1500 We print that's something we still need to get to yes.

186
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.520
OK.

187
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.100
So how's it going right now.

188
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.610
Okay.

189
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.080
So you were right.

190
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:11.260
It is still exploring a little bit because it's definitely reaching an average where the largest one

191
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.950
thousand year.

192
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:19.680
But still you know it's still exploring because we want it doesn't want to get to 1500 yet and do it

193
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.110
soon.

194
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.120
OK to start looking at the first video.

195
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:23.890
Okay.

196
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.320
And that's a good idea.

197
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:34.950
So there's video so we all we have four videos when you have so many more because it's not recording

198
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.400
that you frequent.

199
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.610
So it's got to zero.

200
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.500
But the first the age when you see a new one is just randomly.

201
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.450
Yes.

202
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.610
OK.

203
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.550
So here's the first video.

204
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.510
No doesn't know what it's doing right.

205
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.640
OK.

206
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.130
Then secondly it might not be much better.

207
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.720
Oh yes.

208
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.520
Maybe because it's nine seconds now.

209
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.060
So old Kilborne.

210
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.670
Yes.

211
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.980
Good.

212
00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.530
Two to three.

213
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.470
All you got to the last.

214
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.420
I get to do that again Larry.

215
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.420
I know what it is.

216
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.220
This is a lucky one.

217
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.140
The Lucky One played played again.

218
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.630
OK.

219
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:24.060
So go book you it say that they're not ready for war.

220
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.790
That's that's that's the perfect catch.

221
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.310
But as we said is this the best strategy to reach to this is nicest possible.

222
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.440
Probably not.

223
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.880
So let's see how how the carrot is going.

224
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:34.780
OK.

225
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.710
Still so sick.

226
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.970
All right let's do the next one.

227
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.300
OK.

228
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.700
Next one

229
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.110
or two seconds.

230
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.600
He stopped shooting.

231
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.960
You decided to explore the pacifist version.

232
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.990
I get to make friends.

233
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.290
I was going to befriend them all to the vast majority.

234
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.020
So the next one.

235
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.900
Once again we all got there.

236
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.570
OK.

237
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.100
You got it.

238
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.530
Yeah but what if if you got the rest pretty much right away.

239
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.430
Yes.

240
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:15.160
Then how much like how would you get more points because you know the faster you get to divest the more

241
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.610
positive is your reward ouster.

242
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.200
Can you go even faster than that.

243
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.430
Yes I think so let's watch the next one.

244
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.660
Say he understood it he's not OK.

245
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.450
He was running towards the best as you can see we see some of the directions left and right.

246
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.740
I think the best best course when we just try right strips.

247
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.250
OK.

248
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.590
OK interesting.

249
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.200
But you can see that he's getting play play 27 on here.

250
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.840
Let's see.

251
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.810
You know this one's on

252
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.520
right now.

253
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.570
OK so they're pretty simple.

254
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.330
So guys I think you know 1500 was too much.

255
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.770
Yeah I think you know it might be a good average two to research.

256
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:05.710
Once you choose this 1500 by 1000 then maybe you'll get to video that with your winning.

257
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.920
Yeah I think you've got to experiment that as well.

258
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.990
So it looks like because it's like converging.

259
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.810
Right.

260
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.320
They go down 300 1300.

261
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.290
Yeah.

262
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.220
Looks like he's figuring it out.

263
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.170
But we can see that he's figured out that he's on to the play.

264
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.710
Let's wait until I put 25 maybe he reaches 1500.

265
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.990
But anyway you're right that was really quick.

266
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.610
That's.

267
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.570
The training didn't take much time.

268
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:40.570
That's also why you think that is because I think it's because of the LGBT to trace their back into

269
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.730
the method.

270
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.600
OK.

271
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.460
There are actually other bodies that can play the action.

272
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:54.150
There is also as we saw in the paper which is this paper you implement this algorithm.

273
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.010
I think is and.

274
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.030
That's actually we see paper from deep mine that's going to be critical.

275
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.700
But as you can see in this algorithm they take action according to Neptune reports.

276
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.920
So that's another that's another body that's another way of playing the action.

277
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.280
So that's also good.

278
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.410
But I wanted to end too many soft necks because I thought the results would be better.

279
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:18.020
But guys if you want to practice try implementing Ipsden grip.

280
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.110
OK.

281
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.140
So how are you going 23 so far.

282
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.030
So the 100 is going to go another video.

283
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040
Twenty five.

284
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.730
Yes.

285
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.530
OK.

286
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.230
Interesting.

287
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.130
Well it's doing you know what I read recently.

288
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.310
No.

289
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.130
Why.

290
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.740
Why.

291
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.020
Computer games don't use artificial intelligence like we created.

292
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.960
You know like for example those monsters that are killing him.

293
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.550
Why.

294
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.120
Well that's an old game but even in New Games they don't use these algorithms full of monsters.

295
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.650
You know what.

296
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.160
No.

297
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.270
Why why why.

298
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.950
Well I think I need some more powerful algorithms in that because he's talking about the video when

299
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.480
it's killing over and over again.

300
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.450
Which one.

301
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.040
You know the video of the airplane.

302
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.540
Yes.

303
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.380
No no no no no.

304
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.450
I mean like if when you as a human you play a game.

305
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:13.980
Yes.

306
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.570
And against you there's AI AI that against you in a computer.

307
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.060
OK.

308
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.250
Why they don't use these algorithms.

309
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.280
Oh we can truly use these algorithms.

310
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.430
For example I almost implemented an algorithm to play against me.

311
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.560
I had the pong game yeah.

312
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.320
So we can.

313
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.780
But the thing is they don't on purpose that was impossible to beat them.

314
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.560
I think they do.

315
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.990
There is a soccer player.

316
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.530
Think about is a good game if they use something like this.

317
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.970
It just gets so good that you will never win.

318
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.770
Yeah.

319
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.690
Yeah that's why they have to really dumb it down.

320
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.240
Yeah.

321
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.630
So any artificial televisions playing even in the most basic game like chess and whatever.

322
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.760
But like especially in the more advanced himself going to be like this album because it's just got to

323
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.780
be impossible to.

324
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.590
This is going to kill you right.

325
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.060
Exactly.

326
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.880
Because I also get suspicious suspicion online gaming gets so much access to so many human players.

327
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.050
So you can train all different human play behaviors and you can understand what humans judiciously actually

328
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.930
instantly.

329
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.810
The guys in the video games are nothing like this.

330
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.230
Yeah.

331
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.800
Because as you said we would have no chance.

332
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.320
There's funny is like something somewhat post-box.

333
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.100
OK.

334
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.300
So how are we doing.

335
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.430
Well definitely increasing strength.

336
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.810
So he found a way right.

337
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:32.810
Look look at that like between 13 and 24 7 airports you're stuck at a thousand.

338
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.820
Yes the threat of thousand one hundred and now he finally found a break.

339
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.170
Maybe he's like Yavanna way John Foster somewhere maybe.

340
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.690
I think I just can't imagine how he can even improve even further.

341
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.400
Yes.

342
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.180
OK.

343
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:53.080
I remember he reached 1900 1900 when I went out there.

344
00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:00.890
I was definitely running fast but then I said you know I don't think there's much difference.

345
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.730
And there we go.

346
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.790
Finally he recorded this video as well.

347
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.060
Yes it did actually add records to the air every five six months.

348
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.690
So wait see.

349
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.600
Just like that where we got this video.

350
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.700
Yes we are.

351
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.420
But anyway we already this guy.

352
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:21.230
So I thought yes I was going to ask you like what if he.

353
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.060
But we don't recall the winning.

354
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.940
Well we would like to but I guess I would have won it.

355
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.210
Let's watch the last one.

356
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:29.530
OK.

357
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.380
So congratulations guy.

358
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.310
Cissoko Fiat 1500

359
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.610
I can't really call.

360
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.680
That's the one right.

361
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.270
Yes.

362
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.690
And you know I don't think that's too busy 236 and right now is 2:43.

363
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.160
Where's the video.

364
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.450
Good question.

365
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.720
The video.

366
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.450
It should be very soon.

367
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:56.780
You can.

368
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.460
Or maybe dinner with you.

369
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.670
No it didn't actually I didn't finish writing results.

370
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.270
You know like I can die.

371
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.450
Well that's it it's all good.

372
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.900
Yeah this one is good enough.

373
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.860
That would be really very fast.

374
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:21.190
My friend that was on the peaceful way in trying to make friends this one I think is a shallow are not

375
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.620
a good idea actually.

376
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.940
The next time that's next and to really understand the difference.

377
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.960
Yeah.

378
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.330
OK.

379
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.790
OK.

380
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.800
That's pretty cool.

381
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.500
Yeah.

382
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.500
That's so exciting.

383
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.350
Hope Hope you guys got the same results.

384
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.990
And I think you guys might get the results before the epic's 26 because I actually tried it several

385
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.620
times.

386
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:47.960
And sometimes you can get them at number 10 or 15 but 26 is the first.

387
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:48.910
OK.

388
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.470
OK.

389
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.910
So that's the end of this module to know what is going on to the next module about celebrating your

390
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.580
breakout.

391
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.330
Yeah.

392
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.910
You guys excited for a while is break out the last one because it's the most difficult one is the most

393
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:08.520
challenging one and the simple reason for that's the main reason for that is that the little ball that

394
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.210
deep convolutional neural network has to detect is much smaller than the big monsters do much more much

395
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.550
easier to detect.

396
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.110
That's the reason.

397
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:24.170
And actually we once implemented the congressional Kulemin will implement the Botha's algorithm of course.

398
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.790
Yeah.

399
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.140
What we see.

400
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.330
Yay.

401
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.240
So exciting.

402
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.820
OK.

403
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.310
OK.

404
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.000
Good stuff.

405
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.690
Good stuff.

406
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.820
So I hope you like it.

407
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.220
And congratulations for building your second act up.

408
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.390
Thanks guys.

409
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.510
See you in the next section here.
