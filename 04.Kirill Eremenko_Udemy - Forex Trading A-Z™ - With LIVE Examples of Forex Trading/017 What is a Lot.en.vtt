All right so lots and lots is a measure of volume of a transaction on the forex market.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.630
One lot equals to one hundred thousand units of base currency 0.1 laut equals to 10000 units of base

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.660
currency zero point zero one lot equals to 1000 units of base currency also 0.1 laut is called the Mini

4
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.770
lot and 0.01 lot is called the microlot.

5
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.020
Tell us Have a look at an example.

6
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.540
For instance you want to trade the Euros dollar and you want to conduct a bi transaction with the volume

7
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.140
of one lot.

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.260
That means that you will be buying one hundred thousand euros in that one transaction.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
The ask price with your broker is currently at one point 2 3 2 to 8.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.550
And that means that in order to buy one lots of euro a used dollar you need one hundred and twenty three

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.290
thousand two hundred twenty eight American dollars on your account.

12
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.010

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.490
