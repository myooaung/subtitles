Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,800
And welcome back to of course and for training today I've prepared a really exciting tutorial for you

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:07,860
.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,980
We're going to be talking about indicators.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,280
So let's jump straight into it.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,860
So as you can remember we talked about that the price has four main elements the high the low the open

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,600
and the clothes.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,240
So indicators are basically aggregators of these values.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,180
So you have a stream of values of high open low clothes coming into a terminal all the time.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,600
And what indicators do is they process these values to kind of give you a different perspective on the

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:39,980
market.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,460
So let's have a look at a particular example here.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,050
Got the price chart and say For answers we take the most the bar that's most to the right and we take

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,150
its high and then we take it slow and we subtract the high from the low.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,500
Well that difference is called the true range.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,350
It just basically indicates what the volatility or the amplitude of the market movement was for today

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,570
.

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,380
So that's good.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:13,080
So that's one of the things that you can derive from price and that's that's an example of an indicator

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,750
because that value.

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,960
The true range is not actually given to you by default.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,690
But you can derive it from these two values.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Next let's take the two range for the next bar.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,210
And then the sex change for the bar after that and then we'll take one more range.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,510
So what we're going to do all of these for true ranges is we'll take the average of these for ranges

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,330
and that will give us the average true range in the past four bars.

27
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:48,690
So that tells you not only how volatile the market was in the in the current day but also how volatile

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,900
the market was over the past four days on average because if you take one day you can have an anomaly

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,810
or some some news might've come out but when you average it out it tends to smooth out the facts and

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,230
therefore you see a representative picture of the markets.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,990
So what we can do now is we can pluck this average to range on our chart.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,110
So let's make some space will move up this chart a bit.

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,390
And at the bottom we'll have a new chart.

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,180
So let's plot this calculate average should range under the last bar.

35
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,560
So this little blue cross at the bottom or presents the hours sure arrange for the previous four bars

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,170
.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,060
Next we'll continue like that and we'll take the average to arrange for the full bars before the current

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,600
one so excluding the current one.

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,920
What's the average range before that will plaudit as well.

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,740
Let's do that again.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,090
Once more we've got four bars we've got the average sheer range plot plotted under the last of the four

42
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,710
bars.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,290
We can do that again and again and so on.

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,610
We just keep going as far left as we want to and we get all these little cross at the bottom.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,230
So now we're going to do is we're going to connect the crosses with a line and that's what it looks

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,830
like.

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,740
So now what we've actually constructed is the average true range indicator with a period of four.

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,730
You can actually take this find the syndicator and mentored or four and then drag it on to your chart

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,290
and you'll see exactly this picture.

50
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:30,600
And sometimes traders they're a bit scared of all these complicated indicators and they know they kind

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,590
of learn the names.

52
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,950
They learn what they represent for the market but they don't know the calculation.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,230
Well this example shows that the calculations behind these indicators are very often very simple in

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,750
most cases they're very simple you just take the sum of the values from the open low high and close

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,110
you do something with them.

56
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,880
You take an average and you plug it on the chart.

57
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:00,420
So it's a very good idea to actually understand what's behind the indicators that you are using in your

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,220
trading and not not only what they mean but also how they're calculated.

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,610
So right now we know that this average range indicator tells us how volatile the market has been over

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,210
the past four days and to finish off today's tutorial Let's have a look.

61
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:21,060
Quick look at that was strange on a real chart in better shape or form.

62
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,490
So here's a chart which snapshot from Editor for and at the bottom we've got the average to arrange

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,660
with a period of 14.

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,100
That means that every single element in the average range represents the smoothed out true range of

65
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,990
the past 14 bars and that's has been changing and that tells you of the market volatility.

66
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:48,000
So right now you can see on the right the range is somewhere about average meaning the market is not

67
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,710
in its most volatile time.

68
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,900
And you can use that in your trading so maybe a trading strategy tells you that you are trying to avoid

69
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,540
volatile times because there are more they bring more uncertainty and you want to trade during less

70
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,650
volatile times.

71
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,030
Or maybe you want to try doing more volatile times and take big movements and big impulses.

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,540
So there's lots of indicators on the market.

73
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,200
They're all constructed differently.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,510
Have a look around you'll definitely find some that you like some that you don't like in our trading

75
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,730
.

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,970
The one we will focus on is the moving average and we'll talk about that in next tutorial.

77
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,430
I look forward to seeing you then.

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,360
And until next time happy trading
