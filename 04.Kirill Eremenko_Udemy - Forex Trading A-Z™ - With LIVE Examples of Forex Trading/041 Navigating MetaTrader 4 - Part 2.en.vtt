00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.310
All right so now we're going to talk about navigation Ameritrade or for using quick panels over here

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.860
.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.310
So I'm going to open up my expand one of the charts and the quick panels you can.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.000
There's four of them right here by default and you can just take them and drag them wherever you want

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.960
so like I can put it here.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.750
I did like an.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.890
I can put it back in here.

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.850
Can book put it at the top wherever you want.

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.510
So let's just maybe take them out so we can focus the first one is at a chart and you can just basically

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.980
quickly choose a chart you want to add if you want to close the chart.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.950
Just click this cross over here up the top and the chart gets closed.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.960
So that's an alternative to adding charts through this list that we here on the left.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.210
The second one is saving and loading profiles.

14
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.420
You don't need to focus on this right away.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.720
But if you have like a certain number of charts opened up and you want to save that kind of view then

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.430
you can save profile as and then you can load your profile if you want to.

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.860
I don't really use profiles that much but you might find it handy.

18
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.900
OK so Market Watch this basically switches the market watch on and off as you can see on the left the

19
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.090
market which is disappearing.

20
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
So if one day you buy X and click this cross and market which goes away don't worry you can always bring

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.480
back.

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.790
But just like Market Watch.

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.400
All right so this cross-hair it opens up a daughter window which not open by default so let's cook that

24
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.610
.

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.860
And what that does is right now it's empty but as soon as the amount is on the chart as you can see

26
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.330
the the value the values in the data window are changing and it's basically showing you quickly what's

27
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
the open high low close and volume are for the chart.

28
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.610
And that's a very quick way to get the information instead of having to look up every single bar.

29
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.800
And as you can see if you just hold your mouse still the same information will pop up in a small little

30
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.950
window beside your mouse.

31
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.530
So let's get rid of the data window.

32
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.380
Next one is a navigator.

33
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.940
Once again gets rid of the Navigator puts it back.

34
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.590
Next one is the terminal box or terminal windows at the bottom.

35
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.300
So if you don't want them if they're taking up too much space just get rid of them and then you can

36
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.950
bring them back.

37
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.960
So you think that you get rid of you can bring back.

38
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.170
That's the terminal window.

39
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.010
This one is the strategy tester.

40
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.860
So it brings up another window at the bottom over here.

41
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.740
And here you can test expert advisers.

42
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.000
And this is the part where you do your kind of preparations for algorithmic trading.

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.260
We're not going to talk about that in this course.

44
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.210
I have a separate course on this.

45
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.000
It's it's called use Ameritrade or for strategy testing like a pro.

46
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.090
It's quite a complex beast so if you do want to get a straight chess thing then check out that other

47
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.670
course.

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.550
For now I will just close the strategy tester.

49
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.300
And this button is.

50
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.800
And you order button see if you want to open in your order.

51
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.350
You click that button and you can open and you order and we'll talk about more about this when we're

52
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.430
performing a live trading on a real Forex account in the next section of the course.

53
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.870
So the editor brings up a separate window where you can create Forex robots indicators and scripts you

54
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.230
can program things and deploy them on your account.

55
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.760
Then once again we're not going to be talking about that in this course.

56
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.240
If you are interested check out my other courses for example the green one is on programming expert

57
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.390
advisors in a MetaTrader Four.

58
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.030
So we're going to close that for now.

59
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.890
And last but on here on the trading when you bring this back here it becomes a big button.

60
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.890
It basically says weather expert advisors are allowed to trade on your account or not.

61
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.600
Right now it's off and kind of protects us from accidentally launching a forex robot on that cup.

62
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.890
OK so we've done that one now.

63
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.810
Next one is this one right here.

64
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.570
So the first three are pretty straightforward.

65
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.940
Change is the type of chart.

66
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.210
So if you zoom in using these to zoom in and so now you can see that we've got a bar chart in front

67
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.830
of us.

68
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.810
Well if we click this button will become become a candle chart if we click this button it will become

69
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.590
a line chart.

70
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.260
Soldiers zoom out a bit.

71
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.920
See here you see a line chart.

72
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.320
See a candle chart and a bar chart.

73
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.840
These ones we were done these humans about this one tiles windows like as we talked about in the previous

74
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.670
tutorial.

75
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.770
And then arcade this this is quite an important Voronoi here.

76
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.520
So let's go back to this chart.

77
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.820
This BOTTEN this green button.

78
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.260
Basically what it does is it auto scroll your chart so when the markets open like today Saturday or

79
00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.570
not.

80
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.760
But generally when they're open you get new takes all the time.

81
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.940
And if you this is on your rules will just keep moving like for example just keep moving like this all

82
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.520
the time.

83
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.630
When you take the coming they'll just keep like fast forwarding to the right and if you don't want that

84
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.770
if you want to scroll to the left and see what's going on then just click this button and you'll be

85
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.720
able to scroll without the chart or is crawling back to the right and this button gives you a bit of

86
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.630
a shift on the rights of one should what which when I click it what happens so I click it and the chart

87
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:41.820
shifts to the to the left basically giving me some extra space to analyze like to see the end of the

88
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.450
chart because like this you can maybe not really see it it's hiding behind there.

89
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.750
And once you've clicked this little triangle up at the top and you can move it around and you charge

90
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.900
shift tool change and giving you more or less space depending on what you need.

91
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.260
Indicators basically brings up an indicator you can add to the chart.

92
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.560
So that's a third way of adding an indicator to chart.

93
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.920
This one changes your time frame but you don't really need that because you have these bottoms up at

94
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.750
the top here which you've already talked about this last one also working with templates.

95
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.230
OK so that's done very done.

96
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.260
This one with the timeframes.

97
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.810
The last one we have to do is line studies.

98
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.530
So here you can the crosshair.

99
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.880
You click it and it will add a crosshair to the chart.

100
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.640
And then if you click on hold you kind of can measure distances on your chart if you like.

101
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.450
Same thing if you're just right and middle click your mouse click the middle of the scrolling wheel

102
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.610
and your button you'll get across here.

103
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:52.190
So this vertical line it adds a vertical line to chart a horizontal line as a horizontal one.

104
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.710
If you want to delete it to double click or you right click and click delete.

105
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.940
So if you want to change change something about it then you double click it and then you go horizontal

106
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.670
on properties and change the color if you want.

107
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.240
You can change the width and things like that.

108
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.460
This is a diagonal line so a trend line.

109
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.810
What's important about it is by default some pitches delete this one by default.

110
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.060
Trend lines will be race so a lot of traders have trouble with this.

111
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.290
By default they're like going forever so you can't see the end of it.

112
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.530
So if you want to change that you double click a trend line and you go and into parameters and you uncheck

113
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.500
ready then it becomes like just a small trend line which is much better and much easier to operate with

114
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.870
.

115
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:48.600
And then if you want to like do a channel you click it and then you click control and you copy it and

116
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.790
then you have the same angle and you have a channel and the rest of them you don't really to worry about

117
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.800
them oh actually this one is quite important Fibonacci retracement.

118
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.950
We'll be talking about it.

119
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:06.060
So you pull it from somewhere to somewhere and you'll have a Fibonacci retracement psychotically Pop-Pop

120
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:15.480
but we'll talk about it in more detail when we get to the live training section of our course.

121
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.560
Also you can add labels so this is this that text and this is the label.

122
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.320
So a label doesn't say moves off the chart or stays on the screen.

123
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.300
The text moves with the chart.

124
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.160
So that's if you want to make some certain highlights of things like that then you can add arrows and

125
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.590
thumbs up and thumbs down.

126
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.940
So this whole graphical analysis and markings.

127
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.930
OK so I hope that's helpful.

128
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.570
Trader 4 is generally very easy to navigate and if you spend one or two hours just playing around with

129
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.880
it and after you've watched this and the previous tutorials you'll very quickly get the hang of it and

130
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.510
you'll know what's happening.

131
00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:00.240
If you have any questions at all feel free to leave a comment or a question in the in the comments section

132
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.760
to this video and I'll definitely help you out.

133
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.860
Other than that I look for next time.

134
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.350
And until then happy trading
