1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,850
Trends flats.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,010
So one of the most common themes in the Forex market is a trend.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,170
Let's try to understand what a trend is exactly.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,680
For example this is how the price has been moving over a certain period of time.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,810
Then as you see here we can draw a diagonal line underneath the price which the price seems to be bouncing

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,380
off.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,780
This line is called the support line.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,830
It indicates an upward trend.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:34,680
It means that the price is bouncing off upwards of this line and continuing its upward movement.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,070
And so what you can expect in a situation like this is that the price will once again come close to

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,780
line and bounce off it and keep moving upwards.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,150
That's how user support.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,350
So if you notice that the price has bounced off a dagger like a couple of times in a row then there

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,810
is a good chance that it will bounce off the support line.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,840
One more time.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
At least one more time.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:04,590
And that's how traders using technical analysis would enter into a buy order.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,920
The downward trend is very similar but it's just happening in the opposite direction.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,020
So here we can draw a red line a bar of the price and which is kind of not letting the price go up which

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,870
is forcing the price to go down.

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,110
And this price this line therefore is called a resistance line.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,010
And once again here you can expect that the price will go towards the line.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,740
And there's a high chance that the price will bounce off the line again and continue its movement downward

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:34,860
.

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,700
So this is called a downward trend and lines called the resistance line.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,140
And the third type of market is a flat market.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:50,190
And this in this case we can't draw a support line or resistance line because the market is kind of

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,670
flat it's moving sideways.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,410
Some people call the flat market a sideways trend.

30
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,220
I kind of try to stay away from that definition because there is actually no trend in the market so

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,870
why bother calling it a side restaurant.

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,380
Finally in regards to trends it's always important to check the overall trend on the market.

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:18,600
So if the euro dollar is going down then whatever your other technical name suggests it's always more

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,060
favorable to trade downwards.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,690
If the British pound dollars going up overall then you would favor more.

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,210
The signals that tell you to try and trade upwards so it's called Trading with the trend and you'll

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,060
notice that we will be doing that in our live real trading in this course.
