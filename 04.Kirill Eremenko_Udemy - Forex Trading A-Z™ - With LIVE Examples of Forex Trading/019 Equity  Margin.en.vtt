00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.170
Equity and margin in the previous tutorial we explored an example where we were opening a hypothetical

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.700
order of a zero point one lots.

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.040
Now to create this transaction we required twelve thousand three hundred twenty two dollars.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.030
And because that was quite a substantial amount.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.710
We explored the concept of leverage and in fact we found that with a leverage of 1 to 100 we could borrow

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.380
99 percent of the required amount from the broker and we would only be required to put in 1 percent

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.630
or $123 know that amount that we need to put in the $123 is called the margin for this transaction.

8
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.760
And today we're going to talk more about the margin and find out exactly why the broker is willing to

9
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.760
lend us 99 percent and how leverage works in the background and how all of these concepts play out.

10
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.300
When you open an order and when the market goes against you and when the market goes in your favor.

11
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.820
So let's jump straight into it.

12
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.130
So here is our $500 balance and now we want to open that transaction which we talked about.

13
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.780
So the broker puts in twelve thousand one hundred ninety nine.

14
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.690
We put in $123 or the $123 is on margin and the remaining funds.

15
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.130
So the 500 minus the 123 The $377 that is called the free margin.

16
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.960
Now here we are going to introduce one more concept and that is the concept of equity.

17
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.900
Now normally equity is defined as the balance on your accounts plus or minus any unrealized profit or

18
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.170
loss.

19
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.040
So basically your balance is constant until you actually close your transaction but your equity reflects

20
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.650
whether the market is going in your favor or it's going against you.

21
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.550
However in this example to start off we're going to kind of introduce equity backers we're going to

22
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.980
introduce equity as the free margin account plus the margin.

23
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.660
There's no big difference and you'll see just in a few moments how that is exactly the same as what

24
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.760
we discussed about balance and unrealized profit or loss.

25
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.610
So there's our equity.

26
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.880
We're going to outline it with a green bracket here on the right.

27
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.410
And now let's see what happens as the market moves in either direction.

28
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.800
So we start we'll start off with by looking at what happens when the market moves against us.

29
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.470
So if the market moves against our position then first of all let's say it moved in against us and the

30
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.210
unrealized loss on our account is $100.

31
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.190
So as you can see the margin is intact.

32
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.460
The broker funds are intact but the free margin has reduced by $100 and therefore our equity has also

33
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.160
reduced by $100 at the same time.

34
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.490
We should note that the balance hasn't changed so that big box the overall box is still $500 and still

35
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.110
we it looks like we have $500 on our call because that's our balance.

36
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.950
But in reality there is an unrealized loss and it's cold and unrealized loss because you haven't yet

37
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.010
closed the transaction so that you know that loss might change into a profit of time or that might increase

38
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.730
as a loss.

39
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.420
So if the market keep keeps going against us now the free margin has reduced by $200 and the equity

40
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.150
has reduced by two hundred dollars.

41
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.830
And at the same time the borrowed funds and the margin of the frozen margin are still intact.

42
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.970
Now what happens if the market keeps going against us.

43
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.610
Well what will happen is a stop shot so a stop out is when the broker sees that you have lost quite

44
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.290
a lot of funds and you don't have any free margin left.

45
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:42.180
And in that case the broker will automatically close your position and you this loss will become a realized

46
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.830
loss.

47
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.440
And that way they will be able to pull out of this position.

48
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.490
So because they lent you some money and now they see that the position has gone against you they don't

49
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.440
want to lose any of the money that they lent you.

50
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.310
So they're just going to close your position and pull out their 12000 199.

51
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.840
And in this case the margin acts as a safety net or a safety buffer.

52
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.880
So basically the brokers saying OK this trader doesn't have any free margin left.

53
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.400
We should close the position and in that case what will happen is they pull back the 12:1 twelve thousand

54
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.250
one hundred ninety nine and you get back your margin so your margin is returned to you.

55
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.310
So why does a broker use this margin as a safety buffer.

56
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.960
Well because while they're closing the transaction the market can actually move and they might not have

57
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.020
enough time to close the transaction spot on on that margin level so the market might even move a bit

58
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.030
further against you and might ease into your margin and you won't get $123.

59
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.160
You might get $100 back $90 back or $150 back.

60
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:51.000
So that is their safety buffer so that is the funds that will get eaten into before the funds that they

61
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.770
actually enter you.

62
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.210
So that's how the broker uses the margin as a safety net.

63
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.740
And as you can see the equity has also reduced the size of the margin.

64
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.420
Now the Stop can happen at when all of your free margin is eaten up so when you only have margin left

65
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.240
or maybe when you have half of your margin left so the broker might in its terms and conditions specify

66
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.220
that it will allow 50 percent of the margin to be used up before the stop out occurs or it might allow

67
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.390
70 percent of the margin to be used up so you have to refer to the terms and conditions of your broker

68
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.290
to understand at which point to stop our worker.

69
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.050
And another thing you should be aware of is that sometimes will also be a margin call some margin call

70
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.810
normally occurs before a stop out and it's a warning from the broker telling you that you're getting

71
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.560
very close to stop out level and you should intervene and do something about it.

72
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.970
Now it's not necessarily going to happen you're not necessarily going to have a margin call and in fact

73
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.480
a lot of brokers might have the margin call set at the same level as the stop out.

74
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.420
So basically the margin call won't happen because it's too late anyway.

75
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.130
The stop that has occurred so that's another thing you should look into and check with your broker chiken

76
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.610
the terms and conditions or the product disclosure statement and find out when does is there a margin

77
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.770
call when does that occur.

78
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.570
When What's the levels to the top.

79
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.860
Also occur at.

80
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.310
OK.

81
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.240
So that's what happens if the position goes against you.

82
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.210
Now let's see what happens if the person goes in your favor.

83
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.060
Back to the start of a kid on the right free margin and margin and let's say you have said a take profit

84
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.000
somewhere up at the top over there where the dust or the dotted line is.

85
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.490
Now if the position moves in your favor so here we can see that we've earned some money as you can see

86
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.370
your position still isn't closed.

87
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.440
Your balance is still $500.

88
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.470
What's your free margin has increased.

89
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.960
So any unrealized profit or loss is being added to your free margin and therefore as you can see your

90
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.490
equity is increasing and that's a good thing because now you can use this free margin to happen more

91
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.770
transactions if you wish to do so.

92
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.350
But we're not going to go into that.

93
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.180
Let's continue with this example so your free margin is increasing your equities increasing and the

94
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.420
market keeps moving in your favor and it hits you take profits Horray your free margin has increased

95
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:19.140
your equity has increased at the same time you can see that the margin is still the same $623 and the

96
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.130
amounts of money that you bought from the broker hasn't changed still 12 199.

97
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.570
So what happens next is your position closes.

98
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.380
The broker pulls back their amount.

99
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:37.200
So they take back their 12 199 and your margin is released and it is added to your back to your account

100
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.230
.

101
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.430
So it was always on your call but now is released and it's no longer frozen margin.

102
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.420
So now your balance is $763.

103
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:53.190
So as you can see here that is one of the great advantages of leverage is that the broker just at the

104
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.310
end when the transaction is complete all the broker wants back is the money it lent you.

105
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.770
They don't want none.

106
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.440
They're all going to penalize you for using leverage and therefore you get to keep all of the profits

107
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.800
you made.

108
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.900
So even though you borrowed money to open this transaction you get to keep all the profits you make

109
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.170
.

110
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.230
The downside of course is that in your losses you make are also going you're going to be liable for

111
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.140
any of those losses that you make.

112
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.250
So there we go.

113
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.580
That's how our leverage works.

114
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.520
And in a way it's kind of like a magnifying glass to find leverage you can only conduct if if you can

115
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:37.110
if you even have enough balance to conduct the smallest transactions on like micro transactions on the

116
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.590
forex with leverage.

117
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:45.430
Everything is magnified so you can conduct greater transactions you incur greater profits or and at

118
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.050
the same time you will incur great losses if they occur.

119
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.260
And you only have that amount of money that is on your account to accommodate those losses.

120
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.770
So since your money runs artisan's your free margin runs out.

121
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.370
The broker will pull their funds back.

122
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.720
So in a way I like to think of the leverage as a sportscars So of course you can hurt yourself by driving

123
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.210
a sports car.

124
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:16.560
But if you know what you're doing and if you're careful about it and you're just driving it safely then

125
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.970
you can derive substantial benefit from it.

126
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.810
And same thing with leverage of course you can hurt yourself and there are substantial risks associated

127
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.290
with leverage.

128
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.250
But on the other hand if you know what you're doing if you calculate your risks and if you're careful

129
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.530
about it then you can derive substantial benefits from having that leverage.

130
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.920
All right so that's how leverage works.

131
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:42.810
And before we conclude this tutorial I'd like to highlight one more important key risk associated with

132
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.650
leverage.

133
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:49.140
So I'm going to go back to our example here and let's go back to the example where the market goes against

134
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.420
us.

135
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.930
So sure you can see that there is a stop out which kind of is a safety net for the broker and etree

136
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.060
.

137
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.310
After the stop what happens you get your margin back.

138
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.180
The broker gets the amount that it lent you back.

139
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.150
And that's the end of it.

140
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:10.860
However sometimes it so happens on the forex market that the movements can that caused your position

141
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.570
to go against you.

142
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:20.070
That can be so quick and so volatile so it can be such an big movement that the broker might not have

143
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.570
enough time or might not have an opportunity.

144
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.640
They might not be a price in the market for your position to be closed at the stop on.

145
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.330
So the broker is intending to close it but are just not able to do it.

146
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:41.670
So in that case as we discussed your margin will start to suffer and the funds will be any additional

147
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.980
losses will be taken out of the margin and that way your margin is like the little safety buffer between

148
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:52.350
your funds your free margin and the brokers funds the ones that they lintian.

149
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:59.190
But at the same time if that market movement is so drastic and so quickly that it actually shows up

150
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:07.110
through all of your margin then what will happen is that before the broker is able to close the position

151
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:14.340
the brokers funds will start to suffer so the market will start eating into the 12 199 that the broker

152
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.730
lent you in this specific example.

153
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.840
So and that is an additional risk.

154
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.320
So if the market moves so quickly that it eats up all of your margin and it uses up some or even all

155
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.890
of the money that the broker lent you then you should be aware that you will be liable for those funds

156
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.990
that were used up from the money that the broker lent you.

157
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.260
So you need to check the terms and conditions.

158
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.670
But there's is a very high chance that you will be liable for those funds.

159
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.300
And the broker can reclaim them back from you.

160
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.850
So the broker can ask you to pay back that money so be careful of that.

161
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.730
That is an inherent risk of using leverage.

162
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:03.600
And of course this risk is has to be verified with your broker has to be checked if your terms and conditions

163
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.700
.

164
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:10.050
But you should make yourself aware of that and you should understand this risk when you're using leverage

165
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.350
.

166
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.520
So I just wanted to make sure that you're aware of that.

167
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.500
And that brings us to the end of today's tutorial.

168
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.100
There we go.

169
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.900
Talked about equity and margin.

170
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:25.350
And hopefully now you have a very clear understanding of how leverage works and why exactly brokers

171
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.730
are willing to lend to that money.

172
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.720
OK.

173
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.190
I look for the next tutorial.

174
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.800
And until then happy trading
