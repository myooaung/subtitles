Hello this is Kirill from spot dot com.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,790
And welcome back to the course and for its trading today we'll be conducting our next trade on our real

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,420
life Forex account.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,510
So today we'll be trading the Australian dollar Canadian dollar one already time frame and I'd like

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,150
to mention that the strain of Canadian dollar currency pair is quite interesting because it consists

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,560
of two commodity currencies the kabaddi currencies on the market are the Australian dollar Canadian

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,480
oil and New Zealand dollar and their cold sides because the economies of the respective countries heavily

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,910
depend on commodities such as grain timber oil natural gas and so on.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,130
And so the movements of these currencies are often dictated by and correlated with the movements of

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,980
those commodities.

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,050
So trading that trillion dollar Canadian dollar has its own specifics and it's quite quite interesting

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,690
and time so I think this will be a good example to kind of illustrate what other currencies they are

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,340
that are currency pairs that don't involve the American dollar.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,650
So as you can see on this account we already now have $595 on 81 cents.

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,250
If we go to the county's history we can see our two profitable trades from previously.

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,310
And what we're going to do today is we go into conducta or third.

17
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,370
So on this chart I have highlighted some things and right away you can see that the Australian dollar

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:41,700
Canadian dollar currency pair has recently been in a channel so are really the currency standard bouncing

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,670
around in this shorter channel.

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,080
And then the channel expansion that sometimes happens.

21
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,130
And so the low boundary became the middle line of the channel and now the currency has been bouncing

22
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,300
in here for a couple of days actually since since Christmas.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,140
So now we're in January 2015.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,370
Happy New Year by the way.

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,040
And so we're going to conduct this trade now.

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,650
One more thing if we zoom on we can see that generally speaking it is a downward trend so what's happening

27
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,890
right now is a retracement and we should be very careful when trading these because the currency can

28
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,350
turn around at any point in time.

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,130
So that's why we're going to trade quite conservatively setting I'll take profit.

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:34,710
Not even at the very end of the Tuborg of the channel but rather around this high that we had seen previously

31
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,450
over here.

32
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,870
Also what you will see is that there is a level here zero point ninety six.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:51,330
So I'll just point it out here just above the blue line is zero point ninety six and that level is quite

34
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,740
strong quite strong resistance level as you can see here here here.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Traders are generally afraid of it.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,220
So I'm quite skeptical about the price crossing this level so we're definitely going to see it take

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,700
profit below that level.

38
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,660
So we've got to take profits where we will set the profit here.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,930
We'll enter at market price and the stop loss well the loss.

40
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,510
I chose to said just below the zero point ninety five level because the zero point ninety five level

41
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:30,210
was quite a strong support level and we can use it to protect our investments are included in our strategy

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:37,530
and I expect if the price does go down then it might bounce back off around the 0.25 mark and that level

43
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,770
has proven like you can see here and around these areas here you can see that level has proven to be

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,910
quite strong when it comes when the price comes towards it.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,250
So without further ado let's move on to calculating the risk and then we can open the order for Kalka

46
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,120
and the risk we will need to know Stop-Loss and pips.

47
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:11,930
So here we have approximately seventy pips of of for our stop loss soldiers bring up slides from there

48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,730
we're familiar with.

49
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,270
So we need to take the risk in dollar terms and divide by 10 times Stop-Loss and pips.

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,620
So in our case we wanted the risk in dollar terms to be approximately 10 percent of the balance and

51
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,900
that's because we're taking a very short trade we're not going to ask for a big movement and it is quite

52
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,470
a good signal even though it is in the counter-trend movement.

53
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,050
But at the same time we are headed towards the top of that channel.

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,510
So 10 percent of $595 81 is approximately $60.

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,810
So we put that into the formula and now we can also plug in our stop loss and pips which was approximately

56
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,300
73 pips.

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,550
And now if we calculate that I'll just bring up the calculator here.

58
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:09,690
So 60 divided by 10 times 73 makes it a zero point zero eight lots.

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,540
So that's good.

60
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:22,430
Now we can exit this presentation screen pops up and so will type 0.0 lots Stop-Loss.

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:30,610
Is there a point 9 4 8 0 tech profit 0 9 5 9 0 comments.

62
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:37,570
My search for X order and it's an execution.

63
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,430
We want to create a buy order.

64
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,230
Everything is ready just double check very quickly currency pairs correct.

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,010
Click buy and avoid the orders ready.

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,900
Zero point zero eight lots.

67
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,160
If we go into the trade tab over here we can see that the orders up over there.

68
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,400
And right now we're in a bit of a minus.

69
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,420
And that's because the spread.

70
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,660
So we'll leave it at that and check back in hopefully maybe today so these vertical lines is a period

71
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,770
separate as that means and New Day according to server time.

72
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,420
So maybe today maybe maybe the day after.

73
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,040
Hopefully we'll get a result and hopefully we'll get a take profit on the order.

74
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,030
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,980
Until next time happy trading.
