1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,000
All right so we've already talked about support and resistance trendlines.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,420
Now we're going to talk about support and resistance levels so support levels.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,840
Let's imagine a situation where we have a downward trend in the market and in this case a support level

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:26,450
is a horizontal line which is called support level which represents a barrier for the price.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,260
So when we'll find out how to look for support levels in a few minutes.

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,850
But right now let's see what the support level does to the price.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,570
So as the price approaches the support level trade has become hesitant because they don't know what

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,290
will happen.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,690
They don't know whether the price will cross it or whether the price will bounce off and move in the

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,900
opposite direction.

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,550
So generally you'll notice a kind of consolidation on the market.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,580
And then one of the following three things will happen.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,590
Either the price will bounce off the support level and go in the opposite direction or the price might

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,140
test the support level a little bit.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,740
Cross-head and then bounce off and go in the opposite direction or the price can actually cross the

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,630
support level and there'll be a massive impulse in the direction of the trend.

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,400
So now resistance levels are they're very similar but they're the opposite.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,900
They're above price.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:32,340
So resistance level puts pressure on the price and doesn't act as a barrier for the price going upwards

20
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,490
.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,820
And once again generally speaking it's three possible outcomes.

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,060
Either the price bounces off the resistance level and goes down or it can test the resistance level

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,530
and then go down or it can cross the resistance level and there will be a strong impulse in the direction

24
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,300
of the trend.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:58,290
There are two main types of support and resistance levels and these are historical and psychological

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,520
.

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,890
Let's have a look at the historical type first.

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,890
So historical lows look at this chart.

29
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:11,590
Can you identify any horizontal lines that have been tried and tested by the price of more than one

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,540
type.

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,610
We can see one of those lines right away.

32
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,550
It's this horizontal support line and the price tested this line over here first and then it came back

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,770
to this line here.

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,980
And so what can we anticipate from the prices future movement.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,130
Well we can anticipate that if the price does go towards this support line then something will probably

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,210
happen over there.

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,670
So and that's how you establish support and resistance levels the historical type.

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,760
You look at what happened in the past and you see that oh wait a second so the price was hesitant to

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,050
cross this level previously or there was some sort of consolidation there in the past.

40
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,060
So maybe that same thing or something might happen when the price approaches is low.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,100
And more often than not that's exactly what will happen.

42
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:16,470
There will be some sort of abnormal movement when the price gets to this level and that's what we take

43
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,510
advantage of.

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,280
The second type is psychological levels.

45
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:29,280
So they're a bit different in the sense that the price is just in a trend and then we identify a level

46
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,190
which is very often a round number.

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:41,010
So for example 1.5 0 0 0 that is a number that's plays of the minds of traders and because they don't

48
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,990
know whether the price is going to bounce off or across it.

49
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,600
Mathematically speaking there's nothing special about one point 5 0 0 0.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,320
It's no different to one point 650.

51
00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:01,080
But at the same time in a consumer's head in a normal person's head who walks the streets and lives

52
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:09,270
his life in his head his home currency being traded at above 1.5 and below one point for two distinct

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,040
things.

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,220
So you might not care whether it's 1.6 or 1.7 but he'll remember if it's one point fifty five or if

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,340
it's one point forty five because that kind of difference sits in your head.

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:29,180
Or same thing if it's like 2.0 like you would know if your home currency or somebody somebody sold currencies

57
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,910
trading at $2 per unit of the currency or below or above.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,300
So it's kind of a strong level because it's around number and traders tend to be hesitant when the price

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,320
approaches this level because they don't know what will happen where the pressure will go down or up

60
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:46,590
.

61
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,970
And same thing as with historical levels something happens.

62
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,670
One of the three things that we discussed normally happens over here.

63
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,740
So let's have a look at an example from a real chart here we've got the British pound dollar weekly

64
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,330
chart and I just took this out of my terminal So this is fresh as of today our fourth of February 2015

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,070
.

66
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,050
And as you can see the British pound dollar currency pair is approaching or has approached this blue

67
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,240
support line.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,130
And guess what it is it's 1.5 0 0 0.

69
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:28,830
And let's have a look here closer so as we discussed traders don't know what's going to happen and these

70
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,900
kind of broad numbers play with their heads.

71
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,790
They're anticipating some sort of reaction or action on the market and generally the price goes into

72
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,920
consolidation for a certain period of time.

73
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,870
So traders and I was going to happen.

74
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,650
And here you can see that's exactly what happened.

75
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,900
So before the price reached this level we had six weeks in a row we had bearish candles.

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,010
You see those six out white candles going down.

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,540
They there were 6000 euro.

78
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,090
And as soon as the price got to the to the psychological level it stopped.

79
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,210
We got to bullish candles so the price went in the opposite direction and that's because it's testing

80
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,620
the level it doesn't know.

81
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,290
Nobody knows whether it's going to cross it or was going to bounce off and so now there's like a balance

82
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:20,670
of power of bears and bulls and sooner or later one of those three things will happen and we'll see

83
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,030
a strong movement afterwards.

84
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:30,000
And in this particular case you can see that the psychological level is also a historical level and

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that's quite common with psychological levels because they tend to be very significant throughout history

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,030
.

87
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:48,180
So back in January to July 2013 the price tested this psychological level three times.

88
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,370
And as you can see it wasn't able to cross it and that's when a massive impuls happened and the price

89
00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:00,020
went upwards and reached somewhere around 1.7 American dollars per British pounds.

90
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,150
So now it's back here at one point 5 0 0 0 and everybody's waiting to see what will happen.

91
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,050
So to sum up there are two main types of support and resistance lines.

92
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,080
These are trend lines which are diagonal and these are levels which are horizontal and there are two

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:24,990
types of supporters Aston's levels historical levels and psychological levels and all of them act as

94
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,510
barriers for the price.

95
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,550
And when the price gets to them it either bounces off or we see an impulse when the price crosses these

96
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,880
levels
