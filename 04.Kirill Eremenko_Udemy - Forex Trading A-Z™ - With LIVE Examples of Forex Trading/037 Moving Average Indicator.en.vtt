Hello this is Kirill from forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.510
And welcome back to the course and for extruding.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.660
Today we're going to talk about the moving average indicator.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.970
So personally I think the moving average is a very powerful indicator.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.110
It's very simple and in Forex.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.580
Very often Simplicity is the key to your success.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.140
If you overcomplicate things then you might miss out on the obvious.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.570
So today we're going to talk about moving average.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.700
We'll see how is constructed and then we'll see a few examples of how to do that and trading strategies

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.890
.

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.810
And I'll just give you a few more thoughts on this indicator.

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.640
All right so similar to what we do in the past the of the average Chura age indicator.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.400
Let's have a look at how the moving average is constructed.

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.180
So if we take the far past four bars and we take the close prices of these bars and then we plot the

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.570
average of them it looks something like this.

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.460
Next if we move to one bar to the left and we take the average of the four bars there then we plot it

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.590
.

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.240
It looks like this.

19
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.190
Then if we keep going and keep plotting the average every time we can keep going as far as we want left

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.970
and we'll get a picture like this.

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.380
Next we'll connect all these points on our chart with a line and get rid of the crosses.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.480
So that's how your moving average indicator looks.

23
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.760
And this particular moving average has a period of four.

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.000
And that's because of the way we constructed it we're looking at four bars.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.880
Every time this case is a bit different to the average terrains because we don't have to plot this indicator

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.610
in a separate chart and you'll notice that on the forex market and Ameritrade or four there are two

27
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.450
types of indicators.

28
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.140
Those that are plotted on the same chart as the press and those that are it in a separate chart.

29
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.310
And in this particular instance we didn't have to plot it separately because the actual range in which

30
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.890
indicate it has its values is actually the same of the chart as the chart.

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.050
So what we're taking is we take an average of the of potful prices so it will be somewhere there on

32
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.740
the chart.

33
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.900
Whereas with the average sheer range indicator we are taking the difference of the high and the low

34
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.130
.

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.130
So obviously if your highs 1.5 and your lows 1.4 than the differences 0.1 it's not going to be anywhere

36
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
near the current values in the chart so it be very far down.

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.180
So you have to kind of plot it on a separate chart.

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.840
So that's all moving average.

39
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.690
Let's have a look at the moving average on a real 4 x chart.

40
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.290
So that's of Eurodollar already time frame chart.

41
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.720
And as you can see here I've uploaded the moving average for period of 48.

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.670
So in this case it means that every single value of the moving average represents the average close

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.790
price for the past 48 bars because this is a one hour timeframe.

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.730
Forty eight means two days.

45
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240
So two times 24.

46
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.200
So it basically means that average close price on the hour the time frame for the past two days.

47
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.370
And that's how it's been changing.

48
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.650
You can see that it went first down the average and start picking up and then it started going down

49
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.570
again.

50
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.020
So how can you use the moving average in your trading.

51
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.940
There are several methods of using the moving average but we'll look at the two main ones and the two

52
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.830
most simple straightforward and most frequently used methods.

53
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.590
So the first one is using the moving average is a signal generator.

54
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.510
Let's have a look at the chart again.

55
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.040
Can you see here that when on the left the price crosses the moving average downwards.

56
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.090
It keeps going down.

57
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.720
So in that case when the price crossed the moving average down you would sell expecting the price to

58
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.810
keep going down.

59
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.110
And then when the price crossed the moving average upwards it kept going that way.

60
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.250
So you could buy here expecting that it will keep going that way.

61
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.100
And then once again crossed down.

62
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.000
You could sell expecting that the price would go down.

63
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.400
So as you can see in times when there is a trend on the market if the price is low the moving average

64
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.150
then it's a downward trend.

65
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.090
If the price is above the moving average then it's an upward trend.

66
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.030
So this strategy works during TrimTabs unfortunately doesn't work during flat times like when there's

67
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.460
no movement on the market because the price seems tends to be very close to the moving average and that

68
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.490
can crossover very frequently.

69
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.290
So you have to be careful when you use the strategy but do keep in mind that if you see the price above

70
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.130
the moving average and most likely you are currently in an upward trend.

71
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.390
Next the other way of using the moving average is using it as a support or resistance line.

72
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.900
And this is actually very interesting.

73
00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.510
You will notice that our support resistance line where the trend lines or levels.

74
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.380
And that's what we talked about previously but now we've got a moving Sopore resistance line.

75
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.900
So let's have a look at that.

76
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.170
We've got the moving average here the same one as we talked about.

77
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.890
Can you see how on the right during the uptrend the price actually bounced off the moving average one

78
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.330
time the second time and the third time.

79
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.930
So that's not a coincidence that is quite a frequent phenomenon on the forks market.

80
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.940
And if you find you have to kind of pick the right period of your moving average which we'll talk about

81
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.600
in a minute.

82
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:42.120
But if you pick the right one for the right situation you can actually effectively construct a moving

83
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.120
supportive resistance line which is very powerful and there are many different speculations why this

84
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.780
works.

85
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.580
And for example one of them is because other traders also use a moving average.

86
00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:01.080
And when a lot of traders and decision makers for large funds use the same strategy tends to work.

87
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.470
And in this case they see the price approaching the moving average and they know that it's going to

88
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.090
act as a support line so they can buy.

89
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.380
And then they buy again and they buy again every time that happens.

90
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.900
So this strategy may work for that reason.

91
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.880
But regardless of why exactly it works it's a good thing to call forth.

92
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.890
And moreover in our live trading on a real for X amount of further in this course you will see us use

93
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.700
this strategy to our advantage to make profits.

94
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.250
And I'll explain exactly how I pick the right period for the moving average and how to better use it

95
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.220
in your life trading.

96
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.260
And finally the last remark I want to make an editorial was that the period of the moving average is

97
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.170
very important.

98
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.510
Let's have a look at the chart again.

99
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.210
So this is the moving average period of 48.

100
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.400
If you plot the moving average of a period of 12 that's how it will look like.

101
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.520
And if people are moving out to a period of one hundred fifty that's how it will look like.

102
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.290
So as you can see all of them are very different and they can give you different insights into the market

103
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.840
and actually different recommendations to what you have to do so it's up to you as the trader to pick

104
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.500
the right moving average for your currency pair for your timeframe and for your particular situation

105
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.910
.

106
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.760
Don't worry it might sound complicated but in reality it's very simple.

107
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.470
And with time you will get the hang of it.

108
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:30.090
And with every single situation you'll get better and better at picking the right period of the moving

109
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.180
average.

110
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.820
That's all for today's tutorial.

111
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.390
Next time we'll be talking about algorithmic trading and expert advises on the forex market.

112
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.490
And until then happy trading
