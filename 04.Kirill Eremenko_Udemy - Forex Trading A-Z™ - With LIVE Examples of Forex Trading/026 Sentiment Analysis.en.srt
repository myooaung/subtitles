1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,970
Sentiment analysis.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,460
So personally I think that sentiment analysis is valuable but at the same time it's not substantial

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,670
enough to be a stand alone type of analysis that you can base your Forth decisions on.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,130
I think sentiment analysis is more of an auxillary type analysis that you can and you probably should

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,770
add to your own analysis to make it more robust.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,600
So sentiment analysis implies trying to assess and understand the general mood in the market.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,840
What traders are thinking what what their expectations are and a good starting point for that is Twitter

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,710
and Facebook.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,680
So you can go on Twitter Search your currency pair and see what people are thinking what they're talking

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,380
about what they're kind of expecting.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:57,150
And also you can find that out on Facebook and certain groups in certain circles other social networks

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,290
like Google Plus basically any type of social network including forums.

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,190
Why it's important will because at the end of the day people make transactions in the market and it

14
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,330
matters what people think especially when it's a lot of people think you know how ideas can be viral

15
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,930
sometimes and something can pick up out of nothing.

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,180
Like somebody says the euro is going up and and then just spreads very quickly across Twitter and everybody

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,610
starts feeling that way and then you know in a matter of an hour or so you could actually see the euro

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,210
going up once again because it is rare that just purely sentimental sentiment drives the market.

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:45,570
But it's good to assess it and keep in the back of the mind also sentiment is reflected often in currency

20
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,150
pairs.

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,370
You'll be you'll eventually learn how to pick it up from the charts.

22
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,640
Some types of sentiments for instance a good one is when traders are uncertain and they're nervous.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,470
You'll see consolidation on the chart.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,700
So the price Samplitude will be reducing substantially and moreover will actually witness some of these

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,380
situations in our live trading on a real account in the further sections of the score's
