00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,140
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,360
And welcome back to a course on forex trading in today's tutorial we will be conducting our fourth live

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
trade on a real Forex account.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,970
So as you can see here down at the bottom we've got our three profitable trades that we've had so far

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,020
and that have brought us a harder and dollars and 20 cents and currently on this account I have six

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,410
hundred and nineteen dollars and twenty cents of available funds.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,720
So today we'll be looking at those trillion dollar American dollar hourly timeframe.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,160
And here we will be investigating a very interesting formation which we have not talked about yet.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,620
So this is a Gartley and person Vento harmonic patter.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,480
And before we go into detail on this particular formation I just wanted to show you how you can read

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,350
a bit more about the step parents.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:09,120
So if you go to Google and you type in harmonic patterns and then you go for it will go for the images

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,250
just to see them you can find a lot about these harmonic patterns.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:22,590
And for instance here is a good summary of the six harmonic patterns the crab the butterfly the bat

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,580
the Gartley pattern the three drives Paran a BCT pattern.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:34,600
So if you scroll down here you'll see that there's a lot of examples as a lot of analytics around them

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,830
there's lots of good explanations.

18
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,400
So in this particular case the turnaround we're going to go looking at is the butterfly the Gartley

19
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,660
butterfly pattern.

20
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,480
HARMAN Harmonix Perens a very interesting and they're based on Fibonacci numbers so there's a lot of

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,310
mystery around them.

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,140
I used to try them quite a lot back in the day.

23
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,500
You can write a whole course about harmonic patterns and that's why we won't go into too much detail

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,840
about them in general.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,870
However today we will look at the butterfly because we are working with it.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,680
So what you're looking for in harmonic patterns is either a kind of shape or kind information in the

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,360
form of the letter W for a cell or in the form of a letter M for a buy.

28
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,510
In this case we have a very very well pronounced garkey butterfly.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,420
And the W formation is kind of just something to get your attention but that's not actually enough to

30
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:44,040
for or for a formation to be a harmonic pattern the word harmonic implies that they are Fibonacci numbers

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
and ball somewhere.

32
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,490
So how or how the numbers involved in this case.

33
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,730
So if we take the Fibonacci retracement up over here and then we drag them onto the very first movement

34
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,050
in this formation.

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,650
So we drag them here and then we move back.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:10,350
You will see that this line sixty one point eight percent happens to fall exactly where the retracement

37
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,610
the second movement.

38
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,940
And so that's why marks at six to 1.8 percent here.

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,670
So that's no coincidence.

40
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,950
This is a downward trend the retracement sixty one point eight percent and that is if Banaszak phenomenon

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,430
call that if you will or is just a harmonic movement.

42
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:37,290
So but the interesting thing about 30 percent parents is that there's multiple ratios like this in one

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:37,750
parent.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,540
And for instance if we keep expanding this to the right you will see that the last movement over here

45
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:53,310
the fourth movement was exactly a hundred and twenty seven point two percent of the original movement

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,990
here at the start.

47
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,450
And these two things happened at the same time.

48
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,570
So how do we get a hundred and twenty seven point two from the Fibonacci ratio.

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,230
Well if we bring up the calculator and type in one point 6 1 8 and take the square root of that there

50
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,380
you'll see that the square root of 1.6 1A is actually exactly 1 point 2 7 2.

51
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,100
And that again is not a coincidence.

52
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,450
That is where all the mystery comes in.

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,370
Nobody actually knows why markets move like that.

54
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,930
Why is it exactly sixty one point eight percent here and was exactly 127 point two percent here.

55
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,630
In fact this ratio can be a bit different.

56
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,930
Could be it can be the four hundred sixty one point eight percent can be another Hermana aggression

57
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:45,930
but the fact is that there are harmonic ratios involved multiple times in these formations regardless

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,020
of the fact that nobody knows why that happens you can still take advantage of them and use them as

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,560
strong signals for you to enter the market.

60
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,760
So in this instance we have a strong cell signal.

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,390
Oh by the way before we move on I just wanted to show you that in your Fibonacci properties if you ever

62
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,100
want to add a level like for example a hundred twenty seven point two is not a default level you just

63
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,530
click the levels tab and you click ADD and you can just add a new level of it here so that's pretty

64
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,510
simple.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,630
OK moving back to our Paran we've got this pattern ready to fire.

66
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,410
And one more thing that it actually gives you is it gives you targets.

67
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,990
So fibonacci garkey patterns they actually give you targets which is such a take profit Stop-Loss which

68
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,950
is very convenient at times.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,330
So the way you set the take profit is you take this last movement you drag another notch retracement

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
onto it and then you look where you have the once.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,110
Point one sixty one point eight low.

72
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,100
And that's probably where the prizes are going to go up to.

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,240
Statistically it happens that way most of the time more often than not anyway.

74
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:01,740
So you might want to set the take profit here but in our case we have a very strong support level zero

75
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,240
point eight which the price was 0.18 actually which the price has not been able to surpass two times

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,850
already.

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:19,170
So it is quite a strong bet that we will go through this level and that's strong enough already so that's

78
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:25,110
why I wanted to set the take profit a bit closer a bit higher up because there's another level over

79
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,530
here which is zero point seventy nine which just happens to be on the one point sixty one 106 one point

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,470
eight line or just above it.

81
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,090
So I wanted to be above this other support line.

82
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:47,400
So if we do break the zero point eighty level then we don't have to worry about the 0.17 line level

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,060
.

84
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,000
So that's how you kind of establish just such a take profit is either at 160 1.8 percentage or hundred

85
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,130
twenty seven point two if you like.

86
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,740
I'm sitting over here somewhere in between.

87
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,390
Stop-Loss Well kind of similar similar thing.

88
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,400
If you drag the original three Banaji retracement the stop loss kind of it's good to set it above the

89
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,780
160 1.8 because this acts as the resistance line.

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,140
Also we've got a strong level here which is zero point eighty three.

91
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,820
And as you can see over here Zero Point 83 was a strong resistance line.

92
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,520
It's also a psychological level as well.

93
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,720
So it's good to protect our supply in that way.

94
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,080
Finally if we zoom out a little bit you will see that we are where we were in a downward trend.

95
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:49,410
And so there is a more kind of evidence or support for us to say that the trend will continue in that

96
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,610
direction which is good.

97
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,230
It's always good to trade in line with the overall.

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,940
So right now we're all ready to set our order.

99
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,470
And the last thing that we want to do right now is going to probably delete these Bonacci lines.

100
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,530
Last thing I want to do is we need to measure our Stop-Loss because we will need that for the risk calculation

101
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,100
.

102
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,420
So right now there's about a hundred ninety five pips in the stop loss.

103
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's remember that number and move on to calculation calculating our lots.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,150
All right so you get a lot.

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,760
We have to take the risk in dollar terms and divide by 10 tenth the number of pips and our stop loss

106
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,740
because this is quite a risky trade.

107
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,310
We're trying to break the zero point eight level.

108
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,960
I would rather go a bit more conservative here and that's why we would take about 5 percent of our balance

109
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,310
as opposed to the temps that we sometimes take 5 percent of six hundred nineteen point twenty years

110
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,680
dollars.

111
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,400
Thirty one years dollars.

112
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,470
Let's plug that into the formula.

113
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,600
And so the last thing that we have left to do is to type in our Stop-Loss and pips which is 195.

114
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,080
So let's calculate all of this

115
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,060
31 divided by ten times hundred ninety five.

116
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,210
This is a buzzer point 0 1 5 8.

117
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,720
So you can run this up either down or up.

118
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,470
I'll roll it up.

119
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,910
In this particular instance and that will give us zero point zero two points or two loss.

120
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,480
All right.

121
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,850
That means that we're ready to set our order now.

122
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,580
So now I'm going to click the new order button up the top here.

123
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,450
This will bring up the new order screen.

124
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,270
I'll just zoom out a bit so you can see everything at the same time.

125
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:51,660
All right so our lots are 0.02 Stop-Loss there a point 0.8 3 5 0.

126
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,550
Take profit is 0.7 9 5 0 comments.

127
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,600
Let's call this

128
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,680
fourth order.

129
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:11,940
We'll call this Gartley butterfly doesn't fit.

130
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,190
Just call it Gartley butterfly.

131
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,690
And at the start it's a number.

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,450
All right.

133
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,010
So now we're going to just quickly check that everything is correct and we're going to sell.

134
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,160
Perfect.

135
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:37,900
So there is also order over here and it's all in the market.

136
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,940
We just have to wait for the price to hopefully go in our direction.

137
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,860
All right so we'll leave this order alone for a couple of days and I look forward to seeing you on the

138
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,750
next tutorial.

139
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,350
Until then happy trading
