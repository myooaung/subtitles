Hello this is Kirill from for ex-beau dot com.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,970
And welcome back to the course and for extruding in today's tutorial we will be talking about the triangle

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,580
power.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,990
Now the triangle pattern is a very powerful yet extremely simple formation the 4 X market.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,460
And right now we're going to learn how to use it and make profits with it.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,740
So here we've got a chart a hypothetical chart that's kind of moving sideways.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,750
And if we draw a line above and below the chart we'll see right away that the price is in a triangle

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,380
formation.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,490
Where can we go from here.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,190
Next Well it can continue going in the Triangle had more often than not that's exactly what happens

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,870
the price keeps progressing in the triangle.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,920
But then there's an issue.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:53,220
There's nowhere to go the triangle ends and that's exactly when this happens the price shoots out.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,820
Now the shoot out can go up or down depends on the situation the outcome can be different and often

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,790
very often unpredictable.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,360
However the main core concept of the triangle is the fact that the price the amplitude of the price

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,950
movements is increasing.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,270
So you can kind of witness a consolidation in the market and it's not a coincidence.

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,020
It means that there's something happening in the world or in the traders minds that is forcing them

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,410
to slow down their trading and is increasing the level uncertainty for this particular currency pair

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,740
.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,490
And therefore the market consolidates and then bam all of a sudden something happens and movement picks

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,760
up and it shoots out.

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,940
So more often than not it will happen exactly in this way.

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:53,070
So the triangle will progress towards very close to its end and then the market will exhibit an impulse

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,940
and the price will shoot out up or down.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,660
And that's exactly what we will be taking advantage of.

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,660
So the triangle is also a very good pattern because it actually gives you targets.

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,050
So if you measure the base of the triangle.

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,310
And then you copy this measurement to the place where you think the price will shoot out them.

31
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,400
An aggressive target is exactly the size of the base.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,030
But it is always recommended to go with a more conservative target which is more reliable.

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,100
Half of the base.

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,120
So if you measure half of the base from the point where you think the price will shoot out that's where

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,490
you should such a take profit.

36
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,190
So let's look at the same situation.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,470
But when the price shoots are downwards here you also measure your base copy it over there and said

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,750
Chittick profit at about half the distance of the base.

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,720
So that's all good but in reality we don't know which way the price will shoot up.

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,880
So what do we do do we buy it or do we sell.

41
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,750
Well this is the beauty of training and trying and that's why I love the triangle pattern so much is

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,740
because the price amplitude is narrowing down.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,900
And you know we're you are forecasting that with a very high probability they'll be an impulse but you

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,250
don't know which way but on the forex market you can set stop orders he can said pending orders.

45
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,540
And that's exactly what you should do in this case.

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,060
So instead of buying or selling and taking our chances with that what we're going to do is we're going

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,020
to set two pending orders one by stop order and once sell stop order.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,420
So which ever way the prize goes we're going to earn a profit as long as there is an impulse.

49
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,290
It doesn't matter whether it's upwards or downwards we can earn a profit from that.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,590
And that is a massive advantage of technical analysis over fundamental because in situations like this

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,950
you don't have to predict where the price will go.

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,520
You just have to predict that it'll go somewhere.

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,910
And so we set these two orders and the take profit of each of the orders is set at about half the base

54
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,060
of the triangle.

55
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,260
So that's exactly how you trade the triangle.

56
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:09,930
And moreover further in this course you will see a live example from a real account where I do exactly

57
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,630
that and the trial does shoot out and we do earn a profit.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,640
It's just mind blowing how well the strategy works.

59
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,860
So to sum up of the triangle the three main points first of all triangle means market consolidation

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,540
and it's one of those instruments of technical analysis that can actually picture the psychology of

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,210
traders on the chart.

62
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,910
So that is very powerful so it combines technical analysis and sentiment analysis in one pattern.

63
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,130
The second point is that the most likely exit out of triangle's an impulse doesn't happen 100 percent

64
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,300
of the time but definitely happens more often than not.

65
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,860
And the best part about this is you don't have to predict which way the market will go.

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,160
All you have to do is set a Buy stop and assess stop order.

67
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,410
And whichever way the market goes you have a good chance of earning a profit.

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,640
And finally the triangle gives you a defined target which is a very strong advantage of the parent because

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,840
it makes it straightforward and very easy to incorporate into your trading system.
