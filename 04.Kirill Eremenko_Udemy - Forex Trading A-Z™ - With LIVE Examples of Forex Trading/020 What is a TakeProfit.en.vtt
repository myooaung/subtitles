00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.410
And today we're going to talk about the take profit but before we continue I'd like to ask you to please

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.270
the review for this course.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.680
It's very simple to leave a review if you're on the main page of the course so you have to do is click

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.620
this link up at the top of the star which says write a review and then select the number of stars you

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.100
think the course deserves and maybe write a short message with some feedback for me.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.610
I know we're not finished with the Course yet but I would really appreciate if you could leave a review

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.880
based on the materials you have already seen it would assist other students who have not yet signed

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.310
up for the course in understanding whether the Course is worth their while or not.

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.890
And also to really help me out and I would really appreciate it.

11
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.260
So if you could do that for me that would be just fantastic.

12
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.130
And now let's move on with our course so take profit.

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.960
Let's imagine that we have some sort of market movement which is illustrated by this line chart on the

14
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.720
left.

15
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.050
And also let's assume that your analysis at this point in time suggests that we should enter into a

16
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.570
byword and that's exactly what we do.

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:24.360
Will a take profit is an additional order which you can make part of your buy or so basically you can

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.980
make this alteration to your buy order specifying that if the price ever reaches a certain level then

19
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.890
you want your buy in order to automatically be closed.

20
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.400
So you can always close any order manually with just by clicking on it and telling us trading terminal

21
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.630
to close order.

22
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.810
But in this case you are embedding a condition in your buy order which is called the take profit and

23
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.330
this condition will check whether or not the price is at or above a certain level which is Mark here

24
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.650
with the red line.

25
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.810
And as soon as the prices at that level are above it then the order will be automatically closed.

26
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.440
So let's have a look at an example.

27
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.550
Let's assume the market kept moving from where we entered.

28
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.960
Went up there with a bit down and then shot up straight through the take profit level.

29
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.320
The Green Cross here marks where the order would have been closed.

30
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.100
So you wouldn't have to do anything at all.

31
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.770
It would happen automatically and therefore you would earn a profit from this order closing and that's

32
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.270
why this is called the take profit.

33
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.680
Now for a sell order we have a similar situation.

34
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.530
Let's assume this is the market line chart and then our analysis tells us to enter into sell order which

35
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.060
we successfully do.

36
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.960
Well we can also embed a take profit in the sell order as you would imagine the take profit for a sell

37
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.450
order has to be below the entry point because we will earn profit if the market goes down.

38
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.580
We're taking a short position in the market.

39
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.730
So let's see what happens next.

40
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.730
The market goes against us for a bit then goes in our favor and kind of flattens out a bit and then

41
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.950
it goes straight through take profit.

42
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.350
And that's where our gets closed and we earn profit on the forex market.

43
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.680
That's why it's also called the take profit status or take profit.

44
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.320
Don't forget to leave review for this course if you haven't yet.

45
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.390
And until next time happy trading
