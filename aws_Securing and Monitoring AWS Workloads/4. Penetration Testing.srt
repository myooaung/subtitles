00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,040
I'm sure if you have been working in any securityâ€‘related work,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,020
you may have performed penetration testing to test

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,010
the stability of your network.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,780
Recently,

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,030
AWS has changed the rule, and they will allow conducting penetration tests

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:25,600
without any approval for these eight selected AWS services. From the list,

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,050
you can see that these are some of the core AWS services that most of the

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,590
applications will be using. Previously,

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,740
AWS had strict rules on performing penetration tests, and AWS

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,840
customers were asked to submit penetration testing request form,

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,120
and an account needs to be authorized by AWS before they can

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,140
conduct a penetration test.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,270
Along with granting the services,

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,680
they also have restricted the activities that cannot be performed

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
during penetration testing, and here is the list of prohibited

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,190
activities. Zone walking is a technique that it's used by attackers to

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:14,840
enumerate the full content of DNSSEC signed DNS zones. DNS zone

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,910
walking via Amazon Route 53 hosted zones is strictly not allowed

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,140
during penetration testing.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,970
Denial of service or distributed denial of service or simulated DoS and

21
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,740
DDoS are prohibited during penetration testing as well.

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,150
Port flooding includes UDP flags, ICMP flags, and any other

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,940
spoofed packet flooding is strictly prohibited.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,960
You are allowed to use any open source tools and services to

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,990
simulate and perform security assessment like port scanning,

26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,460
vulnerability scanning, a web application scanning, SQL

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,040
injection, and forgery activities.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,850
However,

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,180
you are not allowed to use any tool or service to simulate

30
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,300
protocol flooding attacks like SYN flooding and resource request

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,480
flooding attacks like HTTP request flooding, login request

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,810
flooding, and API request flooding.

33
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,580
Now,

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,760
if you need to test your network for other simulated events, you need to

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:30,520
send an email to Amazon with the plan dates, account details, other assets

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,640
that are part of under contact information.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,770
Since each submission is manually reviewed, you need to plan your

38
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,390
testing and send this request ahead of time.

39
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,140
Now, if you are planning to stress test your network,

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,540
the policies are very different.

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,970
Before we look at the policy,

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,280
let's see what qualifies as a network stress test. If you are trying to

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,060
generate traffic over 1 billion bits per second or 1 billion packets per

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,150
second that sustains for more than a minute, or if your traffic has a

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,990
potential to impact other associated entities, like a shared service

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:20,000
infrastructure, then you need to fill out on Amazon EC2 Network Stress test intake form, which is obtained by sending an email to Amazon.
