00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.340
Welcome to this module on securing EC2 instances using hardened AMI.

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.130
In this course,

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.410
you will learn the importance of hardening the AMI and why it is

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.840
important to continuously maintain the hardening process.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.940
Then,

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.040
we will look at the EC2 key pairs and some of the best practices in securing it.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.550
Then we will log into AWS Trusted Advisor and understand how to

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.840
identify and assess security concerns in your AWS account.

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.670
Later on,

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.620
you will learn how to use AWS Config to monitor resources that

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.340
are non‑compliant to security standards.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.070
And in this specific module,

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.470
we will learn about the process of hardening an AMI and understand

14
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.400
how to run security assessments using Amazon Inspector to uncover

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.200
security violations in your EC2 instances.

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.460
Before we start looking at hardening the AMI,

17
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.840
let's cover some basics on Amazon Machine Image.

18
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.300
An AMI is like a blueprint for the bricks that you're

19
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.510
going to use in constructing the building.

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.740
If the resource material of that brick is of low quality,

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.110
the whole building can come collapsing down.

22
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.290
In the same way, if an AMI is not built or configured properly,

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.240
it's going to reflect in the strength of your network.

24
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.340
Any time you want to launch a single or multiple EC2 instances,

25
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.340
you need to specify an AMI that holds all the configuration details.

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.420
An AMI typically includes the following details: one or more EBS snapshots,

27
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.840
permissions that control which AWS account can be used to launch EC2 instance,

28
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.020
and the device mapping that specifies the volumes to be

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.010
attached while launching the instance.

30
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.560
AWS also gives you the option of customizing the launched instance and

31
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.760
saving this updated configuration as a custom AMI.

32
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.030
And any new instances that are going to be launched in the future using this

33
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.000
custom AMI will include all the customized config changes.

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.450
Instead of building an AMI from scratch,

35
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.670
you can also purchase AMIs from a third party that

36
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.830
are available in AWS Marketplace.

37
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.670
Hardening from a security standpoint indicates strengthening or

38
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.490
protecting your system against vulnerability attacks.

39
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.410
When you launch an EC2 instance from AMI,

40
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.440
it helps you save time and effort,

41
00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.940
but it will all come crashing down If there is a security loophole in your AMI.

42
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.740
It's like building a house on a weak foundation.

43
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.690
So let's look at some of the common industry accepted hardening

44
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.180
standards that your AMI needs to adhere to.

45
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.790
They are Center for Internet Security, also called as CIS,

46
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.730
International Organization for Standardization,

47
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.130
called as ISO standards, Sysadmin Audit Network Security Institute,

48
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.750
also called as SANS institute, and National Institute of Standards Technology,

49
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.930
NIST.

50
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.760
Let's take a detailed look at the steps involved in the hardening process.

51
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.570
Identify the right base image.

52
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.610
You need to select an AMI that has the latest and greatest

53
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.440
operating system packages and server patches installed.

54
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.040
If this is not chosen properly, you are starting off on a wrong note.

55
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040
So this step is very vital in the hardening process.

56
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.240
Protect credentials.

57
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.480
You need to delete all AWS credentials and third party

58
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.350
credentials from any conflagration files and ensure all

59
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.580
additional certificates are removed from the system.

60
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.020
Any services that authenticates users in clear text format over the

61
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.990
network or in any insecure way needs to be disabled.

62
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.850
Startup script must start only minimum essential administrative services.

63
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.950
The rest of the nonessential network services needs to be shut off.

64
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.360
Access to some of the known vulnerable IP addresses must be

65
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.240
blocked to prevent any kind of DoS and DDos attacks.

66
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.400
As part of customizing your AMI, you may add application servers,

67
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.810
web servers, and database servers to your AMI.

68
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.170
It is very important that these additional services need to be secured by

69
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.400
setting up proper firewall rules, enabling SSN, disabling remote access to DB

70
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.890
servers, and so on and run proper vulnerability checks using many tools

71
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.430
provided by AWS or other third party security vendors. I will encourage you to

72
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.280
look at the security whitepaper published by AWS. You will see a link for that

73
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.840
under exercise file section.

74
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.480
Let's look at some of the tasks that are specific to Linux‑based AMIs.

75
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.510
Remote password authentication and configure SSHD to allow only public key

76
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.420
authentication. Do not allow any default password and delete or disable

77
00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:02.400
passwords for all user accounts and delete all SSH public and private keys.

78
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.290
Any system log files or history commands that may contain sensitive data

79
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.930
needs to be purged as well.

80
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.320
Now let's switch our attention to Windows‑based AMIs. You need

81
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.150
to ensure that guest account is disabled, and all user accounts

82
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.540
have randomly generated passwords.

83
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.180
Clear all the Windows event logs that may contain any sensitive data, and

84
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.940
Windows services, like file sharing, print spooler, RPC, and any other

85
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.990
non‑essential Windows services needs to be disabled as well.

86
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.590
As a security engineer,

87
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.140
you must be aware that this hardening process is not a one‑time process.

88
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.470
You need to be constantly on your toes to apply the latest patches and

89
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.750
install OS fixes and security fixes for any vulnerability attacks that

90
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.430
may surface from time to time. Some of the common bootstrapping

91
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.070
applications that can be used to your benefit are Puppet, Chef,

92
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:14.440
Capistrano, cloud‑init, and cfn‑init.

93
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.770
Now let's look at some of the architectural policies that needs to be

94
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.420
considered if you're planning to create a custom AMI. AMIs cannot be

95
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.900
region‑specific, and they must be able to run in all regions without any

96
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:39.410
modifications. AMIs must use 64‑bit or 64‑bit ARM architecture.

97
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.260
AMIs cannot use paravirtualization and instead must use HVM

98
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:52.210
virtualization only. All AMIs must be backed by Amazon EBS,

99
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:58.630
and they cannot be backed by Amazon S3. AMIs also need to use file

100
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:14.000
systems like EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, XFS, vfat, lvm, and ntfs to pass a self‑service AMI scanning tool test.
