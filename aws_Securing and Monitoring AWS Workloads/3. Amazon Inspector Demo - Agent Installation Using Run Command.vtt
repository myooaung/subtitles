00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.570
Imagine a scenario where you have multiple development

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.210
certification and production instances. Installing the agent

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.860
manually is not going to be a feasible option.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.920
We can automate installing the agent using AWS

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.140
Systems Manager run command feature.

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.340
Let's log in back to AWS console and see a demo.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.940
I currently have three running EC2 instances.

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.550
All these EC2 instances are Amazon Linux 2 instance types.

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.490
These instances come preinstalled with SSM agent.

10
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.940
The instances are set up in such a way that two of the instances

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.220
have development as the value of environment tag, and one of the

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.720
instance has staging as its value.

13
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.510
Though the SSM agents are preinstalled,

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.340
you need to add an IAM role for EC2 instances that allow run command operation.

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.110
All these instances have an IAM role named EC2SSMRole attached to it.

16
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.260
Let me click on this role and you can see this role has a

17
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.140
policy that allows full access to SSM.

18
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.950
You may need to double‑check with your systems engineer if you can use full

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.250
access policy. Now that all of our EC2 instances are prepared well, our

20
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.970
next step is to install the Amazon Inspector agent. I just switched to AWS

21
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.520
Systems Manager run command console.

22
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.550
There is a built‑in command with the name Amazon Inspector

23
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.940
Manage AWS agent. Let me search for it,

24
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.180
let me select it. I'm going to accept the default document version that

25
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.080
is latest and greatest. The only command parameter is installed. Under

26
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.550
Targets, I'm going to select the instances based on tags. Let me enter

27
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.140
Environment as key and Dev as a value.

28
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.460
I have the option to write the output of this command to a

29
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
S3 bucket and send an SMS notification to send the

30
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.640
execution status of this command.

31
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.000
Let me click Run, and you can see under Targets and output, it has

32
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.300
picked up two instances that were part of the development environment

33
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.890
and the status is currently in progress.

34
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.270
Let me refresh it and it looks like the commands are

35
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.890
successfully run against both these instances.

36
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.420
Let me expand the Output section, and you can see that it fetched the agent

37
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:11.080
package URL, validated it, issued a HTTP call to download it, and got a 200

38
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.220
success status, and finally, installed agent. Now let's go back to Amazon

39
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.120
Inspector and create a new assessment run.

40
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.930
Click on Assessment target, choose Create.

41
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.040
Give your assessment target a name. Under Use tags,

42
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
select the development instances only.

43
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.810
Since the agents are already installed, I'm going to

44
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.540
uncheck the install agent option.

45
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.190
Even if you let the inspector install the agent, all your instances need

46
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.520
to have a proper IAM role setup that you saw before.

47
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.660
Running it from run command gives you more flexibility in terms

48
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.500
of tracking a notification. Click Save. Now let's go ahead and

49
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.240
create an assessment template.

50
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.920
Click Create, give your assessment template a name. Under target name,

51
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.150
select the new target that you just created. Under Rules package, I'm

52
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.520
going to choose only Network Reachability.

53
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.540
Let me run this for 1 hour, and under Tags, select only development instances.

54
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.640
I'm going to uncheck recurring assessment run.

55
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.140
Click on Create and run.

56
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.580
You can see our assessment has started and it is going to run

57
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.640
for 1 hour before it displays its findings.

58
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.630
For those assessments that are currently in the running state,

59
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.590
you have the option to check the status. Click on Show status and it displays

60
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.540
the amount of time that the inspector has been analyzing,

61
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.000
Click on Show agents and you can see the two instances against

62
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.740
which the assessment is currently being run.

63
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.600
It has been more than an hour and let me login back to Amazon Inspector.

64
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.400
There are four recent findings in the recently completed run. Let me

65
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.540
click on the recent run, click on the findings.

66
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.740
There are two medium and two information findings.

67
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.760
Let me click on the information finding and it looks like the

68
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.340
ports are reachable from the internet through ENI.

69
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.930
Let us go back and choose what the medium findings are.

70
00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.640
It looks like port 22 is open and accessible from the internet.

71
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.000
Along with the findings, you can also see the recommendation by AWS to address this vulnerability.
