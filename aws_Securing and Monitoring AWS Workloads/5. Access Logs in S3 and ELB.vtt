00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.840
In this clip we will see how to set up access logs in S3 and ELB.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.950
To begin with, let's see how to set up access logs in the S3.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.310
Choose S3 and go to S3 console.

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.170
I'm going to use this S3 bucket, globomantics, to host a static website.

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.940
And I have uploaded a couple of simple HTML files, index.html and error.html.

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.900
Go to Permissions tab.

7
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.040
Under Block public access you can see that I have turned off blocking.

8
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.250
Choose the tab Bucket Policy.

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.440
And I've added a new service ID with the name PublicReadGetObject

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.540
that allows GetObject action in this bucket.

11
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740
Go to the tab Properties.

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.090
Choose Server access logging.

13
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.840
It is recommended by S3 not to use the source and target as the same S3 buckets.

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.040
I have a different S3 bucket under bucket target.

15
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.340
You can mention a prefix to differentiate the logs.

16
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.510
Click Save.

17
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.440
In order to test this feature I'm going to enable static web hosting as well.

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.790
I have specified index.html as the index page and I

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.140
have turned on bucket hosting.

20
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.010
Let me open a new tab and enter the URL to this page.

21
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.840
And you can see the index.html is being served directly from

22
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.680
the S3 bucket without any HTTP server.

23
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.940
Let's go back to our target bucket and check the logs.

24
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.240
Choose the S3 bucket globomantics‑target.

25
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.980
You can see we have a bunch of files with the prefix globo that

26
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.440
we mentioned while setting up the access logs.

27
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.170
Let me click one of them,

28
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.710
and you can get a detailed view of this file including the ETag information.

29
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.540
Now let's turn our attention to Application Load Balancer.

30
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.280
Go to EC2 console.

31
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.640
To your left,

32
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.520
choose Load Balancers. I already have a load balancer

33
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.020
with the name Globo‑Application,

34
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.440
and it's currently listening for connection requests at port 80.

35
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.130
Click on Target Groups. And there are two instances that are linked as

36
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.640
registered targets. To enable access logging, let's go back to Load

37
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.420
Balancers. Choose Description. Scroll down. Under Attributes,

38
00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.340
click on Edit attributes. Choose Enable to enable access logs.

39
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.970
If you have an existing S3 bucket that you would like to use you can mention

40
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.480
the bucket URL here or you can choose to create a new one.

41
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.610
I'm going to create a new S3 bucket. Click Save to enable ELB access logs.

42
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.600
Let's go back to S3 and validate the same. Under Services, click on

43
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.070
S3. Under the list of buckets you can see a new bucket with the

44
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.180
name globomantics‑elb has been created.

45
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.930
Let me click that.

46
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.060
And you can see a folder with the name AWSglobo that corresponds to the path

47
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.760
that we mentioned. There is another folder that corresponds to my account ID.

48
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.440
And you can see that is a test file logged by ELB.

49
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.830
Let me go back to the bucket and choose Permissions tab. Click on Bucket Policy.

50
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.350
You can see two service IDs with the names AWSLogDeliveryWrite and

51
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.000
AWSLogDeliveryAclCheck have been automatically generated.

52
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.150
These are the bucket policy changes that you may need to manually

53
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.000
apply if you have chosen to use an existing S3 bucket instead of creating a new bucket like we did here.
