00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.810
Let's turn our attention to AWS Systems Manager.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.990
It offers a number of management and governance capabilities

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.800
that can be group under five broad categories.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.240
First one is Operations Management.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.380
This is a suite of capabilities that helps you manage AWS resources.

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.360
Application Management is a set of capabilities that lets you

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.540
manage the applications that are running in AWS.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.820
Actions & Change let's you automate some of the common maintenance tasks,

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.930
like applying OS patches, resetting SSH keys and passwords.

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.780
Instances & Nodes offers multiple capabilities for

11
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.820
managing your on‑premises service, VMs, and your EC2 instances.

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.960
We will dive deep and see a demo of two main functionalities,

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.640
Run Command and Session Manager shortly.

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.700
And the last one is Shared Resources.

15
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.540
That maintains all the documents for managing and configuring AWS resources.

16
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.640
Let's see a demo of how to use Run Command.

17
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.600
It lets you securely manage the configuration of a managed instance.

18
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.740
A managed instance can be an EC2 instance or an on‑premises instance.

19
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.440
To manage any instance, there are a few prerequisites that needs to be made.

20
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.950
First one is to install SSM agent,

21
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.930
and the agent is preinstalled on AMIs like Amazon Linux,

22
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.990
Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu Server 16.04 and 18.04,

23
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.620
and Windows Server 2016 and 2019.

24
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.710
If you have chosen any other AMIs, you need to manually install the agent.

25
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.650
Please refer to AWS documentation for detailed

26
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.000
instruction on how to install this agent.

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.270
Next one is creating the IAM role on associating it with your EC2 instance.

28
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.840
Let's log in to AWS Console and see a demo of all these steps.

29
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.140
Since the instance that I launched already had SSM preinstalled,

30
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.510
I'm going to set up the IAM role first.

31
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.340
Go to IAM console.

32
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.040
Click on Roles to your left.

33
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.370
Choose Create Role.

34
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.510
Choose EC2 under Common use cases, and click on Permissions.

35
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.930
Next, to filter policies, type SSM, and select the policy, AmazonEC2RoleforSSM.

36
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.900
Click Tags.

37
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.040
I'm going to add Environment as key and Dev as the value.

38
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.570
Click Review.

39
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.240
Enter a name for the role under description.

40
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.670
Click Create role.

41
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.290
A new role with the name globo_dev_access has been created.

42
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.930
Now let's go back to EC2 console and link our EC2 instance to this role.

43
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.040
Click on Running instances.

44
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.040
Select the instance, and currently there are no roles linked with this instance.

45
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.460
Let's set up this connection now.

46
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.640
Click Actions.

47
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.470
Choose Instance Settings and select Attach/Replace IAM Role.

48
00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:02.840
Under IAM role, select globo_dev_access, and click Apply.

49
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.510
Click Close.

50
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.580
Scroll up,

51
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.940
and you can see the new IAM role has been

52
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.340
successfully linked with this EC2 instance.

53
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.780
Now let's go back to Systems Manager and see how Run Command works.

54
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.240
I just switched to AWS Systems Manager console.

55
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.140
Click on Run Command to your left.

56
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.340
Choose Run Command.

57
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.040
Click on the search bar, and choose Document name prefix,

58
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.380
select Equals, and enter AWS‑RunShellScript.

59
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.240
Under Command parameters, enter a simple yum update command,

60
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.540
which you will run at the Linux command prompt.

61
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.360
You have the option to enter the working directory where

62
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.650
you would like to issue the command, and a default timeout has been already set.

63
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.840
Now let's select the instance where you would like to run this command.

64
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.970
Let's choose the instance manually,

65
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.350
and select the instance where we link the IAM role.

66
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.560
Under the Output options,

67
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.730
you can either choose and S3 bucket where you would like to

68
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.170
write the output or select the CloudWatch log group where

69
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.430
you would like to send the logs.

70
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.540
There is an option to trigger the SNS notification as well.

71
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.310
Click Run, and the Run Command is currently being executed.

72
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.270
Let me hit Refresh,

73
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.810
and you can see that the Run Command has been successfully completed,

74
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.040
and its start time and end time are displayed.

75
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.630
Let me select the instance and click on View output.

76
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.140
Expand the Output section,

77
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.000
and you can see the output of the command that issued to Run Command is being displayed here.
