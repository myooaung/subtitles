1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,540
Let's switch our attention to AWS GuardDuty.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,840
When you enter some of the large retail stores,

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,530
you may have seen people wearing a vest that say's Loss

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,500
Prevention Officer whose primary duty is to monitor the stores

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,700
and to promote the safety and security.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,210
AWS GuardDuty is the loss prevention officer of your AWS account.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,090
AWS GuardDuty uses machine learning to identify

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,130
malicious activities in your account, like exposed credentials,

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,740
communication with malicious IP addresses,

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,150
unauthorized infrastructure deployments,

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,750
and password policy changes.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,840
AWS GuardDuty can analyze CloudTrail logs,

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,080
VPC Flow logs, and DNS logs for any unauthorized activities.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,190
You can set up a trusted IP list that are highly secure so that GuardDuty

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,070
doesn't generate findings from these set of IP addresses.

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,700
And you can also set up a threat IP list so that you can pay more

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,000
attention if you see them in GuardDuty findings.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,210
This AWS service is disabled by default,

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,600
and once enabled, you will have a free 30 days trial.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,740
Let's jump into a quick demo and learn about AWS GuardDuty.

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:39,340
I just logged into AWS Console. Search for AWS GuardDuty. Click on Get

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,110
started. Before enabling the GuardDuty, let's take a look at the

23
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,080
service role permissions. This lists the permissions that are needed by

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,840
GuardDuty to generate the findings.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,560
You can see the DescribeInstance and DescribeImages actions have been

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,230
included. Click on Enable GuardDuty. And it may take a few seconds

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,540
before GuardDuty console gets activity.

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,340
Findings tab lists all the current findings.

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,570
Click on Settings, and you'll see an option to export your findings

30
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,000
to a specific location at a specific interval.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,300
You can either create a new S3 bucket or use an existing bucket to store these

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,550
findings. In order to preview how the real findings might look, GuardDuty gives

33
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,520
you the option to generate a few sample findings.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Click on Generate sample findings.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,730
Click on Findings to your left, and you will see a

36
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,540
bunch of findings sorted by severity.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Click on the first one, which alerts you that a potential

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,610
denial‑of‑service attack might be going on.

39
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,080
It shows the instance ID, Availability Zone, private IP address, and

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,600
public IP address. Click on Lists to your left.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,050
You can add the trusted IP list and threat IP list here.

42
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:24,360
Under Accounts, you can add other AWS accounts that needs

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,040
to be monitored by GuardDuty.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,220
In that case,

45
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:36,000
your account will be considered as master account, and the other account will become your member account.
