00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.350
In this clip we will see how to set up a unified CloudWatch agent and

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.040
monitor the logs from EC2 instance in CloudWatch.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.340
I just logged into AWS Management Console.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.640
Click on IAM.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.140
Before installing the CloudWatch agent, let's address some of the prerequisites.

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.420
And the important one is creating an IAM role and

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.560
attaching it to your EC2 instance.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.840
To your left, click on Roles.

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.310
Choose Create role.

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.040
Under Choose a use case, select EC2.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.340
Click on Permissions.

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.340
Let's search for AmazonEC2RoleforSSM.

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.780
This is one of the policies that you must have in your IAM role if you

14
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.800
would want the CloudWatch agent to be integrated with SSM.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.150
Next policy that you need to have is CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy.

16
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.690
Let me search for it and include it as part of the role.

17
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.140
Click Review.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.400
Give your role a name and click on Create role.

19
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.840
A new role with the name CloudWatchAgentRole has been created,

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.540
which we are going to associate with are EC2 instance.

21
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.640
Click EC2 from the Admin console.

22
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.640
I'm going to launch a new instance.

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.540
Let me choose 2018.03.0 AMI.

24
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.440
I'm going to stick to t2.micro type.

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.840
Click on Review and Launch.

26
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.340
Click Launch.

27
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.140
Acknowledge that you have access to the key pair and select Launch Instances.

28
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.420
Select the instance that we just launched.

29
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.490
Under Description, you can see there are no IAM rules being currently linked.

30
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.430
Right‑click the instance, the Instance Settings,

31
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.010
and click on Attach/Replace IAM Role.

32
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.740
Select the IAM role that you just created.

33
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.420
Click Apply.

34
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.220
Click Close.

35
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.230
Let's go back and check the IAM role on the Description tab.

36
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.410
Now you can see that the CloudWatchAgentRole has

37
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.340
been associated with this instance.

38
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.840
I just connected to this EC2 instance using a PuTTY terminal.

39
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.410
I'm going to install a few required packages like zip and unzip.

40
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.200
You can download the CloudWatch agent zip file from this URL.

41
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.000
And I'm going to wget to this URL and download the file.

42
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.700
Let me unzip the file.

43
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.200
I'm going to execute install.sh to install the CloudWatch agent.

44
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:33.280
The default location is under /opt/aws/amazon‑cloudwatch‑agent.

45
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.540
Our next step is to create a config file,

46
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.310
and you can use the wizard provided by CloudWatch

47
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.040
agent or manually create the file.

48
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.200
I'm going to use the wizard.

49
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.260
This wizard will ask you a series of questions and build a config file

50
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.140
in the JSON format. Let me accept the default choice here as we are

51
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.450
using a Linux instance. We are using the EC2 instance. Root user will

52
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.800
be running the agent in our case.

53
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.070
You may need to change this if you need to select a

54
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.400
different user who will be running the agent.

55
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.250
I would like the StatsD daemon to be turned on.

56
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.940
I'm going to accept the default 8125 port.

57
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.910
I won't accept the default collection and aggregation interval.

58
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.360
Let me choose the default choice to monitor metrics from CollectD. Yes,

59
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.990
I would like to monitor CPU and memory.

60
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.170
I'm going to accept the default choice to monitor the CPU

61
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:54.320
metrics per core, adding EC2 dimensions, default collection

62
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.150
interval, and the default metrics config.

63
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.590
It lists the default config that you just created using the wizard,

64
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.480
and you have the option either to keep it or to edit it further.

65
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.170
I'm not going to migrate any existing CloudWatch agent, but

66
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.510
I'm going to monitor existing log files.

67
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.840
I'm going to monitor /var/log/messages.

68
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.420
I'm going to provide a log group customized to name.

69
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.950
And then I don't want to monitor any other log files.

70
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.190
And I also don't want to store the config in the SSM Parameter Store.

71
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.860
You can see a new file with the name config.json has been created.

72
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.210
I'm going to use amazon‑cloudwatch‑agent‑ctl utility to start

73
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.190
the agent by giving a link to this file.

74
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.340
It looks like there is a failure when starting the agent.

75
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.860
I believe this instance doesn't come preloaded with collectd utility,

76
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.750
and I'm going to manually install it.

77
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.660
Now that collectd is installed, let us try restarting the

78
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.840
agent The message No csm configuration found is a warning

79
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.880
message and we can safely disregard it.

80
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.590
It looks like our agent is started now. Let's use the status

81
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.830
option and make sure our agent is running.

82
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.400
Let's go back to CloudWatch console and make sure

83
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.940
that the logs are being recorded.

84
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:48.300
Choose Logs to your left. Choose get started. Click on the

85
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.900
log group messages_Globomantics. Select the log stream

86
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.610
that matches the instance ID.

87
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:05.340
And you can see the logs from /var/logs/messages are being streamed here.

88
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:15.000
If you prefer to monitor any other application logs or OS logs all you need to do is to modify the JSON file and restart the service.
