00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.430
Let's jump into a demo and check how to generate security reports with

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.060
Amazon Inspector. Before we generate the report, we need to install an

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.710
agent in our EC2 instance. I'm going to use the key pair that I

4
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.950
previously generated on SSH to my EC2 instance. Let's download the

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.930
package from the URL provided in the inspector documentation. You can

6
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.740
use either wget or cURL.

7
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.620
Let's install the downloaded package and make sure you run as a root user.

8
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.440
The installation may take a few seconds before it completes.

9
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.300
You can check the status of this agent by running

10
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.940
this agent with the status option.

11
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.750
Let's go back to AWS console and go to Amazon Inspector

12
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.260
Service. From the dashboard, you can see that currently

13
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.900
there are no assessments running.

14
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.410
Click on Help me create an Assessment, and you can see the inspector uses

15
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.140
a Serviceâ€‘linked role and you have the option to perform assessment on

16
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
both on the network, as well as on the host.

17
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.340
And you can see, and to access the host, you need the agent to be

18
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
installed. Under Host Assessments, you can see that the agent is

19
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.250
going to be installed automatically, however,

20
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.090
you also saw before how to install it manually as well. I'm going to

21
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.860
leave both the options checked and click on Run once. Now you can see

22
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.930
the list of assessments that are going to be run during network

23
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:07.430
assessment and host assessment. Click OK to continue. Click on

24
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.640
Assessment templates to your left.

25
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640
You can see the list of rules packages that are included

26
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
as part of the assessment process.

27
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.350
Click on Assessment target and it shows all the instances in the current AWS

28
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.410
account that will be included in the scanning process.

29
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250
Go back to a dashboard and you can see there is one

30
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.240
assessment currently running.

31
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.720
Click that. You can see that it is currently collecting data and the duration

32
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.730
of this assessment is 1 hour. Click on Show status and you can see that

33
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.540
Amazon Inspector has been analyzing the instances.

34
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.160
Now click on Show agents and the agent is running and it is collecting data.

35
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.660
You can also see there are no findings being published yet.

36
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.660
I just waited for an hour and you can see the status

37
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.980
of the run is Analysis complete, and there are 106 findings.

38
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.480
Click on Findings to your left, and you can see a lot

39
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.110
of high and medium and low findings.

40
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.880
Click on one of them,

41
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.190
and you can see the severity and the findings and the

42
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.450
detailed description of each one of them.

43
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.760
To download the report, let's go back to the Assessment Run and

44
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.920
click on Download report. Choose the Findings report and select

45
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.430
the format. Click on Generate report.

46
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.080
This may take a while before the report gets generated.

47
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.350
This is 112 pages PDF report that lists all the findings in the current

48
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.640
assessment run. The executive summary shows there are 93 high severity,

49
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.500
3 medium, and 9 information findings.

50
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.940
As you scroll down the document,

51
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:41.000
you can see the rules package that was used as part of the assessment, and it also gives a detailed look of each finding.
