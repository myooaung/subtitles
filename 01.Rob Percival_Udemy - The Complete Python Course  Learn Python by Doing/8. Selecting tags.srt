<v ->Hi guys, welcome back.</v>

00:00:01,710  -->  00:00:05,600 line:15% 
In this video, we're going to look at selecting a tag.
3

3

00:00:05,600  -->  00:00:07,300
We're gonna go about it the opposite way
4

4

00:00:07,300  -->  00:00:10,060
than we've been going about things until now.
5

5

00:00:10,060  -->  00:00:12,590
We're gonna start off at app.py,
6

6

00:00:12,590  -->  00:00:15,080
and then we're gonna move over to the quotes page.
7

7

00:00:15,080  -->  00:00:18,380
And this way of developing can be really good
8

8

00:00:18,380  -->  00:00:20,410
as well, so I'm just gonna try it out
9

9

00:00:20,410  -->  00:00:22,340
so that you can see what I mean by it,
10

10

00:00:22,340  -->  00:00:24,970
and maybe you can do this on your projects.
11

11

00:00:24,970  -->  00:00:28,380
And what I mean is we're gonna first decide
12

12

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:31,700
what we want to do and then we're gonna go over
13

13

00:00:31,700  -->  00:00:35,280
to our quotes page and implement how that's done.
14

14

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:39,450
So what we wanna achieve is to select an author,
15

15

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:42,450
then we wanna look at what tags are available.
16

16

00:00:42,450  -->  00:00:43,940
We wanna tell the user look you've got
17

17

00:00:43,940  -->  00:00:46,190
these tags, which one do you want?
18

18

00:00:46,190  -->  00:00:49,830
And then we're gonna select a tag from those.
19

19

00:00:49,830  -->  00:00:53,980
So we can do something like tags = something like
20

20

00:00:53,980  -->  00:00:56,930
page.get_available_tags,
21

21

00:00:56,930  -->  00:00:59,030
and notice that this doesn't exist yet,
22

22

00:00:59,030  -->  00:01:02,440
but this is just me using something
23

23

00:01:02,440  -->  00:01:04,180
that I know doesn't exist yet
24

24

00:01:04,180  -->  00:01:05,480
because I'm trying to decide
25

25

00:01:05,480  -->  00:01:08,570
how I wanna interact with a page object,
26

26

00:01:08,570  -->  00:01:09,600
so that I can then go
27

27

00:01:09,600  -->  00:01:10,840
and implemented these meth--
28

28

00:01:10,840  -->  00:01:13,510
Then we can say something like select one
29

29

00:01:13,510  -->  00:01:17,700
of these tags, and we're gonna put a list there
30

30

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:18,980
with format
31

31

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:22,263
that .join tags.
32

32

00:01:23,500  -->  00:01:24,393
So this tells us a little bit
33

33

00:01:24,393  -->  00:01:26,478
about get_available tags.
34

34

00:01:26,478  -->  00:01:28,210
Get_available tags is gonna give us
35

35

00:01:28,210  -->  00:01:31,750
a list of strings, and then we're going to join
36

36

00:01:31,750  -->  00:01:34,730
those strings using this pipe character,
37

37

00:01:34,730  -->  00:01:36,040
which is gonna essentially give us
38

38

00:01:36,040  -->  00:01:39,620
something like love/music
39

39

00:01:40,630  -->  00:01:42,590
and anything else.
40

40

00:01:42,590  -->  00:01:43,860
And so on, this is what that join is gonna do,
41

41

00:01:43,860  -->  00:01:47,220
and it's gonna print it out in this string
42

42

00:01:47,220  -->  00:01:49,233
inside these square brackets.
43

43

00:01:50,720  -->  00:01:52,610
And then we're gonna ask the user
44

44

00:01:52,610  -->  00:01:53,610
for their selected_tag.
45

45

00:01:53,610  -->  00:01:55,883
We're gonna say input enter your tag,
46

46

00:01:57,660  -->  00:02:00,240
and finally we're gonna do page.select_tag,
47

47

00:02:01,280  -->  00:02:04,710
and we're gonna pass in this selected_tag there.
48

48

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:08,930
So what this means is that we've now decided
49

49

00:02:08,930  -->  00:02:11,580
how we want to use the page,
50

50

00:02:11,580  -->  00:02:13,193
the QuotesPage, class.
51

51

00:02:14,120  -->  00:02:16,840
If we are happy with this implementation,
52

52

00:02:16,840  -->  00:02:19,810
we can go and actually write these methods
53

53

00:02:19,810  -->  00:02:22,700
in the class, so let's go and do that.
54

54

00:02:22,700  -->  00:02:24,360
We're gonna go over to QuotesPage,
55

55

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:26,060
and it's gonna be very similar
56

56

00:02:26,060  -->  00:02:27,650
to what we have here.
57

57

00:02:27,650  -->  00:02:30,410
All we're gonna do is add another drop-down,
58

58

00:02:30,410  -->  00:02:31,793
very much like this one,
59

59

00:02:34,120  -->  00:02:36,370
that says tags_dropdown,
60

60

00:02:37,220  -->  00:02:40,100
and it's gonna find by TAG_DROPDOWN there,
61

61

00:02:40,100  -->  00:02:42,380
and it's just the same thing as before.
62

62

00:02:42,380  -->  00:02:45,443
And as well as select_author we're gonna have
63

63

00:02:45,443  -->  00:02:49,060
get_available_tags, which returns a list
64

64

00:02:49,060  -->  00:02:50,790
of strings as we agreed earlier.
65

65

00:02:50,790  -->  00:02:54,540
And that is gonna return option.text.strip
66

66

00:02:54,540  -->  00:02:59,120
for_option in_self.tags_dropdown.options.
67

67

00:02:59,120  -->  00:03:02,373
And once you have a select,
68

68

00:03:03,240  -->  00:03:05,540
you can access all the options inside it,
69

69

00:03:05,540  -->  00:03:08,040
and then you can do option.text
70

70

00:03:08,040  -->  00:03:10,847
for the actual contents of the option,
71

71

00:03:10,847  -->  00:03:12,650
.strip is gonna remove any white space
72

72

00:03:12,650  -->  00:03:15,240
at the end and at the start of an option,
73

73

00:03:15,240  -->  00:03:17,730
so that it doesn't have any extraneous
74

74

00:03:17,730  -->  00:03:20,420
white space when you print it out.
75

75

00:03:20,420  -->  00:03:23,715
And then we also need select_tag,
76

76

00:03:23,715  -->  00:03:25,680
which takes in a tag_name
77

77

00:03:25,680  -->  00:03:27,230
which is a string, and then just
78

78

00:03:27,230  -->  00:03:28,774
a self.tags_dropdown
79

79

00:03:28,774  -->  00:03:33,620
.select_by_visible_text tag name.
80

80

00:03:33,620  -->  00:03:34,810
Too many brackets there.
81

81

00:03:34,810  -->  00:03:35,663
There you go.
82

82

00:03:37,620  -->  00:03:39,800
So these are methods that we wanted to use
83

83

00:03:39,800  -->  00:03:42,040
from our app.py and, like I said earlier,
84

84

00:03:42,040  -->  00:03:43,240
this is just going
85

85

00:03:43,240  -->  00:03:45,620
the other way round for developing.
86

86

00:03:45,620  -->  00:03:48,280
Instead of trying to get the whole programme
87

87

00:03:48,280  -->  00:03:51,060
in your head, and implement all the methods
88

88

00:03:51,060  -->  00:03:53,380
and then go and try to use them,
89

89

00:03:53,380  -->  00:03:56,720
you can decide what you wanna achieve first,
90

90

00:03:56,720  -->  00:03:58,250
and then go and implements the methods you need
91

91

00:03:58,250  -->  00:03:59,120
in order to do that.
92

92

00:03:59,120  -->  00:04:01,040
I actually do this quite often,
93

93

00:04:01,040  -->  00:04:02,640
and you may like this way of going
94

94

00:04:02,640  -->  00:04:03,690
about things as well.
95

95

00:04:04,560  -->  00:04:06,543
Let's go and run this,
96

96

00:04:08,020  -->  00:04:09,960
and Chrome will appear first,
97

97

00:04:09,960  -->  00:04:13,220
then we can select Bob Marley,
98

98

00:04:13,220  -->  00:04:14,800
and then you get here select one
99

99

00:04:14,800  -->  00:04:16,450
of these tags, which are all the tags
100

100

00:04:16,450  -->  00:04:17,480
in the drop-down.
101

101

00:04:17,480  -->  00:04:19,420
Notice that in order to get these tags,
102

102

00:04:19,420  -->  00:04:20,910
the browser has already selected
103

103

00:04:20,910  -->  00:04:22,900
Bob Marley from the drop-down,
104

104

00:04:22,900  -->  00:04:24,750
so then we can enter our tag
105

105

00:04:24,750  -->  00:04:28,550
and, by the way, this here is the first element
106

106

00:04:28,550  -->  00:04:30,530
of the drop-down, the one that you can see
107

107

00:04:30,530  -->  00:04:31,860
selected right now.
108

108

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:34,700
And then you've got love, music and friendship.
109

109

00:04:34,700  -->  00:04:36,660
So these are the other elements
110

110

00:04:36,660  -->  00:04:37,800
in the drop-down,
111

111

00:04:37,800  -->  00:04:40,760
you could get rid of this one if you really wanted to,
112

112

00:04:40,760  -->  00:04:42,780
but to be honest I think is a problem
113

113

00:04:42,780  -->  00:04:45,150
with the website more so than anything else.
114

114

00:04:45,150  -->  00:04:47,420
This is a thing that you can select,
115

115

00:04:47,420  -->  00:04:50,040
so I think it makes sense to leave it in there,
116

116

00:04:50,040  -->  00:04:51,890
and then we're gonna select love,
117

117

00:04:51,890  -->  00:04:54,080
for example, and there you have that
118

118

00:04:54,080  -->  00:04:56,650
selected in the drop-down.
119

119

00:04:56,650  -->  00:04:58,070
The next step is, of course,
120

120

00:04:58,070  -->  00:04:59,120
to press the search button
121

121

00:04:59,120  -->  00:05:00,860
and get the quote information out.
122

122

00:05:00,860  -->  00:05:02,700
All right, that's everything for this video.
123

123

00:05:02,700  -->  00:05:05,260
Just wanted to show you this alternative approach
124

124

00:05:05,260  -->  00:05:06,580
and, of course, implement
125

125

00:05:06,580  -->  00:05:08,777
the tag selection in our programme.
126

126

00:05:08,777  -->  00:05:10,400
We can move onto the next video
127

127

00:05:10,400  -->  00:05:12,470
where we're gonna do some searching.
128

128

00:05:12,470  -->  00:05:13,420 line:15% 
I'll see you there.
