<v ->Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,370  -->  00:00:03,010
In this video, I'm going to show you
3

3

00:00:03,010  -->  00:00:06,331
how you can re-use your Mailgun sending code
4

4

00:00:06,331  -->  00:00:10,180
just by putting it inside a library file
5

5

00:00:10,180  -->  00:00:12,083
and calling it from your other code.
6

6

00:00:12,930  -->  00:00:16,810
So this is just a re-factoring of this code here.
7

7

00:00:16,810  -->  00:00:17,643
I had to make it up at night,
8

8

00:00:17,643  -->  00:00:19,360
but nonetheless, I thought I should show you
9

9

00:00:19,360  -->  00:00:22,070
how I do this normally in my other projects.
10

10

00:00:22,070  -->  00:00:23,680
It's really straightforward.
11

11

00:00:23,680  -->  00:00:27,070
What we do is in your project, you'll want to have
12

12

00:00:27,070  -->  00:00:30,500
a new Python package that you're gonna call libs.
13

13

00:00:30,500  -->  00:00:32,927
And normally, you'll have a package like this one
14

14

00:00:32,927  -->  00:00:35,402
in most projects as long as you're using
15

15

00:00:35,402  -->  00:00:37,420
other external services.
16

16

00:00:37,420  -->  00:00:40,420
In this case, we're using the external service Mailgun.
17

17

00:00:40,420  -->  00:00:42,929
Mailgun gives us an API that we can interact with
18

18

00:00:42,929  -->  00:00:47,929
but there is a small issue of sorts
19

19

00:00:49,094  -->  00:00:53,910
that here we're not really, in terms of our code,
20

20

00:00:53,910  -->  00:00:57,970
we're not really interacting with Mailgun directly.
21

21

00:00:57,970  -->  00:01:01,673
When you read this code, it's a bit too raw.
22

22

00:01:01,673  -->  00:01:03,560
You can see that what you're doing is
23

23

00:01:03,560  -->  00:01:05,360
you're making a request to some API
24

24

00:01:05,360  -->  00:01:07,610
and then something's happening and so forth.
25

25

00:01:07,610  -->  00:01:11,290
And unless you know exactly what this API is doing,
26

26

00:01:11,290  -->  00:01:13,150
it may not be immediately obvious
27

27

00:01:13,150  -->  00:01:15,040
that this is sending an email.
28

28

00:01:15,040  -->  00:01:16,940
Of course, you now know what this code does
29

29

00:01:16,940  -->  00:01:19,500
and if you see a post request to something
30

30

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:21,099
called Mailgun, you know what Mailgun is,
31

31

00:01:21,099  -->  00:01:23,770
and you see a from, to, subject, and text,
32

32

00:01:23,770  -->  00:01:26,560
you can probably guess this is sending an email.
33

33

00:01:26,560  -->  00:01:30,150
But what I need to say is that this code here
34

34

00:01:30,150  -->  00:01:34,870
isn't what you'd read as send an email.
35

35

00:01:34,870  -->  00:01:38,173
You'd read this as make a post request to someplace.
36

36

00:01:39,260  -->  00:01:41,400
So it's always a good idea to put this code
37

37

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:43,239
inside a function and call that function
38

38

00:01:43,239  -->  00:01:46,908
send an email and that way when you read
39

39

00:01:46,908  -->  00:01:51,120
in some other part of your programme, send email,
40

40

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:53,198
you'll know that that function is sending an email
41

41

00:01:53,198  -->  00:01:54,950
and you won't have to worry about
42

42

00:01:54,950  -->  00:01:57,110
whether it's sending a post request or a get request
43

43

00:01:57,110  -->  00:01:58,790
to some place.
44

44

00:01:58,790  -->  00:02:00,600
So with that said, we'll go into our libs folder,
45

45

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:02,020
create a new Python file.
46

46

00:02:02,020  -->  00:02:04,320
I'm gonna call this Mailgun dot py,
47

47

00:02:04,320  -->  00:02:07,362
because this is gonna contain our Mailgun library.
48

48

00:02:07,362  -->  00:02:10,850
This is going to be a Python file
49

49

00:02:10,850  -->  00:02:15,410
that is going to encapsulate that sending of a request.
50

50

00:02:15,410  -->  00:02:16,700
And it's going to encapsulate it
51

51

00:02:16,700  -->  00:02:19,470
and call it in a bit nicer way.
52

52

00:02:19,470  -->  00:02:22,010
So we're going to import requests in here.
53

53

00:02:22,010  -->  00:02:24,480
Then we're gonna have our class Mailgun
54

54

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:28,240
and this class Mailgun is going to have a few properties,
55

55

00:02:28,240  -->  00:02:32,620
an API URL, API key, and also a from name and from email.
56

56

00:02:32,620  -->  00:02:34,320
So we're gonna paste those in here.
57

57

00:02:34,320  -->  00:02:36,380
Now the assumption for this class is
58

58

00:02:36,380  -->  00:02:38,270
that these are all static properties,
59

59

00:02:38,270  -->  00:02:40,260
they're never going to change
60

60

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:44,620
and so we can just set and hardcode the values in here.
61

61

00:02:44,620  -->  00:02:46,140
This may not be true for your project.
62

62

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:48,030
Maybe you'll want to be sending emails
63

63

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:50,147
from different people and in that case,
64

64

00:02:50,147  -->  00:02:52,610
you'll wanna re-structure this slightly.
65

65

00:02:52,610  -->  00:02:55,100
I'll show you how in just a moment.
66

66

00:02:55,100  -->  00:02:59,430
Then, we're going to have a class method in here
67

67

00:02:59,430  -->  00:03:01,720
that I'm gonna call send email.
68

68

00:03:01,720  -->  00:03:04,160
And this is going to get three arguments:
69

69

00:03:04,160  -->  00:03:07,030
the emails that you wanna send an email to,
70

70

00:03:07,030  -->  00:03:08,990
the subject, and the content.
71

71

00:03:08,990  -->  00:03:09,960
Now, okay?
72

72

00:03:09,960  -->  00:03:10,900
And then what we're gonna do is,
73

73

00:03:10,900  -->  00:03:13,458
we're gonna copy this requests.post
74

74

00:03:13,458  -->  00:03:16,660
and instead of Mailgun API URL,
75

75

00:03:16,660  -->  00:03:19,530
we're gonna do cls.Mailgun API URL.
76

76

00:03:19,530  -->  00:03:20,850
Instead of Mailgun API Key,
77

77

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:23,460
we're gonna do cls.Mailgun API Key.
78

78

00:03:23,460  -->  00:03:26,110
And instead of to emails as a constant,
79

79

00:03:26,110  -->  00:03:30,460
we're gonna do to emails, the parameter.
80

80

00:03:30,460  -->  00:03:32,710
Subject is also going to be the parameter.
81

81

00:03:32,710  -->  00:03:34,910
Content is also going to be the parameter.
82

82

00:03:34,910  -->  00:03:36,500
And of course, from name and from email
83

83

00:03:36,500  -->  00:03:38,623
should also be inside CLS.
84

84

00:03:41,200  -->  00:03:42,530
That's it.
85

85

00:03:42,530  -->  00:03:43,730
We're gonna remove this comment here.
86

86

00:03:43,730  -->  00:03:45,930
Let's assume we already know what that does.
87

87

00:03:47,210  -->  00:03:49,250
And really, that's everything you need.
88

88

00:03:49,250  -->  00:03:53,390
You put in here your API URL and your API Key
89

89

00:03:53,390  -->  00:03:56,130
and you can hardcode your name and your email
90

90

00:03:56,130  -->  00:03:57,630
that you're sending from.
91

91

00:03:57,630  -->  00:03:59,270
If you don't want to hardcode them
92

92

00:03:59,270  -->  00:04:00,930
because your application requires
93

93

00:04:00,930  -->  00:04:02,830
sending from different places,
94

94

00:04:02,830  -->  00:04:04,930
just add them as arguments here.
95

95

00:04:04,930  -->  00:04:08,170
From name, from email.
96

96

00:04:08,170  -->  00:04:10,270
And if you want, you could even make these
97

97

00:04:11,600  -->  00:04:14,040
constant variables by default.
98

98

00:04:14,040  -->  00:04:15,963
Make sure to use the right thing here.
99

99

00:04:19,560  -->  00:04:23,440
But because my applications normally have a single email
100

100

00:04:23,440  -->  00:04:26,460
that is sending the emails, I normally don't do this,
101

101

00:04:26,460  -->  00:04:29,490
but you could do it and then just replace them here as well.
102

102

00:04:29,490  -->  00:04:33,163
And that would be a way of making this a bit more flexible.
103

103

00:04:34,570  -->  00:04:35,530
That's it.
104

104

00:04:35,530  -->  00:04:40,390
You have your Mailgun class that can send emails.
105

105

00:04:40,390  -->  00:04:42,410
Now when you wanna send an email anywhere
106

106

00:04:42,410  -->  00:04:44,750
within your application, all you have to do is say
107

107

00:04:44,750  -->  00:04:49,170
Mailgun dot send email and give it the email subject
108

108

00:04:49,170  -->  00:04:50,600
and content.
109

109

00:04:50,600  -->  00:04:53,360
So we're gonna create a new file inside the project
110

110

00:04:53,360  -->  00:04:58,360
and I'm gonna call that using Mailgun lib dot py.
111

111

00:04:58,720  -->  00:05:01,620
And this is gonna do just from libs Mailgun,
112

112

00:05:01,620  -->  00:05:02,993
import Mailgun class.
113

113

00:05:03,840  -->  00:05:06,450
And then we're gonna do Mailgun send email
114

114

00:05:06,450  -->  00:05:11,160
and this is gonna go to test@gmail.com.
115

115

00:05:11,160  -->  00:05:15,360
The subject is going to be something like test email.
116

116

00:05:15,360  -->  00:05:18,710
And the content is going to be "This is a test email."
117

117

00:05:18,710  -->  00:05:20,210
It could be anything you want.
118

118

00:05:21,800  -->  00:05:22,910
That's it.
119

119

00:05:22,910  -->  00:05:24,280
You can now send emails.
120

120

00:05:24,280  -->  00:05:25,716
What's this say?
121

121

00:05:25,716  -->  00:05:28,820
Oh, of course, I've put the list in there.
122

122

00:05:28,820  -->  00:05:30,890
We don't wanna put the list there.
123

123

00:05:30,890  -->  00:05:33,810
This is the emails that this email is going to.
124

124

00:05:33,810  -->  00:05:36,870
In this case, it's just a single guy or woman.
125

125

00:05:36,870  -->  00:05:39,100
And if this is the title or the subject,
126

126

00:05:39,100  -->  00:05:40,730
and this is the content.
127

127

00:05:40,730  -->  00:05:42,690
If you want to call this a bit nicer,
128

128

00:05:42,690  -->  00:05:46,110
you can say to emails is that.
129

129

00:05:46,110  -->  00:05:48,283
You can then say subject is that.
130

130

00:05:48,283  -->  00:05:51,970
And you can then say content is that.
131

131

00:05:51,970  -->  00:05:54,260
So that's just calling it a bit nicer.
132

132

00:05:54,260  -->  00:05:56,760
It's up to you what you do, of course.
133

133

00:05:56,760  -->  00:05:59,050
Normally, I think I would do it this way
134

134

00:05:59,050  -->  00:06:00,350
just because it's pretty clear
135

135

00:06:00,350  -->  00:06:03,040
that the email is gonna go to this email.
136

136

00:06:03,040  -->  00:06:05,610
And then you may wanna put subject and content here
137

137

00:06:05,610  -->  00:06:07,530
just to make sure that nobody gets confused.
138

138

00:06:07,530  -->  00:06:09,000
Maybe they think this is the content,
139

139

00:06:09,000  -->  00:06:10,590
this is the subject.
140

140

00:06:10,590  -->  00:06:12,580
If you call them with named arguments,
141

141

00:06:12,580  -->  00:06:13,740
that's just a little bit clearer,
142

142

00:06:13,740  -->  00:06:15,440
maybe a bit nicer way of doing it.
143

143

00:06:17,200  -->  00:06:19,260
Whenever you want to send an email from your application,
144

144

00:06:19,260  -->  00:06:22,770
all you have to do is call your Mailgun library
145

145

00:06:22,770  -->  00:06:25,430
send email function, or method, sorry,
146

146

00:06:25,430  -->  00:06:26,460
and that'll send an email.
147

147

00:06:26,460  -->  00:06:28,130
So this is a bit of a nicer way
148

148

00:06:28,130  -->  00:06:29,880
of structuring your email sending
149

149

00:06:29,880  -->  00:06:32,370
and this is actually what I use very often,
150

150

00:06:32,370  -->  00:06:35,053
a library just like this one in many other projects.
151

151

00:06:35,960  -->  00:06:37,870
There is an issue with security
152

152

00:06:37,870  -->  00:06:40,540
if you put your API key inside your code.
153

153

00:06:40,540  -->  00:06:42,820
You don't want to put your API key inside your code
154

154

00:06:42,820  -->  00:06:45,370
if you're gonna share that code with other people,
155

155

00:06:45,370  -->  00:06:48,500
but that is a bit more of an advanced concept,
156

156

00:06:48,500  -->  00:06:49,650
how you're gonna secure your code
157

157

00:06:49,650  -->  00:06:51,680
if you're gonna share with people and so forth.
158

158

00:06:51,680  -->  00:06:53,990
Not something we're gonna cover in this course.
159

159

00:06:53,990  -->  00:06:56,300
But there are ways of doing that.
160

160

00:06:56,300  -->  00:06:57,520
It's just a little bit more advanced
161

161

00:06:57,520  -->  00:06:59,620
and you have to worry about sharing your code
162

162

00:06:59,620  -->  00:07:00,760
with other people first
163

163

00:07:00,760  -->  00:07:03,230
before you start worrying about security.
164

164

00:07:03,230  -->  00:07:04,250
That's it for this video.
165

165

00:07:04,250  -->  00:07:06,470
I hope you've enjoyed structuring this application
166

166

00:07:06,470  -->  00:07:07,870
in a bit of a nicer way,
167

167

00:07:07,870  -->  00:07:09,620
and I'll see you on the next video.
