<v ->Hi guys, and welcome back!</v>

00:00:02,550  -->  00:00:04,000
In this video, we're going to learn
3

3

00:00:04,000  -->  00:00:06,793 line:15% 
about iterating over dictionaries.
4

4

00:00:07,720  -->  00:00:10,900
Just as we iterated over lists or tuples
5

5

00:00:10,900  -->  00:00:14,130
with the for loop, we can iterate over dictionaries.
6

6

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:17,160
Imagine you've got a dictionary of your friend names
7

7

00:00:17,160  -->  00:00:20,770
to their ages, such that you can access friend_ages Rolf
8

8

00:00:20,770  -->  00:00:25,143
to get 25, or friend_ages Anne to get 37.
9

9

00:00:26,740  -->  00:00:28,823
You can do for name in friend_ages.
10

10

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:32,160
And again, this is a variable that we can name
11

11

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:35,383
whatever we want, but I'm calling it name at this point.
12

12

00:00:36,310  -->  00:00:37,680
And you can print name.
13

13

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:40,130
What happens when you do this is,
14

14

00:00:40,130  -->  00:00:43,810
you're iterating over the dictionary's keys.
15

15

00:00:43,810  -->  00:00:48,810
So what you would get here is Rolf, Anne, Charlie, and Bob.
16

16

00:00:49,330  -->  00:00:53,610
The values, 25, 37, 31, 22, will be ignored
17

17

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:56,380
and won't be present anywhere in here.
18

18

00:00:56,380  -->  00:00:59,903
So if we run this, you'll see that you get the keys back.
19

19

00:01:00,880  -->  00:01:04,810
If you wanted the values, you could iterate
20

20

00:01:04,810  -->  00:01:08,463
over friend_ages.values.
21

21

00:01:10,370  -->  00:01:12,520
And then if we run this, now you'll get
22

22

00:01:12,520  -->  00:01:17,260
25, 37, 31, 22, so just the ages.
23

23

00:01:17,260  -->  00:01:20,683
Name, age in friend_ages.items.
24

24

00:01:25,340  -->  00:01:26,640
And what you're gonna get now
25

25

00:01:26,640  -->  00:01:29,830
is this tuple of names and ages
26

26

00:01:29,830  -->  00:01:33,180
that you can de-structure into two variables directly here
27

27

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:37,400
in the for loop, and you'll get the name and the age.
28

28

00:01:37,400  -->  00:01:39,100
This here is the most common way
29

29

00:01:39,100  -->  00:01:41,450
of iterating over a dictionary.
30

30

00:01:41,450  -->  00:01:44,680
Usually, you'll either iterate over the keys only
31

31

00:01:44,680  -->  00:01:48,010
or you will iterate over the key and the value
32

32

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:52,720
by using .items on your dictionary variable.
33

33

00:01:52,720  -->  00:01:54,770
This is great because it allows you to get
34

34

00:01:54,770  -->  00:01:57,840
both the key, in case you want to show the key information
35

35

00:01:57,840  -->  00:02:00,570
when you're printing it out, and also the value.
36

36

00:02:00,570  -->  00:02:03,050
Remember that if this value is a list,
37

37

00:02:03,050  -->  00:02:05,360
or another dictionary, or a tuple,
38

38

00:02:05,360  -->  00:02:07,550
you will still get it in here, just the entire
39

39

00:02:07,550  -->  00:02:09,620
list or dictionary or tuple.
40

40

00:02:09,620  -->  00:02:12,790
So anything that is here will be age
41

41

00:02:12,790  -->  00:02:15,470
and the key will be name.
42

42

00:02:15,470  -->  00:02:17,590
So there's iteration over dictionaries,
43

43

00:02:17,590  -->  00:02:20,770
and that's why I introduced to you tuple de-structuring
44

44

00:02:20,770  -->  00:02:22,570
earlier on in the course.
45

45

00:02:22,570  -->  00:02:24,000
Thanks for joining me in this video,
46

46

00:02:24,000  -->  00:02:25,650
and I'll see you in the next one.
