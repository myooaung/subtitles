00:00:01.010  -->  00:00:02.100 line:15% 
In this video, we're going to look
3

3

00:00:02.100  -->  00:00:04.240 line:15% 
at some advanced set operations,
4

4

00:00:04.240  -->  00:00:09.240
which is why sets are useful compared to lists and tuples.
5

5

00:00:09.260  -->  00:00:11.400
So what I've got here is my art_friends
6

6

00:00:11.400  -->  00:00:12.640
and my science_friends.
7

7

00:00:12.640  -->  00:00:16.000
In arts, we've got Rolf, Anne and Jen.
8

8

00:00:16.000  -->  00:00:18.140
And in science, we've got Jen and Charlie.
9

9

00:00:18.140  -->  00:00:21.400
So a couple of things you can notice about these sets
10

10

00:00:21.400  -->  00:00:25.260
is that Jen does both art and science, right?
11

11

00:00:25.260  -->  00:00:26.780
She's in both sets.
12

12

00:00:26.780  -->  00:00:30.040
Rolf and Anne do art but not science.
13

13

00:00:30.040  -->  00:00:32.890
And Charlie does science but not art.
14

14

00:00:32.890  -->  00:00:34.880
And in total, we have four people,
15

15

00:00:34.880  -->  00:00:37.863
Rolf, Anne, Jen and Charlie.
16

16

00:00:38.790  -->  00:00:42.100
So we can use sets to extract that information
17

17

00:00:42.100  -->  00:00:43.770
from this data.
18

18

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:44.860
Here's how.
19

19

00:00:44.860  -->  00:00:48.193
Let's get those people that do art but not science.
20

20

00:00:48.193  -->  00:00:50.987
So we'll say art_but_not_science.
21

21

00:00:50.987  -->  00:00:52.016
And what you want to do
22

22

00:00:52.016  -->  00:00:56.965
is you wanna say art_friends.difference(science_friends).
23

23

00:00:56.965  -->  00:00:59.530
So the difference gives you which elements
24

24

00:00:59.530  -->  00:01:02.773
are in art that are not in science.
25

25

00:01:02.773  -->  00:01:06.830
So the ones that are in art but not in science
26

26

00:01:06.830  -->  00:01:09.820
means that it's gonna do Rolf, Anne and Jen,
27

27

00:01:09.820  -->  00:01:12.970
it's gonna take away all the elements that are here
28

28

00:01:12.970  -->  00:01:13.920
that are also here.
29

29

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:17.370
So in this case, Jen is both, so it's gonna get taken away
30

30

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:19.833
and what you'll get back is Rolf and Anne.
31

31

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:23.357
Of course you can do science_but_not_art
32

32

00:01:24.460  -->  00:01:25.880
and it's just the opposite
33

33

00:01:25.880  -->  00:01:27.880
science_friends.difference(art_friends).
34

34

00:01:29.640  -->  00:01:31.010
And what that's gonna do is it's gonna take
35

35

00:01:31.010  -->  00:01:32.870
your science friends, Jen and Charlie
36

36

00:01:32.870  -->  00:01:36.880
and it's gonna take away those that are in art, so Jen.
37

37

00:01:36.880  -->  00:01:39.640
And it's gonna leave you just with Charlie.
38

38

00:01:39.640  -->  00:01:40.740
Let's print those out.
39

39

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:43.560
And you'll see what I mean.
40

40

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:47.260
So in the first one you have Anne and Rolf
41

41

00:01:47.260  -->  00:01:48.520
but not Jen.
42

42

00:01:48.520  -->  00:01:51.510
And in the second one you have Charlie but not Jen.
43

43

00:01:51.510  -->  00:01:52.960
Sometimes what you want is something
44

44

00:01:52.960  -->  00:01:55.100
called the symmetric difference,
45

45

00:01:55.100  -->  00:01:58.920
which is members that aren't in both sets.
46

46

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:02.380
So what members are not in both sets?
47

47

00:02:02.380  -->  00:02:04.213
Rolf, Anne and Charlie.
48

48

00:02:05.110  -->  00:02:07.190
So let's get that.
49

49

00:02:07.190  -->  00:02:09.240
So not_in_both
50

50

00:02:09.240  -->  00:02:12.567
will be art_friends.symmetric_difference(science_friends).
51

51

00:02:17.780  -->  00:02:20.350
So you get Anne, Rolf and Charlie.
52

52

00:02:20.350  -->  00:02:23.720
So those are the members that are not in both.
53

53

00:02:23.720  -->  00:02:26.090
Since Jen is the only one that's in both,
54

54

00:02:26.090  -->  00:02:28.890
what you end up is everything together
55

55

00:02:28.890  -->  00:02:31.510
except the ones that are in both.
56

56

00:02:31.510  -->  00:02:33.630
Of course because it says symmetric difference,
57

57

00:02:33.630  -->  00:02:35.610
it doesn't matter which one goes first.
58

58

00:02:35.610  -->  00:02:36.621
You can put
59

59

00:02:36.621  -->  00:02:38.620
science_friends.symmetric_difference, art_friends
60

60

00:02:38.620  -->  00:02:40.155
or you can do what we've done here,
61

61

00:02:40.155  -->  00:02:43.280
art_friends.symmetric_difference(science_friends).
62

62

00:02:43.280  -->  00:02:46.090
So to recap, difference does elements
63

63

00:02:46.090  -->  00:02:48.400
that are in one but not the other,
64

64

00:02:48.400  -->  00:02:50.380
where the symmetric difference does elements
65

65

00:02:50.380  -->  00:02:52.200
that are not in both.
66

66

00:02:52.200  -->  00:02:55.320
If you wanted the members that are in both sets,
67

67

00:02:55.320  -->  00:02:57.850
so Jen, you can do that
68

68

00:02:57.850  -->  00:02:59.490
with something called the intersection.
69

69

00:02:59.490  -->  00:03:02.020
So you could do who is doing art and science,
70

70

00:03:02.020  -->  00:03:07.020
art_and_science and that would be art_friends.intersection
71

71

00:03:07.520  -->  00:03:09.217
with science_friends.
72

72

00:03:10.860  -->  00:03:14.800
And what that would give you is just Jen in her own set.
73

73

00:03:14.800  -->  00:03:16.720
Notice that this is still a set
74

74

00:03:16.720  -->  00:03:19.100
because it has the curly braces around it.
75

75

00:03:19.100  -->  00:03:21.453
So that is a set of one element.
76

76

00:03:22.930  -->  00:03:25.120
Finally, if you wanted all the people
77

77

00:03:25.120  -->  00:03:28.820
that are studying any subject, but without duplicates,
78

78

00:03:28.820  -->  00:03:33.820
you could do all_friends is art_friends.union
79

79

00:03:34.430  -->  00:03:36.080
with science_friends.
80

80

00:03:36.080  -->  00:03:38.140
And that is gonna unite both sets
81

81

00:03:38.140  -->  00:03:40.793
and give you one big set with everybody in it.
82

82

00:03:42.300  -->  00:03:44.730
Of course, note that Jen is there twice,
83

83

00:03:44.730  -->  00:03:48.020
so it's only gonna appear once in the final set
84

84

00:03:48.020  -->  00:03:49.870
because sets cannot contain duplicates
85

85

00:03:49.870  -->  00:03:51.740
and you can see that this is still a set
86

86

00:03:51.740  -->  00:03:53.390
so there are no duplicates in it.
87

87

00:03:54.500  -->  00:03:58.550
These operations are why sets are useful.
88

88

00:03:58.550  -->  00:04:02.540
For example, you could have a lottery game
89

89

00:04:02.540  -->  00:04:05.160
where your user has a few numbers
90

90

00:04:05.160  -->  00:04:08.150
and the system has decided on six numbers
91

91

00:04:08.150  -->  00:04:10.570
that are the lottery winners.
92

92

00:04:10.570  -->  00:04:13.620
By having them both on sets, you could calculate
93

93

00:04:13.620  -->  00:04:15.000
the intersection of them two,
94

94

00:04:15.000  -->  00:04:16.710
which elements the user has matched
95

95

00:04:16.710  -->  00:04:18.850
with the winning elements
96

96

00:04:18.850  -->  00:04:21.520
and then calculate the user's winnings like that.
97

97

00:04:21.520  -->  00:04:23.950
And that is, in fact, going to be one of the challenges
98

98

00:04:23.950  -->  00:04:25.540
for this section.
99

99

00:04:25.540  -->  00:04:28.050
If you're not completely sure when to use
100

100

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:31.820
each of these data structures, lists, tuples and sets,
101

101

00:04:31.820  -->  00:04:33.130
don't worry too much,
102

102

00:04:33.130  -->  00:04:35.310
over time you will get better at it.
103

103

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:39.120
And most of the time, you'll be using tuples and lists.
104

104

00:04:39.120  -->  00:04:42.793
Sets are reserved for when you want to use these operations.
105

105

00:04:43.700  -->  00:04:45.000
Thanks for joining me in this video,
106

106

00:04:45.000  -->  00:04:46.060
I hope you've learned something,
107

107

00:04:46.060  -->  00:04:47.613 line:15% 
and I'll see you in the next one.
