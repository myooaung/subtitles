<v Instructor>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.340  -->  00:00:02.590
In this video we are talking about
3

3

00:00:02.590  -->  00:00:06.040
the @syntax for decorators.
4

4

00:00:06.040  -->  00:00:07.880
We've used a couple of decorators in the past,
5

5

00:00:07.880  -->  00:00:09.970
like the @property decorator
6

6

00:00:09.970  -->  00:00:12.850
and also the @class method and @static method.
7

7

00:00:12.850  -->  00:00:14.900
Now we're going to learn how to use that for
8

8

00:00:14.900  -->  00:00:17.840
our own functions that we create, our own decorators.
9

9

00:00:19.692  -->  00:00:24.470
All we have to do is actually really simple, is do this.
10

10

00:00:29.110  -->  00:00:34.040
Now, we no longer need this line, because this function,
11

11

00:00:34.040  -->  00:00:38.090
when it's defined, is already defined using the decorator.
12

12

00:00:38.090  -->  00:00:41.950
So now, my function doesn't really
13

13

00:00:41.950  -->  00:00:44.510
exist anymore as a function.
14

14

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:48.610
We can just run my function here.
15

15

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:54.300
And you'll get the password for the admin panel,
16

16

00:00:54.300  -->  00:00:56.050
and if you change the access level,
17

17

00:00:58.620  -->  00:00:59.453
you get nothing.
18

18

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:04.940
However, something not so great happens,
19

19

00:01:04.940  -->  00:01:08.364
which is, if you print myfunction.name,
20

20

00:01:08.364  -->  00:01:11.450
this should give you the name of the function.
21

21

00:01:11.450  -->  00:01:13.920
What do you think is going to get printed out?
22

22

00:01:16.870  -->  00:01:18.420
Possibly not what you'd expect.
23

23

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:23.500
Now you get secure_func printed out because that's
24

24

00:01:23.500  -->  00:01:26.190
the function that you defined that is actually
25

25

00:01:26.190  -->  00:01:28.340
replacing my_function when you
26

26

00:01:28.340  -->  00:01:29.840
run it through this decorator.
27

27

00:01:30.950  -->  00:01:35.950
Also, if you have a doc string here, for example,
28

28

00:01:36.740  -->  00:01:41.700
allows us to retrieve the password for the admin panel,
29

29

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:48.980
you can then print this out by printing dunder doc.
30

30

00:01:53.700  -->  00:01:56.350
Now you can see that you get none.
31

31

00:01:56.350  -->  00:01:59.590
You get none because, again, my_function has been
32

32

00:01:59.590  -->  00:02:02.850
replaced by this secure_func.
33

33

00:02:02.850  -->  00:02:07.270
If you were to add something here, hey
34

34

00:02:09.320  -->  00:02:12.400
then you'd get hey when you print that out, as you can see.
35

35

00:02:13.290  -->  00:02:15.080
So, not so great.
36

36

00:02:16.270  -->  00:02:21.270
Particularly when you have multiple functions,
37

37

00:02:21.410  -->  00:02:24.530
each one being affected by this decorator.
38

38

00:02:24.530  -->  00:02:26.830
Like, if you have another function here
39

39

00:02:26.830  -->  00:02:28.760
and it doesn't do anything, but you know,
40

40

00:02:28.760  -->  00:02:31.940
you apply the decorator to it,
41

41

00:02:33.830  -->  00:02:36.590
then you can print out my_function name
42

42

00:02:36.590  -->  00:02:41.410
and you can print out another name
43

43

00:02:44.190  -->  00:02:46.960
and they're both called the same thing,
44

44

00:02:46.960  -->  00:02:50.460
which, I mean, it's true, they are both this function,
45

45

00:02:50.460  -->  00:02:53.850
but what they are doing is different.
46

46

00:02:53.850  -->  00:02:57.640
One of them is returning the result of calling my_function,
47

47

00:02:58.660  -->  00:03:01.210
the other one is returning the result of calling another.
48

48

00:03:01.210  -->  00:03:05.370
So them two having the same name doesn't make any sense.
49

49

00:03:05.370  -->  00:03:06.900
They are different functions,
50

50

00:03:06.900  -->  00:03:08.650
why should they have the same name?
51

51

00:03:09.650  -->  00:03:12.240
So, this is a slight problem with decorators,
52

52

00:03:12.240  -->  00:03:15.070
but there is a way to solve it.
53

53

00:03:15.070  -->  00:03:19.058
Let's look at how we can keep the original function name
54

54

00:03:19.058  -->  00:03:21.522
and doc string when using a decorator in the next video,
55

55

00:03:21.522  -->  00:03:22.760
I'll see you there.
