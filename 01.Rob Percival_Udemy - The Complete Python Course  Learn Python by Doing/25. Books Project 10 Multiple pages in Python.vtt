<v Jose>Hi and Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.286  -->  00:00:05.335
In this video, we're going to get data out of multiple pages
3

3

00:00:05.335  -->  00:00:06.952
and that's going to be really simple,
4

4

00:00:06.952  -->  00:00:10.712
because each page has, essentially, the same content,
5

5

00:00:10.712  -->  00:00:12.118
and all we have to do is,
6

6

00:00:12.118  -->  00:00:15.311
instead of getting a list of book parsers,
7

7

00:00:15.311  -->  00:00:16.623
which is from one page,
8

8

00:00:16.623  -->  00:00:19.119
we're going to get the book parsers from each page
9

9

00:00:19.119  -->  00:00:21.989
and then we're gonna join them all into a single list.
10

10

00:00:21.989  -->  00:00:23.882
And that's going to give us a list of all the books
11

11

00:00:23.882  -->  00:00:24.965
in each page.
12

12

00:00:26.560  -->  00:00:28.164
So, what we're going to do is,
13

13

00:00:28.164  -->  00:00:31.948
instead of saying books = page.books
14

14

00:00:31.948  -->  00:00:35.142
what we're going to do is, we're going to start by
15

15

00:00:35.142  -->  00:00:37.559
going over each of the pages.
16

16

00:00:38.578  -->  00:00:42.108
So instead of going over this page here,
17

17

00:00:42.108  -->  00:00:47.108
we are going to do:
for page_num in range(50)
18

18

00:00:48.760  -->  00:00:50.991
There are 50 pages.
19

19

00:00:50.991  -->  00:00:54.324
We're going to say the URL is this here,
20

20

00:00:58.746  -->  00:00:59.579
but also
21

21

00:01:01.019  -->  00:01:06.019
catalogue/page-(page_num+1).html
22

22

00:01:11.108  -->  00:01:14.104
and, of course, this has to be an f string in there.
23

23

00:01:14.104  -->  00:01:16.675
What this is going to do now is construct the URL
24

24

00:01:16.675  -->  00:01:18.931
of the page we want,
25

25

00:01:18.931  -->  00:01:20.264
starting at one.
26

26

00:01:21.590  -->  00:01:25.463
Remember, the range function starts at zero, goes 0 to 49
27

27

00:01:25.463  -->  00:01:27.629
Our pages go from 1 to 50,
28

28

00:01:27.629  -->  00:01:31.899
so we have to add one to the page_num that we've got.
29

29

00:01:31.899  -->  00:01:34.964
And then all we do is get the URL.
30

30

00:01:34.964  -->  00:01:39.964
page_content = requests.get(url).content
31

31

00:01:40.038  -->  00:01:44.886
And of course, construct the page with the page_content.
32

32

00:01:44.886  -->  00:01:49.886
And then we are going to make sure to put them into our list
33

33

00:01:50.313  -->  00:01:53.146
So that's going to be books.extend
34

34

00:01:55.971  -->  00:01:58.208
(page.books)
35

35

00:01:58.208  -->  00:01:59.703
Like that.
36

36

00:01:59.703  -->  00:02:02.786
Now, because we've got page one here,
37

37

00:02:04.576  -->  00:02:07.659
we can start, of course, at page two.
38

38

00:02:08.779  -->  00:02:10.854
So our range can go from 1 to 50,
39

39

00:02:10.854  -->  00:02:13.864
which is going to be 48 numbers.
40

40

00:02:13.864  -->  00:02:16.755
So, page two is gonna be the first page we're gonna
41

41

00:02:16.755  -->  00:02:18.918
get in this section.
42

42

00:02:18.918  -->  00:02:20.159
And we're going to start with page one,
43

43

00:02:20.159  -->  00:02:21.169
which is actually this one.
44

44

00:02:21.169  -->  00:02:25.429
Remember how the page one and the page that has nothing,
45

45

00:02:25.429  -->  00:02:28.752
in terms of the catalogue and page number, is also page one.
46

46

00:02:28.752  -->  00:02:30.781
So, this is page one here.
47

47

00:02:30.781  -->  00:02:33.451
And then what we do is we get the book's pages,
48

48

00:02:33.451  -->  00:02:36.981
then we go over the rest of the pages and extend that list
49

49

00:02:36.981  -->  00:02:40.898
by the page.books that we have just downloaded.
50

50

00:02:42.656  -->  00:02:46.931
OK? So, by the time this file finishes running,
51

51

00:02:46.931  -->  00:02:50.843
books will contain the information of all the pages.
52

52

00:02:50.843  -->  00:02:52.817
Now, notice that is something important, though,
53

53

00:02:52.817  -->  00:02:55.734
which is that the 50 is hard coded.
54

54

00:02:57.229  -->  00:02:58.414
And sometimes you won't want that.
55

55

00:02:58.414  -->  00:02:59.784
Sometimes, you'll want to make sure
56

56

00:02:59.784  -->  00:03:03.232
that you get the page count from the page itself,
57

57

00:03:03.232  -->  00:03:04.788
so that you don't go wrong.
58

58

00:03:04.788  -->  00:03:07.203
For example, if they add more books to the collection,
59

59

00:03:07.203  -->  00:03:10.616
the page number, the base count, might increase.
60

60

00:03:10.616  -->  00:03:12.497
Let's try this out though, first of all,
61

61

00:03:12.497  -->  00:03:16.674
by running our menu and see whether anything changes.
62

62

00:03:16.674  -->  00:03:19.623
Let's press play in the menu
63

63

00:03:19.623  -->  00:03:21.573
Notice how this takes a while now.
64

64

00:03:21.573  -->  00:03:24.128
It takes a while because it's having to go through
65

65

00:03:24.128  -->  00:03:27.108
all of the pages and downloading each of them.
66

66

00:03:27.108  -->  00:03:29.503
So, it takes a while.
67

67

00:03:29.503  -->  00:03:31.430
Then we can do B.
68

68

00:03:31.430  -->  00:03:33.323
And now we get all the books.
69

69

00:03:33.323  -->  00:03:36.701
Notice how, now, all the books we get are five-star books
70

70

00:03:36.701  -->  00:03:39.789
whereas before we got a few five-stars, a few four-stars.
71

71

00:03:39.789  -->  00:03:41.682
That's because now we have more books
72

72

00:03:41.682  -->  00:03:46.153
and therefore, there are a larger number of five-star books.
73

73

00:03:46.153  -->  00:03:48.838
Similarly, if we get just the cheapest books,
74

74

00:03:48.838  -->  00:03:51.914
there'll be books that are lower price,
75

75

00:03:51.914  -->  00:03:54.225
in this case we've got a 10 pound one
76

76

00:03:54.225  -->  00:03:56.941
here, that is five-stars.
77

77

00:03:56.941  -->  00:03:59.651
And we've got a few other 10 pounders here.
78

78

00:03:59.651  -->  00:04:01.648
So as you can see, it doesn't even go over 10
79

79

00:04:01.648  -->  00:04:03.935
because there are so many books now,
80

80

00:04:03.935  -->  00:04:06.675
that it doesn't go over that,
81

81

00:04:06.675  -->  00:04:08.753
when you only get the 10 cheapest ones.
82

82

00:04:08.753  -->  00:04:11.069
And if you went next and next,
83

83

00:04:11.069  -->  00:04:13.229
you would be here for a long time.
84

84

00:04:13.229  -->  00:04:15.923
The "A Light in the Attic" book's still the first book.
85

85

00:04:15.923  -->  00:04:19.789
But, now there are many more books in the collection.
86

86

00:04:19.789  -->  00:04:21.612
Of course, there are more things you can tell your users,
87

87

00:04:21.612  -->  00:04:23.911
like how many books there are in the collection,
88

88

00:04:23.911  -->  00:04:26.708
you can tell them which ones are in stock or not,
89

89

00:04:26.708  -->  00:04:29.065
although you'd have to look at another property
90

90

00:04:29.065  -->  00:04:31.004
in the book parser in order to do that.
91

91

00:04:31.004  -->  00:04:34.258
So there's quite a lot of stuff you can do there.
92

92

00:04:34.258  -->  00:04:38.086
One other area of improvement would be,
93

93

00:04:38.086  -->  00:04:40.799
other than the 50 being hard coded,
94

94

00:04:40.799  -->  00:04:41.716
would be to
95

95

00:04:42.724  -->  00:04:44.224
get all these URLs
96

96

00:04:45.368  -->  00:04:46.564
at the same time,
97

97

00:04:46.564  -->  00:04:48.782
or more or less at the same time,
98

98

00:04:48.782  -->  00:04:52.776
and doing, essentially, parallel downloading.
99

99

00:04:52.776  -->  00:04:54.296
Downloading the things simultaneously.
100

100

00:04:54.296  -->  00:04:56.270
This is something that Python can do
101

101

00:04:56.270  -->  00:04:58.569
and we may look at that later on in the course.
102

102

00:04:58.569  -->  00:05:02.307
But, for now, we'll settle for downloading one at a time
103

103

00:05:02.307  -->  00:05:03.608
and when it's finished downloading,
104

104

00:05:03.608  -->  00:05:04.966
moving on to the next one.
105

105

00:05:04.966  -->  00:05:08.844
Later on, we can look into doing them at the same time.
106

106

00:05:08.844  -->  00:05:12.838
Okay, so that's it for requesting a larger number of pages,
107

107

00:05:12.838  -->  00:05:14.149
which you can see is very simple.
108

108

00:05:14.149  -->  00:05:17.354
Let's go and, not hard code the page count.
109

109

00:05:17.354  -->  00:05:19.676
So, we're going to get the 50 from the page,
110

110

00:05:19.676  -->  00:05:23.205
as opposed to putting the number here.
111

111

00:05:23.205  -->  00:05:24.924
Let's go and do that in the next video.
112

112

00:05:24.924  -->  00:05:26.468
I'll see you there.
