00:00:00,194  -->  00:00:01,860
<v Instructor>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:04,690
Once you've opened up PyCharm for the first time,
3

3

00:00:04,690  -->  00:00:07,580
you'll get something that looks more or less like this.
4

4

00:00:07,580  -->  00:00:10,430
If you get asked to import any settings
5

5

00:00:10,430  -->  00:00:13,740
from a previous PyCharm version, just say "no,"
6

6

00:00:13,740  -->  00:00:16,640
because you don't have any previous PyCharm versions.
7

7

00:00:16,640  -->  00:00:19,500
Unless, of course, you do have a previous PyCharm version
8

8

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:21,490
that you want to import settings from.
9

9

00:00:21,490  -->  00:00:22,720
But if you don't know what it means,
10

10

00:00:22,720  -->  00:00:24,940
just say "no" or "cancel" or "exit."
11

11

00:00:26,090  -->  00:00:28,040
Then make sure you open up PyCharm,
12

12

00:00:28,040  -->  00:00:30,640
and you'll have a window that looks more or less like this,
13

13

00:00:30,640  -->  00:00:33,840
or possibly like one we'll see in just a moment.
14

14

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:38,220
Nonetheless, what we wanna do is go into Create New Project.
15

15

00:00:38,220  -->  00:00:40,700
Let's create a new project, and then you've got
16

16

00:00:40,700  -->  00:00:42,510
two things that you have to pick:
17

17

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:45,410
the location of your project, where in your computer
18

18

00:00:45,410  -->  00:00:49,010
this project is going to live, and also the Interpreter.
19

19

00:00:49,010  -->  00:00:50,400
This is the Python version that
20

20

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:53,610
you want to use for this project.
21

21

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:56,390
Notice that, for example, macOS comes with
22

22

00:00:56,390  -->  00:00:59,240
Python 2.7 already installed.
23

23

00:00:59,240  -->  00:01:01,880
However, when you create a new Python project,
24

24

00:01:01,880  -->  00:01:04,690
you can choose whether you want to use Python 2.7
25

25

00:01:04,690  -->  00:01:07,130
or Python 3.6 that we've just installed.
26

26

00:01:07,970  -->  00:01:11,250
Python works fine if you have multiple versions
27

27

00:01:11,250  -->  00:01:14,150
all installed at the same time in your computer,
28

28

00:01:14,150  -->  00:01:16,580
and it is on a per-project basis
29

29

00:01:16,580  -->  00:01:20,010
that you'll choose which Python version to use.
30

30

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:23,200
So, you can instal Python 3.7 when it comes out,
31

31

00:01:23,200  -->  00:01:26,060
alongside 3.6, and that's totally fine.
32

32

00:01:27,130  -->  00:01:30,000
Let's pick out a location for our project.
33

33

00:01:30,880  -->  00:01:32,450
So, what I'm going to do here is
34

34

00:01:32,450  -->  00:01:35,170
I am going to go over to my desktop.
35

35

00:01:37,130  -->  00:01:38,370
Now, okay.
36

36

00:01:38,370  -->  00:01:39,810
So, I'll open up the desktop here,
37

37

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:41,290
and I'm going to create a new folder,
38

38

00:01:41,290  -->  00:01:44,150
which is going to be called "milestone_1."
39

39

00:01:48,070  -->  00:01:51,240
Now, my project is going to be in this folder here.
40

40

00:01:52,410  -->  00:01:54,720
So any new files I create are going to appear
41

41

00:01:54,720  -->  00:01:58,660
inside that folder, and basically all the contents
42

42

00:01:58,660  -->  00:02:00,030
of the core of this project
43

43

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:01,570
are going to be inside that folder.
44

44

00:02:01,570  -->  00:02:03,820
Make sure to pick out a folder that you like.
45

45

00:02:04,870  -->  00:02:07,590
For the Interpreter, I have a lot of options here,
46

46

00:02:07,590  -->  00:02:09,970
and you won't have so many options,
47

47

00:02:09,970  -->  00:02:14,910
but what you wanna go and find is 3.6, presumably .4,
48

48

00:02:14,910  -->  00:02:16,740
which is the one we've just downloaded,
49

49

00:02:16,740  -->  00:02:19,890
or 3.7 or, you know, 3.5, or whatever version
50

50

00:02:19,890  -->  00:02:22,740
you've got installed at the time of this video.
51

51

00:02:24,050  -->  00:02:26,621
Now, the latest version currently is 3.6.4,
52

52

00:02:26,621  -->  00:02:28,960
but I've got 3.6.0 installed, and, you know,
53

53

00:02:28,960  -->  00:02:31,820
that's fine for the purposes of this course.
54

54

00:02:31,820  -->  00:02:34,400
So, make sure you find 3.6.
55

55

00:02:34,400  -->  00:02:37,850
Make sure you don't select an invalid one, if you have any.
56

56

00:02:37,850  -->  00:02:40,450
Select only the valid ones.
57

57

00:02:40,450  -->  00:02:45,000
And we'll look at why I have so many versions later on.
58

58

00:02:45,000  -->  00:02:47,350
Then you can go and press Create.
59

59

00:02:47,350  -->  00:02:48,920
And really, that's it.
60

60

00:02:49,760  -->  00:02:50,800
So, a couple of things.
61

61

00:02:50,800  -->  00:02:53,040
PyCharm shows you a tip of the day.
62

62

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:54,510
These things are pretty useful,
63

63

00:02:54,510  -->  00:02:59,000
and it tells you some information on how to use PyCharm.
64

64

00:02:59,000  -->  00:03:02,670
I recommend that you don't untick the box
65

65

00:03:02,670  -->  00:03:04,330
so that every time you open PyCharm,
66

66

00:03:04,330  -->  00:03:06,320
you get this, and maybe you can learn a thing or two.
67

67

00:03:06,320  -->  00:03:08,540
So, I normally do read them.
68

68

00:03:08,540  -->  00:03:09,740
I won't read them today.
69

69

00:03:11,000  -->  00:03:16,000
Then, what we've got is our project here on the left.
70

70

00:03:16,480  -->  00:03:18,500
If this was the first screen you saw
71

71

00:03:18,500  -->  00:03:21,040
when you opened up PyCharm, you can always go over
72

72

00:03:21,040  -->  00:03:24,880
to create a new project by pressing on File, New Project,
73

73

00:03:24,880  -->  00:03:27,980
and that will let you create a brand new project.
74

74

00:03:27,980  -->  00:03:30,650
Okay, then you've got a bunch more menu options,
75

75

00:03:30,650  -->  00:03:32,220
and we're gonna be learning a lot about those
76

76

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:33,964
as we go through the course, so don't worry
77

77

00:03:33,964  -->  00:03:36,530
if you don't know what they do just yet.
78

78

00:03:36,530  -->  00:03:38,580
You've got the usual Edits, Undo,
79

79

00:03:38,580  -->  00:03:40,830
Redo, Cut, and Copy, and so forth,
80

80

00:03:40,830  -->  00:03:44,100
and they can be pretty handy in a lot of scenarios.
81

81

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:47,230
Then what we've got is our tree.
82

82

00:03:47,230  -->  00:03:50,610
Here we've got our project, project files, problems,
83

83

00:03:50,610  -->  00:03:53,140
and scratches, which is a really bad name.
84

84

00:03:53,140  -->  00:03:57,030
We'll only be working with Project in this course.
85

85

00:03:57,030  -->  00:03:59,400
This gives you the project files
86

86

00:03:59,400  -->  00:04:03,490
and also any external libraries that we're using.
87

87

00:04:03,490  -->  00:04:04,970
At the moment, this project is only using
88

88

00:04:04,970  -->  00:04:08,570
one external library, which is Python 3.6.
89

89

00:04:08,570  -->  00:04:10,720
That's the Interpreter we chose earlier on.
90

90

00:04:11,880  -->  00:04:14,730
And our project is a folder called "milestone_1,"
91

91

00:04:14,730  -->  00:04:16,690
that doesn't have anything inside it,
92

92

00:04:16,690  -->  00:04:18,530
but we can add things to it.
93

93

00:04:18,530  -->  00:04:20,960
For example, you can right click on it
94

94

00:04:20,960  -->  00:04:23,220
and add a new Python file.
95

95

00:04:24,500  -->  00:04:26,560
Then you'll get this dialogue, and you can choose
96

96

00:04:26,560  -->  00:04:28,310
what type of file you're gonna add,
97

97

00:04:28,310  -->  00:04:30,170
Python file or Python unit test.
98

98

00:04:30,170  -->  00:04:31,260
Don't click on that just yet.
99

99

00:04:31,260  -->  00:04:32,670
We'll look at that later on.
100

100

00:04:32,670  -->  00:04:35,740
Just click on "Python file," and I'm gonna call it "app."
101

101

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:39,790
"App" how is created inside our project."
102

102

00:04:39,790  -->  00:04:42,820
Look, we've got our file "app.py,"
103

103

00:04:42,820  -->  00:04:45,230
and the ".py" has been appended at the end,
104

104

00:04:45,230  -->  00:04:47,650
and that just means that this is a Python file.
105

105

00:04:49,010  -->  00:04:53,270
The name, "app.py," can be anything you'd like,
106

106

00:04:53,270  -->  00:04:56,737
but "app.py" is a pretty popular name
107

107

00:04:56,737  -->  00:05:00,610
for your sort of main file in a Python programme.
108

108

00:05:01,640  -->  00:05:03,160
Whenever you run your programme,
109

109

00:05:03,160  -->  00:05:06,350
likely this is the file that you're gonna be running.
110

110

00:05:06,350  -->  00:05:08,110
So, "app.py" is a pretty popular name,
111

111

00:05:08,110  -->  00:05:09,940
and I advise that you go for that
112

112

00:05:09,940  -->  00:05:12,440
for the main, most important file in your programme.
113

113

00:05:13,520  -->  00:05:16,130
Now, over the next few videos, we're going to be looking at
114

114

00:05:16,130  -->  00:05:18,250
developing our milestone project.
115

115

00:05:18,250  -->  00:05:20,810
But first, of course, I'm going to give you the brief
116

116

00:05:20,810  -->  00:05:23,870
so that you can tackle this milestone project on your own.
117

117

00:05:23,870  -->  00:05:25,620
It's gonna be a challenge, and you may have to do
118

118

00:05:25,620  -->  00:05:29,440
some research in order to do so, but please do.
119

119

00:05:29,440  -->  00:05:31,590
Don't just move over to the next lecture.
120

120

00:05:31,590  -->  00:05:32,510
Give it a go.
121

121

00:05:32,510  -->  00:05:36,270
Try developing this application on your own first,
122

122

00:05:36,270  -->  00:05:38,800
and doing that is going to ensure that you learn
123

123

00:05:38,800  -->  00:05:41,500
much faster than just watching the video.
124

124

00:05:42,530  -->  00:05:44,320
And also, I'm going to plug my laptop in,
125

125

00:05:44,320  -->  00:05:46,032
because I'm running low on battery.
126

126

00:05:46,032  -->  00:05:48,782
So with that said, I'll see you in the very next video.
