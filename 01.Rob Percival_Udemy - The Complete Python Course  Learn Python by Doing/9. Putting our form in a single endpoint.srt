<v Narrator>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,150  -->  00:00:02,910
In this video, we're going to be simplifying
3

3

00:00:02,910  -->  00:00:04,530
our Flask code a little bit
4

4

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:07,880
by allowing our end point here
5

5

00:00:07,880  -->  00:00:12,420
to both give the U to the form and receive the data.
6

6

00:00:12,420  -->  00:00:14,230
So it's just going to be a little bit nicer,
7

7

00:00:14,230  -->  00:00:17,180
fewer routes for users to access
8

8

00:00:17,180  -->  00:00:21,000
and just generally, a bit easier to navigate.
9

9

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:24,110
What we're going to do is we're going to do two things.
10

10

00:00:24,110  -->  00:00:25,860
We're going to allow this end point
11

11

00:00:27,050  -->  00:00:30,060
to see get requests as well.
12

12

00:00:30,060  -->  00:00:33,400
Now, the browser does get requests.
13

13

00:00:34,820  -->  00:00:37,170
The form does post requests.
14

14

00:00:37,170  -->  00:00:40,930
So we know that if we get a request that is get,
15

15

00:00:40,930  -->  00:00:44,100
that's the browser wanting to load the page.
16

16

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:47,150
And probably the user wanting to see the form.
17

17

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:49,700
If users see the post request,
18

18

00:00:49,700  -->  00:00:52,130
we know that the form sending us data.
19

19

00:00:52,130  -->  00:00:54,900
And therefore we should deal with that form data.
20

20

00:00:56,070  -->  00:01:00,220
So, if the request method is post,
21

21

00:01:01,330  -->  00:01:03,210
we're going to do all of this stuff.
22

22

00:01:04,060  -->  00:01:06,040
Get the title from the form,
23

23

00:01:06,040  -->  00:01:07,760
get the content from the form,
24

24

00:01:07,760  -->  00:01:09,280
you know create a new post
25

25

00:01:09,280  -->  00:01:12,710
and then redirect the user to the post.
26

26

00:01:12,710  -->  00:01:13,730
As soon as we return,
27

27

00:01:13,730  -->  00:01:15,870
you know this from general Python knowledge,
28

28

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:18,570
as soon as we would return I think, the function ends.
29

29

00:01:19,450  -->  00:01:22,300
So if we have another return down here,
30

30

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:31,100
this return will only execute
31

31

00:01:31,100  -->  00:01:33,100
if we did not execute this one.
32

32

00:01:34,480  -->  00:01:37,140
And we will always execute this one
33

33

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:39,650
if the request method is post.
34

34

00:01:39,650  -->  00:01:42,000
So if the request method is not post,
35

35

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:44,450
we will jump right to this return.
36

36

00:01:46,446  -->  00:01:49,330
And that means that if the browser makes a get request,
37

37

00:01:49,330  -->  00:01:51,640
we are going to render the template.
38

38

00:01:51,640  -->  00:01:54,120
If we receive a post request from the form,
39

39

00:01:54,120  -->  00:01:56,640
we're going to deal with that data.
40

40

00:01:56,640  -->  00:02:00,030
Now we no longer need /post/form
41

41

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:02,040
because this end point can be both.
42

42

00:02:02,040  -->  00:02:03,700
And it's just a little bit simpler
43

43

00:02:03,700  -->  00:02:05,160
to have the same end point dealing
44

44

00:02:05,160  -->  00:02:08,540
with both serving the way of creating data
45

45

00:02:08,540  -->  00:02:10,620
as well as dealing with that data input.
46

46

00:02:11,840  -->  00:02:14,540
Our create.jinja2 also has to change
47

47

00:02:14,540  -->  00:02:17,380
so that this action here can now be removed.
48

48

00:02:18,420  -->  00:02:20,430
If you remove the action,
49

49

00:02:20,430  -->  00:02:24,650
that means use the current page that you're at.
50

50

00:02:24,650  -->  00:02:25,870
And because the current page
51

51

00:02:25,870  -->  00:02:27,820
is the page that serves the template,
52

52

00:02:28,670  -->  00:02:31,280
is also the page that takes in the data,
53

53

00:02:31,280  -->  00:02:33,500
we don't need an action there.
54

54

00:02:33,500  -->  00:02:35,350
This also simplifies things
55

55

00:02:35,350  -->  00:02:37,130
because if you move this form around
56

56

00:02:37,130  -->  00:02:40,160
or you change the URLs or anything like that,
57

57

00:02:40,160  -->  00:02:41,700
things can break the form.
58

58

00:02:41,700  -->  00:02:42,930
But now because it's the same page,
59

59

00:02:42,930  -->  00:02:44,810
both giving the form to the user
60

60

00:02:44,810  -->  00:02:46,790
and accepting the form's input,
61

61

00:02:46,790  -->  00:02:49,210
it's just a bit more stable.
62

62

00:02:50,280  -->  00:02:52,680
And so this way here simplifies your code a little bit,
63

63

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:54,330
makes it a bit easier to work with.
64

64

00:02:54,330  -->  00:02:56,810
And also reduces the amount of code you've got.
65

65

00:02:56,810  -->  00:02:58,520
All good things.
66

66

00:02:58,520  -->  00:02:59,750
So that's it for this video.
67

67

00:02:59,750  -->  00:03:00,820
I wanted to show you how to do this.
68

68

00:03:00,820  -->  00:03:02,470
And I'll see you on the next one.
