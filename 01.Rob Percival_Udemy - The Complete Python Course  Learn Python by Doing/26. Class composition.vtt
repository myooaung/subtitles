<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>

2

00:00:02.120  -->  00:00:05.710
In this video we're going to learn about class composition.
3

3

00:00:05.710  -->  00:00:08.250
Composition is a counterpart to inheritance
4

4

00:00:08.250  -->  00:00:11.530
so you build out classes that use other classes.
5

5

00:00:11.530  -->  00:00:14.660
You're going to be using inheritance very little in Python,
6

6

00:00:14.660  -->  00:00:15.493
if I'm honest,
7

7

00:00:15.493  -->  00:00:18.240
you're going to be using composition much more.
8

8

00:00:18.240  -->  00:00:21.000
Composition allows your classes to be simpler
9

9

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:23.550
and reduces the complexity of your code overall,
10

10

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:27.100
so it is recommended that you use that most of the time.
11

11

00:00:27.100  -->  00:00:29.820
In addition, composition means something different
12

12

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:32.580
than inheritance when you're thinking about your classes.
13

13

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:35.800
For example, we've got here a bookshelf class
14

14

00:00:35.800  -->  00:00:38.140
that takes in a quantity when you create it
15

15

00:00:38.140  -->  00:00:39.800
and then when you print it out it tells you
16

16

00:00:39.800  -->  00:00:41.990
that it's a bookshelf with x books.
17

17

00:00:41.990  -->  00:00:44.540
For example, here we're creating a bookshelf with 300 books,
18

18

00:00:44.540  -->  00:00:45.510
when you print it out,
19

19

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:48.450
you can see that it says bookshelf with 300 books.
20

20

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:51.570
If you wanted to create a book class now,
21

21

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:53.630
some new programme has maybe attempted
22

22

00:00:53.630  -->  00:00:55.440
to make it inherit from bookshelf.
23

23

00:00:55.440  -->  00:00:57.440
After all, they are somehow related.
24

24

00:00:57.440  -->  00:00:58.273
Correct?
25

25

00:00:58.273  -->  00:00:59.533
Books live in bookshelves so.
26

26

00:01:00.520  -->  00:01:02.880
And then you would do something like this in it
27

27

00:01:02.880  -->  00:01:06.040
and then you would say the name of the book.
28

28

00:01:06.040  -->  00:01:10.860
But now if you want this book to call the superclasses
29

29

00:01:10.860  -->  00:01:14.520
in each method, you also need the quantity of books.
30

30

00:01:14.520  -->  00:01:17.100
So this is where this is trying to break down a little bit,
31

31

00:01:17.100  -->  00:01:21.630
a book object doesn't have a quantity of anything.
32

32

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:23.810
So anyway, we are going to continue with that example
33

33

00:01:23.810  -->  00:01:26.080
because we firmly believe that
34

34

00:01:26.080  -->  00:01:28.270
a book should inherit from bookshelf.
35

35

00:01:28.270  -->  00:01:30.020
So you'll put your quantity in here
36

36

00:01:31.270  -->  00:01:33.180
and then you'll say self.name equal name.
37

37

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:34.630
Okay, perfect.
38

38

00:01:34.630  -->  00:01:38.320
Now, this I'm sure you'll realise makes little sense
39

39

00:01:38.320  -->  00:01:42.600
because you are passing the quantity to a book.
40

40

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:44.700
So when you create a book object,
41

41

00:01:44.700  -->  00:01:47.100
you're going to have to say Harry Potter
42

42

00:01:47.100  -->  00:01:50.780
and then you're going to have to say something like 120.
43

43

00:01:50.780  -->  00:01:52.830
Then if you print book,
44

44

00:01:52.830  -->  00:01:55.890
you'll get something out that's not all that good.
45

45

00:01:55.890  -->  00:02:00.630
You get bookshelf with 120 books when you print the book.
46

46

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:05.630
So clearly you're going to need an str method here
47

47

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:07.390
that prints something completely different.
48

48

00:02:07.390  -->  00:02:11.880
So for example, book self.name.
49

49

00:02:11.880  -->  00:02:13.720
Okay, let's press play again
50

50

00:02:13.720  -->  00:02:15.370
and now you get book Harry Potter.
51

51

00:02:15.370  -->  00:02:19.610
So why is this a bad approach?
52

52

00:02:19.610  -->  00:02:21.080
Well, there are two reasons.
53

53

00:02:21.080  -->  00:02:24.500
One of them is conceptual, the way of thinking about it.
54

54

00:02:24.500  -->  00:02:26.470
The other one is technical.
55

55

00:02:26.470  -->  00:02:30.610
The conceptual reason is that when you do inheritance,
56

56

00:02:30.610  -->  00:02:32.130
you are essentially treating it
57

57

00:02:32.130  -->  00:02:34.270
like evolutionary inheritance.
58

58

00:02:34.270  -->  00:02:39.270
You're saying that a book is a bookshelf and something more.
59

59

00:02:41.170  -->  00:02:45.880
For example, in the same way that all tigers are mammals,
60

60

00:02:45.880  -->  00:02:48.010
but not all mammals are tigers.
61

61

00:02:48.010  -->  00:02:50.180
So all books are bookshelves,
62

62

00:02:50.180  -->  00:02:52.120
but not all bookshelves are books.
63

63

00:02:52.120  -->  00:02:54.970
The bookshelf can still be used on its own.
64

64

00:02:54.970  -->  00:02:58.160
That breaks down when you talk about books and bookshelves,
65

65

00:02:58.160  -->  00:03:00.340
because a book is something completely different
66

66

00:03:00.340  -->  00:03:01.220
from a bookshelf.
67

67

00:03:01.220  -->  00:03:06.160
A bookshelf can contain books, but one isn't the other.
68

68

00:03:06.160  -->  00:03:08.850
The technical reason why this breaks down
69

69

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:12.500
is because you've got this book class that inherits
70

70

00:03:12.500  -->  00:03:17.500
from bookshelf, but actually you are not using inside it
71

71

00:03:18.760  -->  00:03:20.230
anything about the bookshelf.
72

72

00:03:20.230  -->  00:03:22.830
So you are completely overriding the str method
73

73

00:03:22.830  -->  00:03:24.810
because you don't want anything to do with bookshelves
74

74

00:03:24.810  -->  00:03:27.900
in there and you actually don't need these at all
75

75

00:03:27.900  -->  00:03:31.930
because I mean, what's the point of setting the quantity
76

76

00:03:31.930  -->  00:03:34.620
if you're not going to use it in the methods?
77

77

00:03:34.620  -->  00:03:38.700
So the conceptual reason is a book is not a bookshelf.
78

78

00:03:38.700  -->  00:03:40.788
The technical reason is there is no reason
79

79

00:03:40.788  -->  00:03:42.880
to inherit if you're not gonna use
80

80

00:03:42.880  -->  00:03:44.460
that inheritance anywhere.
81

81

00:03:44.460  -->  00:03:48.060
So this is where composition comes in.
82

82

00:03:48.060  -->  00:03:52.740
Composition is for when you wanna say something like,
83

83

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:55.120
a bookshelf has many books.
84

84

00:03:55.120  -->  00:04:00.120
A bookshelf is composed of a bunch of things and books.
85

85

00:04:00.710  -->  00:04:05.580
So instead of defining our bookshelf and our book like this,
86

86

00:04:05.580  -->  00:04:08.150
we're going to define it slightly differently.
87

87

00:04:08.150  -->  00:04:11.550
Instead of setting the quantity of books in the bookshelf,
88

88

00:04:11.550  -->  00:04:14.600
we're actually going to allow the constructor
89

89

00:04:14.600  -->  00:04:16.603
to take in a number of books.
90

90

00:04:17.800  -->  00:04:19.430
So we will do star books
91

91

00:04:19.430  -->  00:04:22.113
and then we'll say self.books, equal books.
92

92

00:04:22.990  -->  00:04:27.990
And then here we will say bookshelf with len of self.books.
93

93

00:04:28.480  -->  00:04:33.480
So what this will take in is a bunch of book objects.
94

94

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:38.970
Next up, the book class doesn't actually need,
95

95

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:40.660
I'm going to delete this as well for now,
96

96

00:04:40.660  -->  00:04:43.380
the book class doesn't need to inherit from bookshelf
97

97

00:04:43.380  -->  00:04:45.240
and it doesn't need the quantity
98

98

00:04:45.240  -->  00:04:48.270
and it doesn't need to call the superclass of anything.
99

99

00:04:48.270  -->  00:04:49.200
Okay.
100

100

00:04:49.200  -->  00:04:52.440
So now we have two much simpler classes,
101

101

00:04:52.440  -->  00:04:54.270
but how do you use them?
102

102

00:04:54.270  -->  00:04:56.320
Well, we can create our book
103

103

00:04:56.320  -->  00:04:58.120
and then we can create another book.
104

104

00:05:01.780  -->  00:05:02.613
Just like that.
105

105

00:05:02.613  -->  00:05:03.780
So we have our two books here.
106

106

00:05:03.780  -->  00:05:08.780
Then we'll create our bookshelf and give it the two books.
107

107

00:05:11.810  -->  00:05:13.963
Then we can print the shelf.
108

108

00:05:15.110  -->  00:05:17.180
So I'll press play now and you can see
109

109

00:05:17.180  -->  00:05:20.193
that you get bookshelf with two books printed out.
110

110

00:05:21.280  -->  00:05:24.480
This is composition and this is very common,
111

111

00:05:24.480  -->  00:05:26.250
much more common than inheritance.
112

112

00:05:26.250  -->  00:05:30.170
It is when you have a class that contains
113

113

00:05:30.170  -->  00:05:32.220
a bunch of other classes or a class
114

114

00:05:32.220  -->  00:05:34.640
that has as many of that.
115

115

00:05:34.640  -->  00:05:37.290
And the here we've got our bookshelf that has many books.
116

116

00:05:37.290  -->  00:05:39.330
And when you use it, when you create it,
117

117

00:05:39.330  -->  00:05:43.013
you can pass to it a bunch of your other book objects.
118

118

00:05:44.320  -->  00:05:45.960
So to recap.
119

119

00:05:45.960  -->  00:05:50.080
Inheritance means that a book is a bookshelf,
120

120

00:05:50.080  -->  00:05:53.830
composition means that a bookshelf has many books.
121

121

00:05:53.830  -->  00:05:55.670
So take your pick from those two,
122

122

00:05:55.670  -->  00:05:58.960
that's an important decision to make, but as I said earlier,
123

123

00:05:58.960  -->  00:06:02.190
you'll most frequently be using composition.
124

124

00:06:02.190  -->  00:06:03.540
Thanks for joining me in this video
125

125

00:06:03.540  -->  00:06:05.930
to learn about composition in Python,
126

126

00:06:05.930  -->  00:06:07.580
and I'll see you in the next one.
