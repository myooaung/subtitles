<v ->Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,300  -->  00:00:02,560
In this video we're going to be adding
3

3

00:00:02,560  -->  00:00:05,210
a little bit of error handling to our app,
4

4

00:00:05,210  -->  00:00:08,293
just so we can deal with any eventualities that may happen.
5

5

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:10,050
We're gonna come here
6

6

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:12,093
and we're gonna surround everything in here
7

7

00:00:12,093  -->  00:00:15,970
by a try/except block.
8

8

00:00:15,970  -->  00:00:16,803
Okay.
9

9

00:00:16,803  -->  00:00:18,972
And the first section is gonna be
10

10

00:00:18,972  -->  00:00:22,710
InvalidTagforAuthorError as e
11

11

00:00:22,710  -->  00:00:24,990
and it's just gonna print the error message
12

12

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:28,672
and then we're gonna have a more generic exception.
13

13

00:00:28,672  -->  00:00:30,607
And we're gonna say something like,
14

14

00:00:30,607  -->  00:00:33,007
"An unknown error occurred.
15

15

00:00:33,007  -->  00:00:34,420
"Please try again."
16

16

00:00:34,420  -->  00:00:36,620
So this double except,
17

17

00:00:36,620  -->  00:00:38,200
I'm not sure we've looked at it before,
18

18

00:00:38,200  -->  00:00:40,770
but what happens is if an exception is raised
19

19

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:43,793
in this block here and it is an InvalidTagForAuthorError,
20

20

00:00:44,920  -->  00:00:46,550
then it's gonna run this.
21

21

00:00:46,550  -->  00:00:49,910
If it's not that, then it is gonna run this
22

22

00:00:49,910  -->  00:00:52,950
because Exception is the base class for every exception.
23

23

00:00:52,950  -->  00:00:54,480
But you can have many of these
24

24

00:00:54,480  -->  00:00:57,600
and then they get less and less specific.
25

25

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:01,020
We also do need to import our error there of course.
26

26

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:06,020
So now if we run our app and we say we want Bob Marley
27

27

00:01:06,030  -->  00:01:08,833
and then we want something like magic.
28

28

00:01:09,711  -->  00:01:11,610
What you'll get is Chrome will launch,
29

29

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:13,230
Bob Marley will be selected
30

30

00:01:13,230  -->  00:01:15,887
and then you'll get your message here,
31

31

00:01:15,887  -->  00:01:18,450
"Author Bob Marley does not have any question"
32

32

00:01:18,450  -->  00:01:19,690
Any question?
33

33

00:01:19,690  -->  00:01:20,540
Why question?
34

34

00:01:20,540  -->  00:01:22,340
I'm not sure why I typed question there.
35

35

00:01:22,340  -->  00:01:24,630
Does not have any quotes.
36

36

00:01:24,630  -->  00:01:26,820
I'm not sure why I decided to type question there
37

37

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:28,290
but that's no problem.
38

38

00:01:28,290  -->  00:01:30,920
We fixed it and we've added our error handling
39

39

00:01:30,920  -->  00:01:32,210
there as well.
40

40

00:01:32,210  -->  00:01:33,190
That's it for this video.
41

41

00:01:33,190  -->  00:01:34,470
Thank you for joining me.
42

42

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:35,920
I'll see you in the next one.
