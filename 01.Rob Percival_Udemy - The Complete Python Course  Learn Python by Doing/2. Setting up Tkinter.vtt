00:00:00.160  -->  00:00:02.730
<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.730  -->  00:00:06.101
In this section, we're going to start looking at Tkinter.
3

3

00:00:06.101  -->  00:00:08.770
And we're gonna be using Python 3.
4

4

00:00:08.770  -->  00:00:10.770
I know that most of you are already using Python 3,
5

5

00:00:10.770  -->  00:00:13.290
but for this section, it is especially important
6

6

00:00:13.290  -->  00:00:14.397
that you use Python 3
7

7

00:00:14.397  -->  00:00:18.620
because it has all the latest Tkinter updates.
8

8

00:00:18.620  -->  00:00:21.100
Use the latest version that you can.
9

9

00:00:21.100  -->  00:00:23.949
In this case I'm gonna be using Python 3.7.
10

10

00:00:23.949  -->  00:00:27.930
3.8 has just come into beta, so I'm not using it yet,
11

11

00:00:27.930  -->  00:00:29.900
but what we covered in this section
12

12

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:33.470
should work for Python 3.8 and later as well.
13

13

00:00:33.470  -->  00:00:35.277
As I said though, I'm using 3.7
14

14

00:00:35.277  -->  00:00:37.403
and I recommend you do as well.
15

15

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:42.376
In order to create a project in PyCharm using Python 3.7,
16

16

00:00:42.376  -->  00:00:44.189
I'm sure you know how to do that already.
17

17

00:00:44.189  -->  00:00:47.580
I'm just going to create a folder for my project
18

18

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:51.630
and I'm gonna call it gui development.
19

19

00:00:51.630  -->  00:00:54.380
Make sure to not call your project Tkinter,
20

20

00:00:54.380  -->  00:00:58.320
as that is going to conflict with the imports later on.
21

21

00:00:58.320  -->  00:00:59.980
And then for the environment,
22

22

00:00:59.980  -->  00:01:02.756
select a new environment using pipenv
23

23

00:01:02.756  -->  00:01:05.456
and then make sure the base interpreter is Python 3.7.
24

24

00:01:06.616  -->  00:01:08.760
All right, that's everything you need
25

25

00:01:08.760  -->  00:01:12.270
in order to create your project.
26

26

00:01:12.270  -->  00:01:16.643
So once that's done, we should be able to use Tkinter.
27

27

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:21.010
To verify that Tkinter is working in your system,
28

28

00:01:21.010  -->  00:01:24.144
all you have to do is create a file inside this project.
29

29

00:01:24.144  -->  00:01:27.650
And name it whatever you want, I'm gonna call it test.py.
30

30

00:01:27.650  -->  00:01:30.576
And in here, type import tkinter.
31

31

00:01:30.576  -->  00:01:35.270
Now if, as you're typing, PyCharm has this recommendation,
32

32

00:01:35.270  -->  00:01:37.710
that means you're all good to go, that's first of all.
33

33

00:01:37.710  -->  00:01:41.670
But just to make 100% sure, after import tkinter,
34

34

00:01:41.670  -->  00:01:45.954
type tkinter_test, like that.
35

35

00:01:45.954  -->  00:01:49.540
Now PyCharm will complain about this, but that's okay.
36

36

00:01:49.540  -->  00:01:51.722
And we're going to run this file
37

37

00:01:51.722  -->  00:01:54.865
and you should get a little window
38

38

00:01:54.865  -->  00:01:56.670
that looks similar to this.
39

39

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:58.970
If you get anything at all, that isn't an error,
40

40

00:01:58.970  -->  00:02:00.090
that means you're good to go.
41

41

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:04.050
But, you should get a little window
42

42

00:02:04.050  -->  00:02:09.034
that is essentially a sample Tkinter app.
43

43

00:02:09.034  -->  00:02:12.310
If that happens in your system, you're good to go,
44

44

00:02:12.310  -->  00:02:13.800
you can continue to the next video.
45

45

00:02:13.800  -->  00:02:17.820
If it doesn't, you'll need to go through installing Tkinter.
46

46

00:02:17.820  -->  00:02:21.700
Now that is fairly straightforward in most systems.
47

47

00:02:21.700  -->  00:02:24.360
All you have to do is reinstall Python
48

48

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:27.283
or instal a late version of Python, like 3.7,
49

49

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:32.930
and make sure that tk/tcl is selected in the instal.
50

50

00:02:32.930  -->  00:02:34.500
And you shouldn't have to worry about it
51

51

00:02:34.500  -->  00:02:37.343
on Mac and on Linux, it should all just work fine.
52

52

00:02:38.750  -->  00:02:39.829
Thanks for joining me in this video.
53

53

00:02:39.829  -->  00:02:42.250
Let's get started with Tkinter.
54

54

00:02:42.250  -->  00:02:43.700
I'll see you in the next one.
