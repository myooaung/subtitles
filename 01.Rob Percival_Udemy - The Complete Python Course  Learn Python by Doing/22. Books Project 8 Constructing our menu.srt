00:00:00,220  -->  00:00:01,470
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,470  -->  00:00:04,180
In this video we're going to be constructing our menu.
3

3

00:00:04,180  -->  00:00:06,203
It's going to be really straightforward.
4

4

00:00:07,050  -->  00:00:08,960
What we're going to do is we're gonna give the user
5

5

00:00:08,960  -->  00:00:10,920
some choices to make.
6

6

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:12,540
And I'm gonna paste in here,
7

7

00:00:12,540  -->  00:00:14,383
what exactly the choices gonna be.
8

8

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:18,900
So let's say the user has these choices.
9

9

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:20,820
They can enter one of the following,
10

10

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:23,580
the character B to look at five-star books,
11

11

00:00:23,580  -->  00:00:27,100
the best books, C to look at the five cheapest books,
12

12

00:00:27,100  -->  00:00:29,020
or the 10 cheapest books,
13

13

00:00:29,020  -->  00:00:33,430
N to just get the next available book on the collection,
14

14

00:00:33,430  -->  00:00:36,760
let's say catalogue here instead
15

15

00:00:36,760  -->  00:00:38,910
and they can type Q to exit.
16

16

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:40,510
And then they gonna enter their choice.
17

17

00:00:40,510  -->  00:00:43,113
So you know exactly how to do this now.
18

18

00:00:44,210  -->  00:00:45,853
You have all the tools you need,
19

19

00:00:47,200  -->  00:00:49,470
this one here has not been implemented for you,
20

20

00:00:49,470  -->  00:00:51,560
how to get the next available book on the catalogue,
21

21

00:00:51,560  -->  00:00:54,843
but I'm sure you can use generators to do this.
22

22

00:00:56,120  -->  00:00:56,990
So give it a go.
23

23

00:00:56,990  -->  00:00:59,940
Try to implement this menu yourself.
24

24

00:00:59,940  -->  00:01:04,080
Allow the user to get cheapest books, five-star books,
25

25

00:01:04,080  -->  00:01:06,690
the next book and also run that on a loop,
26

26

00:01:06,690  -->  00:01:09,283
so that they can always exit the application.
27

27

00:01:10,630  -->  00:01:11,670
I hope you managed.
28

28

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:14,470
Let's get started on creating our menu.
29

29

00:01:14,470  -->  00:01:18,253
So down here I'm going to create our menu property here.
30

30

00:01:19,315  -->  00:01:23,693
And I'm gonna say user input is input of user choice,
31

31

00:01:24,920  -->  00:01:29,920
while the user input is not Q, we're going to run our menu.
32

32

00:01:30,120  -->  00:01:34,820
So we're gonna say if user input is equal to B,
33

33

00:01:34,820  -->  00:01:36,533
we're gonna print the best books.
34

34

00:01:37,960  -->  00:01:42,530
And if the user input is equal to C, we are gonna print
35

35

00:01:42,530  -->  00:01:43,813
the cheapest books.
36

36

00:01:45,380  -->  00:01:48,883
And if the user input is equal to N,
37

37

00:01:49,790  -->  00:01:51,853
we're going to somehow get the next book.
38

38

00:01:53,030  -->  00:01:55,090
We're gonna implement that in a moment.
39

39

00:01:55,090  -->  00:02:00,090
Else we're going to print, please choose a valued command,
40

40

00:02:00,170  -->  00:02:01,670
I think that's a reasonable thing to do
41

41

00:02:01,670  -->  00:02:03,763
and finally we're gonna once again,
42

42

00:02:06,180  -->  00:02:09,240
give them the choice to give us another thing
43

43

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:10,480
that they wanna do.
44

44

00:02:10,480  -->  00:02:11,530
Then at the very end,
45

45

00:02:13,650  -->  00:02:16,080
we're going to, from the menu.
46

46

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:18,893
Let's implement the get next book function.
47

47

00:02:21,480  -->  00:02:25,230
All that we have to do, in order to get the next book,
48

48

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:28,993
is create a generator on the books.
49

49

00:02:35,590  -->  00:02:37,890
And then get next book
50

50

00:02:37,890  -->  00:02:42,833
can just print out the next of that.
51

51

00:02:44,420  -->  00:02:48,570
That is how simple it can be using generators.
52

52

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:50,460
You don't have to worry about, you know,
53

53

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:53,910
what was the last book you looked at, or keeping an index,
54

54

00:02:53,910  -->  00:02:57,490
or something, or how many books you've gone through, no.
55

55

00:02:57,490  -->  00:03:01,440
Just create a generator for the list, very efficient,
56

56

00:03:01,440  -->  00:03:03,800
because it doesn't actually do anything,
57

57

00:03:03,800  -->  00:03:06,600
until you start getting the next book.
58

58

00:03:06,600  -->  00:03:07,890
So it doesn't take up any memory,
59

59

00:03:07,890  -->  00:03:11,030
or not a lot of memory, it's not completely free,
60

60

00:03:11,030  -->  00:03:12,690
but it's essentially free.
61

61

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:14,640
It doesn't take up any processing power.
62

62

00:03:14,640  -->  00:03:16,520
Every time you press next, it just gives you
63

63

00:03:16,520  -->  00:03:18,120
the next book in that.
64

64

00:03:18,120  -->  00:03:21,220
Generator it doesn't actually go through the entire list,
65

65

00:03:21,220  -->  00:03:22,320
or anything like that.
66

66

00:03:23,490  -->  00:03:27,460
So that's a great way of setting up this
67

67

00:03:27,460  -->  00:03:29,073
getting the next of something.
68

68

00:03:31,320  -->  00:03:33,020
Let's run it and see what happens.
69

69

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:37,050
I get to enter one of the following,
70

70

00:03:37,050  -->  00:03:42,050
let's type B and then I see sort of the best books in here.
71

71

00:03:42,690  -->  00:03:45,130
Five-star books, four-star books, it's pretty awesome.
72

72

00:03:45,130  -->  00:03:46,773
Maybe I wanna buy one of these.
73

73

00:03:47,620  -->  00:03:49,310
C you can look a the cheapest books,
74

74

00:03:49,310  -->  00:03:53,440
just in case you're wanting to spend a little less money
75

75

00:03:53,440  -->  00:03:56,240
on a book, some of them are not so good,
76

76

00:03:56,240  -->  00:03:57,340
but you know others are pretty good,
77

77

00:03:57,340  -->  00:04:00,290
so maybe you can find something good there.
78

78

00:04:00,290  -->  00:04:02,440
And if you just wanna go through the books,
79

79

00:04:03,550  -->  00:04:06,590
just press N and then you get one, "A Light in the Attic",
80

80

00:04:06,590  -->  00:04:10,393
N again, "Tipping the Velvet", it's not a very good one,
81

81

00:04:11,227  -->  00:04:14,260
"Sous Michon", I guess that's French,
82

82

00:04:14,260  -->  00:04:17,690
or maybe it's some sort of weird submission thing.
83

83

00:04:17,690  -->  00:04:19,410
That's also not very good.
84

84

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:20,380
And that's it.
85

85

00:04:20,380  -->  00:04:23,500
Now you cannot go back on the catalogue,
86

86

00:04:23,500  -->  00:04:25,830
I'll leave that to you to implement.
87

87

00:04:25,830  -->  00:04:27,640
But this is how you can see the different things
88

88

00:04:27,640  -->  00:04:28,700
that are in the catalogue.
89

89

00:04:28,700  -->  00:04:30,570
I guess you could go back just by scrolling up.
90

90

00:04:30,570  -->  00:04:32,797
So that works too.
91

91

00:04:32,797  -->  00:04:35,023
And you can press Q to terminate.
92

92

00:04:36,940  -->  00:04:38,880
Okay so there are a few more improvements we're gonna make
93

93

00:04:38,880  -->  00:04:40,050
on this project.
94

94

00:04:40,050  -->  00:04:41,280
This first improvement we're gonna make
95

95

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:44,900
is we are going to scrape all of the pages in the catalogue
96

96

00:04:44,900  -->  00:04:46,220
not just one.
97

97

00:04:46,220  -->  00:04:48,170
That way we're gonna get a much larger collection.
98

98

00:04:48,170  -->  00:04:50,940
So we're gonna look at how to scrape multiple pages,
99

99

00:04:50,940  -->  00:04:53,863
how to go through the different pages of this site.
100

100

00:04:55,060  -->  00:04:58,440
And we can also add logging, just so it's a bit easier
101

101

00:04:58,440  -->  00:04:59,900
to spot when things go wrong
102

102

00:04:59,900  -->  00:05:02,120
and also what's goin' on in the programme.
103

103

00:05:02,120  -->  00:05:04,730
I'd encourage you to try to do these two,
104

104

00:05:04,730  -->  00:05:06,100
particularly the logging,
105

105

00:05:06,100  -->  00:05:07,660
because we've already looked at logging,
106

106

00:05:07,660  -->  00:05:08,630
you know it's quite simple.
107

107

00:05:08,630  -->  00:05:10,710
All you have to do is import logging,
108

108

00:05:10,710  -->  00:05:13,430
set up the logger and start logging in different places.
109

109

00:05:13,430  -->  00:05:15,540
I'd encourage you to do that.
110

110

00:05:15,540  -->  00:05:18,820
And try to set up the looking at different pages if you can,
111

111

00:05:18,820  -->  00:05:22,570
but if not just wait and we will do it here.
112

112

00:05:22,570  -->  00:05:23,410
For the logging,
113

113

00:05:23,410  -->  00:05:25,980
one of the most important things about logging
114

114

00:05:25,980  -->  00:05:28,600
and why I'm recommending that you do it
115

115

00:05:29,930  -->  00:05:34,313
is deciding where to log and what to log.
116

116

00:05:35,720  -->  00:05:37,770
Because you can log at every line
117

117

00:05:37,770  -->  00:05:40,580
and that's gonna make your code look really ugly.
118

118

00:05:40,580  -->  00:05:43,770
Or you can log too little
119

119

00:05:43,770  -->  00:05:46,300
and then you're not gonna get enough information.
120

120

00:05:46,300  -->  00:05:49,740
So definitely keep an eye out for that.
121

121

00:05:49,740  -->  00:05:51,340
Try to implement the logging yourself,
122

122

00:05:51,340  -->  00:05:54,210
then we'll go back in the video and do it here
123

123

00:05:54,210  -->  00:05:56,930
just so you can see how much I would log
124

124

00:05:56,930  -->  00:05:58,030
and where I would log.
125

125

00:05:59,300  -->  00:06:00,560
That's it for this video.
126

126

00:06:00,560  -->  00:06:02,160
So I'll see you on the next one.
