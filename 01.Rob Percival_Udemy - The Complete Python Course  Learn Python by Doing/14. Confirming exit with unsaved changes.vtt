00:00:00.110  -->  00:00:01.800
<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.800  -->  00:00:03.320
In this video we're going to be
3

3

00:00:03.320  -->  00:00:05.070
asking the user to confirm
4

4

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:06.158
that the really want to exit
5

5

00:00:06.158  -->  00:00:09.300
if they have unsaved changes.
6

6

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:11.040
So let's jump right in it.
7

7

00:00:11.040  -->  00:00:13.230
We're gonna go and create a new function.
8

8

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:15.080
I'm just gonna call it,
9

9

00:00:15.080  -->  00:00:15.913
create it down here,
10

10

00:00:15.913  -->  00:00:19.100
and call it confirm quit.
11

11

00:00:19.100  -->  00:00:19.933
And what this is gonna do
12

12

00:00:19.933  -->  00:00:21.480
is it's going to start off
13

13

00:00:21.480  -->  00:00:23.690
as unsaved equal false.
14

14

00:00:23.690  -->  00:00:26.040
And then it's gonna cycle through the tabs
15

15

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:28.660
and if anyone of them is unsaved
16

16

00:00:28.660  -->  00:00:30.070
it's gonna turn this to true.
17

17

00:00:30.070  -->  00:00:33.920
So we'll do for tab in notebook dot tabs.
18

18

00:00:33.920  -->  00:00:35.660
We will get the current widget,
19

19

00:00:35.660  -->  00:00:38.250
which is tab widget is root dot name
20

20

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:40.880
to widget of the tab.
21

21

00:00:40.880  -->  00:00:43.780
And again we are using the tab name here
22

22

00:00:43.780  -->  00:00:45.010
and then we're getting the actual
23

23

00:00:45.010  -->  00:00:48.360
widget using the name to widget method.
24

24

00:00:48.360  -->  00:00:51.700
Then we are going to do that the content
25

25

00:00:53.130  -->  00:00:58.130
is equal to the tab widget dot get 1.0
26

26

00:00:59.850  -->  00:01:02.053
to end minus one C.
27

27

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:05.440
And then we're gonna check the contents.
28

28

00:01:05.440  -->  00:01:08.260
So if the hash of the content
29

29

00:01:08.260  -->  00:01:11.470
is not equal to the text contents,
30

30

00:01:11.470  -->  00:01:14.110
SDR of tab widget sorry.
31

31

00:01:14.110  -->  00:01:15.090
I'm actually gonna rename this
32

32

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:17.720
to text widget just because
33

33

00:01:17.720  -->  00:01:18.770
it makes it much clearer
34

34

00:01:18.770  -->  00:01:19.920
of what it actually is.
35

35

00:01:20.810  -->  00:01:23.800
Then unsaved is true
36

36

00:01:23.800  -->  00:01:25.360
because they are different.
37

37

00:01:25.360  -->  00:01:28.280
So we can now break.
38

38

00:01:28.280  -->  00:01:29.420
If they are the same,
39

39

00:01:29.420  -->  00:01:32.900
that means that this file is not unsaved
40

40

00:01:32.900  -->  00:01:34.630
and it should have the little asterisk
41

41

00:01:34.630  -->  00:01:36.000
beside its name.
42

42

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:37.833
So we won't do this.
43

43

00:01:39.760  -->  00:01:41.580
And next up if unsaved
44

44

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:44.810
then we're going to ask the user
45

45

00:01:44.810  -->  00:01:47.060
to confirm whether they really want to exit.
46

46

00:01:47.060  -->  00:01:48.580
So we'll say confirm
47

47

00:01:48.580  -->  00:01:52.580
is message box dot ask yes no.
48

48

00:01:52.580  -->  00:01:54.730
And we will pass in a message.
49

49

00:01:54.730  -->  00:01:56.030
You have unsaved changes,
50

50

00:01:56.030  -->  00:01:57.450
are you sure you want to quit?
51

51

00:01:57.450  -->  00:01:59.290
Then we will place an icon
52

52

00:01:59.290  -->  00:02:02.433
which is the string question.
53

53

00:02:03.500  -->  00:02:06.860
And finally we will have a title for the window,
54

54

00:02:06.860  -->  00:02:09.763
which is going to be confirm quit.
55

55

00:02:11.070  -->  00:02:13.920
So if not confirm,
56

56

00:02:13.920  -->  00:02:15.470
we're going to return.
57

57

00:02:15.470  -->  00:02:17.970
Otherwise we're gonna do root dot destroy.
58

58

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:19.570
And that's gonna close our application.
59

59

00:02:19.570  -->  00:02:21.780
Now we do have to import message box.
60

60

00:02:21.780  -->  00:02:23.670
So go ahead and do that
61

61

00:02:23.670  -->  00:02:25.513
just from TK inter there.
62

62

00:02:27.240  -->  00:02:28.260
So what this is doing,
63

63

00:02:28.260  -->  00:02:29.230
just to review,
64

64

00:02:29.230  -->  00:02:31.500
is it's starting off as unsaved false.
65

65

00:02:31.500  -->  00:02:32.919
Which means that all the files
66

66

00:02:32.919  -->  00:02:34.940
currently open are saved.
67

67

00:02:34.940  -->  00:02:36.040
Then it's gonna cycle through
68

68

00:02:36.040  -->  00:02:38.280
all the tabs getting the text widget,
69

69

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:39.113
getting the content,
70

70

00:02:39.113  -->  00:02:40.240
and checking it against
71

71

00:02:40.240  -->  00:02:42.470
our text contents dictionary.
72

72

00:02:42.470  -->  00:02:43.990
If any of them don't match,
73

73

00:02:43.990  -->  00:02:45.000
that means there is at least
74

74

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:46.870
one file that is unsaved.
75

75

00:02:46.870  -->  00:02:48.160
So we set unsaved to true,
76

76

00:02:48.160  -->  00:02:49.320
we break,
77

77

00:02:49.320  -->  00:02:51.860
and then if unsaved is true,
78

78

00:02:51.860  -->  00:02:53.890
then we ask the user to confirm.
79

79

00:02:53.890  -->  00:02:55.481
If the confirm saying
80

80

00:02:55.481  -->  00:02:58.140
that they do not want to quit,
81

81

00:02:58.140  -->  00:02:59.630
that means they click no.
82

82

00:02:59.630  -->  00:03:01.650
Then confirm will be false.
83

83

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:03.160
And then we will just return
84

84

00:03:03.160  -->  00:03:05.510
and not run root destroy.
85

85

00:03:05.510  -->  00:03:07.963
However if they do not say no,
86

86

00:03:07.963  -->  00:03:11.230
that means that not confirm will be false
87

87

00:03:11.230  -->  00:03:13.393
so we will then root destroy.
88

88

00:03:14.350  -->  00:03:15.880
Next up we do have to add
89

89

00:03:15.880  -->  00:03:17.240
a way of calling that function.
90

90

00:03:17.240  -->  00:03:18.073
And we're gonna do that
91

91

00:03:18.073  -->  00:03:20.340
with another menu item.
92

92

00:03:20.340  -->  00:03:23.080
So we are not going to run this whenever
93

93

00:03:23.080  -->  00:03:24.470
you press the close button.
94

94

00:03:24.470  -->  00:03:25.303
We're gonna run this when
95

95

00:03:25.303  -->  00:03:26.880
you use the menu to exit.
96

96

00:03:26.880  -->  00:03:30.010
So we'll say file menu at command.
97

97

00:03:30.010  -->  00:03:33.860
The label is going to be exit.
98

98

00:03:33.860  -->  00:03:36.233
And the command is confirm quit.
99

99

00:03:37.570  -->  00:03:38.610
Let's press play
100

100

00:03:39.810  -->  00:03:42.020
and we'll type an H
101

101

00:03:42.020  -->  00:03:44.830
and then I will press file exit.
102

102

00:03:44.830  -->  00:03:46.973
And this is what it asks me.
103

103

00:03:48.120  -->  00:03:49.160
You have unsaved changes,
104

104

00:03:49.160  -->  00:03:50.610
are you sure you want to quit?
105

105

00:03:50.610  -->  00:03:52.740
And I will say yes.
106

106

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:54.070
So then it exits.
107

107

00:03:54.070  -->  00:03:56.900
But similarly if we type H
108

108

00:03:56.900  -->  00:03:58.620
and then we exit,
109

109

00:03:58.620  -->  00:04:00.050
and we say no,
110

110

00:04:00.050  -->  00:04:01.670
then that just returns and it doesn't
111

111

00:04:01.670  -->  00:04:03.433
actually terminate the application.
112

112

00:04:05.680  -->  00:04:07.150
Hopefully that makes sense.
113

113

00:04:07.150  -->  00:04:08.310
I am actually going
114

114

00:04:08.310  -->  00:04:10.100
to remove this print from here
115

115

00:04:10.960  -->  00:04:12.930
since we're printing the frame names there
116

116

00:04:12.930  -->  00:04:14.310
or the text area names there.
117

117

00:04:14.310  -->  00:04:15.380
We don't wanna do that.
118

118

00:04:15.380  -->  00:04:16.520
So that's it for this video.
119

119

00:04:16.520  -->  00:04:17.700
I hope you've learned something.
120

120

00:04:17.700  -->  00:04:18.670
Thank you for joining me
121

121

00:04:18.670  -->  00:04:20.320
and I'll see you in the next one.
