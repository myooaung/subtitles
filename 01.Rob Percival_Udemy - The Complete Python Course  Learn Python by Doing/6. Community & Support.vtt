00:00:00.160  -->  00:00:01.570
<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.570  -->  00:00:03.530
In this video, I just wanted to tell you a little bit
3

3

00:00:03.530  -->  00:00:07.340
about how to get help if you need it in this course.
4

4

00:00:07.340  -->  00:00:09.870
If you have a question about something covered
5

5

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:12.690
in the videos, be that an explanation,
6

6

00:00:12.690  -->  00:00:14.800
or some of the code in the videos,
7

7

00:00:14.800  -->  00:00:16.680
or you've been typing along with the videos
8

8

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:19.020
and you've had a problem or something like that,
9

9

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:22.450
or if you have a question about a coding exercise
10

10

00:00:22.450  -->  00:00:26.570
in the course, please ask those questions in the Course Q&amp;A.
11

11

00:00:26.570  -->  00:00:27.950
That's the best place for them,
12

12

00:00:27.950  -->  00:00:30.100
so we can get back to you quickly.
13

13

00:00:30.100  -->  00:00:32.320
However, if you're going somewhere more advanced,
14

14

00:00:32.320  -->  00:00:34.750
you have a question about your own project,
15

15

00:00:34.750  -->  00:00:37.590
or you wanted some feedback on your own code,
16

16

00:00:37.590  -->  00:00:39.400
or you just wanna chat with other students,
17

17

00:00:39.400  -->  00:00:42.040
ask them about their journey or help them
18

18

00:00:42.040  -->  00:00:44.220
or get help from them and so on,
19

19

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:46.823
then go into the Slack Community.
20

20

00:00:47.670  -->  00:00:49.450
The Slack Community is also the place
21

21

00:00:49.450  -->  00:00:51.600
for if you are still stuck
22

22

00:00:51.600  -->  00:00:53.580
after getting an answer in the Course Q&amp;A
23

23

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:55.500
and you want something a bit more involved.
24

24

00:00:55.500  -->  00:00:58.830
The Slack Community is there for that.
25

25

00:00:58.830  -->  00:01:00.610
If you don't know where the Slack Community is,
26

26

00:01:00.610  -->  00:01:02.840
I'm going to put a link in the resources section
27

27

00:01:02.840  -->  00:01:04.220
of this lecture.
28

28

00:01:04.220  -->  00:01:06.493
So let's go and have a look at that.
29

29

00:01:07.400  -->  00:01:08.620
So when you're taking the course,
30

30

00:01:08.620  -->  00:01:11.240
you're going to see a screen like this one.
31

31

00:01:11.240  -->  00:01:13.457
You've got the video player here on the left,
32

32

00:01:13.457  -->  00:01:17.040
and then you've got your course curriculum on the right.
33

33

00:01:17.040  -->  00:01:18.610
If you hover over the video,
34

34

00:01:18.610  -->  00:01:20.230
you'll see the controls up here.
35

35

00:01:20.230  -->  00:01:22.250
And there's a few really important ones.
36

36

00:01:22.250  -->  00:01:24.720
The first one is the playback rate.
37

37

00:01:24.720  -->  00:01:27.670
So here you can adjust the speed of the video.
38

38

00:01:27.670  -->  00:01:30.540
If you think I'm speaking too quickly or too slowly,
39

39

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:33.340
you can change this so that I'll go faster or slower,
40

40

00:01:33.340  -->  00:01:36.320
just to help you understand things a bit better.
41

41

00:01:36.320  -->  00:01:39.340
Similarly, you can go backwards and forwards in time,
42

42

00:01:39.340  -->  00:01:41.020
and you can save a bookmark.
43

43

00:01:41.020  -->  00:01:42.690
When you save a bookmark, it will appear
44

44

00:01:42.690  -->  00:01:45.670
under your bookmarks tab just underneath.
45

45

00:01:45.670  -->  00:01:47.540
Then you've got your audio controls, of course,
46

46

00:01:47.540  -->  00:01:50.242
and you've got a transcript, which is a text version
47

47

00:01:50.242  -->  00:01:52.410
of what I say in the video.
48

48

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:53.960
And you've got something very important,
49

49

00:01:53.960  -->  00:01:55.710
which is the captions.
50

50

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:59.290
A caption is some text that appears describing what I say.
51

51

00:01:59.290  -->  00:02:02.690
So I've got English captions for all the videos.
52

52

00:02:02.690  -->  00:02:07.030
These are all hand made by a professional captioning team,
53

53

00:02:07.030  -->  00:02:09.980
so if you want captions to further understand
54

54

00:02:09.980  -->  00:02:12.470
what I'm saying or if you need the captions
55

55

00:02:12.470  -->  00:02:14.610
for accessibility purposes, you can find them there.
56

56

00:02:14.610  -->  00:02:16.970
That's a really good feature of this course.
57

57

00:02:16.970  -->  00:02:18.980
Finally, you've got your settings,
58

58

00:02:18.980  -->  00:02:22.370
where you can adjust the quality of the video.
59

59

00:02:22.370  -->  00:02:26.400
Videos are capped at 720p, but if you go to Auto,
60

60

00:02:26.400  -->  00:02:30.090
they can go up to 1080p, which is higher quality.
61

61

00:02:30.090  -->  00:02:33.500
If you are looking at a programming video like these,
62

62

00:02:33.500  -->  00:02:36.590
I cannot recommend going anything lower than 720p,
63

63

00:02:36.590  -->  00:02:39.200
just because the text is gonna start to get a bit blurry.
64

64

00:02:39.200  -->  00:02:41.000
So if your text is blurry,
65

65

00:02:41.000  -->  00:02:44.270
just make sure that the 720p is selected.
66

66

00:02:44.270  -->  00:02:46.580
And then it won't be blurry any more.
67

67

00:02:46.580  -->  00:02:49.210
If you have any technical issues within a lecture
68

68

00:02:49.210  -->  00:02:51.240
such as the video is not playing
69

69

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:53.830
or the audio sounds very weird,
70

70

00:02:53.830  -->  00:02:57.760
then you can in the settings report a technical issue.
71

71

00:02:57.760  -->  00:03:00.170
I make the videos and the course content,
72

72

00:03:00.170  -->  00:03:02.460
but it is Udemy, a separate company,
73

73

00:03:02.460  -->  00:03:05.090
that deals with maintaining the platform
74

74

00:03:05.090  -->  00:03:07.120
and allowing you to watch the videos
75

75

00:03:07.120  -->  00:03:09.250
and handles your purchases and all that stuff.
76

76

00:03:09.250  -->  00:03:10.700
So I just make the content.
77

77

00:03:10.700  -->  00:03:12.810
They handle the platform.
78

78

00:03:12.810  -->  00:03:16.030
Now regarding the resources section of each lecture,
79

79

00:03:16.030  -->  00:03:18.710
you've got it on the right under the lecture itself.
80

80

00:03:18.710  -->  00:03:20.750
Here we are in the lecture called variables
81

81

00:03:20.750  -->  00:03:22.370
and printing in Python.
82

82

00:03:22.370  -->  00:03:26.590
And you can see that it has some resources attached to it,
83

83

00:03:26.590  -->  00:03:30.560
so if you click on that, you'll see the resources there.
84

84

00:03:30.560  -->  00:03:33.170
The lecture that you're currently on has some resources,
85

85

00:03:33.170  -->  00:03:37.070
as well, such as the address to our Slack channel.
86

86

00:03:37.070  -->  00:03:39.610
So you can click on that to go there.
87

87

00:03:39.610  -->  00:03:43.290
You can always skip lectures ahead, or go back if you need,
88

88

00:03:43.290  -->  00:03:45.620
by just clicking on the appropriate lecture.
89

89

00:03:45.620  -->  00:03:47.740
Now let's talk about the Q&amp;A.
90

90

00:03:47.740  -->  00:03:51.600
The Q&amp;A is a great feature of this course.
91

91

00:03:51.600  -->  00:03:54.600
The first thing to do is to go over to the Q&amp;A tab
92

92

00:03:54.600  -->  00:03:57.490
by scrolling down, and then you can see
93

93

00:03:57.490  -->  00:03:59.250
in the current lecture that you're in,
94

94

00:03:59.250  -->  00:04:02.270
all the questions that other people have asked.
95

95

00:04:02.270  -->  00:04:06.360
So for example, Vivek here had a question about strings,
96

96

00:04:06.360  -->  00:04:09.840
and you can click on it to read what he asked
97

97

00:04:09.840  -->  00:04:11.660
and maybe learn something from it,
98

98

00:04:11.660  -->  00:04:14.520
or just help him out if you know the answer.
99

99

00:04:14.520  -->  00:04:17.470
You can always add your answer there, as well.
100

100

00:04:17.470  -->  00:04:19.480
If you want to ask a new question
101

101

00:04:19.480  -->  00:04:22.100
because your question is not answered in here,
102

102

00:04:22.100  -->  00:04:23.470
you can always click the button
103

103

00:04:23.470  -->  00:04:25.050
and type here in question title.
104

104

00:04:25.050  -->  00:04:28.200
For example, "Why is this not working?"
105

105

00:04:28.200  -->  00:04:31.080
And then describe what you're trying to do,
106

106

00:04:31.080  -->  00:04:34.170
where you're getting stuck, and give us your code.
107

107

00:04:34.170  -->  00:04:37.700
Your code, you'll see you can always share with us.
108

108

00:04:37.700  -->  00:04:42.040
If you can include any images to help us help you,
109

109

00:04:42.040  -->  00:04:44.330
then that's always good, as well.
110

110

00:04:44.330  -->  00:04:47.030
Finally, if you're pasting some code in here,
111

111

00:04:47.030  -->  00:04:49.640
do select it all and press this icon.
112

112

00:04:49.640  -->  00:04:52.100
This icon is for text formatting as code,
113

113

00:04:52.100  -->  00:04:55.330
and it's gonna make the code much easier to read.
114

114

00:04:55.330  -->  00:04:56.330
The think I recommend
115

115

00:04:56.330  -->  00:04:59.700
before you create a new question is always to search.
116

116

00:04:59.700  -->  00:05:01.820
Because often you'll be able to find the answer
117

117

00:05:01.820  -->  00:05:03.610
to your question just by searching for it.
118

118

00:05:03.610  -->  00:05:06.540
We answer a lot of questions, and sometimes some
119

119

00:05:06.540  -->  00:05:08.490
of them are duplicated, which means
120

120

00:05:08.490  -->  00:05:10.390
that you could have found the answer
121

121

00:05:10.390  -->  00:05:13.080
to your question by searching first.
122

122

00:05:13.080  -->  00:05:16.950
For example, you could find something about division here
123

123

00:05:16.950  -->  00:05:19.070
and the search will find you questions
124

124

00:05:19.070  -->  00:05:21.410
that have that in the title or in the content.
125

125

00:05:21.410  -->  00:05:23.390
So going through those when you have a question
126

126

00:05:23.390  -->  00:05:26.620
about a particular topic can be really helpful.
127

127

00:05:26.620  -->  00:05:27.610
Together with our videos,
128

128

00:05:27.610  -->  00:05:29.790
we've also got a short Python ebook
129

129

00:05:29.790  -->  00:05:31.590
that can help you learn the content
130

130

00:05:31.590  -->  00:05:33.780
of the first few sections.
131

131

00:05:33.780  -->  00:05:37.340
An ebook is good, because it allows you more time
132

132

00:05:37.340  -->  00:05:38.850
to read through and understand it.
133

133

00:05:38.850  -->  00:05:41.417
And also, it provides different explanations
134

134

00:05:41.417  -->  00:05:42.340
than the ones in the videos,
135

135

00:05:42.340  -->  00:05:44.910
so if you want us to explain something in a different way,
136

136

00:05:44.910  -->  00:05:48.600
then reading the ebook can be a great way to achieve that.
137

137

00:05:48.600  -->  00:05:50.050
In addition, the ebook comes
138

138

00:05:50.050  -->  00:05:51.380
with its own programming challenges
139

139

00:05:51.380  -->  00:05:53.330
and programming questions that you can complete,
140

140

00:05:53.330  -->  00:05:54.970
as well, if you want.
141

141

00:05:54.970  -->  00:05:56.070
That's it for this video, though.
142

142

00:05:56.070  -->  00:05:57.460
Thank you for joining me.
143

143

00:05:57.460  -->  00:05:58.700
I hope this has been useful,
144

144

00:05:58.700  -->  00:06:00.350
and I'll see you in the next one.
