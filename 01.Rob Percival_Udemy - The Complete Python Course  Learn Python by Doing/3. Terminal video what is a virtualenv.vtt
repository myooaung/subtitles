00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:01.820
[Instructor] - Hi, and welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01.820  -->  00:00:04.310
In this video we're going to look at installing packages
3

3

00:00:04.310  -->  00:00:06.330
in Python, using the console.
4

4

00:00:07.430  -->  00:00:09.820
At this point, if you don't have Python 3.5
5

5

00:00:10.660  -->  00:00:12.360
or higher installed,
6

6

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:15.260
I recommend that you go and download and instal that now.
7

7

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:18.940
I'd recommend you instal the latest version of Python,
8

8

00:00:18.940  -->  00:00:22.301
that is stable, of the current time of recording that's 3.6,
9

9

00:00:22.301  -->  00:00:25.970
but when you're watching this, maybe 3.7 or later.
10

10

00:00:25.970  -->  00:00:27.590
I recommend you instal that,
11

11

00:00:27.590  -->  00:00:31.480
just because, you know you wanna stay ahead of the curve,
12

12

00:00:31.480  -->  00:00:32.850
you wanna use the latest technologies,
13

13

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:35.358
and taking a course is a great opportunity to adopt
14

14

00:00:35.358  -->  00:00:37.330
a new technology.
15

15

00:00:37.330  -->  00:00:39.520
So I recommend you instal the latest version.
16

16

00:00:39.520  -->  00:00:43.730
And also that's because later version of Python come with,
17

17

00:00:43.730  -->  00:00:46.190
when you instal them, a programme called Pip.
18

18

00:00:47.750  -->  00:00:50.750
That's, Pip like that.
19

19

00:00:50.750  -->  00:00:54.460
Pip is used to instal Python packages.
20

20

00:00:56.198  -->  00:00:57.170
And okay.
21

21

00:00:57.170  -->  00:00:59.790
So, if we do Pip instal,
22

22

00:01:01.010  -->  00:01:03.220
requests for example,
23

23

00:01:03.220  -->  00:01:04.200
what this is gonna do is
24

24

00:01:04.200  -->  00:01:07.630
it's going to go over to various websites,
25

25

00:01:07.630  -->  00:01:08.670
and it's gonna look,
26

26

00:01:08.670  -->  00:01:11.750
and see if it can find a Python package,
27

27

00:01:11.750  -->  00:01:13.580
or a library called requests,
28

28

00:01:13.580  -->  00:01:16.690
and if it can find it, it's gonna instal it.
29

29

00:01:16.690  -->  00:01:19.620
So press Enter, and as you can see I get requirement,
30

30

00:01:19.620  -->  00:01:21.180
already satisfied.
31

31

00:01:21.180  -->  00:01:22.300
That's because
32

32

00:01:22.300  -->  00:01:24.180
I've already installed requests,
33

33

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:26.060
but the fact that it's telling me this,
34

34

00:01:26.060  -->  00:01:27.940
it means that requests exist.
35

35

00:01:27.940  -->  00:01:28.773
So that's good.
36

36

00:01:30.180  -->  00:01:33.230
This is what Python is doing in the background.
37

37

00:01:33.230  -->  00:01:35.650
When you tell it to instal a library.
38

38

00:01:35.650  -->  00:01:37.580
What it's doing is it's doing Pip instal,
39

39

00:01:37.580  -->  00:01:40.190
and then the library, that you ask it to instal.
40

40

00:01:41.420  -->  00:01:43.680
Okay, as you can see the requests library
41

41

00:01:43.680  -->  00:01:47.430
is already installed in this folder here.
42

42

00:01:47.430  -->  00:01:52.430
Usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
43

43

00:01:52.750  -->  00:01:55.500
This tells us that the requests package
44

44

00:01:55.500  -->  00:01:56.750
we tried to instal right now,
45

45

00:01:56.750  -->  00:01:59.830
we tried to instal it for Python 2.7.
46

46

00:01:59.830  -->  00:02:02.260
We did not try to instal it for Python 3.7.
47

47

00:02:03.460  -->  00:02:06.580
If you want to instal for Python 3.7,
48

48

00:02:06.580  -->  00:02:11.290
you'll have to do pip3.7 instal requests
49

49

00:02:12.140  -->  00:02:15.300
if you only have one version of Python installed,
50

50

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:16.950
I, you're using Windows,
51

51

00:02:16.950  -->  00:02:18.030
or maybe Linux,
52

52

00:02:18.030  -->  00:02:20.560
and you don't have multiple versions of Python installed,
53

53

00:02:20.560  -->  00:02:24.510
you only have to do pip instal requests, okay?
54

54

00:02:24.510  -->  00:02:26.239
This is what to do
55

55

00:02:26.239  -->  00:02:28.620
if you only have one version of Python installed.
56

56

00:02:28.620  -->  00:02:32.360
But if you have many, you can do pip3,
57

57

00:02:32.360  -->  00:02:36.550
in order to choose the latest version of Python 3,
58

58

00:02:36.550  -->  00:02:39.850
or pip 3.7, in order to choose Python 3.7,
59

59

00:02:39.850  -->  00:02:41.030
and that's what you're installing.
60

60

00:02:41.030  -->  00:02:44.051
So again, pip3.7 instal requests,
61

61

00:02:44.051  -->  00:02:46.580
and it'll tell me now the requirements are already satisfied
62

62

00:02:46.580  -->  00:02:48.720
but notice how now the location
63

63

00:02:48.720  -->  00:02:52.020
of where it is already satisfied is different.
64

64

00:02:52.020  -->  00:02:54.160
That's because I've installed Python 3.7,
65

65

00:02:55.320  -->  00:02:57.830
in a different way than Python 2.7.
66

66

00:02:57.830  -->  00:02:59.690
Python 2.7 comes with my computer,
67

67

00:02:59.690  -->  00:03:02.730
Python 3.7 I've installed using the official installer.
68

68

00:03:03.840  -->  00:03:08.840
So, this is how you'd instal packages using Pip.
69

69

00:03:09.770  -->  00:03:12.560
And the package we're gonna want to instal now,
70

70

00:03:12.560  -->  00:03:14.780
is one that you may already have, but nonetheless
71

71

00:03:14.780  -->  00:03:17.040
it's a good idea to make sure you've got it,
72

72

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:19.550
is called virtualenv.
73

73

00:03:19.550  -->  00:03:20.850
Now okay, as you can see it tells me
74

74

00:03:20.850  -->  00:03:22.600
that I've already satisfied this,
75

75

00:03:22.600  -->  00:03:24.740
but if you don't have virtualenv installed already,
76

76

00:03:24.740  -->  00:03:26.490
I recommend that you do instal it.
77

77

00:03:27.790  -->  00:03:30.920
When you use this virtualenv package,
78

78

00:03:30.920  -->  00:03:32.170
what you can do,
79

79

00:03:32.170  -->  00:03:35.770
is you can duplicate an existing Python installation.
80

80

00:03:35.770  -->  00:03:38.780
So let's say you've got Python 3.7 installed,
81

81

00:03:38.780  -->  00:03:41.990
you can use virtualenv to make a copy of that.
82

82

00:03:41.990  -->  00:03:45.130
But, without any of the libraries
83

83

00:03:45.130  -->  00:03:46.630
that you've already installed.
84

84

00:03:47.640  -->  00:03:48.620
As you can see,
85

85

00:03:48.620  -->  00:03:51.260
I've got requests already installed in Python 3.7,
86

86

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:56.870
if I create a virtual environment, using Python 3.7,
87

87

00:03:56.870  -->  00:03:59.210
it won't have requests installed.
88

88

00:03:59.210  -->  00:04:00.360
So let's do just now.
89

89

00:04:01.492  -->  00:04:03.950
The way to do that is, by typing virtualenv,
90

90

00:04:03.950  -->  00:04:06.030
then the name of the virtual environment,
91

91

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:11.030
it's normally venv, --python=python3.7
92

92

00:04:12.810  -->  00:04:15.660
Again, instead of Python 3.7, you can type Python,
93

93

00:04:15.660  -->  00:04:18.610
if you only have one version of Python installed.
94

94

00:04:20.600  -->  00:04:24.340
By doing this, I'm saying run the virtualenv programme,
95

95

00:04:24.340  -->  00:04:27.040
which again must be in my path,
96

96

00:04:27.040  -->  00:04:28.980
and these here are two arguments
97

97

00:04:28.980  -->  00:04:30.730
that I'm passing to that programme.
98

98

00:04:30.730  -->  00:04:33.910
And programmes in the terminal can accept arguments.
99

99

00:04:33.910  -->  00:04:36.190
Venv is a first argument,
100

100

00:04:36.190  -->  00:04:40.650
and --python=python3.7 is a second argument.
101

101

00:04:40.650  -->  00:04:43.160
The first argument is the name of the venv,
102

102

00:04:43.160  -->  00:04:44.300
of the virtual environment which is,
103

103

00:04:44.300  -->  00:04:46.240
in this case is gonna be venv.
104

104

00:04:46.240  -->  00:04:50.580
The second argument tells the venv what programme to run,
105

105

00:04:50.580  -->  00:04:51.480
that's Python 3.7,
106

106

00:04:52.490  -->  00:04:55.060
when we are creating the virtual environment,
107

107

00:04:55.060  -->  00:04:58.530
so it's gonna use Python 3.7 for this virtual environment.
108

108

00:04:58.530  -->  00:04:59.630
So let's do just that.
109

109

00:05:01.560  -->  00:05:04.410
Notice how a few things happen, it says it's using the
110

110

00:05:04.410  -->  00:05:05.243
interpreter, Python 3.7,
111

111

00:05:06.551  -->  00:05:08.880
and then it instals a couple of things like setup tools,
112

112

00:05:08.880  -->  00:05:10.200
Pip and wheel,
113

113

00:05:10.200  -->  00:05:12.830
those are few libraries that are very useful for,
114

114

00:05:12.830  -->  00:05:14.960
for installing packages.
115

115

00:05:14.960  -->  00:05:16.050
And then it's done.
116

116

00:05:17.230  -->  00:05:18.390
Now,
117

117

00:05:18.390  -->  00:05:20.530
inside your venv,
118

118

00:05:20.530  -->  00:05:21.980
so what we're gonna do is
119

119

00:05:21.980  -->  00:05:25.670
we're gonna open the current folder in my Explorer,
120

120

00:05:28.673  -->  00:05:31.710
so that you can see exactly what we've got here,
121

121

00:05:34.150  -->  00:05:35.350
let me just bring it up.
122

122

00:05:36.520  -->  00:05:39.750
This is the venv folder that we've just created,
123

123

00:05:39.750  -->  00:05:41.410
we've got a bunch of things.
124

124

00:05:41.410  -->  00:05:44.610
We've got bin, and in here we've got,
125

125

00:05:44.610  -->  00:05:49.400
you know Python, Python 3.7, Python 3, these are all,
126

126

00:05:50.260  -->  00:05:52.680
Python programmes that we can run,
127

127

00:05:52.680  -->  00:05:53.710
you've got Pip,
128

128

00:05:53.710  -->  00:05:55.570
that you can run as well,
129

129

00:05:55.570  -->  00:05:57.900
you've got a programme called activate,
130

130

00:05:57.900  -->  00:05:59.470
if you're using Windows,
131

131

00:05:59.470  -->  00:06:00.680
this may look slightly different,
132

132

00:06:00.680  -->  00:06:02.550
you may have a scripts folder in here,
133

133

00:06:02.550  -->  00:06:03.550
that's totally fine.
134

134

00:06:05.470  -->  00:06:09.490
Now when you type which python3.7,
135

135

00:06:10.740  -->  00:06:13.360
you can see that the Python 3.7 that we're going to run,
136

136

00:06:13.360  -->  00:06:16.850
is still this one inside library frameworks.
137

137

00:06:18.460  -->  00:06:23.460
If we do source .venv/bin/activate
138

138

00:06:25.420  -->  00:06:28.330
and then type which python3.7 again,
139

139

00:06:28.330  -->  00:06:32.600
now you can see that we are using our venv folder,
140

140

00:06:32.600  -->  00:06:35.930
inside we've got bin, and inside we've got Python 3.7.
141

141

00:06:35.930  -->  00:06:38.070
So what we're doing now is we're using a completely
142

142

00:06:38.070  -->  00:06:39.760
different version of Python.
143

143

00:06:39.760  -->  00:06:40.720
Well it's actually the same version,
144

144

00:06:40.720  -->  00:06:44.130
but it says completely different installation of Python.
145

145

00:06:44.130  -->  00:06:47.750
Before we were using this one in our library,
146

146

00:06:47.750  -->  00:06:50.350
now we're using the one in our venv.
147

147

00:06:50.350  -->  00:06:52.190
By the way, if you're using Windows,
148

148

00:06:52.190  -->  00:06:54.950
it won't be source ./venv/bin/activate
149

149

00:06:54.950  -->  00:06:56.680
if you're using Windows,
150

150

00:06:56.680  -->  00:07:01.680
it'll be .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
151

151

00:07:01.870  -->  00:07:05.130
so if you're using Windows, you wanna run this line here,
152

152

00:07:05.130  -->  00:07:06.280
instead of this one.
153

153

00:07:06.280  -->  00:07:07.113
Okay?
154

154

00:07:08.160  -->  00:07:11.360
But I'm not using Windows, so I don't need to do that.
155

155

00:07:11.360  -->  00:07:14.120
You can also see that you've got slash or venv,
156

156

00:07:14.120  -->  00:07:15.470
inside brackets at the start.
157

157

00:07:15.470  -->  00:07:16.303
That tells you
158

158

00:07:16.303  -->  00:07:18.940
that you're currently using this virtual environment.
159

159

00:07:19.960  -->  00:07:20.793
Okay.
160

160

00:07:21.920  -->  00:07:25.140
If you echo the path,
161

161

00:07:25.140  -->  00:07:26.970
you see that now you've got something
162

162

00:07:26.970  -->  00:07:28.500
at the start of the path.
163

163

00:07:28.500  -->  00:07:32.400
/Users/jslvtr/venv/bin
164

164

00:07:32.400  -->  00:07:35.110
Before we had this at the first folder,
165

165

00:07:35.110  -->  00:07:36.664
now we've got this one.
166

166

00:07:36.664  -->  00:07:37.730
So any programmes we try to run
167

167

00:07:37.730  -->  00:07:39.300
are first going to be looked at,
168

168

00:07:39.300  -->  00:07:42.030
inside this venv folder.
169

169

00:07:42.030  -->  00:07:43.380
For example, Python 3.7.
170

170

00:07:45.250  -->  00:07:47.590
This is really powerful, because now,
171

171

00:07:47.590  -->  00:07:48.720
if we type Python 3.7,
172

172

00:07:49.770  -->  00:07:54.080
we're using the Python 3.7 in our virtual environment.
173

173

00:07:54.080  -->  00:07:56.610
If we then type import requests,
174

174

00:07:56.610  -->  00:07:58.930
you can see that it cannot be found.
175

175

00:07:58.930  -->  00:08:00.370
It's not installed.
176

176

00:08:00.370  -->  00:08:02.140
So, if you want to instal requests,
177

177

00:08:02.140  -->  00:08:05.360
now you can do pip instal requests
178

178

00:08:05.360  -->  00:08:06.590
and that's going to instal
179

179

00:08:06.590  -->  00:08:09.940
the requests library inside your virtual environment.
180

180

00:08:11.350  -->  00:08:12.430
If you were then to go
181

181

00:08:12.430  -->  00:08:14.130
and create another virtual environment,
182

182

00:08:14.130  -->  00:08:15.610
and call it something else,
183

183

00:08:15.610  -->  00:08:18.570
it would not have the requests library.
184

184

00:08:18.570  -->  00:08:19.770
So these libraries,
185

185

00:08:19.770  -->  00:08:21.500
when you're using a virtual environment,
186

186

00:08:21.500  -->  00:08:24.960
are only installed within the virtual environment.
187

187

00:08:24.960  -->  00:08:28.790
This is really great because it lets you have
188

188

00:08:28.790  -->  00:08:30.850
different virtual environments each
189

189

00:08:30.850  -->  00:08:34.330
with different versions of the same library potentially.
190

190

00:08:35.250  -->  00:08:37.260
Let's say you just done a project today,
191

191

00:08:37.260  -->  00:08:41.490
and you instal requests version 2.18.4
192

192

00:08:42.828  -->  00:08:43.661
And you know, you develop
193

193

00:08:43.661  -->  00:08:46.180
this project over a period of a few months,
194

194

00:08:46.180  -->  00:08:48.140
or a couple of years,
195

195

00:08:48.140  -->  00:08:51.050
and you'd never update the requests library.
196

196

00:08:51.050  -->  00:08:53.340
But then, you start a new project,
197

197

00:08:53.340  -->  00:08:54.609
and you know,
198

198

00:08:54.609  -->  00:08:56.120
you wanna use the latest version of requests,
199

199

00:08:56.120  -->  00:08:58.530
because maybe they fixed the bug or something,
200

200

00:08:59.700  -->  00:09:00.533
you can do that,
201

201

00:09:00.533  -->  00:09:01.610
you can create a new virtual environment
202

202

00:09:01.610  -->  00:09:03.290
and instal the latest version.
203

203

00:09:03.290  -->  00:09:05.930
And the old project that's using this version,
204

204

00:09:05.930  -->  00:09:08.060
will not be affected.
205

205

00:09:08.060  -->  00:09:11.800
Imagine they've also changed some of the functionality.
206

206

00:09:11.800  -->  00:09:15.230
So that your old project would no longer work.
207

207

00:09:15.230  -->  00:09:16.740
Now you don't have that problem,
208

208

00:09:16.740  -->  00:09:19.700
because each project can have its own independent versions.
209

209

00:09:20.660  -->  00:09:22.320
And by the way, this takes up
210

210

00:09:22.320  -->  00:09:24.450
a few megabytes of your hard drive,
211

211

00:09:24.450  -->  00:09:25.283
and essentially,
212

212

00:09:25.283  -->  00:09:26.640
it's essentially free.
213

213

00:09:26.640  -->  00:09:28.060
It doesn't cost you anything
214

214

00:09:28.060  -->  00:09:30.060
to have multiple virtual environments,
215

215

00:09:30.060  -->  00:09:32.590
I have many Python projects in my computer,
216

216

00:09:32.590  -->  00:09:35.390
each on has its own virtual environment,
217

217

00:09:35.390  -->  00:09:38.130
to keep it separate from every other project.
218

218

00:09:39.100  -->  00:09:40.130
So moving forwards,
219

219

00:09:40.130  -->  00:09:42.650
whenever you start a new project in Python,
220

220

00:09:42.650  -->  00:09:44.980
create a virtual environment for it,
221

221

00:09:44.980  -->  00:09:46.560
and make sure to use that,
222

222

00:09:46.560  -->  00:09:48.660
whenever you're running your applications.
223

223

00:09:50.110  -->  00:09:51.560
Over the rest of the course
224

224

00:09:51.560  -->  00:09:52.990
we're going to be creating virtual environments
225

225

00:09:52.990  -->  00:09:55.180
for projects, just to give you some examples
226

226

00:09:55.180  -->  00:09:56.350
of how this works.
227

227

00:09:57.420  -->  00:09:58.920
Now that you're in your venv though,
228

228

00:09:58.920  -->  00:10:02.510
if you did have some Python files that you want to run,
229

229

00:10:02.510  -->  00:10:03.410
for example,
230

230

00:10:03.410  -->  00:10:05.270
like an app.py or something,
231

231

00:10:05.270  -->  00:10:08.830
all you have to do is type python. App.py,
232

232

00:10:08.830  -->  00:10:11.290
and that's going to run the Python programme in your path,
233

233

00:10:11.290  -->  00:10:14.910
which is Python 3.7, 'cause that's what's in your venv,
234

234

00:10:14.910  -->  00:10:17.870
and then it's gonna run the file app.py,
235

235

00:10:17.870  -->  00:10:20.840
which is presumably the file that starts up your programme.
236

236

00:10:21.950  -->  00:10:25.620
So this is how you would run a specific file with Python,
237

237

00:10:25.620  -->  00:10:27.590
from within your console,
238

238

00:10:27.590  -->  00:10:30.200
and you can do that within a virtual environment.
239

239

00:10:31.040  -->  00:10:34.690
So that's gonna again give separation between your projects,
240

240

00:10:34.690  -->  00:10:37.730
and it's gonna make them a bit more independent.
241

241

00:10:37.730  -->  00:10:39.010
That's it for this video though,
242

242

00:10:39.010  -->  00:10:40.120
it's getting a bit longer now,
243

243

00:10:40.120  -->  00:10:42.000
so let's continue in the next one.
