00:00:00.080  -->  00:00:01.340
<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back!</v>
2

2

00:00:01.340  -->  00:00:03.230
In this video we're going to be looking at
3

3

00:00:03.230  -->  00:00:04.830
our next project.
4

4

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:07.800
Which is going to be a similar scraping project,
5

5

00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:10.360
only using a more complex site,
6

6

00:00:10.360  -->  00:00:12.810
and our project is going to do a few more things.
7

7

00:00:13.980  -->  00:00:15.830
The first thing to do is to think of
8

8

00:00:15.830  -->  00:00:17.400
what we want to scrape,
9

9

00:00:17.400  -->  00:00:19.920
what we want to get out of the site.
10

10

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:20.990
And in this case,
11

11

00:00:20.990  -->  00:00:23.030
our project is going to do a couple of things.
12

12

00:00:23.030  -->  00:00:25.280
But, essentially, we're going to scrape
13

13

00:00:25.280  -->  00:00:27.960
this books website.
14

14

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:29.580
And again, the URL is:
15

15

00:00:29.580  -->  00:00:32.465
books.toscrape.com
16

16

00:00:32.465  -->  00:00:35.400
The toscrape.com site is a collection of websites
17

17

00:00:35.400  -->  00:00:37.410
that we can scrape freely,
18

18

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:39.430
and that have been designed for scraping.
19

19

00:00:39.430  -->  00:00:41.910
So they're good things to try out.
20

20

00:00:43.630  -->  00:00:45.220
And, what we're gonna do in our app
21

21

00:00:45.220  -->  00:00:47.660
is we're going to go through all the books
22

22

00:00:47.660  -->  00:00:48.870
they've got in their collection,
23

23

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:50.900
and we're going to, sort of,
24

24

00:00:50.900  -->  00:00:52.940
filter through them, we're gonna see
25

25

00:00:52.940  -->  00:00:55.180
which ones we can buy based on price,
26

26

00:00:55.180  -->  00:00:56.120
and the number of views,
27

27

00:00:56.120  -->  00:00:57.730
and things like that.
28

28

00:00:57.730  -->  00:01:00.730
Essentially, making a faster
29

29

00:01:00.730  -->  00:01:02.410
and more efficient way
30

30

00:01:02.410  -->  00:01:04.020
of navigating the collection
31

31

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:06.510
in order to find the books that we want to buy.
32

32

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:09.480
So, as you can see,
33

33

00:01:09.480  -->  00:01:11.420
this is the website here on the left,
34

34

00:01:11.420  -->  00:01:13.680
and we've got the inspector on the right.
35

35

00:01:13.680  -->  00:01:15.240
If you want to open the inspector,
36

36

00:01:15.240  -->  00:01:18.540
you can right-click anywhere and press "Inspect."
37

37

00:01:18.540  -->  00:01:19.880
And, what's happening here is
38

38

00:01:19.880  -->  00:01:22.830
that we have 1,000 books in the catalogue
39

39

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:24.450
or the collection,
40

40

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:27.720
and each book is in this format, as we can see.
41

41

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:28.855
We've looked at this before
42

42

00:01:28.855  -->  00:01:30.450
at the start of the section.
43

43

00:01:30.450  -->  00:01:33.700
We sort of investigated how to extract data
44

44

00:01:33.700  -->  00:01:36.370
if we had one of these books only.
45

45

00:01:36.370  -->  00:01:37.600
We're gonna take it a bit further now
46

46

00:01:37.600  -->  00:01:39.830
and scrape the entire page.
47

47

00:01:39.830  -->  00:01:41.550
So we've got all of these books
48

48

00:01:41.550  -->  00:01:42.780
in this format,
49

49

00:01:43.810  -->  00:01:46.160
and if we go to the inspector
50

50

00:01:46.160  -->  00:01:48.870
and we look at the HTML, we can start
51

51

00:01:48.870  -->  00:01:51.750
by finding out the body of the page.
52

52

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:54.600
There we've got a div which contains
53

53

00:01:54.600  -->  00:01:56.660
everything except the header,
54

54

00:01:56.660  -->  00:01:58.070
and then there's a page inner
55

55

00:01:58.070  -->  00:02:00.220
that has essentially all the content
56

56

00:02:00.220  -->  00:02:01.940
and also adds sort of a bit of
57

57

00:02:01.940  -->  00:02:03.140
margins around the corners.
58

58

00:02:03.140  -->  00:02:04.280
You can see that the,
59

59

00:02:04.280  -->  00:02:06.000
this div here
60

60

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:07.470
is slightly bigger than the other one,
61

61

00:02:07.470  -->  00:02:08.670
so all that's happening there
62

62

00:02:08.670  -->  00:02:10.490
is we're constraining the content
63

63

00:02:10.490  -->  00:02:12.190
so that it displays a bit nicer.
64

64

00:02:13.060  -->  00:02:15.070
Then, we've got the breadcrumbs,
65

65

00:02:15.070  -->  00:02:17.970
we've got the row here,
66

66

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:20.680
and then we have the sidebar,
67

67

00:02:20.680  -->  00:02:22.440
which has the different topics.
68

68

00:02:22.440  -->  00:02:25.280
This is something we could scrape if we wanted.
69

69

00:02:25.280  -->  00:02:28.600
And then we're going into the book collection.
70

70

00:02:29.500  -->  00:02:31.850
So, in here we have a few things
71

71

00:02:31.850  -->  00:02:34.830
such as the different results that we've got
72

72

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:36.500
and then there's a section,
73

73

00:02:36.500  -->  00:02:39.740
and in this section we have a div,
74

74

00:02:39.740  -->  00:02:42.584
and that div is the one that contains a
75

75

00:02:42.584  -->  00:02:44.420
"ol" class row,
76

76

00:02:44.420  -->  00:02:47.660
this is an unordered list of the different books
77

77

00:02:47.660  -->  00:02:50.060
and each book is inside
78

78

00:02:50.060  -->  00:02:51.830
a list item element.
79

79

00:02:51.830  -->  00:02:53.870
You can see the visual repeats itself
80

80

00:02:53.870  -->  00:02:56.460
because each book is inside a list item.
81

81

00:02:57.600  -->  00:02:59.330
Notice how the books are not formatted
82

82

00:02:59.330  -->  00:03:01.730
as list items, but nonetheless,
83

83

00:03:01.730  -->  00:03:04.180
with HTML you can essentially
84

84

00:03:04.180  -->  00:03:07.340
display anything you want in any element.
85

85

00:03:07.340  -->  00:03:08.970
So in this case, they're using list items,
86

86

00:03:08.970  -->  00:03:10.430
maybe they thought that was easier
87

87

00:03:10.430  -->  00:03:11.920
for development purposes.
88

88

00:03:11.920  -->  00:03:14.370
Normally, list items would be like bullet points.
89

89

00:03:15.610  -->  00:03:18.090
Now, inside the list item
90

90

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:20.320
is the stuff we already know.
91

91

00:03:20.320  -->  00:03:22.530
An article, which is the "product_pod"
92

92

00:03:22.530  -->  00:03:24.010
that we've seen before,
93

93

00:03:24.010  -->  00:03:26.520
then we've got a div which contains the image,
94

94

00:03:26.520  -->  00:03:28.160
we've got the star-rating,
95

95

00:03:28.160  -->  00:03:29.110
the title,
96

96

00:03:29.110  -->  00:03:30.980
we've got the price in there,
97

97

00:03:30.980  -->  00:03:33.050
as well as the "add to basket" button.
98

98

00:03:34.240  -->  00:03:35.710
So, what we're gonna do is,
99

99

00:03:35.710  -->  00:03:38.570
we're going to, again, create a parser
100

100

00:03:38.570  -->  00:03:40.260
for the books
101

101

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:42.700
that is going to be each list item
102

102

00:03:42.700  -->  00:03:44.010
is gonna be passed into it,
103

103

00:03:44.010  -->  00:03:45.510
and each parser is going to
104

104

00:03:45.510  -->  00:03:47.610
search for the information about that book
105

105

00:03:47.610  -->  00:03:48.760
within itself.
106

106

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:50.933
Okay.
107

107

00:03:50.933  -->  00:03:51.766
So, it's gonna be essentially
108

108

00:03:51.766  -->  00:03:54.340
a copy of the last project
109

109

00:03:54.340  -->  00:03:56.190
with some added functionality,
110

110

00:03:56.190  -->  00:03:58.610
and of course now that we have prices
111

111

00:03:58.610  -->  00:04:00.670
we're gonna use the regular expressions module
112

112

00:04:00.670  -->  00:04:03.070
to get the price out as a number,
113

113

00:04:03.070  -->  00:04:05.140
and we're also going to be dealing with
114

114

00:04:05.140  -->  00:04:08.000
getting the star rating out of there
115

115

00:04:08.000  -->  00:04:11.320
and then doing some sort of sorting and filtering
116

116

00:04:11.320  -->  00:04:12.730
using that star rating.
117

117

00:04:13.800  -->  00:04:15.830
Nonetheless, my advice, as usual,
118

118

00:04:16.820  -->  00:04:18.890
is to, now that we have implemented
119

119

00:04:18.890  -->  00:04:20.920
the, quote, "scraper,"
120

120

00:04:20.920  -->  00:04:23.400
try to implement this project on your own!
121

121

00:04:23.400  -->  00:04:25.280
It's not gonna be easy,
122

122

00:04:25.280  -->  00:04:27.250
but you already know a lot of the things
123

123

00:04:27.250  -->  00:04:29.230
that you need in order to tackle this,
124

124

00:04:29.230  -->  00:04:30.640
and if you structure your project
125

125

00:04:30.640  -->  00:04:33.210
using the pages and scrapers,
126

126

00:04:33.210  -->  00:04:35.710
essentially one page for the,
127

127

00:04:35.710  -->  00:04:36.820
for this entire page
128

128

00:04:36.820  -->  00:04:38.170
and one scraper for the,
129

129

00:04:38.170  -->  00:04:40.510
I'm sorry, one parser for the books,
130

130

00:04:40.510  -->  00:04:42.140
then you should be able to tackle this
131

131

00:04:42.140  -->  00:04:42.973
pretty nicely.
132

132

00:04:42.973  -->  00:04:43.806
And you may not be able to
133

133

00:04:43.806  -->  00:04:45.630
do some of the more advanced things,
134

134

00:04:45.630  -->  00:04:47.110
but you'll be able to do some things,
135

135

00:04:47.110  -->  00:04:48.460
so I definitely recommend
136

136

00:04:48.460  -->  00:04:49.860
you give it a break
137

137

00:04:49.860  -->  00:04:51.550
before moving on to the next video
138

138

00:04:51.550  -->  00:04:53.450
and try to implement this on your own.
139

139

00:04:54.610  -->  00:04:55.443
Okay?
140

140

00:04:55.443  -->  00:04:56.700
So once you've done that,
141

141

00:04:56.700  -->  00:04:58.010
let's move on to the next video,
142

142

00:04:58.010  -->  00:04:59.930
and we'll start implementing it there.
143

143

00:04:59.930  -->  00:05:00.880
I'll see you there.
