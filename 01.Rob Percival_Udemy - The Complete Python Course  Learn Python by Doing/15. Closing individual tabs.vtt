<v Jose>Hi guys and welcome back.</v>

2

00:00:01.730  -->  00:00:03.030 line:15% 
In this video we're going to be
3

3

00:00:03.030  -->  00:00:06.509
closing individual tabs using a shortcut.
4

4

00:00:06.509  -->  00:00:09.323
So let's go ahead and start with that.
5

5

00:00:10.380  -->  00:00:11.520
We're gonna create a function
6

6

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:13.810
called close current tab.
7

7

00:00:13.810  -->  00:00:17.010
So I'm gonna go ahead and implement it here.
8

8

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:19.610
Close current tab.
9

9

00:00:19.610  -->  00:00:22.710
And what it's gonna do, is it's gonna get the current tab.
10

10

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:26.910
So we'll say current is get text widget.
11

11

00:00:26.910  -->  00:00:31.253
And then we'll do notebook, don't forget current.
12

12

00:00:32.130  -->  00:00:34.760
Now let's add a shortcut for this.
13

13

00:00:34.760  -->  00:00:36.540
So in the file menu,
14

14

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:38.350
we're gonna add a shortcut for it
15

15

00:00:38.350  -->  00:00:42.840
so just before exit, we'll do file menu and command.
16

16

00:00:42.840  -->  00:00:46.780
The label is gonna be close tab and
17

17

00:00:46.780  -->  00:00:50.050
the command is gonna be close current tab.
18

18

00:00:50.050  -->  00:00:54.943
And the accelerator is gonna be Ctrl plus Q.
19

19

00:00:56.430  -->  00:00:58.790
Next up, we're also gonna add a shortcut.
20

20

00:00:58.790  -->  00:01:03.120
So we'll do root.bind control-q
21

21

00:01:04.810  -->  00:01:09.253
and the event is close current tab.
22

22

00:01:10.610  -->  00:01:14.360
All right, let's run the app and see what happens.
23

23

00:01:14.360  -->  00:01:18.330
So control Q and the tab is closed.
24

24

00:01:18.330  -->  00:01:20.473
Create new and it comes back.
25

25

00:01:21.340  -->  00:01:23.680
Of course if you do, create multiple tabs,
26

26

00:01:23.680  -->  00:01:25.530
you can then close them individually.
27

27

00:01:26.930  -->  00:01:31.930
Now if the tab is unsaved, you want to be able
28

28

00:01:32.270  -->  00:01:35.280
to tell the user that they have unsaved changes
29

29

00:01:35.280  -->  00:01:37.664
and they probably shouldn't close
30

30

00:01:37.664  -->  00:01:38.980
the tab until they save them.
31

31

00:01:38.980  -->  00:01:40.680
So let's do that first of all.
32

32

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:45.680
We would say, if the current tab is unsaved,
33

33

00:01:45.885  -->  00:01:50.885
and the confirm close then we will do notebook forget.
34

34

00:01:51.860  -->  00:01:54.010
So two functions here that don't exist
35

35

00:01:54.010  -->  00:01:55.840
that we have to implement.
36

36

00:01:55.840  -->  00:01:59.260
So let's go ahead and do current tab unsaved.
37

37

00:01:59.260  -->  00:02:00.160
What this is going to do,
38

38

00:02:00.160  -->  00:02:03.570
is it's going to get the current text widget.
39

39

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:06.330
So we'll say text widget is get text widget.
40

40

00:02:06.330  -->  00:02:07.880
Then it's gonna get the content
41

41

00:02:09.037  -->  00:02:10.770
and finally its going to see whether
42

42

00:02:10.770  -->  00:02:13.880
it matches the stuff in the dictionary.
43

43

00:02:13.880  -->  00:02:16.610
So we'll say return hash of content
44

44

00:02:17.600  -->  00:02:22.600
is different from text contents str text widget.
45

45

00:02:24.304  -->  00:02:26.270
So if this returns true,
46

46

00:02:26.270  -->  00:02:28.123
this tab is unsaved.
47

47

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:32.870
Next up, let's do a confirm close.
48

48

00:02:32.870  -->  00:02:36.807
So this is gonna do return messagebox.askyesno
49

49

00:02:36.807  -->  00:02:39.950
and it's going to contain the stuff
50

50

00:02:39.950  -->  00:02:41.473
that we have down here.
51

51

00:02:42.897  -->  00:02:45.290
I just gonna make it a little bit more generic
52

52

00:02:45.290  -->  00:02:49.950
and by saying that you've got unsaved changes
53

53

00:02:49.950  -->  00:02:52.863
and call it closed.
54

54

00:02:54.100  -->  00:02:56.930
All right, so what we've got here now is this logic.
55

55

00:02:56.930  -->  00:02:58.950
If the current tab is unsaved,
56

56

00:02:58.950  -->  00:03:01.160
which means we need to save it,
57

57

00:03:01.160  -->  00:03:04.310
and we confirm that we do want to close
58

58

00:03:04.310  -->  00:03:07.160
then we will forget the current tab.
59

59

00:03:07.160  -->  00:03:09.600
But there's a piece of logic missing.
60

60

00:03:09.600  -->  00:03:13.270
What if the current tab is not unsaved.
61

61

00:03:13.270  -->  00:03:16.220
What if the current tab is actually all right to be closed?
62

62

00:03:16.220  -->  00:03:20.630
Well at no point in this function would we close that tab.
63

63

00:03:20.630  -->  00:03:22.483
So we want to do the following,
64

64

00:03:23.899  -->  00:03:26.920
which is that we wanna invert this confirm close.
65

65

00:03:26.920  -->  00:03:31.310
The current tab is unsaved and not confirm close.
66

66

00:03:31.310  -->  00:03:33.990
Then we will just return.
67

67

00:03:33.990  -->  00:03:36.743
Otherwise we will forget the tab.
68

68

00:03:37.770  -->  00:03:39.950
Okay, it's important to test your application
69

69

00:03:39.950  -->  00:03:42.820
and make sure to verify the different scenarios
70

70

00:03:42.820  -->  00:03:45.700
to make sure that you don't miss out on any important logic.
71

71

00:03:45.700  -->  00:03:47.930
Like we almost did here.
72

72

00:03:47.930  -->  00:03:50.350
Next up, we wanna fix another problem.
73

73

00:03:50.350  -->  00:03:52.871
Which is that if I run the application
74

74

00:03:52.871  -->  00:03:54.830
and I run this tab, you can see that
75

75

00:03:54.830  -->  00:03:57.440
we've got a pretty ugly window here.
76

76

00:03:57.440  -->  00:03:59.520
So let's create an empty file
77

77

00:03:59.520  -->  00:04:01.423
if we don't have any left.
78

78

00:04:03.173  -->  00:04:08.173
So we'll say, if the len of notebook.tabs is 1.
79

79

00:04:10.150  -->  00:04:12.830
That is before we forget the current tab,
80

80

00:04:12.830  -->  00:04:15.493
then we're going to create a new one.
81

81

00:04:17.010  -->  00:04:19.580
All right, let's press play now.
82

82

00:04:19.580  -->  00:04:22.908
And you can see that as we press control Q
83

83

00:04:22.908  -->  00:04:24.701
which I am doing, promise.
84

84

00:04:24.701  -->  00:04:26.469
Then this stays there.
85

85

00:04:26.469  -->  00:04:29.543
That's because we are creating new ones.
86

86

00:04:30.540  -->  00:04:32.430
Okay, let's press control Q now
87

87

00:04:32.430  -->  00:04:34.690
and you can see that we get this message box.
88

88

00:04:34.690  -->  00:04:37.696
You have unsaved changes and you should go in and close.
89

89

00:04:37.696  -->  00:04:39.960
And we're gonna say no and it stays.
90

90

00:04:39.960  -->  00:04:42.960
We're gonna press yes and it goes away and we get a new one.
91

91

00:04:44.520  -->  00:04:47.120
Going down to the confirm quit.
92

92

00:04:47.120  -->  00:04:48.430
Here what we're gonna do is
93

93

00:04:48.430  -->  00:04:50.900
we are going to use our function.
94

94

00:04:50.900  -->  00:04:55.900
So we say, not and not confirm close.
95

95

00:04:56.580  -->  00:04:58.680
Then we will return.
96

96

00:04:58.680  -->  00:05:01.300
So just making use of those confirm close function
97

97

00:05:01.300  -->  00:05:03.950
that we defined above made it a bit more generic
98

98

00:05:03.950  -->  00:05:06.140
so that we could use it in both closing a tab,
99

99

00:05:06.140  -->  00:05:07.650
and closing the application
100

100

00:05:07.650  -->  00:05:09.730
and that makes our code a little bit cleaner,
101

101

00:05:09.730  -->  00:05:11.910
a little bit shorter as well.
102

102

00:05:11.910  -->  00:05:13.520
That's everything for this video.
103

103

00:05:13.520  -->  00:05:14.820
Thank you for joining me.
104

104

00:05:14.820  -->  00:05:16.686
I hope you've learned something
105

105

00:05:16.686  -->  00:05:17.763
and I'll see you in the next one.
