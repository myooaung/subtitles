<v Jose>Hi there and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,797  -->  00:00:02,963
In this video we're looking at how to
3

3

00:00:02,963  -->  00:00:05,504
get data out of multiple pages.
4

4

00:00:05,504  -->  00:00:07,351
So the most important thing is for us
5

5

00:00:07,351  -->  00:00:10,127
to look at what the different pages looks like
6

6

00:00:10,127  -->  00:00:12,652
and how we can go to them.
7

7

00:00:12,652  -->  00:00:15,438
Any patterns you can recognise from doing this
8

8

00:00:15,438  -->  00:00:18,590
are going to help you so much in your programming.
9

9

00:00:18,590  -->  00:00:21,563
As you can see, the url right now of this page
10

10

00:00:21,563  -->  00:00:24,063
is books dot toscrape dot com.
11

11

00:00:26,320  -->  00:00:29,730
If we go down to the bottom and we go to the next page,
12

12

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:32,265
which by the way, there are 50 of them.
13

13

00:00:32,265  -->  00:00:35,104
This is gonna be an important number later on.
14

14

00:00:35,104  -->  00:00:38,264
You can see that the url changes.
15

15

00:00:38,264  -->  00:00:43,141
And it changes to slash catalogue slash page dash two.
16

16

00:00:43,141  -->  00:00:46,141
But before it was not page dash one.
17

17

00:00:47,186  -->  00:00:49,350
So we can see that we've gone to page dash two
18

18

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:50,979
and if we go over to the next page,
19

19

00:00:50,979  -->  00:00:53,364
it'll be page dash three and so forth.
20

20

00:00:53,364  -->  00:00:56,938
So what happens if we go to the first page?
21

21

00:00:56,938  -->  00:00:58,754
This is the same page that we were seeing
22

22

00:00:58,754  -->  00:01:00,360
earlier on at the start.
23

23

00:01:00,360  -->  00:01:05,330
But now it has slash catalogue slash page dash one dot html.
24

24

00:01:05,330  -->  00:01:08,580
That means that the home page is either
25

25

00:01:10,421  -->  00:01:14,737
the catalogue slash page one, or it can be just
26

26

00:01:14,737  -->  00:01:17,171
books dot toscrape dot com.
27

27

00:01:17,171  -->  00:01:19,555
Because all the pages can be accessed at
28

28

00:01:19,555  -->  00:01:21,637
slash catalogue slash page dash one
29

29

00:01:21,637  -->  00:01:23,862
this could be helpful for us in extracting
30

30

00:01:23,862  -->  00:01:25,612
all the data we need.
31

31

00:01:26,477  -->  00:01:30,044
Now okay, the next thing is if you want to go
32

32

00:01:30,044  -->  00:01:31,847
to the next page, all you have to do
33

33

00:01:31,847  -->  00:01:33,751
is request a different url.
34

34

00:01:33,751  -->  00:01:35,442
You don't have to click the button.
35

35

00:01:35,442  -->  00:01:36,943
You don't have to make Python click buttons
36

36

00:01:36,943  -->  00:01:37,938
or anything like that.
37

37

00:01:37,938  -->  00:01:40,265
Not that that would work, you can't do that
38

38

00:01:40,265  -->  00:01:42,130
with the knowledge we've got.
39

39

00:01:42,130  -->  00:01:45,096
But you can request a different url entirely.
40

40

00:01:45,096  -->  00:01:47,245
So if you want to get data from 50 pages,
41

41

00:01:47,245  -->  00:01:50,336
which is what we've got, you just have to do
42

42

00:01:50,336  -->  00:01:54,014
a for loop 50 times and each time get all the books
43

43

00:01:54,014  -->  00:01:57,339
out of the page and put them into a list.
44

44

00:01:57,339  -->  00:01:59,289
And at the end you'll end up with a big list
45

45

00:01:59,289  -->  00:02:00,907
of all your books.
46

46

00:02:00,907  -->  00:02:04,146
I'd recommend you try this out now
47

47

00:02:04,146  -->  00:02:07,847
and then we're going to implement this a bit better
48

48

00:02:07,847  -->  00:02:12,597
and we're also going to look at how to extract the 50
49

49

00:02:12,597  -->  00:02:16,258
from this place here so that if the number of pages changes,
50

50

00:02:16,258  -->  00:02:18,768
you're only going to get or you're going to get
51

51

00:02:18,768  -->  00:02:23,440
all of the pages or less pages if there are fewer pages.
52

52

00:02:23,440  -->  00:02:25,302
Okay, that's it for this video.
53

53

00:02:25,302  -->  00:02:26,926
Go and try to implement this.
54

54

00:02:26,926  -->  00:02:30,179
Get the 50 pages by calling this url
55

55

00:02:30,179  -->  00:02:32,889
instead of the url we've got right now
56

56

00:02:32,889  -->  00:02:35,511
and then we'll go and implement this ourselves.
57

57

00:02:35,511  -->  00:02:37,678
See you on the next video.
