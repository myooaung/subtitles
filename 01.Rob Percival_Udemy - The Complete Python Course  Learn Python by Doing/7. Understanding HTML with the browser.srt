<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:04,730
In this video, we're talking about how to see the HTML
3

3

00:00:04,730  -->  00:00:08,530
using your browser so that you'll know how to scrape it,
4

4

00:00:08,530  -->  00:00:11,380
and how to parse it, and how to understand it.
5

5

00:00:11,380  -->  00:00:15,600
What I've got here is this website books.toscrape.com.
6

6

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:20,010
Which is a website that was specifically designed
7

7

00:00:20,010  -->  00:00:22,240
for practising scraping.
8

8

00:00:22,240  -->  00:00:26,820
Scraping is the act of loading a page using Python,
9

9

00:00:26,820  -->  00:00:30,670
or another programming language and extracting data from it.
10

10

00:00:31,660  -->  00:00:34,210
So this page was designed for scraping,
11

11

00:00:34,210  -->  00:00:36,300
which means you're free to use it for scraping,
12

12

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:39,380
practise it, give it a go and see what happens.
13

13

00:00:40,460  -->  00:00:43,040
Now before you even think of
14

14

00:00:43,040  -->  00:00:46,850
downloading the page using Python, you have to understand
15

15

00:00:46,850  -->  00:00:49,150
what's going on in a browser.
16

16

00:00:49,150  -->  00:00:51,040
Because what's going on in Python is very similar
17

17

00:00:51,040  -->  00:00:52,590
to what goes on in the browser.
18

18

00:00:53,440  -->  00:00:55,640
So whenever your browser loads a page,
19

19

00:00:55,640  -->  00:00:59,120
such as if you go to books.toscrape.com,
20

20

00:00:59,120  -->  00:01:01,420
it's actually downloading the page.
21

21

00:01:01,420  -->  00:01:04,920
It's asking the place where the page is hosted,
22

22

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:07,020
where the page lives.
23

23

00:01:07,020  -->  00:01:09,780
Then it's asking to download the data in it.
24

24

00:01:09,780  -->  00:01:11,610
It doesn't store the page in your downloads
25

25

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:12,770
or anything like that.
26

26

00:01:12,770  -->  00:01:15,420
But the page is downloaded so the browser can use it.
27

27

00:01:16,446  -->  00:01:19,640
And we can also get Python to download a page
28

28

00:01:19,640  -->  00:01:22,890
and that gives Python the ability to look at the code,
29

29

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:25,400
and look at the HTML, look at the page content,
30

30

00:01:25,400  -->  00:01:26,410
to see what's there.
31

31

00:01:27,350  -->  00:01:29,440
We can load an HTML page with Python
32

32

00:01:29,440  -->  00:01:32,140
and that will give us the HTML as a string.
33

33

00:01:32,140  -->  00:01:35,420
And then we can parse it and we can extract data from it.
34

34

00:01:35,420  -->  00:01:38,240
The act of doing all of that, from downloading the page,
35

35

00:01:38,240  -->  00:01:40,470
to extracting data, is called scraping.
36

36

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:44,210
So when you load the page using your browser,
37

37

00:01:44,210  -->  00:01:46,750
I recommend using Google Chrome for this, by the way.
38

38

00:01:46,750  -->  00:01:49,510
If you don't have Google Chrome I advise using Chrome.
39

39

00:01:49,510  -->  00:01:52,900
It's the best browser for web development generally.
40

40

00:01:53,910  -->  00:01:57,830
You can select or find what you want to extract.
41

41

00:01:57,830  -->  00:02:00,810
So imagine you wanted to use Python to get the price,
42

42

00:02:02,120  -->  00:02:04,960
then what you would do is you would right click,
43

43

00:02:04,960  -->  00:02:06,910
and you would press inspect.
44

44

00:02:08,950  -->  00:02:11,960
What you then get is this side window.
45

45

00:02:11,960  -->  00:02:13,350
It could be at the bottom,
46

46

00:02:13,350  -->  00:02:16,550
or it could be in an entirely separate window.
47

47

00:02:16,550  -->  00:02:19,380
But you get something that looks a lot like this
48

48

00:02:19,380  -->  00:02:22,780
and what you've got here on the left is,
49

49

00:02:22,780  -->  00:02:26,210
I'm going to just make it a bit bigger for you guys to see.
50

50

00:02:26,210  -->  00:02:29,800
What you've got here on the left, this is the right,
51

51

00:02:29,800  -->  00:02:31,610
this is the left, and here you've got
52

52

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:34,060
some extra things at the bottom.
53

53

00:02:34,060  -->  00:02:36,890
What you've got here is the HTML of the page.
54

54

00:02:36,890  -->  00:02:39,530
This is the entirety of the page content.
55

55

00:02:40,640  -->  00:02:43,280
As you can see it starts up here with HTML
56

56

00:02:45,140  -->  00:02:47,540
and then you've got the head tag,
57

57

00:02:47,540  -->  00:02:50,750
you've got the body tag, that has the main set of content.
58

58

00:02:51,620  -->  00:02:54,430
You've got a header, which is a HTML tag
59

59

00:02:54,430  -->  00:02:57,130
for sort of the top of the page,
60

60

00:02:57,130  -->  00:03:00,350
and then you've got a lot of different nested components.
61

61

00:03:00,350  -->  00:03:03,920
You've got a div, which is just a block of content.
62

62

00:03:03,920  -->  00:03:06,820
That div has another block of content
63

63

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:10,120
and that has some sort of list.
64

64

00:03:10,120  -->  00:03:12,860
UL stands for unordered list.
65

65

00:03:12,860  -->  00:03:16,440
And that's this up here, this breadcrumbs,
66

66

00:03:16,440  -->  00:03:19,130
that's the page you're currently at.
67

67

00:03:19,130  -->  00:03:21,730
You've then got another div, on the inside.
68

68

00:03:21,730  -->  00:03:23,280
You've got sort of a bunch of other things.
69

69

00:03:23,280  -->  00:03:24,560
You can use Google Chrome here
70

70

00:03:24,560  -->  00:03:27,220
to very easily see what each element is.
71

71

00:03:27,220  -->  00:03:30,150
For example, this aside here is the sort of
72

72

00:03:30,150  -->  00:03:32,210
left hand bit that has the navigation,
73

73

00:03:32,210  -->  00:03:34,800
different types of books you can look at,
74

74

00:03:34,800  -->  00:03:35,950
and then you've got this one here
75

75

00:03:35,950  -->  00:03:38,950
that is the rest of the page.
76

76

00:03:38,950  -->  00:03:41,080
So if you could only see this,
77

77

00:03:42,010  -->  00:03:44,100
and you wanted to get the price,
78

78

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:45,650
You would sort of hover over here
79

79

00:03:45,650  -->  00:03:48,620
and find out this blue section.
80

80

00:03:48,620  -->  00:03:50,840
This is where, what you're interested in
81

81

00:03:50,840  -->  00:03:52,750
is inside this section.
82

82

00:03:52,750  -->  00:03:56,070
Then you would sort of go in and you would find this div.
83

83

00:03:56,070  -->  00:03:57,390
You'd then see this UL,
84

84

00:03:57,390  -->  00:04:00,810
but what you're interested in is not in here.
85

85

00:04:00,810  -->  00:04:04,230
So you'd look at this div, the price is inside this div
86

86

00:04:04,230  -->  00:04:06,190
because it's inside the blue area.
87

87

00:04:07,300  -->  00:04:09,040
Then you'd look at this side,
88

88

00:04:09,040  -->  00:04:12,230
the blue thing doesn't include the price,
89

89

00:04:12,230  -->  00:04:14,300
so it's probably not inside here.
90

90

00:04:14,300  -->  00:04:17,000
Then you'd find this div, and this div
91

91

00:04:17,000  -->  00:04:20,560
does contain the price, so then you could go into it
92

92

00:04:20,560  -->  00:04:23,530
by opening it up and sort of navigate that way
93

93

00:04:23,530  -->  00:04:26,600
until you find the section that you're interested in.
94

94

00:04:26,600  -->  00:04:29,830
So you'd find the section, then you'd find this div,
95

95

00:04:29,830  -->  00:04:33,460
then that, then this list item, this article,
96

96

00:04:33,460  -->  00:04:35,500
and then you've got there the price eventually.
97

97

00:04:35,500  -->  00:04:37,410
And then you can find it.
98

98

00:04:37,410  -->  00:04:40,610
So what we found here is essentially
99

99

00:04:40,610  -->  00:04:44,093
the hierarchy of elements that end up containing
100

100

00:04:44,093  -->  00:04:46,800
the thing that we're interested in.
101

101

00:04:46,800  -->  00:04:51,800
So as you can see, we've got the P that contains the price
102

102

00:04:52,150  -->  00:04:54,370
and that's inside a div, which is inside an article
103

103

00:04:54,370  -->  00:04:55,670
and so forth.
104

104

00:04:55,670  -->  00:04:57,420
So this is going to be really important
105

105

00:04:57,420  -->  00:04:58,730
for you to be able to understand
106

106

00:04:58,730  -->  00:05:00,380
the HTML when you download it.
107

107

00:05:02,200  -->  00:05:04,930
The interesting thing is also that you can see
108

108

00:05:04,930  -->  00:05:07,400
that there are a lot of similar elements.
109

109

00:05:07,400  -->  00:05:10,460
And that's one for each book in the page.
110

110

00:05:10,460  -->  00:05:12,810
You can see that as I hover over these,
111

111

00:05:12,810  -->  00:05:14,590
different books get selected.
112

112

00:05:15,480  -->  00:05:17,510
And each of these elements is one book.
113

113

00:05:17,510  -->  00:05:19,100
So if you wanted to load the price of
114

114

00:05:19,100  -->  00:05:20,930
all elements on the site,
115

115

00:05:20,930  -->  00:05:23,070
once you've managed to download the HTML,
116

116

00:05:23,070  -->  00:05:25,240
which we will look at soon,
117

117

00:05:25,240  -->  00:05:28,880
all you have to do is find each LI element
118

118

00:05:28,880  -->  00:05:32,352
with these classes here and that's going to give you
119

119

00:05:32,352  -->  00:05:33,950
all the books.
120

120

00:05:33,950  -->  00:05:36,790
Well, it will give you at tag objects
121

121

00:05:36,790  -->  00:05:39,720
in Beautiful Soup for each of the books.
122

122

00:05:39,720  -->  00:05:41,460
Then, for each of the books you could
123

123

00:05:41,460  -->  00:05:43,010
pass it to the class that we created
124

124

00:05:43,010  -->  00:05:46,080
and parse the price out, and the name and so forth.
125

125

00:05:46,080  -->  00:05:48,553
So you could then start working with these books
126

126

00:05:48,553  -->  00:05:51,320
in Python as opposed to in HTML.
127

127

00:05:53,990  -->  00:05:58,680
Okay, now when you want to get the data out
128

128

00:05:58,680  -->  00:06:00,220
and use it from within Python,
129

129

00:06:00,220  -->  00:06:03,460
it's not enough to load it in your browser.
130

130

00:06:03,460  -->  00:06:06,500
Of course you have to get Python to do it.
131

131

00:06:06,500  -->  00:06:08,550
And in order to do that, we're going to instal
132

132

00:06:08,550  -->  00:06:11,090
another library called requests
133

133

00:06:11,090  -->  00:06:13,580
that is used to essentially request
134

134

00:06:13,580  -->  00:06:16,650
some data from a page and download it.
135

135

00:06:16,650  -->  00:06:19,520
So that you can then use it, or look at it,
136

136

00:06:19,520  -->  00:06:21,810
or print it out, or anything you want.
137

137

00:06:21,810  -->  00:06:24,440
So that library will be used to get the page contents,
138

138

00:06:24,440  -->  00:06:28,580
this HTML, and then we will use Beautiful Soup
139

139

00:06:28,580  -->  00:06:31,410
to understand that and extract the data.
140

140

00:06:31,410  -->  00:06:33,410
Lets look at that in the very next video.
141

141

00:06:33,410  -->  00:06:34,510
So I'll see you there.
