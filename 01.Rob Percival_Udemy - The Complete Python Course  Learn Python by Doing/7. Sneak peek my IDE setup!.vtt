00:00:00.280  -->  00:00:01.640
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.640  -->  00:00:03.600
In this video, as we're approaching the end
3

3

00:00:03.600  -->  00:00:06.385
of the course, I wanted to show you a bit more
4

4

00:00:06.385  -->  00:00:09.900
how I work on my day to day.
5

5

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:12.560
What you have seen so far is me working with
6

6

00:00:12.560  -->  00:00:17.110
a setup that is, I think, quite good for recording
7

7

00:00:17.110  -->  00:00:20.520
but you've not seen the actual way that I work
8

8

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:22.240
at my computer every day.
9

9

00:00:22.240  -->  00:00:23.340
So I thought it may be interesting
10

10

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:27.410
to show you how I go about doing my job
11

11

00:00:27.410  -->  00:00:29.920
just in case you want to replicate some of these things
12

12

00:00:29.920  -->  00:00:31.370
if you find them interesting.
13

13

00:00:32.270  -->  00:00:35.520
Now, normally you'll see me and many other
14

14

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:39.430
software engineers coding with a dark theme.
15

15

00:00:39.430  -->  00:00:42.630
This is a white theme and it,
16

16

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:44.220
right now it says, it's getting a bit late
17

17

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:46.310
you can see the time up on the top right
18

18

00:00:46.310  -->  00:00:47.960
it's half eight at night,
19

19

00:00:47.960  -->  00:00:49.610
using a white theme at this time of the day
20

20

00:00:49.610  -->  00:00:52.710
is actually not the nicest thing to use
21

21

00:00:52.710  -->  00:00:54.750
so I normally use a dark theme
22

22

00:00:54.750  -->  00:00:57.200
and I find it's just a bit more readable
23

23

00:00:57.200  -->  00:00:59.190
and also I just find the colours,
24

24

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:00.110
I said that very weirdly,
25

25

00:01:00.110  -->  00:01:02.420
I find the colours pop a bit more
26

26

00:01:02.420  -->  00:01:04.860
so things like key words and things like that
27

27

00:01:04.860  -->  00:01:06.740
are just a bit more visible when you're using
28

28

00:01:06.740  -->  00:01:09.140
a dark theme, so what I normally do
29

29

00:01:09.140  -->  00:01:11.850
is I have a different theme.
30

30

00:01:11.850  -->  00:01:13.410
Now you can see that the theme here
31

31

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:16.083
is default in PyCharm when I open the settings
32

32

00:01:16.083  -->  00:01:17.830
and you go to appearance,
33

33

00:01:17.830  -->  00:01:19.690
you normally, I normally use in PyCharm
34

34

00:01:19.690  -->  00:01:21.958
a Darcula theme so you can apply that
35

35

00:01:21.958  -->  00:01:24.107
and then you can see immediately
36

36

00:01:24.107  -->  00:01:28.840
that we have sort of changed quite a bit.
37

37

00:01:28.840  -->  00:01:31.830
We are now in a dark mode,
38

38

00:01:31.830  -->  00:01:33.420
you can see the font has changed as well
39

39

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:34.540
and you probably can't see it as well
40

40

00:01:34.540  -->  00:01:36.000
'cause it's much smaller.
41

41

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:39.310
Of course when I'm recording I use a huge font
42

42

00:01:39.310  -->  00:01:41.320
just so you guys can see it very easily
43

43

00:01:41.320  -->  00:01:44.143
but when I'm working I don't use a huge font like that.
44

44

00:01:45.130  -->  00:01:47.430
But let's go over to the preferences once again
45

45

00:01:47.430  -->  00:01:51.200
and I'll show you what I do use in the editor
46

46

00:01:51.200  -->  00:01:52.543
and in font.
47

47

00:01:54.235  -->  00:01:57.860
So in the colour scheme here, you can see
48

48

00:01:57.860  -->  00:02:01.280
that I've got my own custom scheme which
49

49

00:02:01.280  -->  00:02:03.477
is called Darcula_Jose, that's just for me
50

50

00:02:03.477  -->  00:02:07.289
and in here, I've overwritten quite a few things.
51

51

00:02:07.289  -->  00:02:10.280
In code, possibly,
52

52

00:02:10.280  -->  00:02:12.920
let me go and find it again,
53

53

00:02:12.920  -->  00:02:15.590
font, here, oh there you go,
54

54

00:02:15.590  -->  00:02:17.110
colour scheme font.
55

55

00:02:17.110  -->  00:02:20.140
I'm using frequently I use a font called
56

56

00:02:20.140  -->  00:02:22.830
Essential PragmataPro, that depends
57

57

00:02:22.830  -->  00:02:25.310
or whether I use this font or not
58

58

00:02:25.310  -->  00:02:27.503
depends on the size of my screen
59

59

00:02:27.503  -->  00:02:31.341
so I don't actually use PyCharm all that often
60

60

00:02:31.341  -->  00:02:33.840
when I'm working at this computer,
61

61

00:02:33.840  -->  00:02:36.360
I use it all the time at work
62

62

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:38.328
but when I'm working at this computer at home,
63

63

00:02:38.328  -->  00:02:40.370
I've stopped using PyCharm a bit more
64

64

00:02:40.370  -->  00:02:41.820
just 'cause it's a bit too heavy duty
65

65

00:02:41.820  -->  00:02:44.709
for the things I do when I'm in my free time.
66

66

00:02:44.709  -->  00:02:48.247
So if I'm using a small screen,
67

67

00:02:48.247  -->  00:02:50.620
like a laptop which I frequently do
68

68

00:02:51.530  -->  00:02:53.440
I'll use Essential PragmataPro.
69

69

00:02:53.440  -->  00:02:56.250
Essential PragmataPro is a paid font
70

70

00:02:56.250  -->  00:02:59.950
but I find it really readable when it's small
71

71

00:02:59.950  -->  00:03:02.010
and also because it's a skinny font
72

72

00:03:02.010  -->  00:03:05.080
it's taller than it is wide,
73

73

00:03:05.080  -->  00:03:07.730
it is very good for small screen,
74

74

00:03:07.730  -->  00:03:10.260
you can fit more characters on a small screen
75

75

00:03:10.260  -->  00:03:11.890
and you can still read it nicely.
76

76

00:03:11.890  -->  00:03:14.960
So Essential PragmataPro paid font,
77

77

00:03:14.960  -->  00:03:17.620
but very nice for small screens.
78

78

00:03:17.620  -->  00:03:19.970
When I'm using a larger screen like I am doing right now
79

79

00:03:19.970  -->  00:03:22.558
for recording, I would actually not use
80

80

00:03:22.558  -->  00:03:24.750
Essential PragmataPro, I would use Fira Code
81

81

00:03:24.750  -->  00:03:28.200
so this is the font I use normally on my day to day
82

82

00:03:28.200  -->  00:03:29.570
when I am at home.
83

83

00:03:29.570  -->  00:03:32.360
So if we apply that, you can see that it looks
84

84

00:03:32.360  -->  00:03:34.020
a bit different.
85

85

00:03:34.020  -->  00:03:37.190
Now one of the reasons I've stopped using PyCharm
86

86

00:03:37.190  -->  00:03:39.509
at home is because it's too heavy duty
87

87

00:03:39.509  -->  00:03:42.100
and another reason is that this font
88

88

00:03:42.100  -->  00:03:44.610
just looks a little bit weird in my eyes
89

89

00:03:44.610  -->  00:03:46.020
the spacing between the letters
90

90

00:03:46.020  -->  00:03:48.660
is a bit too much and in PyCharm
91

91

00:03:48.660  -->  00:03:51.010
you cannot actually change that
92

92

00:03:51.010  -->  00:03:52.520
which is a little bit annoying.
93

93

00:03:52.520  -->  00:03:54.360
PyCharm does have the tendency of adding
94

94

00:03:54.360  -->  00:03:55.910
too much space between letters.
95

95

00:03:57.230  -->  00:04:00.280
So I'll go into, in a moment what I do
96

96

00:04:00.280  -->  00:04:01.213
to avoid that.
97

97

00:04:02.360  -->  00:04:04.128
So this is a font that I normally use,
98

98

00:04:04.128  -->  00:04:05.570
feel free to use that,
99

99

00:04:05.570  -->  00:04:07.750
Fira Code is a free font, you can download it
100

100

00:04:07.750  -->  00:04:10.440
and you can use it, it's up to you.
101

101

00:04:10.440  -->  00:04:12.100
One of the good things about Fira Code
102

102

00:04:12.100  -->  00:04:14.750
is the font ligatures so if you want to enable
103

103

00:04:14.750  -->  00:04:16.850
them just press enable font ligatures
104

104

00:04:16.850  -->  00:04:19.260
and then you can press okay and then you'll
105

105

00:04:19.260  -->  00:04:21.640
get a few things that change in the font,
106

106

00:04:21.640  -->  00:04:24.435
for example if you type equal greater than
107

107

00:04:24.435  -->  00:04:26.470
you'll get this little arrow instead
108

108

00:04:26.470  -->  00:04:28.580
of two separate symbols.
109

109

00:04:28.580  -->  00:04:31.020
Similarly, if you type a greater than or equal to
110

110

00:04:31.020  -->  00:04:33.450
in Python, so that's these two characters together,
111

111

00:04:33.450  -->  00:04:36.300
you get this mathematical symbol for greater than
112

112

00:04:36.300  -->  00:04:39.010
or equal to, so I quite like the symbols,
113

113

00:04:39.010  -->  00:04:41.690
some people don't like them so Fira Code
114

114

00:04:41.690  -->  00:04:44.811
does that for you if you enable the font ligatures
115

115

00:04:44.811  -->  00:04:47.610
and if that's something you wanna do,
116

116

00:04:47.610  -->  00:04:49.113
you can use this font as well.
117

117

00:04:50.370  -->  00:04:53.290
And the other things are the language defaults,
118

118

00:04:53.290  -->  00:04:55.650
sort of the colours for things.
119

119

00:04:55.650  -->  00:04:57.650
And I've modified some of these colours
120

120

00:04:58.671  -->  00:05:00.090
so that keywords are orange,
121

121

00:05:00.090  -->  00:05:02.880
I just find them, they pop much more easily
122

122

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:04.820
and they're very readable like that
123

123

00:05:04.820  -->  00:05:06.420
and of course a few other changes
124

124

00:05:06.420  -->  00:05:09.330
here as well, like the underlines and so forth.
125

125

00:05:09.330  -->  00:05:11.940
Feel free to change these to match your own style
126

126

00:05:11.940  -->  00:05:13.710
and what you like as well.
127

127

00:05:13.710  -->  00:05:16.600
It took me quite a while to find a colour scheme
128

128

00:05:16.600  -->  00:05:18.300
for PyCharm that I really liked,
129

129

00:05:18.300  -->  00:05:21.280
but I've actually not changed this one in a long time.
130

130

00:05:21.280  -->  00:05:24.250
So I do like it but PyCharm adds a bit too much spacing
131

131

00:05:24.250  -->  00:05:28.870
between letters so normally I would use the other font,
132

132

00:05:28.870  -->  00:05:32.770
Essential PragmataPro on particularly
133

133

00:05:32.770  -->  00:05:36.000
a small screen if I was using PyCharm.
134

134

00:05:36.000  -->  00:05:40.480
But at home, I am not using PyCharm any more
135

135

00:05:40.480  -->  00:05:44.430
and I'm also not using Essential PragmataPro
136

136

00:05:44.430  -->  00:05:47.106
really because I have two large screens
137

137

00:05:47.106  -->  00:05:50.086
and so I'm using Visual Studio Code
138

138

00:05:50.086  -->  00:05:53.350
that actually you can see just here.
139

139

00:05:53.350  -->  00:05:56.690
Here are my notes for the last few lectures,
140

140

00:05:56.690  -->  00:05:58.570
you can see I've got a split screen there
141

141

00:05:58.570  -->  00:06:00.920
and here I'm using Fira Code as well
142

142

00:06:00.920  -->  00:06:04.616
with also a dark theme, quite a nice theme here.
143

143

00:06:04.616  -->  00:06:08.810
And this is what I normally code in
144

144

00:06:08.810  -->  00:06:11.060
when I'm working on course material
145

145

00:06:11.060  -->  00:06:14.425
or small applications like I do at home,
146

146

00:06:14.425  -->  00:06:16.730
I use Visual Studio Code, I find it's
147

147

00:06:16.730  -->  00:06:19.110
quite straightforward to use.
148

148

00:06:19.110  -->  00:06:21.330
And I also use Visual Studio Code at work
149

149

00:06:21.330  -->  00:06:23.827
when I'm working on JavaScript applications
150

150

00:06:23.827  -->  00:06:27.110
just because it works very nicely for that
151

151

00:06:27.110  -->  00:06:29.256
and I find just the structure of JavaScript applications
152

152

00:06:29.256  -->  00:06:34.256
and the user Fira Code helps with that.
153

153

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:36.350
Using Fira Code and PyCharm can be a bit
154

154

00:06:37.254  -->  00:06:39.520
more tricky because of the letter spacing.
155

155

00:06:39.520  -->  00:06:40.690
So that's it.
156

156

00:06:40.690  -->  00:06:44.860
In terms of the settings in Visual Studio Code,
157

157

00:06:44.860  -->  00:06:47.350
I have a few extensions installed
158

158

00:06:47.350  -->  00:06:49.830
and you can see them here.
159

159

00:06:49.830  -->  00:06:52.510
I have a bunch of them but really
160

160

00:06:52.510  -->  00:06:54.460
the most important ones for me
161

161

00:06:54.460  -->  00:06:57.523
are ESLint which integrates a linter
162

162

00:06:57.523  -->  00:07:01.580
into JavaScript code, very much like PyLint for Python
163

163

00:07:01.580  -->  00:07:03.590
you've got ESLint for JavaScript
164

164

00:07:03.590  -->  00:07:05.960
and you've got Flow Language which adds types
165

165

00:07:05.960  -->  00:07:08.709
to JavaScript and then you've got a few other
166

166

00:07:08.709  -->  00:07:11.185
things here that are maybe more interesting to you
167

167

00:07:11.185  -->  00:07:15.520
like Jinja which allows us to look at Jinja code
168

168

00:07:15.520  -->  00:07:17.450
which is used in Flask.
169

169

00:07:17.450  -->  00:07:19.670
I've got Python which is an extension
170

170

00:07:19.670  -->  00:07:21.410
that allows you to write Python code
171

171

00:07:21.410  -->  00:07:24.040
and it adds things like lintin, debugging and so forth
172

172

00:07:24.040  -->  00:07:26.058
into Visual Studio Code which is very useful
173

173

00:07:26.058  -->  00:07:29.570
and also something I do like is VSCode Icons.
174

174

00:07:29.570  -->  00:07:31.143
When you go back to your
175

175

00:07:31.143  -->  00:07:35.147
explorer here, that's what it's called,
176

176

00:07:35.147  -->  00:07:36.990
you can see little icons beside the files
177

177

00:07:36.990  -->  00:07:40.580
and that just sort of helps identify them a bit nicer.
178

178

00:07:40.580  -->  00:07:43.200
I generally like the look of Visual Studio Code
179

179

00:07:43.200  -->  00:07:44.950
a bit more than I do of PyCharm
180

180

00:07:44.950  -->  00:07:47.697
but the PyCharm debugger is much more powerful
181

181

00:07:47.697  -->  00:07:50.930
than anything I've managed to use in Visual Studio Code
182

182

00:07:50.930  -->  00:07:52.630
so when I'm working in Python,
183

183

00:07:52.630  -->  00:07:56.870
I use PyCharm because of the debugger almost exclusively.
184

184

00:07:56.870  -->  00:07:58.790
When I'm working in JavaScript because the debugging
185

185

00:07:58.790  -->  00:08:01.270
capabilities are much worse,
186

186

00:08:01.270  -->  00:08:03.270
it doesn't really matter which one I use
187

187

00:08:03.270  -->  00:08:05.220
so I tend to prefer Visual Studio Code.
188

188

00:08:06.410  -->  00:08:07.650
And that's it, Visual Studio Code
189

189

00:08:07.650  -->  00:08:09.150
also gives you a few nice things
190

190

00:08:09.150  -->  00:08:12.020
like it's pretty nice search.
191

191

00:08:12.020  -->  00:08:16.110
The Git source control is quite powerful
192

192

00:08:16.110  -->  00:08:18.080
and quite nice to use and then it's got
193

193

00:08:18.080  -->  00:08:20.450
a debugger as well but as I said with JavaScript
194

194

00:08:20.450  -->  00:08:23.900
it's not so fantastic so I tend not to use it
195

195

00:08:23.900  -->  00:08:24.733
all that often.
196

196

00:08:25.920  -->  00:08:28.393
The theme I think is called,
197

197

00:08:29.574  -->  00:08:31.900
I'm not sure what it's called actually
198

198

00:08:31.900  -->  00:08:36.770
but I will put a wee link to the sort of settings
199

199

00:08:36.770  -->  00:08:38.700
that I'm using here just in case
200

200

00:08:38.700  -->  00:08:40.350
you want to give it a go as well.
201

201

00:08:41.420  -->  00:08:44.260
Down here in Visual Studio Code
202

202

00:08:44.260  -->  00:08:46.160
you've also got a terminal so you don't have
203

203

00:08:46.160  -->  00:08:48.370
to open a separate application and frequently
204

204

00:08:48.370  -->  00:08:50.137
I use this terminal here to do things
205

205

00:08:50.137  -->  00:08:52.760
like run my Python apps or my linter
206

206

00:08:52.760  -->  00:08:54.380
or whatever.
207

207

00:08:54.380  -->  00:08:57.610
So it's pretty nice to have that in here as well.
208

208

00:08:57.610  -->  00:08:58.950
Anyway, that's it for this video,
209

209

00:08:58.950  -->  00:09:00.867
just wanted to show you what I normally work with
210

210

00:09:00.867  -->  00:09:04.615
and to paired with these two programmes
211

211

00:09:04.615  -->  00:09:07.200
that I use for software development,
212

212

00:09:07.200  -->  00:09:10.617
I also use of course Slack as a communication tool
213

213

00:09:10.617  -->  00:09:15.180
to talk with my teammates and that's pretty much
214

214

00:09:15.180  -->  00:09:18.480
always running and of course email as well
215

215

00:09:18.480  -->  00:09:22.670
to, for to do, to do wider company updates
216

216

00:09:22.670  -->  00:09:23.720
and things like that.
217

217

00:09:24.660  -->  00:09:25.740
That's it for this video.
218

218

00:09:25.740  -->  00:09:28.440
Hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you on the next one.
