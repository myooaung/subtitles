<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:04.730
In this section we're looking at errors in Python.
3

3

00:00:04.730  -->  00:00:07.670
Python's got a long history with errors,
4

4

00:00:07.670  -->  00:00:09.420
and errors are really useful.
5

5

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:11.290
And especially the way they're used in Python
6

6

00:00:11.290  -->  00:00:13.270
as we're gonna see throughout this section,
7

7

00:00:13.270  -->  00:00:14.950
makes errors powerful,
8

8

00:00:14.950  -->  00:00:17.520
and they make your code very readable.
9

9

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:19.660
So in this section we're going to look at errors,
10

10

00:00:19.660  -->  00:00:21.294
how you can use them, how you can create them,
11

11

00:00:21.294  -->  00:00:23.320
how you can deal with them.
12

12

00:00:25.114  -->  00:00:27.610
At the start, nobody likes errors.
13

13

00:00:27.610  -->  00:00:31.090
Let's says we've got something like this line here.
14

14

00:00:31.090  -->  00:00:33.330
Print my_variable.
15

15

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:36.750
Now notice how I've not created my_variable before,
16

16

00:00:36.750  -->  00:00:40.850
and this editor already shows me a small cross sign
17

17

00:00:40.850  -->  00:00:43.890
saying that there's undefined variable, my_variable.
18

18

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:47.130
Well let's say we didn't have that hint there.
19

19

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:48.820
Python hasn't ran yet,
20

20

00:00:48.820  -->  00:00:53.500
so this code is perfectly reasonable in terms of its syntax.
21

21

00:00:53.500  -->  00:00:55.450
We're printing some variable
22

22

00:00:55.450  -->  00:00:58.070
that Python doesn't know whether it exists or not,
23

23

00:00:58.070  -->  00:00:59.580
until the point that it runs.
24

24

00:01:00.560  -->  00:01:02.890
So what will happen when we run this?
25

25

00:01:04.350  -->  00:01:06.830
What type of error will we get?
26

26

00:01:06.830  -->  00:01:08.610
Well, we will get a NameError.
27

27

00:01:09.805  -->  00:01:12.540
As you can see up here, we get a traceback,
28

28

00:01:12.540  -->  00:01:14.620
we're gonna look at exactly what those are,
29

29

00:01:14.620  -->  00:01:19.262
and then it tells us in file Python in line one,
30

30

00:01:19.262  -->  00:01:20.750
and at the end it says a NameError
31

31

00:01:20.750  -->  00:01:23.450
and then it gives you a small description of the error.
32

32

00:01:23.450  -->  00:01:25.700
The name, my_variable, is not defined.
33

33

00:01:26.800  -->  00:01:28.500
It's great to receive this error
34

34

00:01:28.500  -->  00:01:30.340
as opposed to some other error,
35

35

00:01:30.340  -->  00:01:33.090
because once you know what it means,
36

36

00:01:33.090  -->  00:01:35.000
you can easily find the source of that problem.
37

37

00:01:35.000  -->  00:01:37.010
You can say, "Okay, my_variable's not defined,
38

38

00:01:37.010  -->  00:01:39.870
"so I must have used my_variable somewhere,
39

39

00:01:40.950  -->  00:01:42.880
"and it wasn't defined when I used it."
40

40

00:01:42.880  -->  00:01:45.550
And it tells you where that problem was, which is line one.
41

41

00:01:45.550  -->  00:01:49.010
So all you have to do is go to line one and find my_variable
42

42

00:01:49.010  -->  00:01:52.290
and say, "Okay, why does it not exist at this point?"
43

43

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:53.123
And of course the reason is
44

44

00:01:53.123  -->  00:01:55.680
'cause we've not defined it above,
45

45

00:01:55.680  -->  00:01:58.980
and we can do that, equals 123,
46

46

00:01:58.980  -->  00:02:01.530
and then we can re-run this and now this all works.
47

47

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:05.210
It would be much worse
48

48

00:02:05.210  -->  00:02:08.050
if instead of a NameError with a nice description,
49

49

00:02:08.050  -->  00:02:10.940
you just got an arbitrary error.
50

50

00:02:13.830  -->  00:02:15.830
I'm running this to get the error again,
51

51

00:02:15.830  -->  00:02:17.920
and notice how it tells you where it is
52

52

00:02:17.920  -->  00:02:19.940
and the name of the error and a description.
53

53

00:02:19.940  -->  00:02:22.160
If you didn't get any of this,
54

54

00:02:22.160  -->  00:02:25.610
it would be hours, it would take you hours or possibly days
55

55

00:02:25.610  -->  00:02:28.690
to find a simple error like this one in a large application.
56

56

00:02:28.690  -->  00:02:30.670
Rather large applications, commercial applications,
57

57

00:02:30.670  -->  00:02:32.730
have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands
58

58

00:02:32.730  -->  00:02:34.140
of lines of code,
59

59

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:35.810
so if you got something that said,
60

60

00:02:35.810  -->  00:02:37.610
error, an error has occurred,
61

61

00:02:38.720  -->  00:02:42.660
and that's all the info it gave you, you would struggle.
62

62

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:46.380
So the name of the error, NameError, is really useful,
63

63

00:02:46.380  -->  00:02:49.420
but even more useful is the traceback.
64

64

00:02:49.420  -->  00:02:51.840
This is also called a stack trace in many languages.
65

65

00:02:51.840  -->  00:02:54.050
Traceback is stack trace, more or less the same thing,
66

66

00:02:54.050  -->  00:02:57.440
and what it tells you is where the error happened,
67

67

00:02:57.440  -->  00:03:00.690
and because we're running this file directly,
68

68

00:03:00.690  -->  00:03:03.150
it says it happened in this file.
69

69

00:03:03.990  -->  00:03:06.040
Now this editor is an online editor,
70

70

00:03:06.040  -->  00:03:08.960
so we don't actually have a file,
71

71

00:03:08.960  -->  00:03:11.330
but it seems that the file is called Python
72

72

00:03:11.330  -->  00:03:13.290
or something like that.
73

73

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:14.710
Tells you where it happened and so forth.
74

74

00:03:14.710  -->  00:03:17.350
So this traceback is a pretty simple traceback
75

75

00:03:17.350  -->  00:03:18.600
that has one line,
76

76

00:03:18.600  -->  00:03:21.780
and then it tells you where your error happened.
77

77

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:25.040
Let's look at a slightly more complex traceback,
78

78

00:03:25.040  -->  00:03:26.900
which has more than a single line,
79

79

00:03:26.900  -->  00:03:29.930
and I'll explain what's happening in a larger traceback.
80

80

00:03:29.930  -->  00:03:30.763
It's really important
81

81

00:03:30.763  -->  00:03:32.900
for you to be able to read these tracebacks
82

82

00:03:32.900  -->  00:03:34.180
to understand what they mean,
83

83

00:03:34.180  -->  00:03:36.340
so that you can solve your own errors.
84

84

00:03:38.150  -->  00:03:40.940
Here we've got a slightly more complex traceback.
85

85

00:03:41.930  -->  00:03:45.300
This time the traceback has four different lines.
86

86

00:03:46.640  -->  00:03:48.240
Now it's really important
87

87

00:03:48.240  -->  00:03:51.090
that at the very bottom of the traceback
88

88

00:03:51.090  -->  00:03:52.580
you're still getting the same thing
89

89

00:03:52.580  -->  00:03:53.920
that you got in the previous traceback.
90

90

00:03:53.920  -->  00:03:55.410
You've got the name, which is,
91

91

00:03:55.410  -->  00:03:58.355
in this case it's a TypeError.
92

92

00:03:58.355  -->  00:04:00.030
And then you've got a small description,
93

93

00:04:00.030  -->  00:04:00.863
and it says,
94

94

00:04:00.863  -->  00:04:04.290
list indices must be integers or slices, not string.
95

95

00:04:05.690  -->  00:04:07.080
And then as you go up
96

96

00:04:07.080  -->  00:04:10.470
it gives you information of where the error happened.
97

97

00:04:10.470  -->  00:04:14.900
Now, we're gonna talk about this stack trace right now.
98

98

00:04:14.900  -->  00:04:18.880
So let's give you a quick description on what is going on.
99

99

00:04:18.880  -->  00:04:22.290
So at the very bottom it gives you the error that was raised
100

100

00:04:22.290  -->  00:04:23.390
and a description, as we've just seen.
101

101

00:04:23.390  -->  00:04:25.280
In this case it's a TypeError.
102

102

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:29.930
Then it gives you what line of your code raised the errors.
103

103

00:04:29.930  -->  00:04:33.150
That's the very next line above the TypeError.
104

104

00:04:33.150  -->  00:04:35.460
In this case, the line that gave us an error
105

105

00:04:35.460  -->  00:04:37.980
was print, and then a formatted string
106

106

00:04:37.980  -->  00:04:42.770
that says, name and in curly brackets, movies, name.
107

107

00:04:42.770  -->  00:04:45.520
So this is the line of our code that gave us the error.
108

108

00:04:46.800  -->  00:04:51.410 line:15% 
Then it also tells us what function that line is in.
109

109

00:04:51.410  -->  00:04:52.700 line:15% 
That's just the line above.
110

110

00:04:52.700  -->  00:04:56.660 line:15% 
It says, File /Users/jslvtr/Dropbox/teclado/courses/
111

111

00:04:56.660  -->  00:05:00.770 line:15% 
complete-python-course/section3/milestone_1/app dot py.
112

112

00:05:00.770  -->  00:05:02.200 line:15% 
It says, line 40.
113

113

00:05:02.200  -->  00:05:05.560 line:15% 
Another variant it says, in show_movie_details.
114

114

00:05:06.590  -->  00:05:09.390 line:15% 
So this is the function that the error happened in,
115

115

00:05:09.390  -->  00:05:11.310 line:15% 
the show_movie_details function.
116

116

00:05:13.330  -->  00:05:18.330 line:15% 
Now the line above is where that function was called.
117

117

00:05:18.490  -->  00:05:20.350 line:15% 
So this function, show_movie_details
118

118

00:05:20.350  -->  00:05:25.080 line:15% 
was called as show_movie_details with movie as an argument,
119

119

00:05:25.080  -->  00:05:27.500 line:15% 
and the line directly above tells you
120

120

00:05:27.500  -->  00:05:30.080 line:15% 
in which function that function call happened,
121

121

00:05:30.080  -->  00:05:31.830 line:15% 
that's in the show_movies function.
122

122

00:05:32.930  -->  00:05:34.050 line:15% 
The show_movies function
123

123

00:05:34.050  -->  00:05:35.880 line:15% 
was called inside the menu function,
124

124

00:05:35.880  -->  00:05:38.610 line:15% 
and the menu function was called directly in the module,
125

125

00:05:38.610  -->  00:05:40.350 line:15% 
which is the file that we execute.
126

126

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:45.900 line:15% 
So it tells you where your error happened,
127

127

00:05:45.900  -->  00:05:48.763 line:15% 
what function that was in, what function that was in,
128

128

00:05:48.763  -->  00:05:51.560 line:15% 
what function that was in, and so forth,
129

129

00:05:51.560  -->  00:05:54.040 line:15% 
until you reached the file that you executed.
130

130

00:05:54.040  -->  00:05:57.700
So this is the code that raised that error.
131

131

00:05:58.650  -->  00:06:01.740
Now, we've got add_movie, show_movies,
132

132

00:06:01.740  -->  00:06:03.720
and then at the bottom, show_movie_details.
133

133

00:06:03.720  -->  00:06:04.800
I'm sure you remember this code.
134

134

00:06:04.800  -->  00:06:08.590
We wrote this for the first milestone project.
135

135

00:06:08.590  -->  00:06:11.970
And what we've got is an add_movie
136

136

00:06:11.970  -->  00:06:15.960
we are appending to our movies list presumably,
137

137

00:06:15.960  -->  00:06:18.590
a dictionary that has name, director, and year.
138

138

00:06:19.760  -->  00:06:23.900
In the show_movies function, we're taking a movie list,
139

139

00:06:23.900  -->  00:06:25.280
where it's writing over it,
140

140

00:06:25.280  -->  00:06:28.450
and for each movie we're showing the movie details.
141

141

00:06:29.770  -->  00:06:31.400
Inside show_movie_details,
142

142

00:06:31.400  -->  00:06:34.850
that takes one parameter, which is called movie,
143

143

00:06:34.850  -->  00:06:37.650
and then it's printing three sets of details.
144

144

00:06:37.650  -->  00:06:40.635
Now do you notice anything weird
145

145

00:06:40.635  -->  00:06:42.802
inside show_movie_details?
146

146

00:06:46.520  -->  00:06:48.670
Well I noticed something, which is there.
147

147

00:06:48.670  -->  00:06:52.010
And that's that the name is now inside curly braces,
148

148

00:06:52.010  -->  00:06:53.930
movies, name.
149

149

00:06:53.930  -->  00:06:55.510
Where as the other two print statements
150

150

00:06:55.510  -->  00:06:58.910
are movie, director and movie, year.
151

151

00:06:58.910  -->  00:07:01.210
Notice how the first one has movies there.
152

152

00:07:02.840  -->  00:07:05.710
So what's happening here is that we're trying to access
153

153

00:07:05.710  -->  00:07:09.320
this name key of a dictionary,
154

154

00:07:09.320  -->  00:07:13.260
but what we're accessing it in is the movies list.
155

155

00:07:13.260  -->  00:07:16.250
So then it tells you, you cannot use this key thing
156

156

00:07:16.250  -->  00:07:18.660
to access an item inside a list.
157

157

00:07:18.660  -->  00:07:20.240
You must only do that
158

158

00:07:20.240  -->  00:07:23.570
when the thing you're accessing in is a dictionary.
159

159

00:07:23.570  -->  00:07:24.990
So if that was movie,
160

160

00:07:24.990  -->  00:07:27.400
then we could access the name key of it.
161

161

00:07:27.400  -->  00:07:29.710
Because it's movies, it's a list,
162

162

00:07:29.710  -->  00:07:31.990
we cannot access the name key of it.
163

163

00:07:31.990  -->  00:07:32.930
Movies, by the way,
164

164

00:07:32.930  -->  00:07:35.830
was defined at the top of the file as a list,
165

165

00:07:35.830  -->  00:07:38.460
and that's why movies is a list.
166

166

00:07:38.460  -->  00:07:41.910
And the movie argument parameter there is a dictionary
167

167

00:07:41.910  -->  00:07:45.060
that was passed in from the show_movies function.
168

168

00:07:45.060  -->  00:07:47.320
So it told us, the stack trace told us
169

169

00:07:47.320  -->  00:07:49.970
that the error happened on this print statement
170

170

00:07:49.970  -->  00:07:52.670
inside the show_movie_details function,
171

171

00:07:52.670  -->  00:07:54.670
and the show_movie_details function was called
172

172

00:07:54.670  -->  00:07:57.140
inside the show_movies function,
173

173

00:07:57.140  -->  00:07:59.800
which is exactly what you can see there.
174

174

00:07:59.800  -->  00:08:00.720
The show_movies function
175

175

00:08:00.720  -->  00:08:03.110
was called from within the menu function,
176

176

00:08:03.110  -->  00:08:06.220
which you don't see in this code, but it was slightly above.
177

177

00:08:06.220  -->  00:08:08.800
And the menu function was called at the file level.
178

178

00:08:12.160  -->  00:08:14.930
So how do you deal with these errors?
179

179

00:08:14.930  -->  00:08:18.010
What do you do when you encounter one of these errors?
180

180

00:08:18.010  -->  00:08:18.932
And a lot of students,
181

181

00:08:18.932  -->  00:08:20.670
a lot of my students encounter errors,
182

182

00:08:20.670  -->  00:08:21.610
and the first thing they do,
183

183

00:08:21.610  -->  00:08:23.980
which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do by the way,
184

184

00:08:23.980  -->  00:08:25.700
is they go and ask in the course Q&amp;A, and they say,
185

185

00:08:25.700  -->  00:08:27.430
"Look, I've got this error.
186

186

00:08:27.430  -->  00:08:29.040
"Help me."
187

187

00:08:29.040  -->  00:08:31.670
Now I'm happy to help you, but,
188

188

00:08:31.670  -->  00:08:33.000
if the first thing you do
189

189

00:08:33.000  -->  00:08:35.940
is go and ask me to solve your problem,
190

190

00:08:35.940  -->  00:08:38.660
which I'm happy to do because that's what I'm here for,
191

191

00:08:38.660  -->  00:08:41.010
you're learning is gonna be slightly impaired.
192

192

00:08:41.010  -->  00:08:43.120
So here's my recommendation for when you get an error.
193

193

00:08:43.120  -->  00:08:43.953
What to do.
194

194

00:08:44.880  -->  00:08:46.580
The first thing to do, that a lot of people miss,
195

195

00:08:46.580  -->  00:08:48.370
is you have to look at your code.
196

196

00:08:48.370  -->  00:08:51.860
You have to look at the line that the error happened in,
197

197

00:08:51.860  -->  00:08:53.810
and see if you notice anything strange
198

198

00:08:53.810  -->  00:08:55.050
with the surrounding lines.
199

199

00:08:55.050  -->  00:08:57.040
For example, in that function there,
200

200

00:08:57.040  -->  00:08:59.200
we were using the wrong variable.
201

201

00:08:59.200  -->  00:09:01.070
I know it's a single letter of a difference,
202

202

00:09:01.070  -->  00:09:03.310
but for Python that is a world of a difference.
203

203

00:09:03.310  -->  00:09:05.320
So look at the code carefully,
204

204

00:09:05.320  -->  00:09:06.670
and it's gonna take some time for you
205

205

00:09:06.670  -->  00:09:10.680
to really start spotting those brackets,
206

206

00:09:10.680  -->  00:09:12.630
or an s that's missing or not there,
207

207

00:09:12.630  -->  00:09:14.890
or small character differences.
208

208

00:09:14.890  -->  00:09:16.760
And at the blink of an eye, it's gonna take some time
209

209

00:09:16.760  -->  00:09:19.660
for you to get accustomed to that, but you will get there.
210

210

00:09:20.900  -->  00:09:21.860
The next thing to do is,
211

211

00:09:21.860  -->  00:09:24.950
if you can't spot anything by just looking at the code,
212

212

00:09:24.950  -->  00:09:26.650
just copy the error and the message,
213

213

00:09:26.650  -->  00:09:30.060
just the very last line and put it into Google,
214

214

00:09:30.060  -->  00:09:31.960
and see if something comes up in StackOverflow.
215

215

00:09:31.960  -->  00:09:34.800
Normally, there's always somebody that's asked,
216

216

00:09:34.800  -->  00:09:36.710
"What does this error mean?"
217

217

00:09:36.710  -->  00:09:40.080
And if you put in a NameError,
218

218

00:09:40.080  -->  00:09:42.580
variable blah blah blah doesn't exist into Google,
219

219

00:09:42.580  -->  00:09:44.240
you'll get somebody that's asked,
220

220

00:09:44.240  -->  00:09:45.370
"I don't know what this means,"
221

221

00:09:45.370  -->  00:09:46.870
and somebody that's replied,
222

222

00:09:46.870  -->  00:09:49.440
"This means your variable's not defined."
223

223

00:09:49.440  -->  00:09:51.180
So it's always helpful to put things into Google
224

224

00:09:51.180  -->  00:09:52.300
and see what comes up.
225

225

00:09:52.300  -->  00:09:54.400
Maybe there'll be something helpful there.
226

226

00:09:55.575  -->  00:09:57.590
Now if neither of these help,
227

227

00:09:57.590  -->  00:10:00.050
you have to start taking a more methodical approach
228

228

00:10:00.050  -->  00:10:01.300
to identifying the error.
229

229

00:10:02.240  -->  00:10:04.300
This is, look at the code again,
230

230

00:10:04.300  -->  00:10:05.820
but this time, much more slowly,
231

231

00:10:05.820  -->  00:10:08.510
and run through it as if you were a computer.
232

232

00:10:08.510  -->  00:10:12.200
That means start at the very top of your code.
233

233

00:10:12.200  -->  00:10:16.150
Think, "What data am I giving the computer in this line?"
234

234

00:10:16.150  -->  00:10:17.920
Then move over to the next line and think,
235

235

00:10:17.920  -->  00:10:20.260
"What data am I giving it in this line?"
236

236

00:10:20.260  -->  00:10:22.490
And then into the next line and so forth.
237

237

00:10:22.490  -->  00:10:27.410
Mimic what the computer is doing exactly in every function.
238

238

00:10:27.410  -->  00:10:31.330
We're going to get a lot more expert in doing this
239

239

00:10:31.330  -->  00:10:32.680
over the next few sections.
240

240

00:10:33.670  -->  00:10:36.280
But as you do this, do you notice anything
241

241

00:10:36.280  -->  00:10:39.060
that could potentially be a source of an error?
242

242

00:10:39.060  -->  00:10:41.190
But rather the error may not be in the line,
243

243

00:10:41.190  -->  00:10:42.430
or rather the error source
244

244

00:10:42.430  -->  00:10:45.150
may not be in the line that raised the error,
245

245

00:10:45.150  -->  00:10:46.440
but rather in a different line
246

246

00:10:46.440  -->  00:10:48.950
that maybe set the variable to the wrong value
247

247

00:10:48.950  -->  00:10:50.100
or something like that.
248

248

00:10:51.920  -->  00:10:55.630
If this doesn't help, run only some parts of the code.
249

249

00:10:55.630  -->  00:10:56.463
For example,
250

250

00:10:56.463  -->  00:10:59.560
try only running the show_movie_details function
251

251

00:10:59.560  -->  00:11:03.540
with a dictionary as an argument, see if that works.
252

252

00:11:03.540  -->  00:11:04.500
If that works,
253

253

00:11:04.500  -->  00:11:07.430
try running the function that calls that function
254

254

00:11:07.430  -->  00:11:09.370
with some arguments.
255

255

00:11:09.370  -->  00:11:10.490
And then trying running the function
256

256

00:11:10.490  -->  00:11:12.340
that calls that function with some arguments.
257

257

00:11:12.340  -->  00:11:14.170
As you incrementally run your code,
258

258

00:11:14.170  -->  00:11:17.240
eventually you'll reach a step where the error will happen,
259

259

00:11:17.240  -->  00:11:20.070
and you'll say, "Okay, the error must happen
260

260

00:11:20.070  -->  00:11:22.370
"some point between these two function calls."
261

261

00:11:24.100  -->  00:11:28.570
And finally, if this doesn't work either, use a debugger.
262

262

00:11:28.570  -->  00:11:30.460
We're going to learn how to, in the next couple of videos.
263

263

00:11:30.460  -->  00:11:32.150
Python has an excellent debugger,
264

264

00:11:32.150  -->  00:11:34.080
and we're going to really be using that.
265

265

00:11:34.080  -->  00:11:37.530
And that debugger helps you step through your code
266

266

00:11:37.530  -->  00:11:40.430
and identify what variables are.
267

267

00:11:40.430  -->  00:11:43.210
It lets you sort of stop at a certain point in your code
268

268

00:11:43.210  -->  00:11:45.350
and inspect the current status of your programme
269

269

00:11:45.350  -->  00:11:46.183
and so forth.
270

270

00:11:46.183  -->  00:11:47.016
It's really useful.
271

271

00:11:47.980  -->  00:11:49.920
And of course, at any point,
272

272

00:11:49.920  -->  00:11:52.010
I know this is quite tricky
273

273

00:11:52.010  -->  00:11:55.200
to go through all of these steps without despair,
274

274

00:11:55.200  -->  00:11:58.980
so at any point, ask questions in the course Q&amp;A.
275

275

00:11:58.980  -->  00:12:01.520
We're here to help, and so make use of that.
276

276

00:12:02.700  -->  00:12:06.210
Now if you ask a question in the course Q&amp;A,
277

277

00:12:06.210  -->  00:12:09.060
which again, you should do if you're stuck,
278

278

00:12:09.060  -->  00:12:11.370
make sure that you give us all the information
279

279

00:12:11.370  -->  00:12:12.650
that you've already gathered
280

280

00:12:12.650  -->  00:12:15.710
through your search for fixing this error.
281

281

00:12:15.710  -->  00:12:18.010
That way we don't have to then start at the top
282

282

00:12:18.010  -->  00:12:20.040
and do the same thing again.
283

283

00:12:20.040  -->  00:12:21.190
So if you tell us,
284

284

00:12:21.190  -->  00:12:23.300
"I've looked on my code and I can't spot anything,"
285

285

00:12:23.300  -->  00:12:24.440
then, "I've gone into Google
286

286

00:12:24.440  -->  00:12:26.400
"and found that this error means that."
287

287

00:12:26.400  -->  00:12:28.210
And, "Here's my code by the way,"
288

288

00:12:28.210  -->  00:12:30.530
and, "Here's the data that I'm givin' it."
289

289

00:12:30.530  -->  00:12:32.120
Now we can really quickly see,
290

290

00:12:32.120  -->  00:12:34.410
okay, you've given it this data, that all looks correct,
291

291

00:12:34.410  -->  00:12:35.700
this error means that.
292

292

00:12:35.700  -->  00:12:38.890
We can then piece the pieces of the puzzle together
293

293

00:12:38.890  -->  00:12:40.360
and find that answer much quicker.
294

294

00:12:40.360  -->  00:12:42.060
So when you have a question in the course Q&amp;A
295

295

00:12:42.060  -->  00:12:44.350
give us all the information you can.
296

296

00:12:44.350  -->  00:12:47.560
And then the answer will come really quickly.
297

297

00:12:47.560  -->  00:12:50.130
We aim to have all your answers within 24 hours,
298

298

00:12:50.130  -->  00:12:51.260
but of course that's only possible
299

299

00:12:51.260  -->  00:12:54.170
if we don't have a back and forth between me and you
300

300

00:12:54.170  -->  00:12:57.590
trying to find out what the source of the problem could be.
301

301

00:12:57.590  -->  00:12:58.760
So that's it for this video.
302

302

00:12:58.760  -->  00:13:01.040
This is an intro to errors.
303

303

00:13:01.040  -->  00:13:03.760
Really errors in Python, but also in programming as a whole.
304

304

00:13:03.760  -->  00:13:07.170
This is something you should be doing as you programme,
305

305

00:13:07.170  -->  00:13:08.850
in any programming language.
306

306

00:13:08.850  -->  00:13:10.060
So that's it for this video.
307

307

00:13:10.060  -->  00:13:11.510
I'll see you on the next one.
