<v ->Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>

2

00:00:01.970  -->  00:00:03.620 line:15% 
In this video, we're going to be looking
3

3

00:00:03.620  -->  00:00:05.440
at using the Chrome driver
4

4

00:00:05.440  -->  00:00:06.630
with our project,
5

5

00:00:06.630  -->  00:00:08.720
instead of the requests module.
6

6

00:00:08.720  -->  00:00:10.430
We're not going to change what the project does,
7

7

00:00:10.430  -->  00:00:12.360
we're not going to look at the new
8

8

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:14.250
Javascript page yet.
9

9

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:16.560
We're just going to use Chrome in here,
10

10

00:00:16.560  -->  00:00:18.400
so that we get accustomed to using it,
11

11

00:00:18.400  -->  00:00:19.350
and then we will move over
12

12

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:21.090
to the new page.
13

13

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:22.460
The first thing we have to do,
14

14

00:00:22.460  -->  00:00:25.020
is to get the Chrome driver.
15

15

00:00:25.020  -->  00:00:25.853
So we're going to do
16

16

00:00:25.853  -->  00:00:28.900
from.selenium import webdriver.
17

17

00:00:28.900  -->  00:00:30.750
We're no longer going to need requests,
18

18

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:34.100
because the webdriver is going to be doing the requesting.
19

19

00:00:34.100  -->  00:00:36.180
So we no longer need that.
20

20

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:37.610
Next, we're going to actually
21

21

00:00:37.610  -->  00:00:38.750
launch Chrome.
22

22

00:00:38.750  -->  00:00:39.583
So we're gonna do,
23

23

00:00:39.583  -->  00:00:40.416
say something like,
24

24

00:00:40.416  -->  00:00:42.567
chrome equals webdriver.Chrome,
25

25

00:00:43.940  -->  00:00:45.180
and here we're going to pass in
26

26

00:00:45.180  -->  00:00:48.420
the executable path,
27

27

00:00:48.420  -->  00:00:50.140
and that's going to be the path,
28

28

00:00:50.140  -->  00:00:53.130
to where your Chrome driver programme is.
29

29

00:00:53.130  -->  00:00:54.350
My case it's in,
30

30

00:00:54.350  -->  00:00:57.820
usr/local/bin/chromedriver,
31

31

00:00:57.820  -->  00:00:58.870
but if you put it somewhere else,
32

32

00:00:58.870  -->  00:01:00.860
then make sure that you put the correct path there,
33

33

00:01:00.860  -->  00:01:01.740
and if you're on Windows,
34

34

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:03.630
make sure that you put the .exe there,
35

35

00:01:03.630  -->  00:01:05.590
if it's on the filename.
36

36

00:01:05.590  -->  00:01:08.085
That will actually launch Chrome,
37

37

00:01:08.085  -->  00:01:11.300
and it will give you this chrome variable,
38

38

00:01:11.300  -->  00:01:13.620
that you can use to interact with it.
39

39

00:01:13.620  -->  00:01:16.930
So now instead of making this request here,
40

40

00:01:16.930  -->  00:01:18.470
to get the HTML content,
41

41

00:01:18.470  -->  00:01:21.980
we're going to say, chrome.get,
42

42

00:01:21.980  -->  00:01:26.870
and then we're going to go to http://quotes.toscrape.com.
43

43

00:01:26.870  -->  00:01:29.570
Now instead of passing the page content,
44

44

00:01:29.570  -->  00:01:31.120
to our QuotesPage object,
45

45

00:01:31.120  -->  00:01:33.420
we're actually going to pass chrome,
46

46

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:35.990
because this Chrome instance,
47

47

00:01:35.990  -->  00:01:37.940
is running the page.
48

48

00:01:37.940  -->  00:01:40.120
So it has access to everything inside the page,
49

49

00:01:40.120  -->  00:01:41.870
we no longer need to limit ourselves,
50

50

00:01:41.870  -->  00:01:44.660
to only getting the HTML content.
51

51

00:01:44.660  -->  00:01:47.130
We can actually pass the chrome object,
52

52

00:01:47.130  -->  00:01:48.030
to the QuotesPage,
53

53

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:50.220
and use that chrome object inside
54

54

00:01:50.220  -->  00:01:52.140
this other object.
55

55

00:01:52.140  -->  00:01:54.250
For example, if we wanted to click around on things,
56

56

00:01:54.250  -->  00:01:55.270
or stuff like that,
57

57

00:01:55.270  -->  00:01:56.670
we can do that as long as we have
58

58

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:58.010
this chrome object.
59

59

00:01:58.010  -->  00:02:00.280
If we pass in only the HTML content,
60

60

00:02:00.280  -->  00:02:01.950
we wouldn't be able to click around in it,
61

61

00:02:01.950  -->  00:02:04.400
because it will just be a string.
62

62

00:02:04.400  -->  00:02:06.350
Now notice that we have some red lines here,
63

63

00:02:06.350  -->  00:02:08.780
because we do have to instal selenium.
64

64

00:02:08.780  -->  00:02:11.400
So just go over to your Python preferences,
65

65

00:02:11.400  -->  00:02:15.010
and go to the project interpreter,
66

66

00:02:15.010  -->  00:02:18.750
click the plus icon, and instal selenium.
67

67

00:02:18.750  -->  00:02:19.620
Don't need anything else,
68

68

00:02:19.620  -->  00:02:21.550
just selenium is okay,
69

69

00:02:21.550  -->  00:02:22.890
and once it's installed,
70

70

00:02:22.890  -->  00:02:24.560
those red lines will go away.
71

71

00:02:24.560  -->  00:02:25.610
All right, that's your instal.
72

72

00:02:25.610  -->  00:02:27.850
So we can close and press okay,
73

73

00:02:27.850  -->  00:02:30.970
and the red lines go away so that's all good.
74

74

00:02:30.970  -->  00:02:33.100
Now we go over to the quotes page,
75

75

00:02:33.100  -->  00:02:37.000
because obviously this expects the HTML content
76

76

00:02:37.000  -->  00:02:38.110
to be passed to it,
77

77

00:02:38.110  -->  00:02:39.070
we need to change it,
78

78

00:02:39.070  -->  00:02:42.170
so that it expects now the chrome instance.
79

79

00:02:42.170  -->  00:02:43.050
So what we're going to do is,
80

80

00:02:43.050  -->  00:02:46.150
we're going to remove this dependency from BeautifulSoup,
81

81

00:02:46.150  -->  00:02:48.000
because we're no longer going to need that,
82

82

00:02:48.000  -->  00:02:50.840
we're going to use chrome and selenium themselves,
83

83

00:02:50.840  -->  00:02:52.570
to traverse the tree.
84

84

00:02:52.570  -->  00:02:54.763
So we don't need BeautifulSoup,
85

85

00:02:55.710  -->  00:02:58.863
and here we're going to say self.browser is browser,
86

86

00:03:00.760  -->  00:03:03.280
and we're going to pass that in as the parameter.
87

87

00:03:03.280  -->  00:03:04.710
Now this browser here,
88

88

00:03:04.710  -->  00:03:07.610
we can use to find things within the page.
89

89

00:03:07.610  -->  00:03:08.870
Selenium comes with that,
90

90

00:03:08.870  -->  00:03:10.780
so as soon you have your browser,
91

91

00:03:10.780  -->  00:03:12.260
you can do self.browser,
92

92

00:03:13.960  -->  00:03:17.627
.find_elements_by_css_selector,
93

93

00:03:18.560  -->  00:03:20.830
and then you pass in your selector there,
94

94

00:03:20.830  -->  00:03:22.233
which is this right here.
95

95

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:26.160
Okay, now it's quite common when you have
96

96

00:03:26.160  -->  00:03:27.920
a long string like this one,
97

97

00:03:27.920  -->  00:03:31.440
to reformat it so that it is a little bit more readable,
98

98

00:03:31.440  -->  00:03:33.653
and we're going to do it like this.
99

99

00:03:34.850  -->  00:03:37.330
Okay, this is just a way to format this.
100

100

00:03:37.330  -->  00:03:39.770
If you are using a formatter like Black,
101

101

00:03:39.770  -->  00:03:40.920
which I recommend,
102

102

00:03:40.920  -->  00:03:42.370
then it will do this for you,
103

103

00:03:42.370  -->  00:03:44.990
but when you've got a longer list comprehension like that,
104

104

00:03:44.990  -->  00:03:46.705
it's normal to divide it into two,
105

105

00:03:46.705  -->  00:03:49.020
the thing that you want to put in the list,
106

106

00:03:49.020  -->  00:03:50.110
and then your loop,
107

107

00:03:50.110  -->  00:03:51.650
and then of course anything else,
108

108

00:03:51.650  -->  00:03:52.633
and also the index.
109

109

00:03:54.240  -->  00:03:56.160
Okay, now that we have our quotes,
110

110

00:03:56.160  -->  00:03:57.090
and again, this is just going to do
111

111

00:03:57.090  -->  00:03:58.010
the exact same thing,
112

112

00:03:58.010  -->  00:03:59.660
only instead of using BeautifulSoup,
113

113

00:03:59.660  -->  00:04:02.350
we're using the browser.
114

114

00:04:02.350  -->  00:04:05.220
We do have to go over to the quote parser,
115

115

00:04:05.220  -->  00:04:07.920
and make these changes as well.
116

116

00:04:07.920  -->  00:04:10.090
Instead of select one,
117

117

00:04:10.090  -->  00:04:10.950
what we're going to have to do,
118

118

00:04:10.950  -->  00:04:15.950
is again, find element by css selector.
119

119

00:04:16.460  -->  00:04:17.960
Notice that in the quotes page,
120

120

00:04:17.960  -->  00:04:20.980
we did find elements by css selector,
121

121

00:04:20.980  -->  00:04:22.380
here we only want one,
122

122

00:04:22.380  -->  00:04:26.060
so it is find element by css selector.
123

123

00:04:26.060  -->  00:04:27.140
Instead of .String,
124

124

00:04:27.140  -->  00:04:29.760
it is .text if you are using selenium.
125

125

00:04:29.760  -->  00:04:32.730
So yeah, we just copy that into here,
126

126

00:04:32.730  -->  00:04:35.710
and into here, but we don't want the text,
127

127

00:04:35.710  -->  00:04:37.730
and we also want multiple elements,
128

128

00:04:37.730  -->  00:04:38.810
so it's gonna be once again,
129

129

00:04:38.810  -->  00:04:41.090
find elements by css selector.
130

130

00:04:41.090  -->  00:04:44.100
The thing that we're interacting with now,
131

131

00:04:44.100  -->  00:04:45.770
when we use self.parent,
132

132

00:04:45.770  -->  00:04:48.320
or when we get these tags,
133

133

00:04:48.320  -->  00:04:51.250
is no longer a BeautifulSoup element,
134

134

00:04:51.250  -->  00:04:53.140
because we're not using BeautifulSoup.
135

135

00:04:53.140  -->  00:04:54.810
These things like self.parent,
136

136

00:04:54.810  -->  00:04:57.710
are all selenium objects,
137

137

00:04:57.710  -->  00:04:59.960
so they have different methods in them,
138

138

00:04:59.960  -->  00:05:02.020
and they have different properties in them,
139

139

00:05:02.020  -->  00:05:04.770
but overall their logic is the same.
140

140

00:05:04.770  -->  00:05:06.000
You're searching for them,
141

141

00:05:06.000  -->  00:05:07.330
and then you're getting the text out.
142

142

00:05:07.330  -->  00:05:09.453
It's just the names that have changed a little.
143

143

00:05:10.840  -->  00:05:12.350
If we go back to app.py,
144

144

00:05:12.350  -->  00:05:13.453
and we run it,
145

145

00:05:15.350  -->  00:05:18.080
you'll see that Chrome gets launched,
146

146

00:05:18.080  -->  00:05:20.190
and we load the page,
147

147

00:05:20.190  -->  00:05:22.720
and then we get our quotes down here,
148

148

00:05:22.720  -->  00:05:24.730
just as we did in the previous application,
149

149

00:05:24.730  -->  00:05:26.820
but now we do have Chrome here,
150

150

00:05:26.820  -->  00:05:27.653
and it tells you that,
151

151

00:05:27.653  -->  00:05:30.210
"Chrome is being controlled by automated test software."
152

152

00:05:30.210  -->  00:05:32.730
Remember what I said in the first video of this section,
153

153

00:05:32.730  -->  00:05:35.830
that the chrome driver is for testing websites,
154

154

00:05:35.830  -->  00:05:37.510
that's why it tells you that it's being controlled
155

155

00:05:37.510  -->  00:05:39.470
by automated test software,
156

156

00:05:39.470  -->  00:05:42.450
even though we're doing nothing to do with testing,
157

157

00:05:42.450  -->  00:05:44.933
but nonetheless, that's why selenium exists.

158

00:05:46.570  -->  00:05:50.610
All right, so that's how you use the Chrome web driver,
159

159

00:05:50.610  -->  00:05:52.750
you just ask it where you want to go,
160

160

00:05:52.750  -->  00:05:55.150
and then we're going to be passing it over to our page,
161

161

00:05:55.150  -->  00:05:56.410
and our parsers,
162

162

00:05:56.410  -->  00:05:57.640
and we're going to be using the methods
163

163

00:05:57.640  -->  00:06:00.070
that are defined inside selenium,
164

164

00:06:00.070  -->  00:06:02.763
to find elements and extract their contents.
165

165

00:06:03.760  -->  00:06:07.500
Now, because we have actual selenium objects,
166

166

00:06:07.500  -->  00:06:09.570
and the actual browser,
167

167

00:06:09.570  -->  00:06:11.270
we can click on things,
168

168

00:06:11.270  -->  00:06:13.050
for example on drop downs.
169

169

00:06:13.050  -->  00:06:14.700
So we're going to start looking,
170

170

00:06:14.700  -->  00:06:16.710
into how to do that in the next videos,
171

171

00:06:16.710  -->  00:06:18.950
as we move over to the new page
172

172

00:06:18.950  -->  00:06:20.680
that uses Javascript.
173

173

00:06:20.680  -->  00:06:22.230
I'll see you in the next video.
