<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.320  -->  00:00:03.640
In this section, we're gonna be looking
3

3

00:00:03.640  -->  00:00:06.380
at interacting with APIs.
4

4

00:00:06.380  -->  00:00:08.280
APIs are a really simple thing.
5

5

00:00:08.280  -->  00:00:09.585
They're basically a programme
6

6

00:00:09.585  -->  00:00:12.190
that receives data from you
7

7

00:00:12.190  -->  00:00:15.570
and gives you data back be that what it may.
8

8

00:00:15.570  -->  00:00:17.630
So, in this section, we're going to be using this API
9

9

00:00:17.630  -->  00:00:20.370
called open exchange rates.
10

10

00:00:20.370  -->  00:00:22.160
This receives some data from you,
11

11

00:00:22.160  -->  00:00:24.740
which is what you want from it
12

12

00:00:24.740  -->  00:00:26.500
and it sends you some data back.
13

13

00:00:26.500  -->  00:00:30.597
For example, the current latest currency exchange rates.
14

14

00:00:30.597  -->  00:00:34.140
So, let's have a look at open exchange rates.
15

15

00:00:34.140  -->  00:00:36.640
First thing to do is of course to sign up
16

16

00:00:36.640  -->  00:00:38.060
and they've got some paid plans
17

17

00:00:38.060  -->  00:00:40.240
but they've also got a free plan.
18

18

00:00:40.240  -->  00:00:41.860
The free plan is a bit limited
19

19

00:00:41.860  -->  00:00:43.200
but it's okay for what we wanna do
20

20

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:45.600
and to learn about APIs.
21

21

00:00:45.600  -->  00:00:47.370
So, sign up to the free plan
22

22

00:00:47.370  -->  00:00:51.730
and then let's go over to our dashboard.
23

23

00:00:51.730  -->  00:00:52.960
When you're in your dashboard,
24

24

00:00:52.960  -->  00:00:54.510
you'll see something like this.
25

25

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:57.380
I've got already some API requests that I've made.
26

26

00:00:57.380  -->  00:00:59.140
I've interacted with the API already,
27

27

00:00:59.140  -->  00:01:01.900
so here it shows me what I have interacted with
28

28

00:01:01.900  -->  00:01:05.240
and when but since we're only just getting started,
29

29

00:01:05.240  -->  00:01:08.789
do go to your App IDs section of the page
30

30

00:01:08.789  -->  00:01:12.760
and then create a new app ID.
31

31

00:01:12.760  -->  00:01:16.700
The API needs this app ID whenever you ask it something
32

32

00:01:16.700  -->  00:01:17.720
so it knows it's you
33

33

00:01:17.720  -->  00:01:19.390
and that you have an account,
34

34

00:01:19.390  -->  00:01:21.740
so by sending them this string here,
35

35

00:01:21.740  -->  00:01:24.140
the app ID, then they'll know
36

36

00:01:24.140  -->  00:01:26.359
that you are a valid user.
37

37

00:01:26.359  -->  00:01:30.800
Just copy that and let's go over to our programme
38

38

00:01:30.800  -->  00:01:31.960
where we're gonna start working
39

39

00:01:31.960  -->  00:01:33.390
on interacting with this API,
40

40

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:35.390
so once you've got this, that's everything you need.
41

41

00:01:35.390  -->  00:01:36.940
I'll see you in the next video.
