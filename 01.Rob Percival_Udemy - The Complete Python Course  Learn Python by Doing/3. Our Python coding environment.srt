<v ->Hi guys and welcome to your very first lecture.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,690  -->  00:00:05,280
In this lecture, we're going to be setting up
3

3

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:07,160
our Cloud coding environment
4

4

00:00:07,160  -->  00:00:09,780
so that you don't have to instal a bunch of stuff
5

5

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:12,160
just as you're getting started.
6

6

00:00:12,160  -->  00:00:14,950
Repl.it is the editor we're going to be using,
7

7

00:00:14,950  -->  00:00:17,253
and it's really powerful and really flexible.
8

8

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:22,793
To get started, come to repl.it and create an account.
9

9

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:26,430
Once you have logged in to repl.it,
10

10

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:29,150
you'll se something more or less like this.
11

11

00:00:29,150  -->  00:00:31,380
At the top right you'll have a button
12

12

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:33,040
to great a new repl,
13

13

00:00:33,040  -->  00:00:35,800
as well as your repls which should be empty for now,
14

14

00:00:35,800  -->  00:00:38,140
languages, and your profile.
15

15

00:00:38,140  -->  00:00:40,273
We're gonna click on new repl.
16

16

00:00:41,240  -->  00:00:43,570
Here, we're going to select Python.
17

17

00:00:43,570  -->  00:00:45,770
Notice that there's a bunch of different Pythons,
18

18

00:00:45,770  -->  00:00:47,930
including an older version of Python,
19

19

00:00:47,930  -->  00:00:50,140
as well as other frameworks and things like that.
20

20

00:00:50,140  -->  00:00:53,020
We're interested in just normal Python.
21

21

00:00:53,020  -->  00:00:55,970
This is going to create a new editor for you
22

22

00:00:55,970  -->  00:00:59,760
that uses Python three and it's going to be
23

23

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:01,520
what we'll use throughout the entire course.
24

24

00:01:01,520  -->  00:01:03,690
You can give it a name and you can give it a description
25

25

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:06,120
so you remember what it's about later on
26

26

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:08,500
when you see it in your profile.
27

27

00:01:08,500  -->  00:01:12,470
When you create your repl, you'll see something like this.
28

28

00:01:12,470  -->  00:01:14,810
You've got your files on the left,
29

29

00:01:14,810  -->  00:01:17,390
you've got your code here in the middle,
30

30

00:01:17,390  -->  00:01:20,623
and then you've got the output of your code on the right.
31

31

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:23,230
For now we're not going to be using files,
32

32

00:01:23,230  -->  00:01:25,780
so you can click this little icon to close it down.
33

33

00:01:26,810  -->  00:01:27,920
By clicking at the top,
34

34

00:01:27,920  -->  00:01:29,950
you can edit the name and the description
35

35

00:01:29,950  -->  00:01:31,900
if you didn't do so before.
36

36

00:01:31,900  -->  00:01:33,360
And whenever we type some code,
37

37

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:35,990
you can then press the green button to run it
38

38

00:01:35,990  -->  00:01:39,460
and then you'll see any output of the code on the right.
39

39

00:01:39,460  -->  00:01:41,390
One of the great things about repl.it
40

40

00:01:41,390  -->  00:01:45,270
is that you can share your editor with someone else.
41

41

00:01:45,270  -->  00:01:46,800
So if you ever have any problems
42

42

00:01:46,800  -->  00:01:48,030
as you go through the course,
43

43

00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:51,260
you can create a new topic in the course Q and A,
44

44

00:01:51,260  -->  00:01:53,340
give us a description of the problem
45

45

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:55,010
and what you're trying to achieve,
46

46

00:01:55,010  -->  00:01:58,890
and then also paste in this link that you get here.
47

47

00:01:58,890  -->  00:02:01,973
Then we will be able to see your code as you see it.
48

48

00:02:03,150  -->  00:02:05,750
When you do that though, remember to not change your code
49

49

00:02:05,750  -->  00:02:07,280
after you've shared it with us,
50

50

00:02:07,280  -->  00:02:10,240
otherwise your Q and A and the code that we see
51

51

00:02:10,240  -->  00:02:13,000
will no longer be in sync.
52

52

00:02:13,000  -->  00:02:15,570
Every time you start a new lecture of this course,
53

53

00:02:15,570  -->  00:02:18,730
I recommend you create a new repl for it.
54

54

00:02:18,730  -->  00:02:19,860
That's it for this video.
55

55

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:21,070
Now that you're all set up,
56

56

00:02:21,070  -->  00:02:22,830
let's get started learning Python.
57

57

00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:24,280
I'll see you in the next one!
