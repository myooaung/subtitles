<v Jose>Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:05,310 line:15% 
In this video we're going to learn about frames.
3

3

00:00:05,310  -->  00:00:06,870
As you can remember from the previous video,
4

4

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:09,610
we have three labels.
5

5

00:00:09,610  -->  00:00:11,730
Two of them that have a side off top
6

6

00:00:11,730  -->  00:00:14,770
and one of them that has a side off left.
7

7

00:00:14,770  -->  00:00:16,300
And what that means in practise is that
8

8

00:00:16,300  -->  00:00:18,160
each of these takes up the entire
9

9

00:00:18,160  -->  00:00:20,170
horizontal space.
10

10

00:00:20,170  -->  00:00:23,540
And finally, the label that is with side left
11

11

00:00:23,540  -->  00:00:25,363
has to appear underneath them.
12

12

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:28,620
If we want different behaviour to this,
13

13

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:33,290
we can use frames to contain certain labels.
14

14

00:00:33,290  -->  00:00:37,810
So, let's do from tkinter import ttk,
15

15

00:00:37,810  -->  00:00:39,920
and as well as the root,
16

16

00:00:39,920  -->  00:00:42,933
now we're going to define a main frame,
17

17

00:00:44,080  -->  00:00:46,370
that is placed inside the root.
18

18

00:00:46,370  -->  00:00:48,030
We're gonna say main.pac,
19

19

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:51,270
and the side is going to be left.
20

20

00:00:51,270  -->  00:00:52,950
And fill is going to be both
21

21

00:00:52,950  -->  00:00:55,820
and expand is going to be true.
22

22

00:00:55,820  -->  00:00:57,540
Now we're gonna place these
23

23

00:00:57,540  -->  00:00:59,540
two labels with side of top,
24

24

00:00:59,540  -->  00:01:00,640
instead of in root,
25

25

00:01:00,640  -->  00:01:02,523
we're gonna place them in main.
26

26

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:06,060
And we're gonna leave this final
27

27

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:08,610
label with a side of left.
28

28

00:01:08,610  -->  00:01:10,360
Now here's what's important
29

29

00:01:10,360  -->  00:01:13,230
about this distribution.
30

30

00:01:13,230  -->  00:01:15,540
The main frame is the first element
31

31

00:01:15,540  -->  00:01:17,620
inside the root.
32

32

00:01:17,620  -->  00:01:21,630
The label is the second element inside the root.
33

33

00:01:21,630  -->  00:01:23,860
These elements affect each other
34

34

00:01:23,860  -->  00:01:26,100
because they're both inside the frame
35

35

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:28,170
but they won't affect this one
36

36

00:01:28,170  -->  00:01:31,730
because they're not inside root.
37

37

00:01:31,730  -->  00:01:33,643
So when we do this,
38

38

00:01:34,840  -->  00:01:36,800
we get this distribution,
39

39

00:01:36,800  -->  00:01:38,350
which is different from before.
40

40

00:01:39,330  -->  00:01:41,040
Now this here
41

41

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:43,940
is the main frame
42

42

00:01:43,940  -->  00:01:45,930
and this is the label.
43

43

00:01:45,930  -->  00:01:48,730
Both are side left.
44

44

00:01:48,730  -->  00:01:50,750
Both have fill both
45

45

00:01:50,750  -->  00:01:51,943
and expand equal true.
46

46

00:01:53,573  -->  00:01:56,640
What it means when two components
47

47

00:01:56,640  -->  00:01:57,980
are on the same side
48

48

00:01:57,980  -->  00:01:59,150
with the same fill
49

49

00:01:59,150  -->  00:02:00,360
and the same expand
50

50

00:02:00,360  -->  00:02:02,050
is that they are gonna share the space
51

51

00:02:02,050  -->  00:02:03,960
equivalently as long as that's possible.
52

52

00:02:03,960  -->  00:02:06,440
So as long as the elements inside them
53

53

00:02:06,440  -->  00:02:08,313
don't take up more space.
54

54

00:02:09,310  -->  00:02:11,883
That means that you get a 50/50 split here.
55

55

00:02:12,800  -->  00:02:15,170
These two labels are inside
56

56

00:02:15,170  -->  00:02:17,060
the main frame
57

57

00:02:17,060  -->  00:02:21,070
so they have a top anchor in both occasions,
58

58

00:02:21,070  -->  00:02:22,860
and they both have fill both
59

59

00:02:22,860  -->  00:02:23,693
and expand equal true,
60

60

00:02:23,693  -->  00:02:27,830
which means they take up 50% of the available space.
61

61

00:02:27,830  -->  00:02:30,220
We create frames in tkinter
62

62

00:02:30,220  -->  00:02:31,900
precisely to do stuff like this,
63

63

00:02:31,900  -->  00:02:33,610
to group together components
64

64

00:02:33,610  -->  00:02:35,930
that we want to affect each other,
65

65

00:02:35,930  -->  00:02:37,470
but not other components.
66

66

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:39,920
By using multiple different frames,
67

67

00:02:39,920  -->  00:02:41,753
we can achieve the layouts we want.
68

68

00:02:43,050  -->  00:02:45,010
Pack() is a very powerful
69

69

00:02:45,010  -->  00:02:46,810
and very flexible algorithm
70

70

00:02:46,810  -->  00:02:49,840
for putting components into a window.
71

71

00:02:49,840  -->  00:02:51,270
But as you've seen throughout
72

72

00:02:51,270  -->  00:02:52,240
the last couple videos,
73

73

00:02:52,240  -->  00:02:54,750
it can be a little bit confusing
74

74

00:02:54,750  -->  00:02:57,040
and also depending on the size of your window
75

75

00:02:57,040  -->  00:02:59,990
and also on the order in which you put elements,
76

76

00:02:59,990  -->  00:03:02,263
things can change in how it behaves.
77

77

00:03:03,670  -->  00:03:05,630
This is why there's other algorithms as well
78

78

00:03:05,630  -->  00:03:06,820
as I've mentioned before.
79

79

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:09,020
But we won't be looking at them in this course.
80

80

00:03:09,020  -->  00:03:11,320
For most simple applications,
81

81

00:03:11,320  -->  00:03:12,640
to get data from users
82

82

00:03:12,640  -->  00:03:14,170
and to show them data back,
83

83

00:03:14,170  -->  00:03:18,400
pack() is a perfectly valid and useful algorithm.
84

84

00:03:18,400  -->  00:03:20,300
And it is very simple.
85

85

00:03:20,300  -->  00:03:22,450
You just say, "pack()", which side you want,
86

86

00:03:22,450  -->  00:03:24,750
and whether you want components to expand or not
87

87

00:03:24,750  -->  00:03:26,260
and there you go.
88

88

00:03:26,260  -->  00:03:28,030
You don't have to worry about positioning,
89

89

00:03:28,030  -->  00:03:29,020
or grids,
90

90

00:03:29,020  -->  00:03:30,723
or layouts and all that.
91

91

00:03:31,970  -->  00:03:33,310
Hopefully this makes sense.
92

92

00:03:33,310  -->  00:03:35,000
Thank you for joining me in this video
93

93

00:03:35,000  -->  00:03:36,623
and I'll see you in the next one.
