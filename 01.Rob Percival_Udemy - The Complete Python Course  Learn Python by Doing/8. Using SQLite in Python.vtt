<v Jose>Hi, welcome back.</v>

2

00:00:01.300  -->  00:00:03.710 line:15% 
In this video, we're looking at using SQLite
3

3

00:00:03.710  -->  00:00:05.500 line:15% 
from within Python.
4

4

00:00:05.500  -->  00:00:07.170
And it's really straightforward.
5

5

00:00:07.170  -->  00:00:10.250
For Python comes with SQLite already installed
6

6

00:00:10.250  -->  00:00:14.340
as a package and all you have to do is import SQLite3.
7

7

00:00:16.250  -->  00:00:20.040
Open up a Python file, write import SQLite3,
8

8

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:21.940
and run that file.
9

9

00:00:21.940  -->  00:00:24.850
If it all works and you don't get any errors,
10

10

00:00:24.850  -->  00:00:25.930
you're good to go.
11

11

00:00:25.930  -->  00:00:28.460
If it fails and you get some sort of margin not found error
12

12

00:00:28.460  -->  00:00:30.270
or an import error, it's possible
13

13

00:00:30.270  -->  00:00:33.710
that your Python installation has been made lighter
14

14

00:00:34.550  -->  00:00:36.120
so that it takes up less space
15

15

00:00:36.120  -->  00:00:38.010
in your computer and so forth.
16

16

00:00:38.010  -->  00:00:40.670
In that case I have to recommend that you find a way
17

17

00:00:40.670  -->  00:00:45.410
to instal SQLite3 or you reinstall Python 3.6 or later
18

18

00:00:46.280  -->  00:00:49.100
in your computer so that it comes with SQLite3.
19

19

00:00:49.100  -->  00:00:50.380
This normally will only happen
20

20

00:00:50.380  -->  00:00:52.610
on some very specific operating systems.
21

21

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:57.590
Now once you're imported SQLite3,
22

22

00:00:57.590  -->  00:01:01.820
you can easily connect to a local database.
23

23

00:01:01.820  -->  00:01:05.140
That's how you do it - you do SQLite3.connect
24

24

00:01:05.140  -->  00:01:08.440
and then as a string, you give it the data file.
25

25

00:01:08.440  -->  00:01:10.240
Remember this is going to be single file letters
26

26

00:01:10.240  -->  00:01:14.530
going to contain all, your entire, SQLite database.
27

27

00:01:14.530  -->  00:01:17.100
The file is normally named data.db,
28

28

00:01:17.100  -->  00:01:18.040
that's just the convention.
29

29

00:01:18.040  -->  00:01:20.600
You can name it whatever you want, of course.
30

30

00:01:20.600  -->  00:01:23.430
And always after we finish with a connection
31

31

00:01:23.430  -->  00:01:25.400
remember to close the connection.
32

32

00:01:25.400  -->  00:01:27.750
Does it remind you of something?
33

33

00:01:27.750  -->  00:01:31.030
I hope it reminds you of files or it looks pretty similar.
34

34

00:01:32.090  -->  00:01:33.040
Okay.
35

35

00:01:33.040  -->  00:01:35.230
So after you've got the connection,
36

36

00:01:35.230  -->  00:01:38.630
you will want to get a cursor for that connection
37

37

00:01:38.630  -->  00:01:40.190
that's there in line three.
38

38

00:01:41.060  -->  00:01:43.410
You can see that cursor equals connection.cursor
39

39

00:01:43.410  -->  00:01:45.780
and that gives you a new cursor that you can use
40

40

00:01:45.780  -->  00:01:47.480
to execute SQL Querys.
41

41

00:01:48.340  -->  00:01:49.950
I'm going to explain exactly what a cursor is
42

42

00:01:49.950  -->  00:01:52.190
in the next video so don't worry.
43

43

00:01:52.190  -->  00:01:54.590
Once you've executed your SQL Query,
44

44

00:01:55.660  -->  00:01:58.530
you can commit the connection.
45

45

00:01:58.530  -->  00:02:00.600
And what that's going to do is it's going
46

46

00:02:00.600  -->  00:02:03.230
to save the contents of whatever changes you've made
47

47

00:02:03.230  -->  00:02:04.063
to the disc.
48

48

00:02:04.063  -->  00:02:06.720
I'm going to explain that in the next video as well.
49

49

00:02:06.720  -->  00:02:08.960
But this is a pretty normal flow
50

50

00:02:08.960  -->  00:02:12.981
for SQLite Querys being executed.
51

51

00:02:12.981  -->  00:02:16.410
You get your cursor, you run your Query with a cursor,
52

52

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:19.170
and then you commit the connection and you close it after.
53

53

00:02:20.630  -->  00:02:22.790
So a few questions, of course.
54

54

00:02:22.790  -->  00:02:23.810
What is a cursor?
55

55

00:02:25.210  -->  00:02:26.043
What is commit?
56

56

00:02:27.180  -->  00:02:29.850
And how do we write SQL?
57

57

00:02:29.850  -->  00:02:31.520
We're going to look at these three questions
58

58

00:02:31.520  -->  00:02:32.640
in the next video.
59

59

00:02:32.640  -->  00:02:33.740
So I'll see you there.
