<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,610  -->  00:00:02,810
In this video, we're going to use
3

3

00:00:02,810  -->  00:00:05,000
a virtualenv with the pipenv.
4

4

00:00:06,070  -->  00:00:09,350
In the last video, we saw that when we did pipenv instal,
5

5

00:00:09,350  -->  00:00:12,500
this created a virtual environment for our project,
6

6

00:00:12,500  -->  00:00:14,840
but there is no virtual environment folder
7

7

00:00:14,840  -->  00:00:16,820
inside our project, there's only
8

8

00:00:16,820  -->  00:00:19,160
a Pipfile and a Pipfile.lock.
9

9

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:23,070
Indeed, the virtualenv location
10

10

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:25,040
is a different folder entirely,
11

11

00:00:25,040  -->  00:00:29,478
it's this /User/jslvtr/.local/share/
12

12

00:00:29,478  -->  00:00:34,478
virtualenvs/scraping-books dash random numbers and letters.
13

13

00:00:36,890  -->  00:00:38,230
Now sorry about that.
14

14

00:00:38,230  -->  00:00:41,050
So pipenv has actually created the virtual environment
15

15

00:00:41,050  -->  00:00:44,610
in an entirely different place, which is
16

16

00:00:44,610  -->  00:00:48,260
a unique folder just for this project.
17

17

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:54,260
Whenever you use pipenv, you can do run python
18

18

00:00:57,870  -->  00:01:01,780
and this is going to run the Python interpreter
19

19

00:01:01,780  -->  00:01:05,090
in that virtual environment, so when you proceed
20

20

00:01:05,090  -->  00:01:09,310
anything by pipenv run, that's going to use
21

21

00:01:09,310  -->  00:01:12,220
a virtual environment that was created for you,
22

22

00:01:12,220  -->  00:01:14,990
not inside this folder but in somewhere else,
23

23

00:01:14,990  -->  00:01:17,480
as where your programmes are running.
24

24

00:01:17,480  -->  00:01:20,040
So now you no longer need to activate and deactivate,
25

25

00:01:20,040  -->  00:01:22,340
all you have to do is ask pipenv
26

26

00:01:22,340  -->  00:01:24,540
to run whatever it is you want to run.
27

27

00:01:25,480  -->  00:01:28,010
So as you can see when we type pipenv run python,
28

28

00:01:28,010  -->  00:01:30,330
that went straight to Python 3.7,
29

29

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:33,290
which is what we used in our virtual environment
30

30

00:01:33,290  -->  00:01:35,420
that was created by pipenv.
31

31

00:01:35,420  -->  00:01:38,300
If we exit here by typing control d,
32

32

00:01:38,300  -->  00:01:42,690
and we type pipenv run python menu.py,
33

33

00:01:42,690  -->  00:01:44,200
you can see that it all works.
34

34

00:01:44,200  -->  00:01:47,460
All the packages are installed in the virtual environment,
35

35

00:01:47,460  -->  00:01:50,010
but the virtual environment is not inside this folder,
36

36

00:01:50,010  -->  00:01:54,130
it's somewhere else, and that's everything working there.
37

37

00:01:55,730  -->  00:01:58,410
So, pipenv actually helps you clean up
38

38

00:01:58,410  -->  00:02:02,660
your development environment, you can no longer have the vn,
39

39

00:02:02,660  -->  00:02:07,270
or you will no longer have the vn inside this folder here
40

40

00:02:07,270  -->  00:02:10,770
because pipenv says this folder is
41

41

00:02:10,770  -->  00:02:13,760
for your code and for your project,
42

42

00:02:13,760  -->  00:02:16,820
it's not for, you know, your Python installation,
43

43

00:02:16,820  -->  00:02:18,670
that doesn't make any sense.
44

44

00:02:18,670  -->  00:02:21,060
So, you keep your Pipfile and your Pipfile.lock
45

45

00:02:21,060  -->  00:02:23,690
in your project and if you share
46

46

00:02:23,690  -->  00:02:25,600
this project with someone else,
47

47

00:02:25,600  -->  00:02:27,680
they will also have a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock,
48

48

00:02:27,680  -->  00:02:30,050
they can also type pipenv instal.
49

49

00:02:30,050  -->  00:02:32,270
They will get their own virtual environment
50

50

00:02:32,270  -->  00:02:36,040
created somewhere else unique to them in their own computers
51

51

00:02:36,040  -->  00:02:39,400
and not inside the project folder.
52

52

00:02:39,400  -->  00:02:41,140
So whenever you create a new project,
53

53

00:02:41,140  -->  00:02:43,640
now instead of creating a virtual environment,
54

54

00:02:43,640  -->  00:02:45,540
just use pipenv and it will be
55

55

00:02:45,540  -->  00:02:48,400
easy to manage all your projects.
56

56

00:02:48,400  -->  00:02:49,860
In addition, you don't have
57

57

00:02:49,860  -->  00:02:52,160
to remember to activate and deactivate.
58

58

00:02:52,160  -->  00:02:54,400
Pipenv will manage your virtual environments for you,
59

59

00:02:54,400  -->  00:02:56,278
whenever you type pipenv run, it will know
60

60

00:02:56,278  -->  00:02:59,040
how to use the correct virtual environment.
61

61

00:03:00,940  -->  00:03:03,330
However, there's a caveat for that.
62

62

00:03:03,330  -->  00:03:05,240
If you move your project,
63

63

00:03:05,240  -->  00:03:07,140
we've got this scraping-books folder,
64

64

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:10,140
if I move that folder somewhere else,
65

65

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:11,760
pipenv will no longer be able to find
66

66

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:12,920
the correct virtual environment,
67

67

00:03:12,920  -->  00:03:15,100
so you'll have to recreate it.
68

68

00:03:15,100  -->  00:03:17,220
Okay, that's the only problem with pipenv,
69

69

00:03:17,220  -->  00:03:20,620
if you move the project, you'll have to recreate
70

70

00:03:20,620  -->  00:03:23,810
the virtual environment, and that is because of the way
71

71

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:25,300
that it creates the virtual environment,
72

72

00:03:25,300  -->  00:03:29,610
it creates it, and depending on where your project is,
73

73

00:03:29,610  -->  00:03:31,100
and if you move it, it sort of loses
74

74

00:03:31,100  -->  00:03:33,110
that knowledge of where it was.
75

75

00:03:34,690  -->  00:03:36,380
That's it for this video, I just wanted to show you
76

76

00:03:36,380  -->  00:03:40,693
how to use pipenv, and there's a bit more to pipenv
77

77

00:03:40,693  -->  00:03:42,890
that you can use if you type pipenv,
78

78

00:03:42,890  -->  00:03:44,850
you'll get a few other commands like,
79

79

00:03:44,850  -->  00:03:46,840
and you know how to uninstall libraries
80

80

00:03:46,840  -->  00:03:47,790
and things like that.
81

81

00:03:47,790  -->  00:03:49,410
There's some investigation you can do if
82

82

00:03:49,410  -->  00:03:53,330
you want to go into more advanced pipenv stuff,
83

83

00:03:53,330  -->  00:03:55,050
but don't worry too much about it.
84

84

00:03:55,050  -->  00:03:57,780
What you need to know is how to instal it,
85

85

00:03:57,780  -->  00:04:01,510
how to run it, in order to simplify your project management.
86

86

00:04:01,510  -->  00:04:02,830
Again, that's it for this video
87

87

00:04:02,830  -->  00:04:04,480
and I'll see you on the next one.
