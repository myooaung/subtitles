<v Jose>Hi and welcome back, in this video we're going to</v>
2

2

00:00:02,364  -->  00:00:06,331
be creating our locator files by getting data out of the
3

3

00:00:06,331  -->  00:00:08,248
HTML here using Chrome.
4

4

00:00:10,637  -->  00:00:13,894
So we said that earlier we've got two locator files in our
5

5

00:00:13,894  -->  00:00:18,727
project, the quote locators, and the quotes page locators.
6

6

00:00:19,693  -->  00:00:23,194
The quotes page is this page you see here, and the HTML
7

7

00:00:23,194  -->  00:00:28,194
is down here on the right, so let's centre on the HTML,
8

8

00:00:28,418  -->  00:00:32,168
and look at what the quote page has to offer.
9

9

00:00:33,063  -->  00:00:36,551
We have a bunch of quotes in divs, and as you can see
10

10

00:00:36,551  -->  00:00:40,801
they are each down here, so the page is essentially
11

11

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:46,477
something that contains these quotes, and it also contains
12

12

00:00:46,477  -->  00:00:50,953
a few other things like the tags and a title, and so forth.
13

13

00:00:50,953  -->  00:00:55,859
For our project, the quotes page is going to allow us to
14

14

00:00:55,859  -->  00:00:59,109
retrieve these divs here, these quotes.
15

15

00:01:01,855  -->  00:01:06,278
Now then, the quote locators are going to be the locators
16

16

00:01:06,278  -->  00:01:08,861
that are within a single quote.
17

17

00:01:10,266  -->  00:01:14,202
So our quotes page has only to worry about finding this
18

18

00:01:14,202  -->  00:01:17,738
div, and this div, and this div, and so forth, and then
19

19

00:01:17,738  -->  00:01:22,683
we're gonna give that entire element, to our quote locators
20

20

00:01:22,683  -->  00:01:26,235
and they're gonna be able to find, this span, this other
21

21

00:01:26,235  -->  00:01:30,902
author, and also the tags, so let's go over into PyCharm
22

22

00:01:32,104  -->  00:01:36,354
and start by creating the quotes page locators, OK?
23

23

00:01:41,352  -->  00:01:44,296
So, go over quotes_page_locators and we're gonna create
24

24

00:01:44,296  -->  00:01:49,154
a class here called QuotesPageLocators, and all this is
25

25

00:01:49,154  -->  00:01:52,705
gonna contain is a single constant, a constant in Python,
26

26

00:01:52,705  -->  00:01:56,027
I'm not sure if we've mentioned this before, is normally
27

27

00:01:56,027  -->  00:01:59,586
a variable that's all in upper case, and this is gonna
28

28

00:01:59,586  -->  00:02:04,253
contain "div.quote", and if we go back to Chrome, we can
29

29

00:02:05,350  -->  00:02:09,338
see that "div.quote" is going to give us this div here,
30

30

00:02:09,338  -->  00:02:11,579
with this "class" quote.
31

31

00:02:11,579  -->  00:02:15,190
But if we find many of them, it's gonna give us this one,
32

32

00:02:15,190  -->  00:02:18,289
this one, this one, this one, it's gonna give us all of
33

33

00:02:18,289  -->  00:02:20,466
these in this page.
34

34

00:02:20,466  -->  00:02:24,349
So when we use that locator, we'll be able to find
35

35

00:02:24,349  -->  00:02:29,156
all of these divs, for each div, we're going to use
36

36

00:02:29,156  -->  00:02:34,156
the locators in here, so if we now go to the quote locators,
37

37

00:02:35,042  -->  00:02:39,709
we're going to create some quote locators, and these
38

38

00:02:39,709  -->  00:02:43,436
are going to be one for each thing that we want to extract
39

39

00:02:43,436  -->  00:02:44,812
from a quote.
40

40

00:02:44,812  -->  00:02:46,479
So that's an author,
41

41

00:02:50,532  -->  00:02:54,365
a content or a quote, and also a tags locator.
42

42

00:02:55,913  -->  00:03:00,597
OK, let's fill these in, the author, content, and tags.
43

43

00:03:00,597  -->  00:03:04,411
So for the author, we're going to look for this small
44

44

00:03:04,411  -->  00:03:09,150
class "author", this tag here, so if we go back to PyCharm,
45

45

00:03:09,150  -->  00:03:13,535
in the author we can put "small.author", that's going to
46

46

00:03:13,535  -->  00:03:18,535
look again for the "small" tag that has class "author".
47

47

00:03:18,868  -->  00:03:21,897
For the content, we are looking for "span" with a class
48

48

00:03:21,897  -->  00:03:22,730
of "text",
49

49

00:03:26,809  -->  00:03:30,849
and finally for the tags, we are looking for a "div"
50

50

00:03:30,849  -->  00:03:34,629
that has class "tags", this one here, but we are actually
51

51

00:03:34,629  -->  00:03:37,885
looking for each of these "a" tags, so that we can extract
52

52

00:03:37,885  -->  00:03:41,194
the different tags that are in there.
53

53

00:03:41,194  -->  00:03:44,520
So we're gonna look for "div.tags", and inside it
54

54

00:03:44,520  -->  00:03:48,787
"a.tag", and we're gonna find multiple of them.
55

55

00:03:48,787  -->  00:03:53,287
So there's gonna be "div.tags", and in it "a.tag", OK?
56

56

00:03:56,293  -->  00:04:00,124
These are locators so given one of these quotes, with
57

57

00:04:00,124  -->  00:04:03,607
this locator, we'll be able to find the author.
58

58

00:04:03,607  -->  00:04:07,194
So once again, going back to the HTML, given one of these
59

59

00:04:07,194  -->  00:04:11,723
quotes, one of these divs specifically, these locators are
60

60

00:04:11,723  -->  00:04:15,849
unique enough that we'll be able to find the quote contents
61

61

00:04:15,849  -->  00:04:20,551
using "span.text", the author using "small.author",
62

62

00:04:20,551  -->  00:04:23,801
and the tags using "div.tags", "a.tag".
63

63

00:04:25,654  -->  00:04:29,904
Now if we were given this entire page, we would not know
64

64

00:04:29,904  -->  00:04:33,176
whether to extract the quote contents from the first quote
65

65

00:04:33,176  -->  00:04:35,856
or from the second quote, or from the third quote, and
66

66

00:04:35,856  -->  00:04:39,447
so forth, so what we're going to do, is we are going to give
67

67

00:04:39,447  -->  00:04:44,434
our, a parser, what's gonna use those locators, only one
68

68

00:04:44,434  -->  00:04:47,952
of these divs, and then with that one, it's gonna be able to
69

69

00:04:47,952  -->  00:04:50,860
find the correct element, and we're gonna treat them
70

70

00:04:50,860  -->  00:04:53,786
independently, I know this doesn't make much sense just yet,
71

71

00:04:53,786  -->  00:04:57,721
but believe me, as we progress through this app, it's going
72

72

00:04:57,721  -->  00:05:00,386
to make more and more sense, for now, just trust me that
73

73

00:05:00,386  -->  00:05:03,921
this is the way to go forward, and let's go over to the
74

74

00:05:03,921  -->  00:05:08,168
next video, where we're going to look at creating our pages.
75

75

00:05:08,168  -->  00:05:09,390
I'll see you there.
