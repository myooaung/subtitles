<v Instructor>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,430  -->  00:00:03,800 line:15% 
In this video we're going to be creating our quotes page
3

3

00:00:03,800  -->  00:00:05,810
and I think everything's gonna make sense,
4

4

00:00:05,810  -->  00:00:08,810
and it's gonna click, once we finish creating this
5

5

00:00:08,810  -->  00:00:11,990
and we write a couple of lines of code in our app .py.
6

6

00:00:11,990  -->  00:00:13,810
What I'm going to do in the quote pages
7

7

00:00:13,810  -->  00:00:16,360
is import BeautifulSoup.
8

8

00:00:16,360  -->  00:00:19,010
Notice how I didn't do that in the quotes page,
9

9

00:00:19,010  -->  00:00:20,640
because we didn't need to.
10

10

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:25,320
Then I am going to import our quote page locator,
11

11

00:00:27,018  -->  00:00:31,690
and also I'm going to import our quote parser.
12

12

00:00:32,720  -->  00:00:34,910
Then, creating a quotes page,
13

13

00:00:34,910  -->  00:00:36,950
we're going to define an innate method,
14

14

00:00:36,950  -->  00:00:40,490
and this one is going to take in the page content,
15

15

00:00:40,490  -->  00:00:44,080
so that's the entire html of the entire page.
16

16

00:00:44,080  -->  00:00:47,300
And we're going to load that using requests, in a moment.
17

17

00:00:48,170  -->  00:00:50,650
Now this, already we know and love.
18

18

00:00:50,650  -->  00:00:52,130
We've done this in the past.
19

19

00:00:52,130  -->  00:00:56,630
We're gonna say self.soup is BeautifulSoup of page,
20

20

00:00:56,630  -->  00:00:58,320
I'm giving it an html parser.
21

21

00:01:00,800  -->  00:01:02,870
Then, we're going to define a property in here,
22

22

00:01:02,870  -->  00:01:04,000
which is the quotes,
23

23

00:01:04,900  -->  00:01:06,400
and what this is going to do is,
24

24

00:01:06,400  -->  00:01:08,190
it's going to grab the locator,
25

25

00:01:08,190  -->  00:01:10,960
which is the QuotesPageLocators.QUOTE,
26

26

00:01:12,840  -->  00:01:15,697
then it's going to...
27

27

00:01:15,697  -->  00:01:16,780
Quote_tags...
28

28

00:01:17,860  -->  00:01:19,780
It's going to find all of them,
29

29

00:01:19,780  -->  00:01:24,780
so it's gonna do self.soup.select with that locator,
30

30

00:01:25,660  -->  00:01:27,370
and finally what it's going to do is,
31

31

00:01:27,370  -->  00:01:31,310
it's going to return a quote parser
32

32

00:01:33,030  -->  00:01:35,640
for each element in quote tags.
33

33

00:01:36,845  -->  00:01:39,110
OK, so hopefully this starts to make
34

34

00:01:39,110  -->  00:01:40,940
a little bit more sense.
35

35

00:01:40,940  -->  00:01:45,810
What we do is we find each of the divs
36

36

00:01:45,810  -->  00:01:47,080
that we're looking for,
37

37

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:49,850
and each of the divs,
38

38

00:01:49,850  -->  00:01:53,380
we pass each one to a quote parser object.
39

39

00:01:54,430  -->  00:01:58,870
That quote parser can then use that pairing
40

40

00:01:58,870  -->  00:02:01,080
to find children inside it,
41

41

00:02:01,080  -->  00:02:04,350
so it here is doing self.parent, which is the div,
42

42

00:02:04,350  -->  00:02:07,050
dot select one of the content locators.
43

43

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:09,420
So it's going to find the content locator
44

44

00:02:09,420  -->  00:02:13,060
within this parent and not within any other parent.
45

45

00:02:13,060  -->  00:02:15,960
Similarly for the author, and similarly for the tags.
46

46

00:02:17,210  -->  00:02:21,650
So now this page has this quotes property,
47

47

00:02:21,650  -->  00:02:24,950
and what it returns are a group of objects
48

48

00:02:24,950  -->  00:02:28,390
of type quote parser, from which we can access
49

49

00:02:28,390  -->  00:02:31,880
the name of the author, the content of the quote,
50

50

00:02:31,880  -->  00:02:32,950
and the tags.
51

51

00:02:34,200  -->  00:02:36,870
So if we go to our app .py now,
52

52

00:02:36,870  -->  00:02:40,660
you'll see that this starts to make a bit more sense.
53

53

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:43,000
I'm gonna import requests,
54

54

00:02:43,000  -->  00:02:47,860
and from the quotes page I'm gonna import the quotes page...
55

55

00:02:50,108  -->  00:02:51,980
QuotesPage, that one!
56

56

00:02:53,120  -->  00:02:54,270
Now the first thing to do of course,
57

57

00:02:54,270  -->  00:02:56,310
is to get the page content,
58

58

00:02:56,310  -->  00:02:58,660
which we must do using requests.
59

59

00:02:58,660  -->  00:03:03,660
So request.get, http://quotes.toscrape.com.content.
60

60

00:03:04,860  -->  00:03:07,030
This is going to get the page
61

61

00:03:07,030  -->  00:03:09,940
and this is going to give me the content of the page.
62

62

00:03:11,020  -->  00:03:14,040
Now, this entire content, everything we've loaded,
63

63

00:03:15,140  -->  00:03:17,680
we give it to our quotes page object.
64

64

00:03:19,110  -->  00:03:21,950
This now gets parsed using BeautifulSoup,
65

65

00:03:21,950  -->  00:03:25,060
because the constructor here, the init method,
66

66

00:03:25,060  -->  00:03:25,893
does that.
67

67

00:03:25,893  -->  00:03:30,350
It gets the BeautifulSoup, and parses the entire page.
68

68

00:03:30,350  -->  00:03:32,130
Going back to app .py,
69

69

00:03:32,130  -->  00:03:36,950
we can then do for_quote in page.quotes, print, quote.
70

70

00:03:39,640  -->  00:03:41,230
When we print quote, that's gonna,
71

71

00:03:41,230  -->  00:03:44,270
well first of all page.quotes is going to give us
72

72

00:03:44,270  -->  00:03:46,070
quote parser objects,
73

73

00:03:46,990  -->  00:03:50,010
and each quote parser object has a repr method
74

74

00:03:50,010  -->  00:03:53,040
that is going to get called when we print it out.
75

75

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:56,800
So when we print, it's going to go through each quote
76

76

00:03:56,800  -->  00:03:59,700
in the quotes and list we got back,
77

77

00:03:59,700  -->  00:04:01,000
and it's going to print it out.
78

78

00:04:01,000  -->  00:04:03,440 line:15% 
Let's right click .py, and run it,
79

79

00:04:04,340  -->  00:04:06,040 line:15% 
and there you have it.
80

80

00:04:06,040  -->  00:04:08,670 line:15% 
We get our quote objects like that.
81

81

00:04:09,860  -->  00:04:12,220 line:15% 
If you wanted to just print the name,
82

82

00:04:14,200  -->  00:04:16,390 line:15% 
sorry, dot content,
83

83

00:04:16,390  -->  00:04:18,120 line:15% 
not the name, the content of the quote,
84

84

00:04:18,120  -->  00:04:19,400 line:15% 
you could do that,
85

85

00:04:19,400  -->  00:04:22,160 line:15% 
and then you just get the content of the quote here.
86

86

00:04:24,180  -->  00:04:26,540
Hopefully this makes a little bit more sense.
87

87

00:04:26,540  -->  00:04:29,010
Let's go over it again in the very next video.
88

88

00:04:29,010  -->  00:04:29,960
I'll see you there.
