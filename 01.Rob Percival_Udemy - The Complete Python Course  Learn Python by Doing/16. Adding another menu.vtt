<v ->Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>

00:00:02.279  -->  00:00:05.280 line:15% 
In this video, we're going to be adding another menu,
3

3

00:00:05.280  -->  00:00:08.036
just for a quick about page in our application.
4

4

00:00:08.036  -->  00:00:11.883
Let's go down to the bottom of our file
5

5

00:00:11.883  -->  00:00:15.980
and we're gonna add another menu as well as the file menu.
6

6

00:00:15.980  -->  00:00:19.073
We're gonna do help menu and it's gonna be another tk.menu
7

7

00:00:19.073  -->  00:00:20.651
inside of the menu bar.
8

8

00:00:20.651  -->  00:00:24.744
And then, we will do menubar.add_cascade
9

9

00:00:24.744  -->  00:00:28.024
and the menu is going to be the help menu
10

10

00:00:28.024  -->  00:00:31.763
and the label is going to be help.
11

11

00:00:32.700  -->  00:00:35.760
Then, down here, we will also add a command.
12

12

00:00:35.760  -->  00:00:40.435
So the help_menu.add_command, the label will be about
13

13

00:00:40.435  -->  00:00:44.377
and the command is show_about_info.
14

14

00:00:45.440  -->  00:00:48.100
So, this is a new function we're gonna create just now.
15

15

00:00:48.100  -->  00:00:49.355
Let's create it up here.
16

16

00:00:49.355  -->  00:00:53.734
Show_about_info and it's just going to launch a message box.
17

17

00:00:53.734  -->  00:00:55.726
So we will say showinfo.
18

18

00:00:55.726  -->  00:00:57.983
The title is going to be about
19

19

00:00:57.983  -->  00:01:02.039
and the message is going to be something like this.
20

20

00:01:02.039  -->  00:01:06.286
All right, so just a simple message that can be shown there.
21

21

00:01:06.286  -->  00:01:08.590
And we will use this to show you
22

22

00:01:08.590  -->  00:01:10.140
how to define multiple menus.
23

23

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:12.010
You can see them up here, file and help.
24

24

00:01:12.010  -->  00:01:14.970
And when you click on it, you get the about.
25

25

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:18.957
Notice that whenever you add a help menu in Mac,
26

26

00:01:18.957  -->  00:01:22.524
you also get this search, this comes by default with MacOS
27

27

00:01:22.524  -->  00:01:25.746
and allows you to do searches for other menu items
28

28

00:01:25.746  -->  00:01:27.228
inside your application.
29

29

00:01:27.228  -->  00:01:28.940
It can be pretty handy.
30

30

00:01:28.940  -->  00:01:31.270
But, if you don't get that because you're not using Mac,
31

31

00:01:31.270  -->  00:01:32.952
that's okay, don't worry about it.
32

32

00:01:32.952  -->  00:01:36.068
This is how you can create multiple menus
33

33

00:01:36.068  -->  00:01:37.591
in your application.
34

34

00:01:37.591  -->  00:01:39.610
Just copy what we had already,
35

35

00:01:39.610  -->  00:01:41.039
add a new one and it just appears there.
36

36

00:01:41.039  -->  00:01:43.925
And also, how you can show an info box
37

37

00:01:43.925  -->  00:01:46.013
with the messagebox.showinfo.
38

38

00:01:47.336  -->  00:01:49.663
Thanks for joining me in this video,
39

39

00:01:49.663  -->  00:01:51.273 line:15% 
I'll see you in the next one.
