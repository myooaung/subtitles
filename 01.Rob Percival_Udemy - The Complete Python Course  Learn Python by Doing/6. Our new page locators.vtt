<v Jose>Hi, guys, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.870  -->  00:00:03.380
In this video, we're going to be finding
3

3

00:00:03.380  -->  00:00:07.080
which locators we need for our new page.
4

4

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:09.750
First of all, let's load up quotes dot toscrape dot com
5

5

00:00:09.750  -->  00:00:13.210
slash search dot aspx and go over
6

6

00:00:13.210  -->  00:00:16.290
and right click on the first dropdown.
7

7

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:18.620
This first dropdown is one we're gonna need
8

8

00:00:18.620  -->  00:00:20.850
in order to be able to interact with it.
9

9

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:23.020
Notice that we don't care for the label.
10

10

00:00:23.020  -->  00:00:25.540
We just care about the select.
11

11

00:00:25.540  -->  00:00:30.520
And here we've got a select and the ID is author.
12

12

00:00:30.520  -->  00:00:32.850
So just keep note of that and put it in your project
13

13

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:35.640
or just wait for a second and I'll do that as well.
14

14

00:00:35.640  -->  00:00:40.640
The tag select is another select with ID of tag.
15

15

00:00:40.990  -->  00:00:43.570
Once you've got IDs on your page,
16

16

00:00:43.570  -->  00:00:46.280
that's what you should be using to find elements
17

17

00:00:46.280  -->  00:00:48.590
because the ID is supposed to be unique
18

18

00:00:48.590  -->  00:00:50.870
so as long as the page was designed correctly,
19

19

00:00:50.870  -->  00:00:53.580
IDs should be unique.
20

20

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:58.350
So there you have the select ID author and select ID tag.
21

21

00:00:58.350  -->  00:01:02.410
And finally, you have the button which is an input,
22

22

00:01:02.410  -->  00:01:06.780
type submit, and the name is submit underscore button.
23

23

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:09.030
We can use the name in as used as selector
24

24

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:12.680
so we are going to do input with name submit button
25

25

00:01:12.680  -->  00:01:14.674
and that's what we're going to be using to search.
26

26

00:01:14.674  -->  00:01:19.674
Now we also need to keep track of what the quote is
27

27

00:01:20.050  -->  00:01:22.030
so we that we can retrieve it after.
28

28

00:01:22.030  -->  00:01:26.180
And we've got a div class quote and then inside it,
29

29

00:01:26.180  -->  00:01:28.420
we've got a span with class of content,
30

30

00:01:28.420  -->  00:01:30.060
that's the content of the quote,
31

31

00:01:30.060  -->  00:01:33.710
a span with class of author, that's the author of the quote,
32

32

00:01:33.710  -->  00:01:35.890
and a span with class of tag,
33

33

00:01:35.890  -->  00:01:37.740
which that's the tag that we searched for.
34

34

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:40.160
That's not really necessary since we already know
35

35

00:01:40.160  -->  00:01:41.720
what we're going to search for when we selected
36

36

00:01:41.720  -->  00:01:43.730
from the dropdown so really we're just going
37

37

00:01:43.730  -->  00:01:46.150
to grab the content and author.
38

38

00:01:46.150  -->  00:01:49.180
Let's go back to PyCharm and note these down.
39

39

00:01:49.180  -->  00:01:52.170
Back in PyCham, I'm gonna open the quote locators
40

40

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:54.150
and the quotes page locators and we're going
41

41

00:01:54.150  -->  00:01:56.210
to add a couple of things here.
42

42

00:01:56.210  -->  00:01:59.290
The author dropdown is going to be a select
43

43

00:01:59.290  -->  00:02:02.660
with tag of author, the tag dropdown is going to be
44

44

00:02:02.660  -->  00:02:07.660
a select with ID of tag, and the search button
45

45

00:02:07.720  -->  00:02:10.720
is going to be an input which I'm actually going
46

46

00:02:10.720  -->  00:02:12.010
to use single quote and input
47

47

00:02:12.010  -->  00:02:15.730
with name equal submit underscore button.
48

48

00:02:15.730  -->  00:02:19.100
This is how you can search by attributes in CSS by the way,
49

49

00:02:19.100  -->  00:02:21.240
with these square brackets and inside you can see
50

50

00:02:21.240  -->  00:02:25.510
the attribute name and then equal and the attribute value
51

51

00:02:25.510  -->  00:02:28.210
so if you wanted to search by value for example,
52

52

00:02:28.210  -->  00:02:30.890
it would be value equal whatever.
53

53

00:02:30.890  -->  00:02:32.340
But if you were searching by name,
54

54

00:02:32.340  -->  00:02:34.954
so it is name equal whatever.
55

55

00:02:34.954  -->  00:02:38.130
Then in the quote locators, we're going to go here
56

56

00:02:38.130  -->  00:02:40.440
and we're just going to make a couple of small changes
57

57

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:44.733
because the content locator is now span dot content,
58

58

00:02:44.733  -->  00:02:49.300
the author locator is span dot author,
59

59

00:02:49.300  -->  00:02:53.133
and the tag locator is span dot tag.
60

60

00:02:54.070  -->  00:02:56.250
Okay, we're not going to use this one so, yeah,
61

61

00:02:56.250  -->  00:02:58.280
we'll just put it there anyway just in case
62

62

00:02:58.280  -->  00:03:00.920
but for now, this is all we need in order
63

63

00:03:00.920  -->  00:03:04.519
to access our new elements in the new page.
64

64

00:03:04.519  -->  00:03:06.620
Another thing that you may wanna do is of course
65

65

00:03:06.620  -->  00:03:11.130
go to app dot py and change this to slash search dot aspx.
66

66

00:03:11.130  -->  00:03:12.994
If you run this now, you'll see
67

67

00:03:12.994  -->  00:03:16.630
that nothing very interesting happens.
68

68

00:03:16.630  -->  00:03:19.800
You load the page and then nothing gets printed out
69

69

00:03:19.800  -->  00:03:22.978
because our locators are now for this new page
70

70

00:03:22.978  -->  00:03:25.760
but our code here, like getting the quotes and stuff
71

71

00:03:25.760  -->  00:03:26.810
is for the old page.
72

72

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:28.440
But you can see that there are no quotes
73

73

00:03:28.440  -->  00:03:31.700
in this page to be shown so nothing happens.
74

74

00:03:31.700  -->  00:03:34.340
We're gonna have to change it so that we actually interact
75

75

00:03:34.340  -->  00:03:36.700
with a new page here instead of just treating it
76

76

00:03:36.700  -->  00:03:38.040
like the old page.
77

77

00:03:38.040  -->  00:03:39.770
Let's do that in the next video.
78

78

00:03:39.770  -->  00:03:40.763
I'll see you there.
