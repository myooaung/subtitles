<v ->Hi, guys, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,530  -->  00:00:03,862
In this video, we're going to be encapsulating our logic
3

3

00:00:03,862  -->  00:00:08,260
into our page so that it the app dot py becomes much simpler
4

4

00:00:08,260  -->  00:00:11,363
and we can very easily reproduce a search.
5

5

00:00:12,510  -->  00:00:16,312
I'm gonna start off at app dot py again by asking the user
6

6

00:00:16,312  -->  00:00:21,312
what author they want and what tag they want.
7

7

00:00:23,920  -->  00:00:26,480
Now, I'm no longer going to be showing the user what tags
8

8

00:00:26,480  -->  00:00:28,440
there are available because I want to run
9

9

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:30,016
through the search very quickly
10

10

00:00:30,016  -->  00:00:34,060
so this is just an alternative way of doing things.
11

11

00:00:34,060  -->  00:00:36,747
Instead of getting the available tags and printing that,
12

12

00:00:36,747  -->  00:00:39,070
we're going to just delete that, we're gonna delete that,
13

13

00:00:39,070  -->  00:00:40,210
we're gonna delete that,
14

14

00:00:40,210  -->  00:00:43,560
and we're left with the central part of the logic
15

15

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:46,410
which is select an author, select a tag,
16

16

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:47,943
and click the search button.
17

17

00:00:48,920  -->  00:00:52,270
So we're going to cut that and we're gonna
18

18

00:00:52,270  -->  00:00:57,270
instead do page dot search for quotes, author, and tag
19

19

00:00:58,190  -->  00:01:00,060
or select a tag rather.
20

20

00:01:00,060  -->  00:01:01,660
I'm just gonna rename it to tag.
21

21

00:01:02,500  -->  00:01:05,130
Now, we're also going to print this
22

22

00:01:05,130  -->  00:01:07,670
because we wanna be as simple as possible.
23

23

00:01:07,670  -->  00:01:11,580
So what this is gonna do is something slightly different.
24

24

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:15,767
It's no longer saying, hey, I wanna do this with the page.
25

25

00:01:15,767  -->  00:01:18,920
Now this is saying I wanna use this page to search
26

26

00:01:18,920  -->  00:01:20,440
for quotes and I don't actually care
27

27

00:01:20,440  -->  00:01:22,227
what happens to the page itself.
28

28

00:01:22,227  -->  00:01:24,930
This is a slightly different way of going
29

29

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:27,460
about interacting with the page using selenium
30

30

00:01:27,460  -->  00:01:28,910
but it's a perfectly valid way
31

31

00:01:28,910  -->  00:01:31,120
and something I'll encourage you to do.
32

32

00:01:31,120  -->  00:01:34,010
If you can encapsulate actions within the page,
33

33

00:01:34,010  -->  00:01:37,350
it's gonna make using the page very easy.
34

34

00:01:37,350  -->  00:01:40,420
So going over to quotes page now down here,
35

35

00:01:40,420  -->  00:01:42,662
we're gonna add our method
36

36

00:01:42,662  -->  00:01:47,650
and that is going to be search for quotes.
37

37

00:01:47,650  -->  00:01:50,150
Takes in an author name which a string and a tag name
38

38

00:01:50,150  -->  00:01:51,920
which is a string and it's gonna return
39

39

00:01:51,920  -->  00:01:54,823
a list of quote parser.
40

40

00:01:55,760  -->  00:01:58,030
Okay, the first thing it's gonna do is
41

41

00:01:58,030  -->  00:02:03,030
is going to do self select author, author name.
42

42

00:02:03,130  -->  00:02:05,974
So just gonna call this method here.
43

43

00:02:05,974  -->  00:02:09,710
Then, it's going to try to do something
44

44

00:02:09,710  -->  00:02:13,560
and what it's going to try to do is select a tag
45

45

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:15,600
and that's gonna be the tag name.
46

46

00:02:15,600  -->  00:02:19,290
But it's possible that it won't find it.
47

47

00:02:19,290  -->  00:02:22,620
No such element exception.
48

48

00:02:22,620  -->  00:02:25,957
And this one here has to be imported by the way
49

49

00:02:25,957  -->  00:02:30,957
from selenium so import selenium and there you go.
50

50

00:02:31,950  -->  00:02:35,090
So you wanna do from selenium common exceptions,
51

51

00:02:35,090  -->  00:02:37,563
import no such element exception.
52

52

00:02:37,563  -->  00:02:42,563
If it can't find it, that means that this tag didn't exist
53

53

00:02:43,390  -->  00:02:48,250
for this author so we're gonna raise an invalid tag
54

54

00:02:48,250  -->  00:02:52,150
for author error and finally if that doesn't happen,
55

55

00:02:52,150  -->  00:02:55,530
it's gonna do self dot search button, click,
56

56

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:57,878
and then return self dot quote.
57

57

00:02:57,878  -->  00:03:02,723
Now we do need to have this invalid tag for author error
58

58

00:03:02,723  -->  00:03:05,840
which is going to be a value error subclass
59

59

00:03:05,840  -->  00:03:07,838
and it's not going to do anything.
60

60

00:03:07,838  -->  00:03:12,063
Okay, and capital F, there you go.
61

61

00:03:12,063  -->  00:03:15,300
So, went a bit quickly there but all this is doing
62

62

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:17,960
is selecting and author, then selecting a tag,
63

63

00:03:17,960  -->  00:03:20,270
then clicking the button, and then returning quotes.
64

64

00:03:20,270  -->  00:03:21,890
And notice that all this is doing
65

65

00:03:21,890  -->  00:03:24,190
is it's using other methods and properties
66

66

00:03:24,190  -->  00:03:27,820
that we have previously defined and used in app dot py.
67

67

00:03:27,820  -->  00:03:31,377
This is a very natural progression for your applications.
68

68

00:03:31,377  -->  00:03:34,160
First, you define your application as doing something
69

69

00:03:34,160  -->  00:03:36,810
and then you encapsulate that application logic
70

70

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:38,670
into a method or a function.
71

71

00:03:38,670  -->  00:03:41,112
Here, pulling it inside this page makes sense
72

72

00:03:41,112  -->  00:03:44,425
because it modifies and interacts with the page itself.
73

73

00:03:44,425  -->  00:03:48,040
By allowing the page to give us everything that you need
74

74

00:03:48,040  -->  00:03:49,827
in order to search and find quotes,
75

75

00:03:49,827  -->  00:03:52,575
it means that your apps become much simpler
76

76

00:03:52,575  -->  00:03:55,390
and also the page can still work as normal
77

77

00:03:55,390  -->  00:03:57,146
using the other methods if you want.
78

78

00:03:57,146  -->  00:04:00,899
We've added some error handling with this try, except
79

79

00:04:00,899  -->  00:04:03,710
just in case that this tag name is invalid
80

80

00:04:03,710  -->  00:04:05,280
because we're no longer telling the user
81

81

00:04:05,280  -->  00:04:09,330
what tags are valid so doing that will raise an error
82

82

00:04:09,330  -->  00:04:11,083
if the tag doesn't exist.
83

83

00:04:12,540  -->  00:04:15,110
Let's go over to app dot py and run it.
84

84

00:04:15,110  -->  00:04:17,290
And now you'll see that we've done another improvement.
85

85

00:04:17,290  -->  00:04:20,460
We ask for the author and the tag first
86

86

00:04:20,460  -->  00:04:23,310
and then we do the slow thing, which is launch in chrome.
87

87

00:04:23,310  -->  00:04:26,873
So we're gonna do Bob Marley and music.
88

88

00:04:28,050  -->  00:04:31,360
And now here comes chrome and everything happens instantly.
89

89

00:04:31,360  -->  00:04:35,920
It's now waiting for us to type so there you have
90

90

00:04:35,920  -->  00:04:38,767
your programme and then you have your quote.
91

91

00:04:38,767  -->  00:04:42,320
Because this application only ever prints out one quote
92

92

00:04:42,320  -->  00:04:45,810
for this tag, you get a list of one element
93

93

00:04:45,810  -->  00:04:48,760
but if there were more, you would get a list of all quotes.
94

94

00:04:49,970  -->  00:04:53,580
This is how we can encapsulate some logic into our page
95

95

00:04:53,580  -->  00:04:56,680
and this is really helpful to simplify your applications.
96

96

00:04:56,680  -->  00:04:58,070
Thanks for joining me in this video
97

97

00:04:58,070  -->  00:04:59,720
and I'll see you in the next one.
