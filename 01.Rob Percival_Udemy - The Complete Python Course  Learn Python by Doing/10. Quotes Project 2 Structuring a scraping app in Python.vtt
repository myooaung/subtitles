<v Instructor>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.490  -->  00:00:02.750
In this video we're going to be setting
3

3

00:00:02.750  -->  00:00:05.900
up our project to scrape quotes.
4

4

00:00:05.900  -->  00:00:07.440
Well of those I've created a new project
5

5

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:09.230
called Scraping Quotes.
6

6

00:00:09.230  -->  00:00:12.220
The code to which is linked in the lecture,
7

7

00:00:12.220  -->  00:00:15.330
and so feel free to have a wee look at it if you want,
8

8

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:19.090
but I'd recommend you go through the few videos here
9

9

00:00:19.090  -->  00:00:21.580
and just before going into the code.
10

10

00:00:21.580  -->  00:00:22.610
'Cause the way we're going to structure
11

11

00:00:22.610  -->  00:00:24.840
the app may be a bit different from,
12

12

00:00:24.840  -->  00:00:27.878
or more complicated than other things we've done before.
13

13

00:00:27.878  -->  00:00:30.100
We're going to create a new Python file,
14

14

00:00:30.100  -->  00:00:31.740
which is going to be app.
15

15

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:35.180
This is going to be the entry point of our application.
16

16

00:00:35.180  -->  00:00:37.150
We're going to be running this file.
17

17

00:00:38.090  -->  00:00:40.830
We're also going to create a couple of packages.
18

18

00:00:40.830  -->  00:00:43.940
We're going to create a pages package.
19

19

00:00:43.940  -->  00:00:45.510
We're going to create a new package
20

20

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:48.810
also on the top called locators.
21

21

00:00:48.810  -->  00:00:51.570
So, notice how our scraping quotes project
22

22

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:55.400
contains locators, pages, and app,
23

23

00:00:55.400  -->  00:00:56.880
and finally, we're also going to create
24

24

00:00:56.880  -->  00:00:59.380
a final package called parsers.
25

25

00:01:00.400  -->  00:01:03.330
So now it contains three different packages;
26

26

00:01:03.330  -->  00:01:05.940
locators, pages, parsers and app.
27

27

00:01:07.410  -->  00:01:10.210
The purpose of these is to separate
28

28

00:01:10.210  -->  00:01:13.000
the different parts of our programme.
29

29

00:01:13.000  -->  00:01:14.923
The locators is going to contain,
30

30

00:01:14.923  -->  00:01:17.830
you guessed it, the locators of where things
31

31

00:01:17.830  -->  00:01:21.410
are in the html, how we can find things.
32

32

00:01:21.410  -->  00:01:24.800
The pages is going to contain the code
33

33

00:01:24.800  -->  00:01:28.920
to use those locators to find particular things in a page.
34

34

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:32.240
And finally, the parsers are very similar to pages,
35

35

00:01:32.240  -->  00:01:35.370
but for specific things that we want to work with.
36

36

00:01:35.370  -->  00:01:36.830
Now, okay.
37

37

00:01:36.830  -->  00:01:39.340
Then we're gonna create a few files.
38

38

00:01:39.340  -->  00:01:42.350
For the locators we're gonna create two files;
39

39

00:01:42.350  -->  00:01:43.650
quote locators,
40

40

00:01:45.350  -->  00:01:48.680
and also a quotes page locators.
41

41

00:01:51.020  -->  00:01:53.720
The quote locators are those locators
42

42

00:01:53.720  -->  00:01:56.190
used when we want to extract information
43

43

00:01:56.190  -->  00:01:58.810
from within a single quote.
44

44

00:01:58.810  -->  00:02:01.040
Quotes page locators are the locators
45

45

00:02:01.040  -->  00:02:03.670
for when we want to extract quotes from a page.
46

46

00:02:04.910  -->  00:02:09.010
In the pages we're going to create a quotes page.
47

47

00:02:09.010  -->  00:02:11.630
This is going to contain some code related to getting
48

48

00:02:11.630  -->  00:02:13.470
data out of the quotes page,
49

49

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:15.870
which is the main page that we saw earlier
50

50

00:02:15.870  -->  00:02:17.390
in the previous video.
51

51

00:02:17.390  -->  00:02:20.460
And finally the parsers is going to contain
52

52

00:02:20.460  -->  00:02:23.751
one quote, quote, and this is going to get some,
53

53

00:02:23.751  -->  00:02:27.760
a tag, and is going to be able to find quote data
54

54

00:02:27.760  -->  00:02:29.860
within that tag.
55

55

00:02:29.860  -->  00:02:32.500
Okay, let's move on to the next video
56

56

00:02:32.500  -->  00:02:34.700
where we're going to start writing some of these
57

57

00:02:34.700  -->  00:02:39.500
locators by comparing and finding things using the browser.
58

58

00:02:39.500  -->  00:02:41.050
I'll see you in the next video.
