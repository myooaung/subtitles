<v ->Welcome to the Complete Python Course,</v>
3

4

00:00:05.633  -->  00:00:07.066
where you'll learn how to code
4

5

00:00:07.066  -->  00:00:10.399
and use Python like a
professional software developer.
5

6

00:00:10.400  -->  00:00:12.066
My name is Jose Salvatierra,
6

7

00:00:12.066  -->  00:00:14.032
and I'm a software engineer
who has worked at one
7

8

00:00:14.033  -->  00:00:16.499
of Scotland's leading tech startups.
8

9

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:18.866
I started teaching on Udemy back in 2013,
9

10

00:00:18.866  -->  00:00:22.366
and since then I've made helping
students my full-time job.
10

11

00:00:22.366  -->  00:00:23.999
So why learn Python at all?
11

12

00:00:24.000  -->  00:00:25.566
13

13
00:00:25,566 --&gt; 00:00:28,099
Over the last few years,
Python has become more
12

14

00:00:28.100  -->  00:00:31.366
and more popular, booming
in the job market.
13

15

00:00:31.366  -->  00:00:34.432
It's also super versatile,
you can use it for anything,
14

16

00:00:34.433  -->  00:00:36.399
like machine learning, web development,
15

17

00:00:36.400  -->  00:00:39.433
desktop app development,
automation, and so much more.
16

18

00:00:39.433  -->  00:00:40.299
19

19
00:00:40,300 --&gt; 00:00:42,966
Python is one of the most
loved programming languages,
17

20

00:00:42.966  -->  00:00:45.166
and also the most wanted language,
18

21

00:00:45.166  -->  00:00:47.699
according to recent industry surveys.
19

22

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:49.933
If people aren't using Python already,
20

23

00:00:49.933  -->  00:00:51.666
they want to start using Python.
21

24

00:00:51.666  -->  00:00:52.532
25

25
00:00:52,533 --&gt; 00:00:54,866
With this course you'll
learn modern Python,
22

26

00:00:54.866  -->  00:00:56.466
and get ahead of the masses.
23

27

00:00:56.466  -->  00:00:59.299
And by the end, you will be a
confident software developer
24

28

00:00:59.300  -->  00:01:02.800
who can tackle any Python
topic and industry.
25

29

00:01:02.800  -->  00:01:04.366
Python is a great first language
26

30

00:01:04.366  -->  00:01:06.132
because it is simple and that means
27

31

00:01:06.133  -->  00:01:08.333
you can focus on real-world projects
28

32

00:01:08.333  -->  00:01:10.166
and applying your skills.
29

33

00:01:10.166  -->  00:01:12.299
Many courses cover just the basics,
30

34

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:13.366
and when you're done with them
31

35

00:01:13.366  -->  00:01:15.066
you can't really make anything.
32

36

00:01:15.066  -->  00:01:17.632
In this course, we'll not
only cover the fundamentals,
33

37

00:01:17.633  -->  00:01:18.633
but then we'll guide you
34

38

00:01:18.633  -->  00:01:20.666
through building multiple real projects
35

39

00:01:20.666  -->  00:01:22.266
to give you all the tools you need,
36

40

00:01:22.266  -->  00:01:24.232
and code like a professional.
37

41

00:01:24.233  -->  00:01:27.199
That, is the focus of this course.
38

42

00:01:27.200  -->  00:01:29.233
We'll use Python to work with files,
39

43

00:01:29.233  -->  00:01:32.366
emails, databases, web apps, desktop apps,
40

44

00:01:32.366  -->  00:01:34.466
automation projects, web scrapers,
41

45

00:01:34.466  -->  00:01:37.232
unit testing, build our
own data structures.
42

46

00:01:37.233  -->  00:01:38.333
And we'll even learn
43

47

00:01:38.333  -->  00:01:40.599
about asynchronous
development with Python.
44

48

00:01:40.600  -->  00:01:42.566
49

49
00:01:42,566 --&gt; 00:01:43,966
Throughout the course we have dozens
45

50

00:01:43.966  -->  00:01:46.066
of coding exercises that will let you type
46

51

00:01:46.066  -->  00:01:48.732
your code directly in the Udemy platform,
47

52

00:01:48.733  -->  00:01:50.566
and correct it instantly.
48

53

00:01:50.566  -->  00:01:52.266
And for any student who wants it,
49

54

00:01:52.266  -->  00:01:53.832
We also conduct code reviews
50

55

00:01:53.833  -->  00:01:56.499
that's professional software developers doing that
51

56

00:01:56.500  -->  00:01:59.466
and give you personalized feedback.
52

57

00:01:59.466  -->  00:02:02.466
