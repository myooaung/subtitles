<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.580  -->  00:00:04.620
In this video, we're going to be installing Python.
3

3

00:00:04.620  -->  00:00:07.960
All you have to do is go to python.org,
4

4

00:00:07.960  -->  00:00:10.310
then hover over the downloads tab,
5

5

00:00:10.310  -->  00:00:12.320
and click on the appropriate version.
6

6

00:00:12.320  -->  00:00:14.850
At the moment, we're on Python 3.7,
7

7

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:16.893
but this may increase later on.
8

8

00:00:18.030  -->  00:00:20.870
All content in this course works with all Python versions
9

9

00:00:20.870  -->  00:00:23.590
from 3.5 onwards, so don't worry too much
10

10

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:26.480
about which Python version you're installing.
11

11

00:00:26.480  -->  00:00:29.340
If you're using macOS, just click on the installer,
12

12

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:32.120
and follow it as you would for any other programme.
13

13

00:00:32.120  -->  00:00:33.840
If you're on Windows, though, you may need
14

14

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:36.503
to change some settings, so let's look at that now.
15

15

00:00:38.710  -->  00:00:40.570
On Windows, the process is the same.
16

16

00:00:40.570  -->  00:00:43.340
Go to python.org, hover over downloads,
17

17

00:00:43.340  -->  00:00:45.460
and download it for Windows.
18

18

00:00:45.460  -->  00:00:49.140
Do make sure that you are using Windows Vista or after
19

19

00:00:49.140  -->  00:00:52.933
as Python 3.5-plus cannot be used on XP.
20

20

00:01:02.550  -->  00:01:04.960
Once you've opened the Python installer on Windows,
21

21

00:01:04.960  -->  00:01:09.100
you gotta make sure that add Python 3.7 to PATH,
22

22

00:01:09.100  -->  00:01:12.290
this checkbox down here is checked,
23

23

00:01:12.290  -->  00:01:15.440
you do need that for everything to work well,
24

24

00:01:15.440  -->  00:01:18.070
as that allows other programmes to use Python,
25

25

00:01:18.070  -->  00:01:19.970
and because we're gonna be using PyCharm,
26

26

00:01:19.970  -->  00:01:21.570
that's gonna come in very handy.
27

27

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:24.000
Once that's checked, you can just go ahead
28

28

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:25.783
and click on instal now.
29

29

00:01:27.470  -->  00:01:29.280
And that's gonna go through and instal Python
30

30

00:01:29.280  -->  00:01:30.283
in your computer.
31

31

00:01:31.350  -->  00:01:33.900
If you're on Windows 10, once the installation completes,
32

32

00:01:33.900  -->  00:01:37.390
you will be able to disable the path length limit.
33

33

00:01:37.390  -->  00:01:40.250
What this means is that in some cases you may have
34

34

00:01:40.250  -->  00:01:43.740
a file path that is longer than the limit for Windows,
35

35

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:45.730
but you can allow Python to bypass it,
36

36

00:01:45.730  -->  00:01:49.983
which gives you more flexibility for really no drawbacks.
37

37

00:01:51.500  -->  00:01:53.710
If you're using Windows 8 or earlier,
38

38

00:01:53.710  -->  00:01:56.090
that option won't be there, but that's okay,
39

39

00:01:56.090  -->  00:01:57.930
don't worry too much about it.
40

40

00:01:57.930  -->  00:02:01.583
Once that's done, you can close and you can launch IDLE.
41

41

00:02:02.920  -->  00:02:05.800
So do make sure you open the Python 3.7 version,
42

42

00:02:05.800  -->  00:02:09.210
or whichever other version of Python you want to open.
43

43

00:02:09.210  -->  00:02:10.560
Alright, that's everything for this video.
44

44

00:02:10.560  -->  00:02:11.710
Thank you for joining me.
45

45

00:02:11.710  -->  00:02:13.220
We've learned how to instal Python
46

46

00:02:13.220  -->  00:02:14.960
and now we're ready to move on.
47

47

00:02:14.960  -->  00:02:16.510
I'll see you in the next video.
