<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,660  -->  00:00:05,150
In this video, we're gonna be pressing that search button.
3

3

00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:07,700
So, let's start with app.py.
4

4

00:00:07,700  -->  00:00:11,480
We're gonna do page.search_button.click.
5

5

00:00:11,480  -->  00:00:14,187
That's how you interact with something in Selenium
6

6

00:00:14,187  -->  00:00:16,870
and in this case it's gonna be that search button
7

7

00:00:16,870  -->  00:00:20,070
that doesn't exist on the quotes page yet
8

8

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:23,150
and then we're gonna do print page.quotes.
9

9

00:00:23,150  -->  00:00:25,180
So, let's go over to the quotes page
10

10

00:00:25,180  -->  00:00:27,530
and add our search button.
11

11

00:00:27,530  -->  00:00:28,850
I'm just gonna add it down here
12

12

00:00:28,850  -->  00:00:30,170
underneath the tags dropdown.
13

13

00:00:30,170  -->  00:00:32,110
It's gonna be a property search_button
14

14

00:00:34,533  -->  00:00:35,366
and what this is gonna do
15

15

00:00:35,366  -->  00:00:39,930
is return self.browser.find_element_by_css_selector
16

16

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:42,953
and that is gonna be the QuotesPageLocators.SEARCH_BUTTON.
17

17

00:00:46,030  -->  00:00:48,160
And that's it, you've got the button,
18

18

00:00:48,160  -->  00:00:49,490
you can click on it now,
19

19

00:00:49,490  -->  00:00:53,113
we can run app.py, Bob Marley.
20

20

00:00:54,170  -->  00:00:56,140
We're gonna type love
21

21

00:00:56,980  -->  00:00:59,243
and there you have your quote.
22

22

00:01:00,250  -->  00:01:01,610
And if you go back to the site,
23

23

00:01:01,610  -->  00:01:04,270
you'll see that this has actually worked.
24

24

00:01:04,270  -->  00:01:05,900
The button has been clicked
25

25

00:01:05,900  -->  00:01:10,180
and this is how you interact with websites using Selenium.
26

26

00:01:10,180  -->  00:01:13,550
As you can see, it's not all that complicated.
27

27

00:01:13,550  -->  00:01:15,770
You have to have a page model
28

28

00:01:15,770  -->  00:01:18,610
that reflects what the page contains
29

29

00:01:18,610  -->  00:01:19,970
and what it looks like
30

30

00:01:19,970  -->  00:01:22,850
so that you can then very easily just say okay,
31

31

00:01:22,850  -->  00:01:23,870
I wanna click this button,
32

32

00:01:23,870  -->  00:01:25,973
I wanna select this thing and so on.
33

33

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:28,690
It is the app.py though
34

34

00:01:28,690  -->  00:01:31,410
that is starting to get a little bit more complicated
35

35

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:33,710
just because it contains all the logic
36

36

00:01:33,710  -->  00:01:36,050
about how we're gonna interact with the page.
37

37

00:01:36,050  -->  00:01:38,210
We're gonna ask what author you want,
38

38

00:01:38,210  -->  00:01:39,520
then we're gonna select an author,
39

39

00:01:39,520  -->  00:01:41,130
then we're gonna get the available tags,
40

40

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:42,140
then we're gonna print them
41

41

00:01:42,140  -->  00:01:43,870
and then we're gonna ask for which one you want
42

42

00:01:43,870  -->  00:01:45,153
and so on and so forth.
43

43

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:48,930
We can make that a bit simpler
44

44

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:51,640
by encapsulating some of this logic
45

45

00:01:51,640  -->  00:01:53,880
into the page as well.
46

46

00:01:53,880  -->  00:01:56,350
Remember that this page here
47

47

00:01:56,350  -->  00:02:00,470
doesn't only have to contain page elements.
48

48

00:02:00,470  -->  00:02:03,210
It can also contain page actions
49

49

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:04,480
like selecting an author,
50

50

00:02:04,480  -->  00:02:07,520
getting available tags, or potentially performing
51

51

00:02:07,520  -->  00:02:09,780
the whole search flow.
52

52

00:02:09,780  -->  00:02:11,960
Let's go and do that in the next video.
53

53

00:02:11,960  -->  00:02:12,910
I'll see you there.
