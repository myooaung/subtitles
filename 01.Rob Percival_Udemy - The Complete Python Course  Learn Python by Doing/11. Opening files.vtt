00:00:00.170  -->  00:00:02.020 line:15% 
<v Jose>Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.020  -->  00:00:03.100
In this video, we're going to be
3

3

00:00:03.100  -->  00:00:05.270
working with opening files,
4

4

00:00:05.270  -->  00:00:07.200
and it's going to be really easy,
5

5

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:08.790
because all we have to do
6

6

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:10.910
is ask the user which file they wanna open
7

7

00:00:10.910  -->  00:00:12.010
using another dialogue
8

8

00:00:12.010  -->  00:00:13.720
like the one we've seen already,
9

9

00:00:13.720  -->  00:00:14.900
get the contents,
10

10

00:00:14.900  -->  00:00:16.550
and then create a new file
11

11

00:00:16.550  -->  00:00:18.320
and put those contents in it.
12

12

00:00:18.320  -->  00:00:22.230
Let's get started by creating our open file.
13

13

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:24.423
So, we'll do open_file() here,
14

14

00:00:25.430  -->  00:00:29.088
and then we're gonna ask for a file_path(),
15

15

00:00:29.088  -->  00:00:32.050
so we say file_path() equal filedialog,
16

16

00:00:32.050  -->  00:00:34.667
and now we're gonna say askopenfilename.
17

17

00:00:37.130  -->  00:00:38.960
Then, we will do as we did before.
18

18

00:00:38.960  -->  00:00:40.720
We will extract the file name
19

19

00:00:40.720  -->  00:00:42.680
from the path that this gives you.
20

20

00:00:42.680  -->  00:00:44.653
So, we will do filename() equal
21

21

00:00:44.653  -->  00:00:47.267
os.path.basename() file_path.
22

22

00:00:49.530  -->  00:00:51.170
Next up, we're gonna open the file
23

23

00:00:51.170  -->  00:00:53.820
with open() file_path.
24

24

00:00:53.820  -->  00:00:55.973
and "r" as file.
25

25

00:00:57.220  -->  00:00:58.710
We will then
26

26

00:00:58.710  -->  00:00:59.550
get the content,
27

27

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:00.700
which is file.read,
28

28

00:01:00.700  -->  00:01:02.980
and this reads the entire file.
29

29

00:01:02.980  -->  00:01:05.180
Now if you have extremely long files,
30

30

00:01:05.180  -->  00:01:07.130
this could present a bit of a bottleneck,
31

31

00:01:07.130  -->  00:01:07.963
but we're not gonna worry
32

32

00:01:07.963  -->  00:01:09.233
about that in this course.
33

33

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:12.700
Then we will have an except,
34

34

00:01:12.700  -->  00:01:13.533
as usual,
35

35

00:01:13.533  -->  00:01:16.130
for AttributeError and FileNotFoundError,
36

36

00:01:16.130  -->  00:01:18.750
so in case that something does fail,
37

37

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:20.500
or we close the
38

38

00:01:20.500  -->  00:01:22.110
dialogue,
39

39

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:22.943
then we will say
40

40

00:01:22.943  -->  00:01:25.820
"print Open operation cancelled"
41

41

00:01:25.820  -->  00:01:28.100
and we will return so that we don't execute
42

42

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:29.660
this next piece of code,
43

43

00:01:29.660  -->  00:01:31.440
which is create_file(),
44

44

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:33.490
but now we're gonna pass in the content
45

45

00:01:33.490  -->  00:01:34.590
and the filename
46

46

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:36.560
into create_file().
47

47

00:01:36.560  -->  00:01:38.635
Let's go back up here to create_file(),
48

48

00:01:38.635  -->  00:01:41.360
and we will have a content of empty string,
49

49

00:01:41.360  -->  00:01:44.970
and a title of Untitled.
50

50

00:01:44.970  -->  00:01:48.710
Then, here we will replace Text equal Untitled
51

51

00:01:48.710  -->  00:01:49.560
by
52

52

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:50.980
title
53

53

00:01:50.980  -->  00:01:51.860
and
54

54

00:01:51.860  -->  00:01:54.360
we're also going to insert
55

55

00:01:54.360  -->  00:01:56.530
the text in a text area.
56

56

00:01:56.530  -->  00:01:59.950
What we'll do is a text_area.insert,
57

57

00:01:59.950  -->  00:02:02.380
and where do we wanna insert the text,
58

58

00:02:02.380  -->  00:02:03.550
that is the first thing that
59

59

00:02:03.550  -->  00:02:05.130
this method requires,
60

60

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:07.830
and we're gonna use the special place end,
61

61

00:02:07.830  -->  00:02:09.770
which will insert the text at the end
62

62

00:02:09.770  -->  00:02:11.650
or at the very last character
63

63

00:02:11.650  -->  00:02:13.470
currently in the text area.
64

64

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:15.100
Because this text area is empty,
65

65

00:02:15.100  -->  00:02:16.100
we just created it,
66

66

00:02:16.100  -->  00:02:17.230
this is going to essentially
67

67

00:02:17.230  -->  00:02:18.593
be the start as well.
68

68

00:02:19.450  -->  00:02:22.923
And, then the content that we wanna insert.
69

69

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:26.820
All right, so this how you open
70

70

00:02:26.820  -->  00:02:27.690
a file
71

71

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:28.530
using
72

72

00:02:28.530  -->  00:02:29.520
our editor,
73

73

00:02:29.520  -->  00:02:30.960
very straight forward
74

74

00:02:30.960  -->  00:02:32.060
once again
75

75

00:02:32.060  -->  00:02:33.650
ask for the file,
76

76

00:02:33.650  -->  00:02:34.510
get the file name
77

77

00:02:34.510  -->  00:02:37.480
so that you can then name the tab that,
78

78

00:02:37.480  -->  00:02:39.260
read the file contents,
79

79

00:02:39.260  -->  00:02:40.870
and then create the file,
80

80

00:02:40.870  -->  00:02:43.780
making sure to pass in the contents of the file
81

81

00:02:43.780  -->  00:02:45.250
and the title.
82

82

00:02:45.250  -->  00:02:47.390
By default, when we create a file
83

83

00:02:47.390  -->  00:02:49.833
such as what we do down here,
84

84

00:02:50.810  -->  00:02:51.680
we want
85

85

00:02:52.640  -->  00:02:54.140
the content and the title
86

86

00:02:54.140  -->  00:02:55.810
to be these default values,
87

87

00:02:55.810  -->  00:02:58.130
So empty content and Untitled,
88

88

00:02:58.130  -->  00:02:59.760
that's why we're making sure
89

89

00:02:59.760  -->  00:03:00.850
that these have defaults
90

90

00:03:00.850  -->  00:03:03.850
so that when you do insert the content,
91

91

00:03:03.850  -->  00:03:05.260
it is gonna be empty,
92

92

00:03:05.260  -->  00:03:06.590
and when you do add the tab,
93

93

00:03:06.590  -->  00:03:07.960
it is gonna be Untitled,
94

94

00:03:07.960  -->  00:03:09.920
unless we specify otherwise.
95

95

00:03:09.920  -->  00:03:11.520
Finally, the last thing that we want to add
96

96

00:03:11.520  -->  00:03:14.540
is of course a way to call this function,
97

97

00:03:14.540  -->  00:03:16.550
as well as new and save,
98

98

00:03:16.550  -->  00:03:18.330
we wanna add in open.
99

99

00:03:18.330  -->  00:03:22.380
So we will do file_menu.add_command(),
100

100

00:03:22.380  -->  00:03:24.680
label is going to be Open...,
101

101

00:03:24.680  -->  00:03:26.050
as is usual,
102

102

00:03:26.050  -->  00:03:28.070
and the command is gonna be open_file(),
103

103

00:03:28.070  -->  00:03:30.270
making sure to not call it.
104

104

00:03:30.270  -->  00:03:31.283
Let's run the app.
105

105

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:33.510
And now we're gonna open
106

106

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:40.180
this file called test.txt
107

107

00:03:40.180  -->  00:03:41.670
that we made earlier,
108

108

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:44.700
and there you have test.txt.
109

109

00:03:44.700  -->  00:03:46.390
Now, notice that you have still an
110

110

00:03:46.390  -->  00:03:48.740
untitled tab at the start.
111

111

00:03:48.740  -->  00:03:49.690
This is a problem that we're
112

112

00:03:49.690  -->  00:03:50.730
not gonna concern ourselves
113

113

00:03:50.730  -->  00:03:52.150
too much with right now,
114

114

00:03:52.150  -->  00:03:54.618
but you could check to see if the tab
115

115

00:03:54.618  -->  00:03:56.200
that is currently selected when
116

116

00:03:56.200  -->  00:03:57.780
you open a new one
117

117

00:03:57.780  -->  00:03:59.320
is empty,
118

118

00:03:59.320  -->  00:04:00.350
and if it is,
119

119

00:04:00.350  -->  00:04:01.900
then you can possibly close it,
120

120

00:04:01.900  -->  00:04:04.390
and instead create this new one.
121

121

00:04:04.390  -->  00:04:05.223
But, as I said,
122

122

00:04:05.223  -->  00:04:06.980
we're not gonna do that in this course,
123

123

00:04:06.980  -->  00:04:08.690
just a separate problem
124

124

00:04:08.690  -->  00:04:10.853
that you can fix if you'd like.
125

125

00:04:11.700  -->  00:04:13.170
Thanks for joining me in this video.
126

126

00:04:13.170  -->  00:04:14.230
I hope you've learned something,
127

127

00:04:14.230  -->  00:04:15.880 line:15% 
and I'll see you in the next one.
