<v Narrator>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.440  -->  00:00:03.040
In this video, I just wanted to give you
3

3

00:00:03.040  -->  00:00:06.030
a few words of warning for
4

4

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:08.340
some of the pages you may try to scrape
5

5

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:09.200
will not work,
6

6

00:00:10.660  -->  00:00:14.000
and the reason for that is JavaScript.
7

7

00:00:14.000  -->  00:00:16.430
So, as I may have said before, JavaScript is
8

8

00:00:16.430  -->  00:00:19.720
a programming language that your browser executes.
9

9

00:00:19.720  -->  00:00:22.790
And it can be used for dealing with user interactions,
10

10

00:00:22.790  -->  00:00:23.623
for example.
11

11

00:00:24.580  -->  00:00:27.980
So when the user does something, maybe you get a window
12

12

00:00:27.980  -->  00:00:30.620
that appears on your screen, or a modal, or maybe
13

13

00:00:30.620  -->  00:00:33.790
you get some sort of alert, or something like that.
14

14

00:00:33.790  -->  00:00:36.290
In some cases, you press the login button,
15

15

00:00:36.290  -->  00:00:39.120
and then you get a nice window there where you can log in.
16

16

00:00:40.280  -->  00:00:44.270
And those sort of things can happen because there is some
17

17

00:00:44.270  -->  00:00:48.470
JavaScript code on the page that your browser can execute.
18

18

00:00:48.470  -->  00:00:50.440
Your browser can run it.
19

19

00:00:50.440  -->  00:00:52.200
However, when you download the page using
20

20

00:00:52.200  -->  00:00:55.790
the Requests module, you don't have access to
21

21

00:00:55.790  -->  00:00:58.160
running the JavaScript, because you don't have a browser.
22

22

00:00:58.160  -->  00:01:00.160
You don't have a JavaScript interpreter.
23

23

00:01:01.120  -->  00:01:05.040
So, if the page relies on JavaScript to change the content,
24

24

00:01:06.170  -->  00:01:09.130
then it won't work with the Requests module.
25

25

00:01:09.130  -->  00:01:10.770
And a word of warning is
26

26

00:01:10.770  -->  00:01:15.580
some pages will actually be a blank page,
27

27

00:01:15.580  -->  00:01:18.990
and then the content is populated using JavaScript.
28

28

00:01:18.990  -->  00:01:21.110
So sometimes the page is completely blank,
29

29

00:01:21.110  -->  00:01:23.270
and it's a lot of JavaScript code in the background
30

30

00:01:23.270  -->  00:01:26.070
that's actually putting the content on the page.
31

31

00:01:26.070  -->  00:01:28.630
When you download the page using Requests,
32

32

00:01:28.630  -->  00:01:30.110
all you'll see is a blank page
33

33

00:01:30.110  -->  00:01:32.700
because you cannot run the JavaScript.
34

34

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:35.950
So, if that happens to you, you know why it is.
35

35

00:01:35.950  -->  00:01:38.040
It's because there's JavaScript code in there.
36

36

00:01:38.920  -->  00:01:41.470
And the way you know that something's gone wrong,
37

37

00:01:41.470  -->  00:01:44.470
is because you'll be able to inspect the page.
38

38

00:01:44.470  -->  00:01:46.820
You'll see a bunch of content, and that's great,
39

39

00:01:46.820  -->  00:01:49.090
but then when you download the pages in Requests,
40

40

00:01:49.090  -->  00:01:51.590
the contents of the page will look very different.
41

41

00:01:52.810  -->  00:01:56.510
You can see it just by printing it out in your Python code.
42

42

00:01:56.510  -->  00:01:57.490
And if it looks very different,
43

43

00:01:57.490  -->  00:02:00.440
it's because there's JavaScript code in there doing things.
44

44

00:02:01.310  -->  00:02:05.910
There are ways, of course, to launch a browser using Python,
45

45

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:08.630
and interact with websites using the browser,
46

46

00:02:08.630  -->  00:02:10.840
which is controlled by Python.
47

47

00:02:10.840  -->  00:02:12.760
But those are a bit more advanced,
48

48

00:02:12.760  -->  00:02:15.460
and I'll try to add content to cover that in the course,
49

49

00:02:15.460  -->  00:02:18.270
but it's not here at the time that I'm recording this video.
50

50

00:02:18.270  -->  00:02:20.590
It may be here by the time you're watching it.
51

51

00:02:20.590  -->  00:02:23.420
So nonetheless, you'll need to use something called
52

52

00:02:23.420  -->  00:02:27.199
Selenium if you want to interact with a page
53

53

00:02:27.199  -->  00:02:29.570
that uses JavaScript.
54

54

00:02:29.570  -->  00:02:31.150
So feel free to take the rest of the course,
55

55

00:02:31.150  -->  00:02:33.440
see if Selenium content's up, and if not,
56

56

00:02:33.440  -->  00:02:36.350
you can look online and see how you can use
57

57

00:02:36.350  -->  00:02:38.240
Selenium to do that.
58

58

00:02:38.240  -->  00:02:40.310
But that's only if the page you're interacting with
59

59

00:02:40.310  -->  00:02:41.240
has JavaScript.
60

60

00:02:41.240  -->  00:02:43.850
If it does not, like a lot of pages don't,
61

61

00:02:44.790  -->  00:02:46.590
feel free to continue using Requests.
62

62

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:48.360
It will do exactly what you want.
63

63

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:51.190
And in many cases, the pages will have JavaScript,
64

64

00:02:51.190  -->  00:02:54.070
but they will also be interactable with Requests,
65

65

00:02:54.070  -->  00:02:56.020
because the JavaScript will be used to add
66

66

00:02:56.020  -->  00:02:57.630
some sort of functionality,
67

67

00:02:57.630  -->  00:03:00.240
not necessarily to change the entire page.
68

68

00:03:01.180  -->  00:03:02.680
So give Requests a go first.
69

69

00:03:02.680  -->  00:03:04.580
It's the simplest way of going about things.
70

70

00:03:04.580  -->  00:03:05.413
And if that doesn't work,
71

71

00:03:05.413  -->  00:03:07.190
and you really need to interact with that page,
72

72

00:03:07.190  -->  00:03:10.040
look at Selenium in order to learn more.
73

73

00:03:11.250  -->  00:03:13.880
That's it for this video, and I'll see you on the next one.
