<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.320  -->  00:00:03.650
In this video we're going to be adding
3

3

00:00:03.650  -->  00:00:05.760
waits to our search.
4

4

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:07.580
Sometimes, when you're interacting with a page
5

5

00:00:07.580  -->  00:00:09.300
that uses JavaScript,
6

6

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:11.410
things are not gonna happen immediately.
7

7

00:00:11.410  -->  00:00:13.400
For example, you may select an author
8

8

00:00:13.400  -->  00:00:15.430
from the dropdown and then it may take you
9

9

00:00:15.430  -->  00:00:17.970
a couple of seconds before the tags dropdown
10

10

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:19.650
is populated.
11

11

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:22.150
Although the page we're using is very fast,
12

12

00:00:22.150  -->  00:00:24.180
other pages may be much slower
13

13

00:00:24.180  -->  00:00:25.623
and you'll have to wait.
14

14

00:00:26.830  -->  00:00:29.280
The easiest way to wait
15

15

00:00:29.280  -->  00:00:31.230
is to do time.sleep
16

16

00:00:31.230  -->  00:00:33.670
and add like five seconds.
17

17

00:00:33.670  -->  00:00:35.390
You need to import time if you're gonna do this
18

18

00:00:35.390  -->  00:00:36.790
so let's do that at the top.
19

19

00:00:37.670  -->  00:00:39.130
Time comes with Python
20

20

00:00:39.130  -->  00:00:41.510
so you don't have to instal anything,
21

21

00:00:41.510  -->  00:00:43.330
and what this does in Python
22

22

00:00:43.330  -->  00:00:46.090
is it just stops everything
23

23

00:00:46.090  -->  00:00:47.690
for five seconds.
24

24

00:00:47.690  -->  00:00:49.730
If you run app.py now
25

25

00:00:49.730  -->  00:00:52.870
and you type Bob Marley and music,
26

26

00:00:52.870  -->  00:00:55.210
you'll see that Chrome opens,
27

27

00:00:55.210  -->  00:00:56.190
Bob Marley is selected,
28

28

00:00:56.190  -->  00:00:59.100
and then nothing happens for five seconds,
29

29

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:00.923
and eventually music is selected.
30

30

00:01:01.890  -->  00:01:03.800
Again, you may need to wait
31

31

00:01:03.800  -->  00:01:06.763
if your programme is too fast for the website.
32

32

00:01:08.020  -->  00:01:12.120
However, sometimes time.sleep
33

33

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:13.360
is not appropriate.
34

34

00:01:13.360  -->  00:01:15.230
In fact, most of the time time.sleep
35

35

00:01:15.230  -->  00:01:17.500
is not appropriate because it waits
36

36

00:01:17.500  -->  00:01:20.040
for five seconds even if the element
37

37

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:22.003
is available after one second.
38

38

00:01:22.930  -->  00:01:25.920
Fortunately, Selenium comes with a way
39

39

00:01:25.920  -->  00:01:29.780
to wait until something happens.
40

40

00:01:29.780  -->  00:01:32.810
So what you can do is you can wait
41

41

00:01:32.810  -->  00:01:35.380
until the different options of the tag
42

42

00:01:35.380  -->  00:01:37.500
have become available.
43

43

00:01:37.500  -->  00:01:38.610
And that's what we're gonna do
44

44

00:01:38.610  -->  00:01:40.083
instead of time.sleep.
45

45

00:01:41.150  -->  00:01:43.830
What we'll do is we will
46

46

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:45.550
go head and import a couple of things
47

47

00:01:45.550  -->  00:01:46.383
that we're gonna need.
48

48

00:01:46.383  -->  00:01:48.460
So, no longer need time there.
49

49

00:01:48.460  -->  00:01:50.140
So we're gonna need these three things:
50

50

00:01:50.140  -->  00:01:53.480
from selenium webdriver common by import by.
51

51

00:01:53.480  -->  00:01:55.540
We're gonna need selenium webdriver support
52

52

00:01:55.540  -->  00:01:57.680
expected conditions, and selenium webdriver
53

53

00:01:57.680  -->  00:02:01.820
support wait web driver wait.
54

54

00:02:01.820  -->  00:02:05.520
Then let's go back down to our search
55

55

00:02:05.520  -->  00:02:09.200
and here we're going to do a wait until.
56

56

00:02:09.200  -->  00:02:12.270
So we're gonna do webdriver wait
57

57

00:02:12.270  -->  00:02:14.510
and we're gonna pass in the browser
58

58

00:02:14.510  -->  00:02:16.290
and the maximum amount of time
59

59

00:02:16.290  -->  00:02:17.970
we want to wait.
60

60

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:19.763
And then we're gonna do until.
61

61

00:02:21.050  -->  00:02:25.790
This is a, what's called an implicit wait,
62

62

00:02:25.790  -->  00:02:29.730
but it is a fairly explicit implicit wait.
63

63

00:02:29.730  -->  00:02:32.720
So, this type of wait is going to wait
64

64

00:02:32.720  -->  00:02:34.320
until something happens,
65

65

00:02:34.320  -->  00:02:35.950
and what's gonna happen is we're gonna say
66

66

00:02:35.950  -->  00:02:40.083
expected conditions.presence of element located.
67

67

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:45.200
And then in here, we pass in a tuple
68

68

00:02:45.200  -->  00:02:46.910
of By CSS Selector
69

69

00:02:47.800  -->  00:02:50.433
and the Quotes Page Locators.
70

70

00:02:51.920  -->  00:02:54.330
Tag Dropdown Value Option.
71

71

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:55.680
This doesn't exist yet, by the way,
72

72

00:02:55.680  -->  00:02:58.810
but let me just explain what's going on first.
73

73

00:02:58.810  -->  00:03:00.800
We're gonna wait up to 10 seconds
74

74

00:03:00.800  -->  00:03:03.580
until the element is in the page.
75

75

00:03:03.580  -->  00:03:04.870
It doesn't have to be visible.
76

76

00:03:04.870  -->  00:03:07.110
It just has to be in the page.
77

77

00:03:07.110  -->  00:03:08.360
And this is the element
78

78

00:03:08.360  -->  00:03:09.800
that we're gonna look for.
79

79

00:03:09.800  -->  00:03:12.540
We're gonna look for this thing
80

80

00:03:12.540  -->  00:03:14.240
and we're telling Selenium
81

81

00:03:14.240  -->  00:03:16.970
that that thing is a CSS selector.
82

82

00:03:16.970  -->  00:03:20.190
If this thing was an element ID,
83

83

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:22.193
you could do By ID.
84

84

00:03:23.090  -->  00:03:24.650
If that thing was something else,
85

85

00:03:24.650  -->  00:03:26.640
you could do all of these,
86

86

00:03:26.640  -->  00:03:29.110
ID, xpath, link text, partial link test,
87

87

00:03:29.110  -->  00:03:31.660
name, tag name, class name, or CSS selector.
88

88

00:03:31.660  -->  00:03:32.940
So these are all the different options
89

89

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:35.240
for searching and up till now
90

90

00:03:35.240  -->  00:03:37.000
we've only been using
91

91

00:03:37.990  -->  00:03:40.040
find element by css selector.
92

92

00:03:40.040  -->  00:03:43.710
So we've not had to use by class.
93

93

00:03:43.710  -->  00:03:46.970
But the expected conditions module here
94

94

00:03:46.970  -->  00:03:51.360
does need the by and the locator,
95

95

00:03:51.360  -->  00:03:53.190
and you have to say both of them.
96

96

00:03:53.190  -->  00:03:56.550
So, then we have to go and create this locator here.
97

97

00:03:56.550  -->  00:04:01.550
And this locator is going to be select tag.
98

98

00:04:01.840  -->  00:04:05.541
So it's basically an element inside this select,
99

99

00:04:05.541  -->  00:04:08.783
and it is an option that has a value.
100

100

00:04:09.910  -->  00:04:12.910
So if the options don't have a value,
101

101

00:04:12.910  -->  00:04:15.270
they won't match the selector.
102

102

00:04:15.270  -->  00:04:17.450
But if any option inside the selector
103

103

00:04:17.450  -->  00:04:20.720
has a value, then it will match the selector
104

104

00:04:20.720  -->  00:04:22.500
and we'll be able to find it.
105

105

00:04:22.500  -->  00:04:23.870
So, what it's saying is
106

106

00:04:23.870  -->  00:04:27.590
wait until that tag select
107

107

00:04:27.590  -->  00:04:30.060
has an option that has a value,
108

108

00:04:30.060  -->  00:04:31.900
and you wait up to 10 seconds.
109

109

00:04:31.900  -->  00:04:33.100
The reason for it is that
110

110

00:04:33.100  -->  00:04:36.290
if you right-click on this tag name here
111

111

00:04:36.290  -->  00:04:39.730
and you look at this one specifically,
112

112

00:04:39.730  -->  00:04:43.590
you'll see that there're multiple options in there.
113

113

00:04:43.590  -->  00:04:47.470
But only the actual tags have an option.
114

114

00:04:47.470  -->  00:04:49.600
The first option in the select
115

115

00:04:49.600  -->  00:04:51.280
doesn't have a value.
116

116

00:04:51.280  -->  00:04:53.400
It's just a bunch of dashes.
117

117

00:04:53.400  -->  00:04:56.673
So, when you don't have an author selected,
118

118

00:04:57.570  -->  00:04:59.850
then these selects here
119

119

00:04:59.850  -->  00:05:01.770
don't have options with values,
120

120

00:05:01.770  -->  00:05:03.970
it only has an option without a value.
121

121

00:05:03.970  -->  00:05:06.660
And as soon as you select an author,
122

122

00:05:06.660  -->  00:05:09.070
then you have your different values
123

123

00:05:09.070  -->  00:05:10.370
appearing there.
124

124

00:05:10.370  -->  00:05:12.010
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna wait
125

125

00:05:12.010  -->  00:05:15.000
for an option with a value to appear
126

126

00:05:15.000  -->  00:05:18.129
and that's for how long we're going to wait.
127

127

00:05:18.129  -->  00:05:20.390
Notice that if it's instant,
128

128

00:05:20.390  -->  00:05:21.660
then this is gonna be instant as well
129

129

00:05:21.660  -->  00:05:23.930
or almost instant and if it's not,
130

130

00:05:23.930  -->  00:05:26.070
then this is gonna wait up to 10 seconds.
131

131

00:05:26.070  -->  00:05:27.230
The way this works internally
132

132

00:05:27.230  -->  00:05:29.770
is it just checks every now and then
133

133

00:05:29.770  -->  00:05:31.243
to see if it's appeared.
134

134

00:05:32.730  -->  00:05:35.030
Once again, this just works the same way.
135

135

00:05:35.030  -->  00:05:36.750
We type Bob Marley
136

136

00:05:38.170  -->  00:05:39.840
and then we type music
137

137

00:05:39.840  -->  00:05:41.990
and you see that now it's almost instant
138

138

00:05:43.290  -->  00:05:45.713
because that appears very quickly.
139

139

00:05:46.970  -->  00:05:50.770
But if you run it and if we like
140

140

00:05:50.770  -->  00:05:52.523
quotes from this author,
141

141

00:05:53.640  -->  00:05:55.430
what you'll see is that it's gonna wait
142

142

00:05:55.430  -->  00:05:57.420
up to 10 seconds after launching Chrome.
143

143

00:05:57.420  -->  00:06:00.030
Because by selecting this author
144

144

00:06:00.030  -->  00:06:02.710
this hasn't changed and there are no tags
145

145

00:06:02.710  -->  00:06:05.100
in there, no options that have a value.
146

146

00:06:05.100  -->  00:06:07.687
And after 10 seconds you'll see an error appeared.
147

147

00:06:07.687  -->  00:06:08.617
"An unknown error appeared.
148

148

00:06:08.617  -->  00:06:10.290
"Please try again."
149

149

00:06:10.290  -->  00:06:11.730
Hopefully, all of this makes sense.
150

150

00:06:11.730  -->  00:06:15.590
The whole waiting is very important
151

151

00:06:15.590  -->  00:06:16.730
when you're using Selenium.
152

152

00:06:16.730  -->  00:06:18.680
You're gonna have to be waiting
153

153

00:06:18.680  -->  00:06:20.250
a lot of the time when you're interacting
154

154

00:06:20.250  -->  00:06:21.270
with JavaScript websites
155

155

00:06:21.270  -->  00:06:22.940
because things can take a while.
156

156

00:06:22.940  -->  00:06:24.700
If the website has to talk to a server
157

157

00:06:24.700  -->  00:06:26.210
that can take some time.
158

158

00:06:26.210  -->  00:06:27.770
And you just don't want to be

159

00:06:27.770  -->  00:06:29.950
faster on the website.
160

160

00:06:29.950  -->  00:06:32.180
And not only that, but sometimes
161

161

00:06:32.180  -->  00:06:35.010
you actually want to be deliberately slow
162

162

00:06:35.010  -->  00:06:38.380
because users can be slower as well.
163

163

00:06:38.380  -->  00:06:40.140
So, waiting, very important.
164

164

00:06:40.140  -->  00:06:41.810
I've just scratched the surface here
165

165

00:06:41.810  -->  00:06:42.700
in this video.
166

166

00:06:42.700  -->  00:06:45.140
You've got explicit and implicit waits.
167

167

00:06:45.140  -->  00:06:46.570
Explicit wait is when you actually
168

168

00:06:46.570  -->  00:06:49.210
tell Python how long to wait for.
169

169

00:06:49.210  -->  00:06:52.470
Implicit waits is when you wait
170

170

00:06:52.470  -->  00:06:54.340
until a certain amount of time
171

171

00:06:54.340  -->  00:06:56.510
or up to a certain amount of time.
172

172

00:06:56.510  -->  00:06:58.040
So, thanks for joining me in this video.
173

173

00:06:58.040  -->  00:06:59.160
I hope you've learned something.
174

174

00:06:59.160  -->  00:07:00.610
I'll see you on the next one.
