<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,250  -->  00:00:04,650
In this video, we're just going to be setting up our project
3

3

00:00:04,650  -->  00:00:07,190
that we're going to be creating in this section.
4

4

00:00:07,190  -->  00:00:11,230
I've created a folder here in my documents
5

5

00:00:11,230  -->  00:00:12,390
and the only thing you need
6

6

00:00:12,390  -->  00:00:14,690
is to create a folder for your project,
7

7

00:00:14,690  -->  00:00:17,400
then remember where the folder is
8

8

00:00:17,400  -->  00:00:20,720
so that you can find it in your terminal.
9

9

00:00:20,720  -->  00:00:23,370
Once you created a folder for your project,
10

10

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:24,970
let's go into the terminal
11

11

00:00:24,970  -->  00:00:28,230
and create our environment using Pipenv.
12

12

00:00:29,150  -->  00:00:31,790
Okay, once you are in your terminal,
13

13

00:00:31,790  -->  00:00:34,540
let's go into this directory.
14

14

00:00:34,540  -->  00:00:38,720
Remember on Unix systems like Mac OS X and Linux,
15

15

00:00:38,720  -->  00:00:43,090
we're gonna do cd and then find the folder.
16

16

00:00:43,090  -->  00:00:44,740
In Windows, you're gonna do chdir
17

17

00:00:45,710  -->  00:00:48,380
and then you're gonna find the folder like C:\
18

18

00:00:48,380  -->  00:00:51,150
wherever the folder is.
19

19

00:00:51,150  -->  00:00:54,780
Here the folder is in my Documents/teclado-projects
20

20

00:00:54,780  -->  00:00:56,250
/your-first-flask-app/
21

21

00:00:56,250  -->  00:00:57,680
so we're gonna cd into that
22

22

00:00:58,840  -->  00:01:03,750
and then we're going to use pipenv to instal Flask.
23

23

00:01:04,760  -->  00:01:07,790
Flask is the library we're going to be using in this section
24

24

00:01:07,790  -->  00:01:09,150
to create our website.
25

25

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:10,550
It's a really lightweight library.
26

26

00:01:10,550  -->  00:01:12,880
We're gonna learn a lot about how it works
27

27

00:01:12,880  -->  00:01:14,890
throughout this section.
28

28

00:01:14,890  -->  00:01:17,260
Once you do pipenv instal Flask,
29

29

00:01:17,260  -->  00:01:20,030
make sure that it is creating a virtual environment
30

30

00:01:20,030  -->  00:01:22,530
using the correct version of Python,
31

31

00:01:22,530  -->  00:01:24,260
in this case Python 3.7.
32

32

00:01:24,260  -->  00:01:25,270
I know you can't see that very well,
33

33

00:01:25,270  -->  00:01:27,700
but version 3.7 there.
34

34

00:01:27,700  -->  00:01:30,210
3.6 is fine, 3.5.
35

35

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:32,020
Just don't go under 3
36

36

00:01:33,640  -->  00:01:36,930
just because of some of the syntax we're gonna be using.
37

37

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:38,420
Once it's installed,
38

38

00:01:38,420  -->  00:01:41,790
you'll have a virtual environment created as well.
39

39

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:43,000
You know this already.
40

40

00:01:43,000  -->  00:01:45,610
Pipenv creates a virtual environment for you.
41

41

00:01:46,980  -->  00:01:48,370
Remembering this virtual environment
42

42

00:01:48,370  -->  00:01:49,690
is gonna be very important
43

43

00:01:49,690  -->  00:01:52,390
because we're gonna need to give it to PyCharm
44

44

00:01:52,390  -->  00:01:56,750
in order for PyCharm to use the correct Python version.
45

45

00:01:56,750  -->  00:01:59,060
Okay, so now that we've got this created,
46

46

00:01:59,060  -->  00:02:03,290
we've got, if we do ls or dir in Windows,
47

47

00:02:03,290  -->  00:02:06,490
we've got a Pipfile and that Pipfile.lock.
48

48

00:02:06,490  -->  00:02:07,323
They're under the Pipfile.
49

49

00:02:07,323  -->  00:02:10,160
It gives us what libraries we're installing.
50

50

00:02:10,160  -->  00:02:12,530
Pipfile.lock gives us a bit of security
51

51

00:02:12,530  -->  00:02:14,550
and also instals the correct versions.
52

52

00:02:15,520  -->  00:02:17,350
If we share both with other people,
53

53

00:02:17,350  -->  00:02:20,350
then they'll be able to instal exactly the same versions
54

54

00:02:20,350  -->  00:02:22,600
that we installed when we set up the project.
55

55

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:25,050
Now that we've got this,
56

56

00:02:25,050  -->  00:02:28,460
again remember the location of this virtual environment,
57

57

00:02:28,460  -->  00:02:31,350
and let's go over to PyCharm to create our new project.
58

58

00:02:32,500  -->  00:02:35,130
Once you've opened PyCharm, you'll see a window like this.
59

59

00:02:35,130  -->  00:02:37,230
Just create a new project
60

60

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:40,820
and here make sure to select the location of your project.
61

61

00:02:40,820  -->  00:02:45,760
So in my case, this is in my Documents/teclado-projects
62

62

00:02:48,250  -->  00:02:49,930
/your-first-flask-app.
63

63

00:02:51,120  -->  00:02:52,790
Be sure to select this folder
64

64

00:02:53,820  -->  00:02:55,720
and then in the interpreter,
65

65

00:02:55,720  -->  00:02:58,780
let's go and find the virtual environment
66

66

00:02:58,780  -->  00:03:01,570
that was created for us by Pipenv.
67

67

00:03:01,570  -->  00:03:03,100
Notice when I open this here,
68

68

00:03:03,100  -->  00:03:04,500
I get a lot of virtual environments
69

69

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:06,000
in various different places.
70

70

00:03:07,200  -->  00:03:10,310
We're gonna need to go and add a local virtual environment
71

71

00:03:11,570  -->  00:03:14,120
and then find the virtual environment that we had before
72

72

00:03:14,120  -->  00:03:16,550
so going back over to the terminal,
73

73

00:03:16,550  -->  00:03:21,550
in my case this is in /users/jslvtr.local and so forth.
74

74

00:03:21,860  -->  00:03:24,330
So PyCharm allows you to copy this
75

75

00:03:25,470  -->  00:03:27,520
and then just put it in here in the path.
76

76

00:03:28,440  -->  00:03:30,090
This is the virtual environment.
77

77

00:03:30,090  -->  00:03:32,340
Then you're gonna open it up,
78

78

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:34,140
find the bin folder,
79

79

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:36,410
and find python.
80

80

00:03:36,410  -->  00:03:39,590
Okay, make sure to select python inside the bin folder
81

81

00:03:39,590  -->  00:03:42,550
and then press OK and now PyCharm knows
82

82

00:03:42,550  -->  00:03:44,910
that this is the Python version you want to use.
83

83

00:03:44,910  -->  00:03:48,580
It's gonna allow you to use Python 3.7 syntax.
84

84

00:03:48,580  -->  00:03:50,870
It's going to use the packages that are installed
85

85

00:03:50,870  -->  00:03:54,810
in this interpreter and not in the system Python.
86

86

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:56,980
Then we can press create and it will ask us
87

87

00:03:56,980  -->  00:04:00,230
whether we want to create a project from existing sources.
88

88

00:04:00,230  -->  00:04:02,740
That's because we've got the Pipfile and the Pipfile.lock
89

89

00:04:02,740  -->  00:04:05,140
in there already and we're gonna say yes
90

90

00:04:06,880  -->  00:04:09,480
and then we're going to get our new project
91

91

00:04:09,480  -->  00:04:11,460
that has our two files there already.
92

92

00:04:13,030  -->  00:04:15,580
Whenever you want to instal new libraries,
93

93

00:04:15,580  -->  00:04:18,100
now you must not go through
94

94

00:04:18,100  -->  00:04:19,850
or you could go through the PyCharm
95

95

00:04:21,210  -->  00:04:23,660
settings here, this thing here,
96

96

00:04:23,660  -->  00:04:27,200
but I'd recommend you go through the Pipenv settings
97

97

00:04:27,200  -->  00:04:28,410
using the terminal.
98

98

00:04:28,410  -->  00:04:30,140
That's because this is going to instal something
99

99

00:04:30,140  -->  00:04:32,080
directly in the virtual environment,
100

100

00:04:32,080  -->  00:04:34,770
but it's not going to update your Pipfile.
101

101

00:04:34,770  -->  00:04:36,770
So if you want to instal more things,
102

102

00:04:36,770  -->  00:04:38,490
you can go through PyCharm,
103

103

00:04:38,490  -->  00:04:41,410
but you probably want to go through the terminal.
104

104

00:04:41,410  -->  00:04:44,590
Just do pipenv instal whatever else you need.
105

105

00:04:44,590  -->  00:04:46,430
For this project, we're not gonna need anything else
106

106

00:04:46,430  -->  00:04:50,030
so Flask is the only thing we need and we've got that now.
107

107

00:04:50,030  -->  00:04:54,600
If you create a new Python file and you call it app.py,
108

108

00:04:54,600  -->  00:04:58,270
you should be able to do from flask_import Flask.
109

109

00:04:58,270  -->  00:05:00,970
Okay, if this doesn't give you any errors,
110

110

00:05:00,970  -->  00:05:02,540
then you're good to go.
111

111

00:05:02,540  -->  00:05:04,170
If this gives you any errors,
112

112

00:05:04,170  -->  00:05:06,810
just check your settings, check your Pipfile,
113

113

00:05:06,810  -->  00:05:08,630
make sure everything's setup correctly.
114

114

00:05:08,630  -->  00:05:10,200
It's possible that
115

115

00:05:10,200  -->  00:05:11,990
either something wasn't installed correctly,
116

116

00:05:11,990  -->  00:05:15,120
in which case your Pipfile will not show Flask,
117

117

00:05:15,120  -->  00:05:17,190
or it's possible that
118

118

00:05:17,190  -->  00:05:20,060
you're not using the correct virtual environment,
119

119

00:05:20,060  -->  00:05:22,260
in which case you want to go back
120

120

00:05:22,260  -->  00:05:25,480
and make sure to select the correct virtual environment here
121

121

00:05:25,480  -->  00:05:28,970
or add a local virtual environment and find the correct one.
122

122

00:05:28,970  -->  00:05:31,840
Okay, make sure that Flask is here
123

123

00:05:31,840  -->  00:05:33,340
and then you can import Flask.
124

124

00:05:34,250  -->  00:05:35,390
Once that's all ready,
125

125

00:05:35,390  -->  00:05:36,710
you're good to continue into the next video
126

126

00:05:36,710  -->  00:05:38,230
where we're going to be implementing
127

127

00:05:38,230  -->  00:05:40,870
our first web application.
128

128

00:05:40,870  -->  00:05:41,820
I'll see you there.
