00:00:00,822  -->  00:00:02,136
<v Jose>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,136  -->  00:00:04,360
I just wanted to give you a little bit of information
3

3

00:00:04,360  -->  00:00:08,059
about Mac OS, if you're using Mac OS,
4

4

00:00:08,059  -->  00:00:09,309
and https URLs.
5

5

00:00:10,892  -->  00:00:14,841
As you can see here, we've requested http://google.com.
6

6

00:00:14,841  -->  00:00:19,602
In our app, we've requested http://books.toscrape.com.
7

7

00:00:19,602  -->  00:00:21,583
And we never made an https request.
8

8

00:00:21,583  -->  00:00:24,264
For example, something like this one.
9

9

00:00:24,264  -->  00:00:27,588
This is John Lewis's pretty big shop in the UK,
10

10

00:00:27,588  -->  00:00:29,755
but its website has https.
11

11

00:00:31,590  -->  00:00:34,764
If you have just now installed Python,
12

12

00:00:34,764  -->  00:00:37,070
maybe at the start of the course or recently,
13

13

00:00:37,070  -->  00:00:40,518
and you're using Python 3.6 or 3.7,
14

14

00:00:40,518  -->  00:00:44,414
it's possible that when you run this programme it will fail.
15

15

00:00:44,414  -->  00:00:47,420
Linked to this lecture I've got a bit of code
16

16

00:00:47,420  -->  00:00:52,146
that you can run to see if your Python is set up correctly.
17

17

00:00:52,146  -->  00:00:54,830
If running this code fails,
18

18

00:00:54,830  -->  00:00:58,425
that means that you've got a missing piece of configuration
19

19

00:00:58,425  -->  00:01:00,280
in your Python code.
20

20

00:01:00,280  -->  00:01:03,530
This is fine if you are using Mac OS X.
21

21

00:01:05,598  -->  00:01:09,410
Your Python doesn't come with a library that it needs
22

22

00:01:09,410  -->  00:01:11,258
in order to essentially verify
23

23

00:01:11,258  -->  00:01:14,508
that these domains are actually secure.
24

24

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:20,447
So, OS X, Mac OS X provides deprecated or older versions
25

25

00:01:21,535  -->  00:01:24,733
of an important library for verification.
26

26

00:01:24,733  -->  00:01:26,800
This library is called OpenSSL
27

27

00:01:26,800  -->  00:01:29,583
and Python 3.6 and 3.7 got tired
28

28

00:01:29,583  -->  00:01:33,519
of using these deprecated old versions,
29

29

00:01:33,519  -->  00:01:37,307
so now Python 3.6 and 3.7, and probably older versions...
30

30

00:01:37,307  -->  00:01:40,980
Newer versions as well, are shipping with their own version
31

31

00:01:40,980  -->  00:01:42,944
of this library.
32

32

00:01:42,944  -->  00:01:45,950
Because it's their own version, it means that
33

33

00:01:45,950  -->  00:01:49,611
all the certificates, you know, keys and things like that,
34

34

00:01:49,611  -->  00:01:51,965
that your computer trusts by default,
35

35

00:01:51,965  -->  00:01:54,941
you computer says, johnlewis.com is, you know,
36

36

00:01:54,941  -->  00:01:57,703
this is secure because this certificate was created
37

37

00:01:57,703  -->  00:02:00,377
by this organisation that we trust.
38

38

00:02:00,377  -->  00:02:03,999
Python doesn't trust those organisations by default
39

39

00:02:03,999  -->  00:02:06,660
because it's a completely different library
40

40

00:02:06,660  -->  00:02:08,846
than the one that comes in your computer.
41

41

00:02:08,846  -->  00:02:11,577
So if you want to make Python
42

42

00:02:11,577  -->  00:02:15,080
usable with https, what you have to do
43

43

00:02:15,080  -->  00:02:17,118
is you have to instal something
44

44

00:02:17,118  -->  00:02:19,468
that is inside your Python folder.
45

45

00:02:19,468  -->  00:02:22,287
So I'm gonna bring it up.
46

46

00:02:22,287  -->  00:02:24,501
What you want to look at is, you wanna find
47

47

00:02:24,501  -->  00:02:27,834
your Python folder in your applications,
48

48

00:02:29,146  -->  00:02:30,679
and notice how it's Python 3.6
49

49

00:02:30,679  -->  00:02:34,529
and then I've got Python 3.7 here which is a new version,
50

50

00:02:34,529  -->  00:02:38,574
there is a thing here called Instal Certificates.command.
51

51

00:02:38,574  -->  00:02:42,099
All you have to do is double-click that.
52

52

00:02:42,099  -->  00:02:43,964
When you do that, this will work.
53

53

00:02:43,964  -->  00:02:45,716
Okay, so all you have to do is double-click that,
54

54

00:02:45,716  -->  00:02:48,423
that is gonna instal the certificates
55

55

00:02:48,423  -->  00:02:52,140
that you need in order to trust these secure domains.
56

56

00:02:52,140  -->  00:02:53,868
Again, the code linked in this lecture has some more
57

57

00:02:53,868  -->  00:02:57,402
information on why this is happening
58

58

00:02:57,402  -->  00:02:59,586
and, you know, how you can fix it.
59

59

00:02:59,586  -->  00:03:00,487
So that's it for this video,
60

60

00:03:00,487  -->  00:03:01,643
just wanted to tell you about this
61

61

00:03:01,643  -->  00:03:03,409
because it's a frequent problem when you start
62

62

00:03:03,409  -->  00:03:06,173
making these requests and it can be a big pain in the ass
63

63

00:03:06,173  -->  00:03:08,064
to solve, especially if you don't know
64

64

00:03:08,064  -->  00:03:09,827
what you're looking for.
65

65

00:03:09,827  -->  00:03:12,456
That's it for this video, I'll see you on the next one.
