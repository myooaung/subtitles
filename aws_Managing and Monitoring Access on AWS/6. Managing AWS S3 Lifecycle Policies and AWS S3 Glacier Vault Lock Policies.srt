00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,150
[Autogenerated] in this section,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,400
we will cover a special class off policies associate

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,540
ID to s three and s three glass, your services,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,380
lifecycle policies and the Volt lock policies.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,950
Let me start with a street as usual.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,830
Let me go for the definition first and as three lifecycle

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,070
configuration is a set of rules that the fine actions that

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,880
Amazon s three applies to a group of objects.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,900
There are two types of actions expiration actions which defines

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,470
when objects expire in transition actions defining when objects

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,020
transition to another storage class.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,140
Now the exploration part sounds very clear,

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,240
implying a scheduled election off objects by means of a policy.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,940
The transition part can be more obscure.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,640
Transition to what?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,080
Let me try to clarify.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,890
Let me recap the different classes off s tree storage.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,550
We have standard as three storage the bark.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,440
It's that we have used the so far as three standard infrequent access.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,650
You pay less for storing, but pay a feat with reviewer that a street standard,

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,140
infrequent access one availability zone.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,080
You pay less for starting you pay a fee to retrieve data

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,070
and the services as less availability.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,080
A street glassy,

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,130
which is currently there archive with the lower cost but high latency to

26
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,270
retrieve your data and finally as three glassy deeper five,

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,290
which has the lowest cost and the highest late.

28
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,740
And see going from Howard's two days to have your data back.

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,450
Now it is clear what life cycle policies are about there

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,070
about saving money by moving data on the basis on the

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,460
importance off the different data sets.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,180
Let me show how to implement a lifecycle policy.

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,280
The scenario is very simple.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,880
Has a global Mantex idea Administrator.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,440
You must ensure lower usage costs off yours three boxes.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,570
My taking into account the relevance of the data and how

37
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,540
much frequently they are accessed.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,790
Your task is to create the for living a rule Move all objects in the

39
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:26,690
develop folder to AWS glassy after seven days,

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,840
let me go to s tree service dashboard and let's move to our target Back it.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
We have already our develop folders in place.

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,740
The here Now we move to management and let's create a lifecycle policy.

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,440
Let me provide proper name.

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,210
We specified the folder or perfect where the policy applies in the drop

45
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,380
down menu with specify our target as three storage class.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,510
We acknowledge that we will incur in additional cost.

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,190
Now we move all versions to glassy storage as well.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,740
We leave the expiration policy as it is and done.

49
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,480
The rule is created.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,740
This was very simple.

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,390
Now let's move to the next.

52
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,240
The topic.

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,090
Glassy volt lock policies.

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,900
A ST Lucie Volt look allows you to easily deploy and then fourth compliments

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,890
Control for individual s tree glass evils with a volt lock policy a ST Lucie

56
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,420
and forces the control set in a vault Look,

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,200
policy toe help achieve your competence objectives.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,140
For example, For data retention, we have the following scenario.

59
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,850
As an 80 administrator of global Mantex,

60
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,320
you are asked to ensure that your archived the data are

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,340
compliments with SEC Rule 17 a four F,

62
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,440
which dictates a retention period of one here for your data.

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,860
Your task is to create a volt lock policy to forbid

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,080
objects election before one here.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,200
This kind of policy is also known as W O R m Write.

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,670
Once, read many.

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,140
Let us start with the glazier a dashboard.

68
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,040
We create a new vote with a meaningful name.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,240
Let us use the full value and keep notification disabled for the moment.

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,790
As you can see, the Volt is set up in Frankfort region and done.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,200
The vault is created.

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,440
Now let us create a volt lock policy.

73
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
We add permissions.

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,240
We specify a principal Ellis in this case will feed just for them a purposes.

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,780
We specified that the action delete archive is denied and the other

76
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,860
condition which says that the dis applies within one year from the

77
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,940
uploading off that specific archive.

78
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,190
When we initiate the vault lock policy, As you can see,

79
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,480
we are provided with Bolt i d.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,390
Let's take note of it.

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,740
Finally, we complete the world lock policy.

82
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,040
We provide the Devote i d.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,640
And once we acknowledge our vault lock policy is created and cannot be deleted.

84
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,200
A list can upload archives to this glacier vote,

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,630
but cannot delete any file until the archive has

86
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,000
been stored in the vault for one. Here
