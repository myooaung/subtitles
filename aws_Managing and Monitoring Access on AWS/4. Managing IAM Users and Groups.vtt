[Autogenerated] managing I am users and groups after having

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.140
securely managed and locked out the root user as 80

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.080
administrator off AWS environment,

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.940
you need to create the users and groups to share access with AWS

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.690
environment with your global Mantex colleagues.

6
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:29.740
In this demo, we're going to explore these topics how to create groups and users,

7
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.940
how to manage multi factor authentication with the vehicle devices,

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.190
how to get access to dashboard and how to provide aws access keys for

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.450
I am users before movinto a degree s environment.

10
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.560
Just one note on multi factor authentication.

11
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.640
Beautiful devices.

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.770
A bless provides support for multiple platform Oh,

13
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.040
the Google authenticator, Last Pass authenticator and others.

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.490
All these solutions are of a label for both Android and IOS smartphone.

15
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.140
For our ____, we will use OT,

16
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.260
which has been selected for its simplicity and because

17
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.180
it allows installation on our laptop.

18
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.400
Now it's demo time.

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
Let's begin with the creation of groups as a reminder.

20
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.220
Groups are collection of user which share the same privileges.

21
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.780
Group creation is very simple.

22
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.940
Let's go to the many on the left side.

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.640
The first thing to do is create a group for administrator people.

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.090
We provide this treatable name, which is at mean off course.

25
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.590
Then we have to specify your policy.

26
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.540
We will talk about policy later in this course,

27
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.910
but this moment is enough to know that Amazon make of label

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.430
for as a policy which grants administrator privileges and

29
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.240
the done our group is created.

30
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.040
Let's now quickly move to use a creation.

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.790
Let me add our first user.

32
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.040
We choose Bob as the name of our first administrator user.

33
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.240
We need Bob to have access key to use the Seelye,

34
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.440
and we need Bob to use the dash word.

35
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.020
Then we had the Bob to the other main group does

36
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.840
immediately in granting admitting privileges.

37
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.780
Let us keep tags for the moment.

38
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.050
As you can see, Amazon provides the page.

39
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.940
It reviewed the configuration so far, let's go for a quick check.

40
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.100
And after the uses created, we are also allowed to see the secret access key,

41
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.040
and the past soared to access the dashboard.

42
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.590
Now it's time to activate our Vettel and Murphy for User Bob.

43
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.510
Let me remind you that we are logged in as a road user,

44
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.940
So let me looking with Bob credentials just used these linker in new browser.

45
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.910
And here we go.

46
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.040
Now we're able to manage our AWS account with our I am user Bob.

47
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.550
Note that we are actually stagnating as Bob at our AWS account name.

48
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.390
Let's move toe I am services and let's select our user.

49
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.700
Let's no move to security credential to set up the M F A access.

50
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.240
First, we create an account on multi service by providing mobile number.

51
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.140
Select the SMS as channel to receive your code.

52
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.480
After you receive an access code, type the code and here we go.

53
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.230
We have been verified.

54
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.640
Then we had an account on AWS dashboard.

55
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.240
We select manage M F A.

56
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.840
We go for very little device option.

57
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.000
We generate a secret key and pastor into old the

58
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.610
application for the new account.

59
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.710
We select the type, which is Amazon Web services and type of Bob as name.

60
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.700
And that's all.

61
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.740
Now my APP is generating one time parceled each 30 seconds.

62
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.800
All we have to do now is to select the two consecutive

63
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.910
codes from our oath application and paste.

64
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.480
Let's very fight.

65
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.140
Look out and look back in with Bob credentials.

66
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.450
Now we're asked between certain MFP code we copy the most recent OTP

67
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.520
code generated by our oath e application and done.

68
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.810
We have successfully logged back in AWS account.

69
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.840
Let me show now that we can accomplish the same task with AWS Eli,

70
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.680
let's suppose that we have already created the second user called the Alleys.

71
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.630
With this command,

72
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.640
we create a veritable device and we write to a file with secret code.

73
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.320
Then we take note off the serial number and we retrieve

74
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.350
the code and paste into our oath.

75
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:36.350
E application does create in a new device which we call Ellis Device.

76
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.390
Then we take note off two consecutive one time password

77
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.840
codes generated by oath application,

78
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.150
and we fired the command to enable the virtual device.

79
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.650
Since you know output is presented here, let me show the result.

80
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.040
With proper see, like almond,

81
00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.280
we have successfully created an additional vehicle MF a device for user Ellis.

82
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.490
Let me look in with Eli's credential.

83
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.000
An M f.

84
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.150
A code is requested just based on the most recent code,

85
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:20.370
and here we go successfully Logan Dean as Ellis and let me know,

86
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.890
rip up all the mean topic.

87
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.940
So far,

88
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.060
we have learned health securely locked down the road user How to enable I am

89
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.400
users for the by the operation on AWS account we learned about different

90
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:48.000
Emma Fe options with art were tokens and virtual devices and we have set up a parceled polish for our I am users.
