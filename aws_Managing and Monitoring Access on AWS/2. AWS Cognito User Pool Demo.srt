1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,290
[Autogenerated] it's them or time.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:10,040
Let us run some demo to demonstrate AWS cognito User poll and identity pool.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,640
Let's start with the user pools.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,840
We have the following scenario.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,430
We have a basic user pull configuration with no local user.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,180
Configured Authentication is done by means of external identity provider

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,360
Google and is them or we will also show how to use AWS.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,770
Cognito hosted the user interface to facilitate stagnant procedures.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,420
Also, take note that given the complexity off Italy escalator configuration,

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,640
we will review and already configure the environment.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,580
Let's move to AWS Cognito dashboard and let's go for user poll section.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
I have some configuration already in place.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,500
Let's select for these them or the one called the test.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,420
Now integrated.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,970
There are towns off possible configuration.

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,130
So let me go for the more interesting ones and let me skip the ones which are

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,540
configured with default values as dictated by this scenario,

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,940
we have no users configured the here.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,610
This section will be automatically populated after that user

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,090
has been authenticated against the Google.

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,970
Let's move to up integration and less taken out of the domain,

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,910
which represents our public face in entry point for AWS cognito user poorly.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,080
Instance when we moved to AP client settings,

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,670
we see that we have enabled Google and user pools as our identity providers.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,340
Also note that we have a place that a generic cold back you are ill,

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,030
which is where we will be redirected after authentication process.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,940
Now it's time to move to Google console.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,040
We go to open authentication constant screen.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,320
As you can see, we have configuration in place,

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,440
which says that Amazon cognito domain is authorized.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,370
Then we moved to credentials and select the already created the client.

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,200
A few things to note Here you were.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,140
I was already being configured with our AWS cook me to domain,

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,570
also taken out of client I D and a claim to secret,

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,140
which we will need at a later stage.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Let's go back to AWS, cook me to dashboard and let's select identity providers.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,870
As you can see,

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,740
Google is already selected and configured with

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,700
proper Client I D and Client Secret.

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,100
Now the fun part.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,330
Let's move under application clients,

42
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,440
settings and letting start hosted user interface.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,340
A second in page pops up we select continued with Google option.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,960
We are really reacted to my personal Google account feeling with past suit

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,010
and done were redirected back toe Our test called back.

46
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,550
You were all which is example dot com.

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,680
And now Well, now Google has redirected here and also provided the code.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,210
Now,

49
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,010
since we're not developed a full framework which

50
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,280
automatically takes this code and do some action,

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,940
I will show you how to use discord in a more manual way.

52
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,490
Let's move to Boston men.

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,540
I have already crafted an FBI coal.

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,350
Not that the your l is our AWS cochinita domain.

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,040
Be sure that the client and the match with one configured and passed

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
the code we received back from Google and done.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,140
A token is returned to us.

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:46,000
This token can be used at a later stage with AWS Cognitive entity pools and exchange it with AWS temporary credentials.
