00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.850
now with Pivot.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.420
I'm going to start with Brenda's having whose two front paws on the wobble board.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.150
And I'm gonna reward him while he's in that position.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.110
We're gonna move my body slightly when he moves with me.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.540
I clicked.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.510
Reward Move slightly the other way.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.930
Yes.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.110
That way he's learning to go both directions.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.500
Absolutely have it with now.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.650
I don't want a four feet on the wobble board for this purpose.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.550
Since I am teaching him how to pivot,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.600
turn into more.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.220
Yes.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.110
Turn the other words drunk.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.650
Yes.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.450
Usually doesn't take you long for dogs to cuts on this.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.660
You move with and if you need to,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.130
you can always just kind of walk into them and just push them very lightly just to

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.670
encourage them to move their back.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.060
Peter,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.420
once you don't understand that concept,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.890
you can start to lure them with food when they move their backseat around with.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.450
Very good.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.950
So once again,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.050
I'm taking my food more and I just body I'm not actually.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.940
Yes,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.690
very good.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.950
Go both ways.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.990
Yes.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.450
Very good.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.950
Go the other way.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.370
Yeah.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.140
Good boy.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.460
Ready?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.050
This way.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.880
This way.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.020
Get it,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.490
Get it.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.450
Get it get it a little more difficult for him this direction.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.350
So I'm gonna go in rewarding halfway and reward for the full term.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.340
Now will go the way you like.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.810
Usually,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.250
dogs will have a dominant sites of the homicide they prefer over the other.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.440
Just depends on the dog.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.850
Get it?

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.550
Yeah.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:28.980
Going to add Mike,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.350
you now for this trick,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.460
it will be It's all lured him and I'll say,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.910
Give it.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.470
Yes.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.310
Good boy.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.150
One are here.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.290
Just a bunch of times.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.760
He told a thoroughly it.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.650
Yes,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.150
right.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.050
Is it?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.560
Yes.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.200
Good boy.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.540
Ready?

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.400
Yes.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.250
Good.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.420
Very good.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.770
Until eventually you actually get a solid pivot without any food lure.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.090
Yes,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.860
Employed.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.300
I was awesome.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.450
All right.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.450
Job money.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.420
All right.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.940
Hopefully that was helpful in demonstrating how to training.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.620
Pivot,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.550
You don't necessarily have to use a wall before.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.460
Can use your dog's bowl.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.330
Um,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.740
I just showed us to use this because it gives them a bit more of a worked out because

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.860
they're trying to balance on.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.220
Um,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.040
thank you all for watching guys looking forward to seeing you on the next video
