00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.250
So everyone back to the online open a training here.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.220
Different showing to evolve off your body.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.030
It's one of the more advanced tricks on the course,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.870
not even sitting in this chair next to it.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.650
I'm gonna have still jump on and off the chair.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.920
I want him to jump on off cushion,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.950
specifically,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.440
very Lord.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.980
Right back.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.970
What?

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.080
It also reward him for jumping.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.730
Good.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.130
And you want to repeat this just a few times.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.190
You don't want them to become too reliant on getting their reward for jumping up once they

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.360
understand what they're supposed to do,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.190
you want to only give the reinforcement on the ground because you want to be reinforced.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.360
Yes.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.020
Very good.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.910
Yes.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.030
Good share.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.280
So I thought you can call it vault.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.550
You can honestly call it anything,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.050
right?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.150
Really good.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.500
Once your dog understands the concept that they're supposed jumping on and off nutrition,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.710
we can actually sit in the chair.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
What?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.250
The cushion on your lap Sit.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.280
So I'm just gonna place it right up there,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.010
and I'm gonna do the exact same thing.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.930
Except well,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.050
I'm sitting in the chair.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.670
You could even tossed,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.060
treated.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.910
Get it,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.770
get it good job.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.320
Uh,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.320
it I want to repeat this exercise a bunch of times.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.790
Good.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.350
Until they understand what they're doing.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.510
Stuff ready?

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.550
Here.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.530
Have a Yes.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.180
Good boy.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.920
And what's up?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.020
So I got up?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.900
Yes.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.850
Good boy you are right.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.870
All right.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.400
The next phase of this strike,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.550
you don't want to move to a,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.950
uh,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.470
and you're gonna wanna actually sit up against the wall while holding the cushion through

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.260
your dog on and off,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.550
you boy.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.840
So I'm just kind of resting against the wall here to give him a little bit more.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.400
You wanna keep this one time?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.050
Yes.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.780
Good boy.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.580
And once he's really got the idea,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.300
you could get rid of the cushion.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.630
And you could just use your body.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.350
Good boy rebirth.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.990
Good boy.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.880
Keep in mind.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.640
You still want to be standing by the wall and you don't want to move out into the open

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.620
until your dog is really super.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.330
Yes.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.920
Good shot.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.750
If you'd like to teach your dog to rebound off the wall,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.160
you want to do the exact same thing.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.650
But just by holding the cushion up against a wall,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.830
start holding love him.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.530
Target in reward Yes,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.050
Very good.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.930
I'll slowly start to raise the cushion higher so he actually has to jump off the wall

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.330
itself.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.660
Yes,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.450
very good.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.540
Okay,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.470
way.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.410
Eventually,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.150
you'll just get rid of patricians lately.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.560
Yes.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.450
Good boy.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.440
Boy.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.650
Thank you all for watching this video looking for to sing in the next one.
