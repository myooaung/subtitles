00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
Hello,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.780
everyone.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.200
Welcome back to deal online,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.590
Ohana.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.580
Dog trick training course I'm here today with my friend.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.330
The border.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.480
Oh,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.390
okay.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.170
She is very excited to help.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.110
Awesome tricks.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.650
So what we're gonna be working on today is actually waiting to your legs.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.450
So I like to start with my dog on my left side,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.680
and I just take my food lore.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.450
They lured him right through like that.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.280
Do it with the opposite leg.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.850
Is why,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.670
yes.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.040
And our word right is she's coming through and coming out on the opposite side.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.710
Very good.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.550
Why?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.750
So tiki actually already knows this train.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.480
Ideally,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.050
you want your dogs.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.350
It is possible.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.970
Yes,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.570
To step forward the opposite leg and reward eventually.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.160
Want to be giving less reinforcement,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.950
dogs actually going through your legs.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.250
So you want to be stepping forward about rewarding until the second time they go through?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.490
Good.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.650
Eventually you want to have something that looks something like this.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.850
Good.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.270
Once your dog understands what they're doing that so you can either say,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.570
but we've I say go through because my dog already he is an agility ops.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.000
So that's why they go through.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.550
Call it whatever you want on A It doesn't matter as long as your dog understands what it.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.180
So you all enjoyed watching this video we're looking forward to seeing in the next one.
