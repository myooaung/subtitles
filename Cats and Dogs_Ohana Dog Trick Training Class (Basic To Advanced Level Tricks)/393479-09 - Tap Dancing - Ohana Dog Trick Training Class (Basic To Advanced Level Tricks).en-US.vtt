00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.830
Hello,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.430
everyone.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.440
Welcome back to the online Ohana dog training course.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.250
I'm here today with my friend Murphy,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.150
the German shepherd.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.240
And hey,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.790
we're going to show you how to teach your dog to tap your leg on command.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.750
So I like to start with my dog right out in front of me.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.650
And I will simply I place my hand good,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.640
right where they can get it on my leg.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.610
All right,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:45.650
That against wait free.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.230
So I'm doing my impairing my right hand with my right leg and my left hand left,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.850
like So when I reach out with the left hand,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.240
I want her to reach out with her.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.550
Right?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.350
So it's her opposite?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.980
Yes.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.110
So I'm just basically trying to get her to mirror me.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.450
Good.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:25.050
That's Yeah.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.380
Hurt.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
You want good?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.050
They should figure it out.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.360
Yes.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.910
Good girl.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:48.200
So once again,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.950
when I put my once mighty out,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.280
I want her happy.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.550
Yeah,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.250
Euro.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.860
Good.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.750
You eventually want to start trying to fade out your hand.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.310
So that way,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.250
they're not totally reliant on your hands,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.650
is it?

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.950
Yeah,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.550
but I want girl.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.290
So I have my head up a little bit higher.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:19.380
Yes,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.950
now you're starting to figure it out today.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.430
And if she doesn't with the wrong pie,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.250
just ignore it.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.460
I don't want to teach her to do with the wrong Wait.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.020
Yes,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.030
yes,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.210
That's what I wanted.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:54.390
So then you had your shot with Yes.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.060
Good.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.030
One more time to show you you are drawn.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.750
I just waited for her to make the right.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.280
Um,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.300
just keep practicing.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.880
Not working on that Every day.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.440
Your dog should run.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.810
How to tap dance.
