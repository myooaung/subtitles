00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100
So the next trick,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.570
so can I.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780
We're gonna show you stay as a teacher.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.930
Darted orbit a backward circle around you.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.480
Your dog should already know how to back up before you try and teach this trip.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.450
And it's also help initially know how to spend.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.770
Um,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.110
it's a good shirt to help teach here in awareness.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.150
So what you want to do is you want to start intended a tight space.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.950
I have a chair here to block him.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.350
I also trying to keep him in a type.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.380
Yeah,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.650
I will reward right here.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.150
What?

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Right.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.550
And he gets rewarded halfway.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.750
Very good.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.330
So I've actually been working on this with him for a little while now,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.980
so he already kind of has an idea what he's doing with beginner dogs.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.760
You definitely want to be rewarding a lot more in the beginning.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.090
Guess what.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.250
And eventually you should have an orbit that looks something like this.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.820
It's once your dog understands what they're doing.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.250
You also move more out for this trip.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.400
This is hard for Mitt.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.350
Should ideally look once your dog has learned all the steps.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.250
Good job
