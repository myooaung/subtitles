00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.030
Hello,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.610
everyone.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.050
And welcome back to the online over the dog training course.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.130
I'm here in today with renegade.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.930
And today we're gonna be showing how to train your dog how to jump there.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.150
Hope,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.340
Good boy.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.580
Just like that.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.610
Um,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.750
when you start off training this trick,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.560
you want to actually start a little bit lower the ground so you can just lower right

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.590
through good click and reward that behavior.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.960
I'm going to do it again.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.730
Yes,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.350
very good.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.000
You actually want to start with closer to the ground or even on the ground if you need Teoh

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.000
.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.630
Just so it's easier for them to get through the hoop.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.290
Good boy.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.850
Once they're confident with going through it,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.450
raise it up a little.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.960
Ready?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.380
Ready,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.910
Frank?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.250
Go.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.850
Uh,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
So you still want to be luring them in this?

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.840
Um,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:21.450
until they're confident with going through it once they're confident with going through

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.850
that you can actually,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.850
out of cute mind.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.180
Is there a word for you could also see the room?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.150
Um,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.150
you start raising up a little bit higher.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.980
Okay.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.420
Sorry,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.780
buddy.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
This happens.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.750
That's okay.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.300
Just don't let them get freaked out about it.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.470
You don't want them to be afraid of very good.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190
You can start to mix it up a little.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.850
You can have them come from behind you.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.350
Good.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.150
Certain raises even more,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.250
right?

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.740
Yeah.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.050
Good Brie.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.070
So he's a little unsure about it being that high.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.250
But he did go through it.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.020
Ready?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.340
Go.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.290
Good boy.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.230
And the goal is you just want to get your dog as confident as possible with going through

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.950
the hoop because it isn't very natural for them.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.050
I want to jump through like that once their dog is reliably going to the who couldn't get a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.010
little bit fancier.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:57.000
You can try to Who upset once here in oops groups?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.370
Yes,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.080
Groups who lives?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.450
Yes.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.900
Let's go.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.490
Yes,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.910
go goes.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.630
Yeah.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.750
Good boy.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.880
Yes.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.240
So another cool daniken dio with Japanese,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.740
actually a double hoops.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:28.210
Really?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.010
A lot of fun.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.990
You can have What?

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.550
Um that's about all for this video.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.350
I hope you all enjoy and have fun training your dogs
