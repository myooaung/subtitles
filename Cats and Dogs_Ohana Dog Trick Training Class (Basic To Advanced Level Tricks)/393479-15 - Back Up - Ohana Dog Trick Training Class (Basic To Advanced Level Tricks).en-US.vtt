00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
Hi,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.520
everyone.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.180
Welcome back.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.670
All my ohana doctoring Course I'm here today with,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.550
and we're gonna show you how you don't have a backup using a Christian.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.040
So right here,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.050
I have my cushion.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.260
I am essentially using this targets for him.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.750
That back up.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750
I'm just pushing back.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:46.990
You're Yeah.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.290
So when he touches that cushion with that C I A reward.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.800
Okay.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.790
Very good.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.520
He might only want to touch Beginning.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.250
That's okay.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670
You just eventually want them catching him.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.090
Okay.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.550
You got both feet on there for a second.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.350
Turning out just a little bit.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.120
Yes.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.950
Very good.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.350
Yeah.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.660
Good.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:38.290
I want to reward while on that.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.890
That way,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.810
I'm rewarding him.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.050
Lock?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:50.660
You don't want to reward Just having your back on.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:09.950
You want to?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:26.850
Yes.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.610
So once he understands what he's doing,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.940
I'm going out the back or back,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.860
or whatever you use.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.500
I want to make sure he understands what the behavior is.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.250
So before I add that Uh huh.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.240
Right.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.600
Actually already knows this,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.950
um,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.450
in a little bit further away with him.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.390
So I want him touching his targets back,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.750
and I don't want him backed up.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.650
Right?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.960
Very good.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.220
Eventually you can actually ditch the cushion.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.950
Want your dog understands how to fast after in a straight line?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.580
Yeah,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.270
Yeah,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.350
but yeah.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.390
So although,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.590
actually get rid of this fishing for sure.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.450
You healthy good boy.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.010
All right,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.180
hopefully videos helpful for you all.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.550
Um I'm looking for to see you all in the next video.
