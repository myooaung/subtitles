00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
Hi,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.040
everyone.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.470
My name is Cassie Candy.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.080
This my dog renegade.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.950
He is a one year old border collie.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.940
And we're going to be demonstrating how to do some fun tricks.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.160
Dog train stuff like that,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.980
all from the safety of your own home.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.160
So demonstrate one of the tricks friend has learned really quick.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.470
Here,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.270
sit.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.740
You need a hug.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.510
Good.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.350
Why?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.870
So that's just one of the fun tricks you'll learn in this course.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.100
We're gonna start with something really simple.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.360
Guess so.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.990
As you can see,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.420
I clicked this little device here that we're just called a clicker as soon as he focused on

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.770
me and was so I'm gonna wait for his focus again.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.190
Yes.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.480
So as soon as he focuses on me and gives me his attention,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.460
I get from the reward.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.350
Yes.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.910
This clicker basically just lets him know that he's being good and thats why he's getting

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.490
your award.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.160
So he associates click,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.450
click with trees.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.140
After you repeat this,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.360
a certain number of times will start to know that what they're doing is good in the current

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.950
behaviour.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.900
And you can click it when they dio what you want them to do.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.950
so lie down.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.380
Yes.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.150
Good morning.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.450
I'm actually just using his kibble.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.130
You can use your dogs meals to train them or treat.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.760
Uh,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.300
this is slightly more affordable,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.550
and it gives him something to dio.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.970
So I just have him work.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.970
First couple read.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.450
What a good boy.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.030
I just want to repeat this much time,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.150
so it's really solid.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.900
They really understand.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.170
What?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.320
Yes.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.430
Yes.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.070
What?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:13.780
Thanks.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.110
That was a good job.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.230
Can you give me a high five?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.270
All right,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.900
so that's about it.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.260
For our first lesson.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.520
I'm looking forward to seeing you all in the next video.
