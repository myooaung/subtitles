You want to take the reward and simply lure your dog.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.050
So I just lured run into a spin?

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.150
Um,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.660
Yes.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.650
Good boy.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.720
So I'm getting him to do a spin.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.740
You're with my hand.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.550
He already knows.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.350
This shark is You can tell he's anticipating it a little bit,

Good boy.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.850
Can also lure them in the opposite direction.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.270
Ready,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.250
right?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250
Yeah.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.620
They don't want to fall.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.290
You could always encourage them to get it right.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.770
Good.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.610
Uh,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.910
I you also want to make sure that your training this at a time.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.700
Your dogs hungry?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.820
Because if they've just eaten,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.200
they're not gonna be a Z interested in following the food.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.760
Drop the one on the ground.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.250
Ready?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.750
get.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.250
It's up here.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.140
We're gonna go the other way too good.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.290
Once your dog is getting it,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.650
you can start to hold the food a little bit higher.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.370
Yes.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.850
get read.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.570
Come.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.250
Thank you.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.550
It's sit,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.970
Get,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.250
get,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.170
get.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.610
Yeah.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.680
Good boy.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.800
So he's a little distracted right now.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.560
There's a ball laying on the ground over there,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
and that's what he wants.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.270
Yes.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.920
Good boy.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.770
And eventually wants your dog understands what they're doing.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.670
You want to start fading the food lore out,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.450
you can just flick your wrist.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.470
Go the other way.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.330
Yes,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.550
we have the queue.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.670
So I use spin for his left side.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.390
And I use twists or his right,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.190
and eventually you'll have something that looks like this.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.040
Focus,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.950
focus.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.030
I got treats right here.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.500
Ready,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.620
spin,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.320
spin with twist.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.950
Good.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.500

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.050

that's about all for today.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.640
We'll be back in the next lesson,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.560

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.280
