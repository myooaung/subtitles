00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
Hi,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.530
everyone.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.580
This is Cassie Ramone.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.650
Mona's dog training.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.360
This is my friend Badham.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.570
And today we're gonna show you how to teach your dog how to roll over.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.870
So I'm gonna start with food lore.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.250
Gonna lure him into it down first.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250
Good boy.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.600
Second step is hate.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.700
Take the food lore,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.520
and I'm actually going to lure him onto his side first.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.950
About halfway,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:59.070
boy.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.050
So I want a market reward that behaviour when he rolls over.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.130
In some cases,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.150
dogs will be more reluctant to roll onto their side.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.600
So if that's the case,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.380
you reward your dog going over.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390
So take food lower.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.650
Yeah.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.940
Good boy.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.750
So he already knows district.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.450
It's been a while since we've done it from on a regular basis,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.250
but he remembers this morning in a long time ago,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.730
but some of the first learning it's a little bit harder for them to roll onto their side.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.420
So we're gonna try the opposite direction.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.950
This time.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.850
This might be a little bit more challenged,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
especially because he's proficient.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.060
Come on,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.470
get up.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.950
But all right,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.980
so we're gonna try to straighten battle with sure,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.950
rewarding him.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.750
I get bored.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.620
I want him on his side,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.650
ideally like that boy when they reward him halfway there and just slip them over.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.250
Come on.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.550
I get it.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.400
Family.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.950
Come on,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.250
You know.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.310
Get it?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.830
Yes.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.040
Go,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.270
go,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.510
go,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.700
go,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.050
go.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:56.280
We're just gonna go this side,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:23.970
since he seems to prefer that it's no doing given the for the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.470
get it,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.740
get it,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.020
get it.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.260
Just people get it.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:43.480
Try a little bit different.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.350
Angle him here.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.750
This helps.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.580
Good.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.960
Good.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.050
Got a scratch?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:01.550
You're try to get over on her side,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.590
but can roll.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.230
Yeah,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.980
bowl.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:38.020
I don't

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.700
Right out.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.890
Oh,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.520
yeah,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.480
boy.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.390
Right.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.190
And that's about it.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.790
You just want to practice both sides.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.410
So that way they get used to doing it on both sides.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.320
Just the water repetition.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.870
And eventually they should learn.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.550
Have to over.
