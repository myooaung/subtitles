00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.010
Yes,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.520
but,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.390
boy Well,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.650

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.480
Oh,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.850
boy.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.120
All right,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.520
once your dog has that,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.340
I understand doing you want the next which is you standing on the bushes and ask your dog

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.050
to do the same.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.650
Waas Yes.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.450
Award does to try that again,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.150
Right?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.750
Very good.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.170
So,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.870
as you can see,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.650
he's starting to place mind on my right.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.130
Now,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.520
how you want to encourage you talk to actually start stepping on your feet is close

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.050
together.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:03.720
So in order that and when he steps,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.160
I click and I reinforces Now it might be a little bit more off to the beginning.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.650
Your dog might only put one foot on yours and that's okay.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.650
You You just wanna move your feet a little bit closer together and that should do the trick

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.650
.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.690
You also can angle your toes inward and that's helped them for a spot.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.550
I want to make sure reinforcing while they have their position on years.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.670
