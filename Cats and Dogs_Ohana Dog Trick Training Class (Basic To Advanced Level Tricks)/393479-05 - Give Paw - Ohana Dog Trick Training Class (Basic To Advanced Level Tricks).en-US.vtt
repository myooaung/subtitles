I knew your dog.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.300
Yes.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.890
And when they lift you,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.450
marketer or so,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.040
ideally,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.830
when you first start,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.150
you want to go right under because they're not gonna automatic.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.280
You're gonna want to come like that.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.750
Stakeholder.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.550
Good boy.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.920
You want to be doing it with both paws.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.350
So that way,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.650
they were one boy.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.050
Repeat that a bunch of time until they got it figured out.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.520
Yes.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.450

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.260
Good boy.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.350
They might be barely lifting there.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.450
No.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.050
Once you got that figured out,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.270
you could raise your Yes.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.350
Good boy.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.150
All right,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.860
do it with the opposite hand guy.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.150
It also out of Q once they understand what they're doing.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.300
So whenever my dog Yes.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:00.230
