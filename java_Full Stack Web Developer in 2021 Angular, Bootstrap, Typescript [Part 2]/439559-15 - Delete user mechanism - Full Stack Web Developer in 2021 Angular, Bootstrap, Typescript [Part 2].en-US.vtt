00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.835
Under our next video,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:08.710
we'll set up the basic functionality for the delete user operation.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:19.450
So let's go back to our Visual Studio code and navigate to the constants class,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.884
where we will define a public static,

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:35.440
delete user of type string.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.900
And this will be computed of constants dot

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.560
user resource plus delete.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.940
And for our knowledge,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.930
we will need to also set up and actually send the ID of the user that we want to delete.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.930
Now let's go to our user service and defined

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.960
a new method called delete user with the ID as parameter.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:34.775
And over here we will invoke this HTTP that delete operation for the constants

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:40.790
delete user and will also propagate the ID of the user we want to delete once

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.875
again under our type script file.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:55.070
Let's set up some specific variables for delete user operation.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.265
So we will have of your child of

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:11.710
delete user model network map now delete user model in our UI.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.780
So this is a model directive specific child.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.050
And now under open delete user model,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.550
we can delete this statement.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.690
Invoke force the clear data to clear any possible existing data in the UI.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.515
This dot id will be equal to user dot id that we receive as parameter.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.420
And we will expose

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.000
the delete user model graphical user interface to the user in the UI of course.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.360
We will also need the delete user method.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.880
And under this method,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.560
we will invoke the user service delete user with

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.150
the ID that we previously set in the open delete user model.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.465
And if this operation has run with success,

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:38.690
will first hide the modal in the UI.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.500
Add a descriptive or message to the user,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.704
such as user with the ID.

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:55.910
This ID has been removed

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:10.130
and will also invoke the final users API to update the existing table in the UI.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.809
If the operation fail for some reason.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.400
We will handle the error case.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.100
And we'll attach the error message to the main message.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.730
Now under user component HTML,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.410
we will need to define the delete user model.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.270
So let's do this.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:08.669
The NDP modal hashtag delete user model,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.830
MDB model, class, model. Left.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.100
And ID should be delete user model.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.880
Tab index minus one.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.010
Not all should be dialogue.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.690
Rel, labeled by the lead user model.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.280
Aria, hidden, true.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:03.230
And now we need to set up a modal dialog div with are all document.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.840
Of course, the modal content.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.325
We are sitting now, the modal header,

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:29.885
text center for class.

00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:38.640
A modal title, font, weight, bold.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.120
And let's set up some specific message such as theirs or will be

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.150
informed if he confidence that he wants to do more user with that specific IB.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.110
As for the bottom type,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.530
it shouldn't be done and the class should be close.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.270
Label clothes.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.470
And for the click event,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.920
we need to either delete user model.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:49.790
So now we will have that x button suggested when we click it,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.480
we should go hide this dialogue.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.510
This sample send times simulates an X button,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:15.260
actually an icon that we can click on to hide this delete user modal dialog.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.900
Now we need to compute, of course,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:25.890
the mortal body center.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:43.940
We need to create a row and col md

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:51.600
12 button type button.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.255
We will use the primary color.

00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:02.550
In-class waves light.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.165
We're creating basically OK button.

00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:20.740
So on the click event will invoke the delete user method that we previously set up under

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:28.780
the type script file MDB waves effect and with an OK message.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:35.140
So once again, this delete user method is set up under

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:42.350
the Directory File to invoke the DDD user method from the user service.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.520
Let's continue under the HTML file.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:10:01.565
Now we need to set in place a counseled bottom, bottom type button,

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:05.540
MDB, color,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:13.530
secondary waves, light.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.770
Area, label should be Council.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.055
And on the click event.

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:32.340
We'll just hide this delete user modal dialogue.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.565
We'll use the NDP waves effect.

00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:39.290
And for the button text,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.700
we should go with council.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.660
So files for compiled successfully.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:00.185
And let's click on a specific user to delete it.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:03.350
150mm removal of user with the ID five.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.315
If we selected yes,

00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:08.840
you see that the user has been removed and also

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.400
the table has been updated since we invoked the final users API.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:27.160
Now, let's hope or no,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.874
fine user by ID dialogue.

00:11:29.874 --> 00:11:31.735
And let's force the user,

00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:34.120
search for the user we tie E5,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.215
you see that it can't be found since it was removed.

00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:43.010
Now let's first for the one with ID six.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.720
I want to go back to the user component ts.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.875
And if we weren't able to find the user by ID,

00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:19.730
let's also closed-off find user by the model.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.300
So let's open the model.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.250
Search for ID six and you see that the model has been hidden.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.300
Now let's delete it.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:43.345
And you see the user with the ID six has been removed.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:49.340
But we should also hide this refresh button.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.020
Since data basically has been refreshed using the find all users API.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.780
So in order to do this,

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:07.594
we should go to delete user method and set the filter in place variable to false,

00:13:07.594 --> 00:13:10.760
since we don't have any filtering in place.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.519
Once we involved or find all users method.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.124
As such for seven, the lead user.

00:13:27.124 --> 00:13:31.340
And you see that everything works now as expected also,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.500
the filtering has been already moved.
