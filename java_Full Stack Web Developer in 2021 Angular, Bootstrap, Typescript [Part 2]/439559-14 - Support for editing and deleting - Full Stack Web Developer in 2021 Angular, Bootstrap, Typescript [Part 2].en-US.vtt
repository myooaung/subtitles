00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
On this lesson, I would like to provide

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.770
the initial support for editing and also deleting users.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.980
So in order to do this,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.840
we need to navigate to our users

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.870
component dot HTML and

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.835
scroll down a bit.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:32.140
Under our main table, we need to set.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.255
But DD tag with the class FA,

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:44.360
FA minus edit, FA minus LG.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.600
So for this we will use the font awesome that we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.985
installed on the configuration process for our angular application.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:01:01.680
The style will be coarser with the pointer and the color will be set to green.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.480
And on the click event will

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.140
have a method called Open update user model.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.480
And it will receive as a bare-metal the user.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030
Let's close this.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.160
And in a similar fashion,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.890
let's do something for the delete or remove user.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.785
So I class FA,

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:53.575
FA minus trash, FA minus RG.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:59.214
The style will be the same coarser pointer.

00:01:59.214 --> 00:02:03.380
And the colour should also be green.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.700
And for the click event,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.079
we will lose a method open DDT zone model.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.320
And the user will be also settles parameter.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.640
Now in the UI you see that we have two icons that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.080
simulate the edit and delete user operation.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.350
So let us go under User component ts and set up those two methods in place.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.899
So the first ten update user,

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.950
model of type user.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.045
Let's use any and will be void.

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:08.225
And the other method, open,

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:15.965
delete user model of user any avoid.

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:20.400
So we have these two methods in place.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.060
And let's add just an informative message to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.530
see that at least one of these methods is invoked.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.880
Let's click on delete.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.090
And you see that the user is shown in the logs.
