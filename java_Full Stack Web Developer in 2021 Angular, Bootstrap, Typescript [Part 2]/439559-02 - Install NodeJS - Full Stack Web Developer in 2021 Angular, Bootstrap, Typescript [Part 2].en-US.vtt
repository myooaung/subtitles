00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
Our next step in our configuration process is to download and install NodeJS.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.080
So I can type in,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.500
download no GS in your favorite browser.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.675
And now you need to navigate to the node js.org page that opens.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:30.135
And over here, you need to use the latest l ds worse shown.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.355
And for my environment,

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:35.730
I have Windows 64-bit.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.715
And let's choose the Windows installer.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.830
Wait for this to finish.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.310
And we will install NodeJS sonar environment.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.820
Let's open it. Click on Next for NodeJS setup.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.270
Next. This is basically

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:14.370
a simple process to follow install.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.910
So now no JS is installing using

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:36.120
also the MBM that we'll need to use as part of our angular or build project.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.490
So lets click on Finish and verify for node and NPM had been installed.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.440
I open a command prompt and type in node minus v,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.505
you see the word Shun and NB and minus V,

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:54.305
c also the version here.

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.910
So everything is in place.
