00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Under this video, will work together on setting in

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.380
place to find user by the business logic.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.720
So first thing to note is to go under

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.255
the constants class and set up a new variable, public static.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:27.060
Find by ID of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.120
type string should be computed from our constants dot user resource.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.880
And we will also add ID.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.940
So moving to the user service Ts.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.919
Let's set in place some method called find user by D That really C11 ideas per kilometer.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.770
And we return no observable of any.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.200
And under this method will invoke

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.275
this HTTP get of constants find by ID.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:23.750
And we'll concatenate the ID to it.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.380
Now let's go under our user component type script file

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.010
and set up some specific data that will work with.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.925
Let's add a comment here.

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:00.590
And these are by ID.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.670
And the first thing will be viewed child element that will allow us to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.100
interact with modal dialog from the HTML component.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:23.049
So the modal dialog will be called bind user by the model and its type modal directive.

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:34.670
And we also need the ID has number and we'll set it initially as undefined.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:45.250
Also, find user by the message will be use in terms

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.140
of message for our find user by the motto.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.889
Clear the data.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.885
Similar to the main message and add new user info message.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.960
And also, let's clear

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:17.450
this field under the common clear method, clear data method.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.380
And now we will set in place method find user by d of type void.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:39.600
And over here we first need to check the value of FAR ID element.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.045
If it's not unordered_map.

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:47.410
And if the idea was not present in the,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.305
was not actually sit by the user,

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:53.180
will inform the user.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.395
So let's go on down the constants class and define a new state one here.

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:05.840
And use the reference to it.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.170
For example. Something like not the number error message.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.580
And we'll have our opponents to it here and do

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.570
the return so that the user would not continuing the process.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.835
If we have a valid ID where u z to involve the user service,

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:55.470
find user by the method.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.340
Do the subscribe.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.880
And on the success case of invoking this method,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.990
we'll need to force the clear existing array of users.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.590
Since if you recall that the users are

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.120
array contains all the users in the UI corresponding table.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.550
And now we need to just push this user bed.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.430
We retreat into the user array.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.310
So only this user will be exposed to the actual gland

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.860
that invoked this UI functionality.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.760
And on the error case,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.305
we first need to check if the status is equal to 404.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:10.330
It means that the user can be found.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.700
And let's add a constant value for this.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:32.240
So public static, user not found of type string.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.085
Let's go with user not found error message.

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:48.410
And a specific message that will be shown as user not found.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:02.004
Let's use this is a not found error message.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:06.324
And on the else case,

00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:13.790
we'll just set the error under the find user by Dean for message error, message.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.385
Now let's go to the other component,

00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:40.550
HTML and build the find user by the volatile dialogue.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.140
So for this, we'll use the div MDB model hashtag.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.780
Go find user by the model.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.979
In the BIM model.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.660
Last model for left.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:12.400
So please recall that the find user by the model with the hashtag needs to match

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:22.360
the viewer child element that we set up in the type script file style overflow, style.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.220
A, labeled by find user,

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.260
by Ib model,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.990
a, hidden, true.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.610
And on the opened event.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:54.800
We'll invoke the clear data method to clear any existing data from the UI.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:06.109
Now for the div class modal dialog will use role document.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:23.150
Div class modal content will come to the header.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:30.785
And of course on the header will need button to click on it.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:33.080
And once we click on this button,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.140
we should hide this model.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.260
So bottom, bottom glass, close border, right.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.820
Adl labeled clothes.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.425
And on the click event,

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:08.940
we just need to invoke the find user by the modal dot, hide, method.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.345
Span ADR.

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:24.590
He'd done true.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.150
And we'll go with the x.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.190
Now for the modal title section when setup or descriptive title for our model.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:51.670
And we will go with find by ID.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.050
Something simple.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.160
We'll need to compute the modal body.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.400
So on the modal body,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.050
the first thing to insert this message

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:24.170
that is exposed to if we have any informative message for the user.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:33.389
So if find user by the message

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.245
plus col md 12,

00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:54.680
and we'll use the find the user ID for message reference.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.820
Let's clear this a bit.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:21.430
And we need to set in place a new row live

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:31.550
class called MDG4, H5.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.850
Whereas the NDP badge default to true.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.810
And we need to use the ID since we want the user

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:52.030
to insert the ID of the actual user that he

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:58.150
wants to find the details

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:06.200
about the class called NDA input and the B input of type text.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.560
And for the 2-way binding using NG model will binding to

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:21.600
a dy d field class form control and the value should be ID.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:41.910
And now let's compute the modal footer,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.799
little button of type bottom,

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.370
end DB, BD and of color primary.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.590
And class with

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:14.250
slight area labeled.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.000
Let's go with fine.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.930
And for the click event,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.510
once we click on this button.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:36.750
We'll invoke the find user by the method.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:49.050
And of course, if we have any errors in the,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:56.900
any existing errors in this dialogue for the user by the message,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.685
we want to clear them out.

00:15:01.685 --> 00:15:04.010
So this is why I said, oh,

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.280
find user via the message to Mt.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.825
And MDB waves effect.

00:15:12.825 --> 00:15:16.709
The fine though statement.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:25.740
Now button type button and dv, btn color secondary.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.210
The class should be a wave slight.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:41.810
For this button will hide

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:49.080
the find user by the motto when we click on this button, of course.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.780
And let's go with the council string.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.510
Now this small dollar is in place.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.770
Let's fix this div indentation.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.890
So be careful with this dave sections to be sure that

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:42.290
the developments contain the corresponding data

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:48.560
and they are close the correct way.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.170
So at the end we should have four divs that reclose.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.790
And now in order to properly work with this model,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:05.040
we need to go on our cards.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:15.810
And for the find by ID card that's inserted the click event.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.890
And once we click on the Open button,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:26.360
will expose the find user by the model to the user.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.005
So let's test this,

00:17:35.005 --> 00:17:37.720
where I'll click on the Open.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.130
A farm by the model is shown not the number.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.680
A few don't insert a number.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.290
And if we select the one,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.885
you see that the user read idea reference one

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:58.100
has been retrieved from the server and exposed in the UI.
