00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.110
In this video, we'll work together on setting up Angular CLI on our environment.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.695
So I'll type in Angular than the browser,

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:15.015
and we should navigate to angularjs dot IO.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the main page for angular website.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.475
And let's rests on gets started.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:43.410
And we are wrong with the documentation.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.015
And let's click on Get Started tab.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:54.815
And over here on the Setup page,

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:59.480
you see that setting up local environment and water space.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.645
And we need to search for the corresponding command to install Angular CLI.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:16.369
You see that this requires so no GS that we already installed.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.120
And MPM package manager.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.345
So this two already installed on a previous video.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.490
And you see the comment here,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.880
npm install minus g for global Angular CLI force,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920
we should though chip for the NPM version.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.515
And now let's type in npm install minus g Angular CLI.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.500
So this will allow us to install,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.390
loan the package globally.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.320
And this so CLI will be used to

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.270
properly configure angular obligations from our command line.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.529
And you see that the Angular CLI workshop Dan has been installed.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.650
