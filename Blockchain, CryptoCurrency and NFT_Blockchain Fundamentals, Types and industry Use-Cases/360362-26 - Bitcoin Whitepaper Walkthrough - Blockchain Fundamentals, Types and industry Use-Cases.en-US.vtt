00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
in this video,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.550
let's take a quick look at the Bitcoins white paper whenever a Blockchain implementation

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.090
comes out.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.850
It is accompanied by a white paper,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.900
which discusses about an introduction by that came into the picture.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.010
What is the difference between that implementation and other implementations in the world?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.440
And what kind of technical details that it follows to ensure security off the blocks in

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.870
portable So as you can see,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.150
but going is an eight page white paper.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.600
I like this in the resources so you can download and go through the same.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.300
This contains all the details in sections off whatever we have discussed it.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.570
Now,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.220
As you can see,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.470
it contains an introduction with says Why isn't present to eliminate banks and

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.320
intermediaries.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.070
Then it comes to transactions where they tell about the still signatures and hold the same

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.800
transactions.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.840
They also talk about the importance of time stamp in this election,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360
how roof off work works.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.120
A second senses.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.920
I'll go out of them to maintain the security of deduction.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.350
How the network optics This section talks about hope,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.860
Transactions of broadcasters loads how lords except the transactions in blocks and added to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.910
the Blockchain Then we talk about incentives or rewards given to the minors for doing some

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.530
good work off mining on adding blocks to the Blockchain.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.200
Then we talk about the mark latelys,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.940
which we discussed also the verification off payments they're in Section nine.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.520
We talk about transaction inputs and outputs.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.780
This is the UTX,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.900
a model which we saw in the earlier review.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.680
Then it got the more privacy.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.110
There's an important point in privacy,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.870
which I want to talk about Karl Soule on anonymity,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.960
which I'll talk about in the next video.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.610
It also has some mathematical calculations.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.250
I improves off why this will definitely work in the real world.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.960
So if you're a mathematician,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.590
are interested in mathematics,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.350
you can go through these details.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:05.580
I forgot to mention that this Bitcoin as a protocol has been completely written in C

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.150
language.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.320
You can also take a look at the words,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.740
notes or sport of Bitcoin available on the Internet.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.280
So,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.640
yeah,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.210
the eight page document gives a lot of details about Bitcoin.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.090
You can go through and let me know in questions are by a private message.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.740
If I have mr discuss something or if there is anything interesting that you're found out

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.700
from this like paper,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.990
see you in the next week
