00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
we know that because it is a global currency based on Blockchain technology.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.150
So who invented it because it was invented by a person called Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.480
But when they say it was a person,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.490
take it with some truckloads of salt.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.550
Because the real identity off Satoshi Nakamoto is not known and still anonymous,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.550
it could be a single person or a group of people who created the wonderful global currency

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.890
based on Blockchain technology.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.040
Why is this global currency called Bitcoin so revolutionary?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.200
It's because of the properties that it does The first property bit coy is intimidated

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.050
because,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080
as in traditional banking system,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.300
it is not controlled by any central authority.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.300
Federal government in the U.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.610
S.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.380
And Bank of Canada in Canada are the central banks which formally the monetary policy off

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.450
the respective countries.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.450
They define how much money should be printed on and mediate the money flow in the country.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.630
Bitcoin is distributed because each node in the Bitcoin ecosystem has a copy of all the

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.560
transactions that happened in the ecosystem we saw in the last section by a distributed

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.550
system is secure and hostility.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.390
Bitcoin is decentralized.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.890
Imagine if you want to send money from Canada to the U.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.290
S.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.500
You would need to go through my people Central authorities to do this transaction in this

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.330
example you need a Canadian bank a U S bank for foreign exchange.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.190
Except in case of Bitcoin,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.080
none of the central authorities are required to do work transaction.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.700
It is only limited in Bitcoin but going is also restless.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.930
This property might be a bit misleading.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.890
As we have seen,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.570
the Blockchain is very frustrating.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.970
What we're really talking about here is that you do not need to consistently party here.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.910
Also imagine that you are doing some transaction among your friends that becomes a custody

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.240
environment where you have faith in your friends.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.080
How are in Bitcoin?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.000
Even if you do not trust the other lords,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.250
the system operates Ville,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.070
that's the ecosystem is just lis.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.200
Were notes which do not trust each other can also contact between them.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.850
That's with properties like disintermediation distributed decentralised and Cussler's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.490
bigeye and rockin have revolutionist the banking system.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.980
We look at how the big kind works in the next video
