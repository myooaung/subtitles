00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
fine.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.980
In the previous video,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.260
we looked at how to farm abruption by linking blocks together by hashes on how that will

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.650
make a Blockchain immutable.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.380
Well,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.620
no.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.750
See how it helps under distributor Natural,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.590
consider there are six notes Inter network and everyone wants a copy of the Blockchain

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.400
Notice that I replace the word public ledger with Dr No because now we know that a block

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.850
intense transactions on it is card chained together with other blocks.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.820
And that's our Blockchain spoke when a hacker wants to attack minute book and he wants to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.450
attack a block in the particular Blockchain in a particular Lord Because of hashes,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.420
the Blockchain goes for a toss as a year when he attacks the third block in this particular

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.480
Blockchain held in this particular Lord,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.850
This Blockchain goes for a toss.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.990
So what happens in this case Since this is a distributed network and every nor has a copy,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.000
the other notes can give the rate copy to the attack.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.350
Don't and make it right again.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.850
Let's look at a Demoff this in under Starcom.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.600
As you can see,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.070
there are three piers A,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.960
B and C on holding a copy of the Blockchain with five blocks each.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.320
As you can see here,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.620
See has five blocks.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.730
B has fired.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.450
And yet you have five blocks.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.620
No,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.330
If I'm a hacker trying to change something in the third block off here,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.860
be the other two.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.550
Notes can exactly know that something has changed in the third block off baby.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.030
Then they can correct it by property.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.130
There on top your deflection topiary be because Piercy has this block as 1/3 rock.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.060
Where is Pierre be?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.780
Has the other one beer?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.160
A.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.040
Also isn't consciences with PFC saying I don't have a different block and hence we need to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.650
change what we will be House.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.550
This is a beauty off a distributed P two p network.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.960
The hiker has to simultaneously changed all the competition,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.750
the network,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.160
the hack,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.790
the system,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.250
which is nearly impossible.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.830
So now let's revisit the challenge.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.370
Number two we still haven't answered who were very further transactions.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.340
How do we want them and being a lace hold the implement a consensus mechanism in the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.560
previous example when we changed appear beast Blockchain how can be re and C be sure that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.680
they copy that they won't is the right one.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.000
They need to be in the consensus with each other,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.350
right?

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.750
The answer to all these about questions is called Mining.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.030
When you go for an interview,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.940
let's see the interviewer the last four years certificates and degrees,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.050
so make sure you are a valid person and an automatic to do your job.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.340
You are providing him Approve off your education to let them know that you are an authentic

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.790
person,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.350
right?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.230
In other cases,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.260
like a running race,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.910
you prove that you can run faster than others to get the reward to get the prize money

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.450
right.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.680
You always need a proof toe.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.750
Believe in someone that he or she is a value person in the real world.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.810
In the same way in the digital world,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.570
North's needs some work to be done by a validator on the North has to prove that it has

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.190
done that something to validate the transactions on back to the Blockchain.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.830
Not every nor can add a block to the Blockchain want.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.630
If I change a transaction before adding it to the block it.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.080
What if I'm?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.030
I hadn't hacker.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.450
I want to confuse the network.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.450
There are some special lords that big transactions from the list of transactions add the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.330
transactions to a block and does something to prove the network that they're valid notes

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.850
and not trying to 100 system.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.620
Once we have a proof that he has done that something,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.250
his block can be added to the collection and he can be rewarded.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.350
They're also penalized if they try to do something malicious.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.950
They have been speaking about doing something to be done to prove this heart into city.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.500
Thank this.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.920
Something can be whatever like approved me that you're rich are proved me that you are a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.350
part of the network for so many years are it can be anything.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.030
When we look at Bitcoin as an example of Blockchain in the next section in detail,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.990
we will understand what rules does going.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.950
Expect from miners to let them add blocks on the Blockchain.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.870
The concept of mining would be crystal clear.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.120
Once we see an example in Bitcoin building state,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.350
you
