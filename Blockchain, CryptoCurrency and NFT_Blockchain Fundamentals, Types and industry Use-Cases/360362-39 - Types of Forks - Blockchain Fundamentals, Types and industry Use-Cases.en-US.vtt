00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
well,

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.060
we saw how that was working,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.060
the last video and you're so started our attack,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.750
which made atriums Blue Tinto called atrium and the Tedium classic right.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.560
We also briefly discussed about this thing called us,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.850
forking very Blockchain spits in tow.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.250
This happens when people do not agree upon a point and come to a consensus on it,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.580
it said.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.940
There's a bunch of friends who want to go out half of them,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.550
work or play fast foot and the other half one so quite continental cuisine.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.820
So these two friends do not agree upon each other till the end,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.140
and hence they split.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.960
Let's say there are 10 trends.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.120
Five Goto Continental and five go too fast it in the same very in Blockchain.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.110
If there is no human between parties,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.450
then the Blockchain is forced to split into two.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.010
One group of people who are agreeing with the point goes in the same rupture,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.890
and the other group of people who don't want our their decision is not backward compatible

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.350
goes to a new corruption.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.280
That way,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.860
we'll did I want happened in July 2016.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.150
People did not agree and agreed upon removing the hackers transactions from Dealogic.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.370
So this led to a split in the block header one lineman Double NW.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.060
When this folk happens,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.240
there's an important property.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080
I want you to know banana in this plot.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.860
191 double blind double a person ones One eater.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.220
After this pork happens.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.180
What happens to is in the Syrian Blockchain.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.420
He holds the monitor.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.630
But then when it medium class explicates this bloke,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.860
this Blockchain also has the same Genesis block as a medium.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.720
And hence whatever transaction happened on this Blockchain is this point in time.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.300
It's also transaction that we don't play Ethereum Classic and helps.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.010
This person will get one meter plus only medium classic as well.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.450
So this is our heart for works Whenever there is a split,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.110
if a person has a born either he gets one meter under new Ethereum Classic as well in the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.490
same way because it has undergone some working toe,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.990
we look at secret in detail.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.460
In the last part of this video,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.280
however,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.470
there was another fault that happened in August 2017.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.850
The cats in boxes off a kind block can be only one name be.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.800
When I began only fertile.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.220
So many transactions on that block consort only once in 10 bullets.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.250
So it was like only 6 to 7 transactions can be done per second,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.410
which is not a good in the real world.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.380
Considering these iron MasterCard,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.350
there's just thousands of transactions per second,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.940
right?

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.910
That's why people suggested,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.100
Why don't we increase the block stays off the Bitcoin from one and B 28 MP because they

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.390
wanted to fit in more transactions into the block.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.070
If there are more transactions,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.890
the minor does not need to do anything more.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.370
It's just that he needs.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.840
He asked more connections,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
and he needs to find the norms and do well the proof of local garden just in the same bed.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.540
So he had us well.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000
They did not complete consensus.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.030
Have the people agree and half the people did not agree to it.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.240
And hence Bitcoin's split into the regular Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash if you can see in going

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.970
market cap,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.750
because cash is also being traded actively in the current market,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.430
having seen Bitcoin being split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.540
there is another four that happened in October 2017 and the at the block for land 1407 This

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.050
made because split into Bitcoin and something always been going good.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.380
This happened because they won't say increasing usage off a six in Bitcoin mining.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.890
You remember the Essex which were application specific integrated circuits which were very

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.890
,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.130
very powerful on at the same time costly.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.320
A common person will not be ableto afford this and hence the mining as opponents of was

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.850
becoming more and more centralised.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.850
But Hughes players taking up all the computational power.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.730
Some people in the Bitcoin ecosystem did not want this to happen and hence does that we

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.770
should eliminate the usage of a six from the Bitcoin mining.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.010
But somewhere against it and hence the split happened.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.060
We need to look at two things here.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.720
Soft heart folks.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.030
These are the two types of full second happen,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.640
right?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.030
So when we looked at it going,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.650
folks,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.890
we saw about Bitcoin castigating the blocks in Toto on Bitcoin Girl spitting the octane in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.590
Toto again.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.210
Right?

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.740
But segment is another folk.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.070
That happened in July 2017.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.710
But this distorts built block genital so whatever for does not script.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.610
The Blockchain is called It's a soft work.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.150
There is something that Spitzer platoon in total.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.350
It's got a hard look.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.270
In other words,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.500
you can say that after the four happens.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.940
If these blocks are backward compatible,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.470
then it is a soft work.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.370
If it is not,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.970
then it becomes a hard fork.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.800
Usually in Southport,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.010
it tightens the rules in the Blockchain and the heart falls it low.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.800
Self those.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.050
Let's look at an example of the art for Candace offer and see how it forms.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.850
Let's take an example of the heart folk in which going got splitting Toby going on Bitcoin

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.460
cash.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.150
So until this point,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.410
all the blocks in Bitcoin ecosystem had my name be.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.580
Blocks is right after they decided pulls plate.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.940
Let's say a 0.7 nb block came and so this is compatible and hence can't be news in the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.030
Blockchain and then a primate and be blocked came and so this is also since it is

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.430
compatible with Bitcoin,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.440
it also exists in the same Blockchain.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.630
But this is when we got an eight MP block according to the new rules set by Bitcoin Cash

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.010
and from here,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.380
all the blocks that come after this are putting the Bitcoin cash ecosystem,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.760
and from this block it becomes a new blood.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.520
Jim Bates I'm one of the blocks which coming that we're going Blockchain 20 new in the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.760
Bitcoin Blockchain as well.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.750
This is how hot forgiveness happened.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.450
Remember that here backward compatibility is not possible.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.360
He until this point it says that only blocks which are listen wannabe will be accepted in

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.020
this not check.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.900
And here we see eight and big.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.550
We are increasing the block chains,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.440
which means we are loosening the rules.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.150
And hence there is a heart fork.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.650
This is what happens when there's a soft foot that's happening.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.430
So let's say I'm reducing the maximum boxes from one and B 2.3 am be there has not happened

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.430
.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.370
I'm just a hypothetical example pushed the new ways so to this point as usual,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.340
there was one MP plots in the Bitcoin reduction and then appoint for and became,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.350
since this is also acceptable belong on MB,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.450
this also Paladino's in the same Blockchain.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.010
Then came points A and B,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.920
and at this point we decided that we'll give you need to only have a maximum blocks.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.480
Azov points a and B from nowhere.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.970
So after everyone decides upon it and since this is backward compatible because 40 MPs also

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.340
less that then maybe everyone decides upon it and then minimum minor Big Sur block which is

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.300
one and being safe.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.640
If you be rejected by the other boats because all the notes in the current election has

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.450
accepted back from the next block,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.930
it's going to be only point favorite.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.750
So after that whichever bloc this only points A and B baby accepted and the others will be

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.220
rejected.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.250
As in this case,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.570
this is an example of us off.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.760
We saw that there was another four that happened in Bitcoin that was called the segregated

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.500
Witness or in Shark said with.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.250
So this happened in July 2017 and segregated business is the soft fork.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.440
So what happened?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.960
Waas Since the block limit for Bitcoin was only one name be,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.150
there was a limited number of transactions that can be put into a lot.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.400
And since every practice mind would leave once in 10 minutes,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.720
it was crossing a serious scalability issue for Bitcoin.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.690
And then people noticed that every transaction,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.320
handsomely still signature associated put it So this signature was taking that for to 65%

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.450
off the entire transaction passion since.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.910
So this decider,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.520
I'll strip oak that signature from this transaction data and put it somewhere else in the

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.890
block because of this,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.470
the blacks is was not increase.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:43.100
But they were able to fit in all transactions in the block because signature has Mr Now

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.900
let's look at the other concept called destined Brody Fork.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.660
So in a Blockchain,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.980
been a minor minds a block by finding our hash out the block with leading zeros that has

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.700
been considered.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.750
I survived broken being added to the Blockchain.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.350
Let's at this point when there is a find and B block there,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.000
there are two murders who find palate blocks at the same time.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.360
Right there is this person who from this block and there's another minus four from this

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.670
block.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.010
Since both of these blocks are valid with the sun number of leading zeros,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.950
both of them have given their competition work through the proof of work and found out this

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.950
.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.230
So what of these can be accepted as benefits.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.490
But what will happen is only one of these can be accepted by because so but going has this

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.290
rule Caldas longest chain will be always accepted.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:36.010
And hence whichever bloc gets more blocks after that will be accepted as the longest chain

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.850
and the other one becomes our friend.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.750
Blocks This we have seen already on this kind of a fork,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.810
whenever it happens,

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:48.570
is called a temporary for Remember that a temporary for couples to minors find valid blocks

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.380
at the same time.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.850
That's it about four King.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.300
Next,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.970
we'll look at I,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.350
CEOs and other types of fundraising using the Blockchain that for
