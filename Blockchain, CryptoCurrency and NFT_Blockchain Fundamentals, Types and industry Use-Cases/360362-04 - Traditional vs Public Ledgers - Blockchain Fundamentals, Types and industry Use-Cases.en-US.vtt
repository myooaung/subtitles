00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
to understand Blockchain,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.000
we need to first understand how traditional systems work on the issues pertaining to them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.250
From there,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.500
we need to understand they expected an ideal solution that we want to achieve.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.510
Considered a traditional banking system and four people A,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.790
B,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.760
C and E.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.870
Whenever they want to make a transaction among themselves,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.300
they send a request to the bank.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.280
The bank holds the records off everyone's accounts,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.200
their balances and transactions.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.000
This record is called a Villager allege it is simply a record which holds income and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.680
expenses.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.070
No,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.410
when you want to transfer $50 to be,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.290
the bank verifies the transaction and added to the Villager the verification goes like

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.460
Doesn't have enough money to send Toby Explain the bank also act as a source of trust,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.010
and that's what everyone believes in.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.310
The account balances on transactions that the bank ledger holes.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.360
So when you're let banking account shows that you have $100 left,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.250
you believe in it because you believe in the bank in the similar manner.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.450
Transactions between B and E off $20 DNC off $3 are all recorded by the bank.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.510
So what's the problem with the system Looks like everything is working fine and everyone

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.360
believes in the bank.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.050
Can you think about it?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.360
But imagine a situation where a hacker wants to hide the system.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.150
He can simply hurt the banks over which is the one Lee storage off all the transactions and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.780
balances.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.060
This collapses,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.670
they in their system and all four will lose their money.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.650
This is known a single point of failure.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.890
Also,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.970
there can be another situation where the bank decides to shut down.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.040
All of us are on this will also affect the system and people involved in it.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.470
This situation is known a single point authority.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.350
No.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.050
Having seen the disadvantages off a central authority called the bank like single point of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.880
failure and single point of authority,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.780
these disadvantages only exists in a centralized oclock by centralised network is the one

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.880
we're all other lords.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.090
Intern.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.810
It'll depend on one Central lord.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.990
So what are the other types of networks we have decentralised network where there are

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.480
multiple points of execution.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.190
For example,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.680
Facebook's over a spread across job graphics.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.880
If the Central Lord in Canada is compromised it laughing only that region and not others

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.510
This solves the problem of single point of failure.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.950
But authority still dimension Facebook.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.640
The other type of network called Distributed Network,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.840
is one where all notes are connected to each other and no,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.150
no has superiority over others.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.250
They all collectively hold data and hills.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.180
If an attacker wants to attack the network,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.490
he needs sort back all the nodes in the network,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.620
even if one,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800
nor has compromised the network times.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.180
So how do we want it to be?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.740
I want a system where everyone has a copy of the document our Ranger,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.970
and it has to be automatically updated with transactions whenever it happens.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.970
This is called a public ledger.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.700
A public ledger is a distributed system in which all the lords,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.150
whole transactions and account retails off all other lords.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.610
For example,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.190
the same four people A,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.430
B,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.200
C and D decided to have a public ledger instead of depending on the bank.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.150
This is how it will look.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.450
Everyone has their one copy of villages.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.630
The initial state where he has a balance of $100 is reflected in everyone's copy of the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.990
ledger.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.790
Anyone students for $30.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.280
Toby.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.480
That transaction is also hard at all the copies of the letter.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.760
For now,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.500
imagine that the ledger is updated by Internet like a Google cheat.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.870
A similar scenario when b.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.250
One seconds for $20 to see and so on.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.000
This is a concept of public legis.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.670
There are a few problems here which needs to be addressed.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.950
Let's look at them in the following videos.
