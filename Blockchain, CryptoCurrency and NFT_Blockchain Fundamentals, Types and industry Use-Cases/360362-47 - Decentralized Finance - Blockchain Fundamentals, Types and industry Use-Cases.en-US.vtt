00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
In the current world,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.720
the entire world of finance is centralized,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.920
and that's the reason why we can see that we're paying a lot of fees to these financial

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.760
institutions.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.450
And also we can find a lot of remote places in the world which are not financially included

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.450
.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.770
Castle people there will not be able to get a loan.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.450
Are will not be able to do a banking transaction because times are not available in their

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.850
area.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.720
What if became decently is the entire finance and make it possible for anyone in the world

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.360
to make a transaction but any other part of the world with Justin?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.250
Internet connection.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.430
Also,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.590
all that that's possible with banks like giving loans,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.430
borrowing money,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.500
taking a credit,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.050
paying interest rates etcetera is possible using Russian.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.640
That's where decentralised finances moving toe Decentralised finance is not a product.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.760
It's kind of a concept which has been devised and hence a lot of people are working towards

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.650
an open source finance which can decent less in their financial institutions.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.050
Space didn't a lot of companies working on decent list finance as a concept with deals with

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.360
anything that works on Blockchain in a decent way,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.180
smarter and it deals with finance.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.670
For example,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.390
payments,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.410
stable coins,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.180
infrastructure exchanges,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.120
investment.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.110
Know your customers deliver those marketplaces.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.210
Except UPS are few off the top picks in which many companies are working this report by

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.530
consensus starting it.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.790
But it's 100 projects pioneering on decent,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.490
less finance.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.730
I like the Lincoln the Resources section so that you can go through the entire list off

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.260
companies that are working on these interest finance,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.580
which will also give you a good understanding about what are the types of decent lease

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.020
finance applications that can be billed under are being the so,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.550
having seen the current concepts that are existing,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.000
indecent,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.650
less finance,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.220
I would like to talk a bit more about stable clients,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.780
as we have seen in the investment part of this course.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.480
These are that the cryptocurrencies are very well today,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.560
and hence Bitcoin changes from $3000 to $8000 to $15,000 little days,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.200
which is not possible in their traditional stock market right,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.470
and hence we needed some stable grains which are pictorial world currencies or someone set

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.200
backing by them.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.340
Imagine if you are a person who is lending me one meter today.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.880
Tomorrow I'm going to pay one meter with some traditionally interests agreed upon by the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.690
smart contract.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.410
But then what is the value of Peter when you are paying me was $200 when I am paying you is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.480
$1000.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.920
That difference needed to be guard down and helps stable coins came into the picture.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.950
There are a lot of examples and companies working on stable coins like Die,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.830
which is a US depicted stable coin built on Ethereum.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.690
There's also in US decline.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.000
Working on a US dollar backed stable coin.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.130
There is Germany Dollar working on the same concept.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.230
We also have stable unit which has decent less privacy,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.150
stable coins.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.250
All of these companies and examples are available in the same link that I provided you,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.550
and hence you can go through them in detail as well.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.270
So doctors,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.240
how decentralization and Blockchain technology is going to change the way finances working

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.820
in the world.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.450
We already for in detail a huge revolution in the form of Bitcoins that is changing the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.250
whole banking work in the entire world.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.290
We have a global currency called has been applying on other cryptocurrencies now,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.300
these decent,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.460
less finance applications,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.740
once it is adopted by the public,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.020
will definitely make a lot of impact in our lives and whole finances handled in the entire

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.250
world.
