00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.870
So having said a quick war,

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.400
you about permission doctrines.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.600
Let's look at where in the degree of centralization graph that permission blocks in certain

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.520
so we can see that the race systems,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.990
which are completely centralised,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.650
total the right end off the centralization graph,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.550
and then comes permission private shared systems.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.690
And then comes permission private shared systems.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.460
An example of this would be a company applying Blockchain application,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.380
and all its transactions are within the company's Blockchain,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.000
right?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.490
So whoever is the company's employees when we will be able to look at the transactions and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.450
not others in the general public,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.230
then comes permission Public shake systems.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.660
Let's say you build a block chain like Wal Mart is building for Chinese pork and you allow

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.960
general public toe.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.740
Look at the your court and see if this food has come from a particular place or not to find

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.080
impetus.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.480
Organic are great,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.990
has come from this specific place very disclaiming Toby,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.610
except so this can be permission and public shared systems because probably can read it,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.250
and it's also permission for my taxes.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.260
Another example would be a country the playing a Blockchain application with all

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.510
citizenship data So if words of citizens within that country can get into the permission,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.190
the Blockchain.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.730
But the other countries would not be able to look at the doctor in and read the citizenship

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.020
greater.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.940
In this case,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.150
it will be a permission to public shared system.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.660
Then we have seen in detail about the permission less public shared systems.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.330
For example,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.450
the big kindnesses that is 100% decentralised.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.400
So what is the advantages of 100% decent delay system is sent such a persistent scaled or

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.420
last number of lords.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.690
We have seen that there will be about 210,000 notes in the Bitcoin network.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.010
No,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.090
and it's a one global Blockchain.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.480
There is no permission as in an African and American and Indian and Australian.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.400
Everyone is treated the same in the public doctor Berries in the central A system our

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.040
permission to private shared systems.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.450
There is privacy because your own want your date out of freely available to the public.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.850
They're scaling the transaction throughput as we have seen Bitcoin alos only about 6 to 7

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.770
transactions per second units.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.250
Blockchain.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.400
But that is not enough for the company to do transactions so We need a lot of transaction

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.000
throughput here,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.260
like sic semper 2000 transactions per second,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920
at least to manage this Blockchain within the company.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.150
That's why private collections focused on scalability,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.500
but not our number off loads.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.680
There will be many interacting block tens here because let's say there is one block general

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.680
.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.940
There are channels within that channels and important concept in the hyper fabric,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.990
which you will understand if you get in details off the high polluting fabric project.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.560
Right?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.100
So there will be one company which says this is a channel between the company and its A

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.430
player,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.830
and there is one other channel,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.870
which is this is a general between the company and defend our exit.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.810
So that's how different channels and many impacting auctions are there in the enterprise

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.410
ecosystem.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.930
Let's look at the differences between permission less on permission to block chains.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.640
First,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.790
let's come to the access where it says the permission less open reading great access to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.300
date of this,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.380
we have seen in Bitcoin that anyone can be a full nor or light northern Bitcoin and do

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.770
transactions in the database.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.080
There isn't permission.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.490
You need permission from the Senate was Carl s membership service provided that in happy

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.560
little family to read or write access to the database.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.060
As they told before permission list,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.930
Blockchain scaled a large number of lords.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.390
But they're not really concentrate on transaction.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.650
Throughput are it is difficult to bring in Trooper.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.270
That's why the existing block chance like Bitcoin and Ethereum,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.320
are facing a lot of scalability issues as more and more transactions coming,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.290
they want to execute faster.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.680
But their block time was set last 10 minutes or 15 seconds in the initial stages itself.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.630
So the transaction throughput is getting ahead because of the last number of notes and the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.120
concert's algorithm that they have.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.910
But here in permission,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.300
we don't have these mining algorithms like proof of work or proof of stake those.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.810
So the scale in terms of transaction throughput is very high,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.940
but it cannot go to a last number off loads.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.030
If you see a typical application in typology fabric,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.830
it will be about 5200 lords maximum more than that will not be ableto operating this

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.530
permission to blocking environment at all and in permission lists block change.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.670
We have proof of worker proof off steak or any other consensus mechanisms for the Lord's to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.200
stay in contact with each other.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.530
But here explores membership pensions,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.780
and I'll go to them as well.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.200
Let's say you are a person who wants to play for her.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.470
Leave.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.060
You go to your manager and your manager goes to a V P on that.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.030
So you preventing endorsements within the entire complete rate.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.270
So in a Blockchain.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.660
Also,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.760
the verification process is done in the same way.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.930
We can say that in this Blockchain,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.960
the CEO will be the person who is very paying.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.000
All the transactions are there will be an argument who is very freeing.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.650
All the transactions are there can be a group of people.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.120
Let's say five people are endorsers on.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.640
We can say that out of five,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.170
if three very further transactions considered dark,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.200
I survived transaction and I repeat election.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.360
That's all permission to consensus looks he had the identities on animals are so none of us

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.360
.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.840
So I must have seen when we saw that on our dresses visible to everyone but not the person

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.470
behind it.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.290
Here.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.770
Identities are all known to the Blockchain because when you want to enter the bloc team to

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.610
read or write.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.210
They need the identity.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.680
But then transaction identity can be private,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.150
anonymous or pseudonymous.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.440
This can be decided by the logic returning the block tentative.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.740
When it comes to assets,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.110
we have native assets in the permission less Blockchain like Bitcoin has the Bitcoin

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.500
Ethereum pass eater.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.610
Ripple has rippled,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.940
Brian,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.420
Except in here.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.880
We don't have anything off the concept off cryptocurrencies because the company does not

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.360
need a pregnancy to do it.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.600
They just want to save the transaction data into the Blockchain for the mood,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.350
ability and problems purposes.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.980
That's why we can have any answer data order state in the permission blocking,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.450
not the triple.
