00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
the third main issue that people are trying to solve in Blockchain is they interoperability

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.960
?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.070
Interoperability,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.120
as the name suggest,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.640
is starting between auctions.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.490
For now,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.460
let's say if you have a lot of Bitcoins,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.850
let's say millions of millions off it.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.400
Also,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.580
there is no way that you can interact with the smart contract build on it,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.100
Miriam with Bitcoin.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.820
So it is a big problem because there is a lot of Blockchain is coming up like we have been

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.050
going ethereum new your yours.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.690
Yon carrano,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.210
etcetera.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
All this block change our existing in silos within the ecosystem.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.480
You don't look fine because I can do transactions between each other and everything looks

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.220
fine in a secure,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.150
inimitable manner.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.950
But then whenever I want to go to a different Blockchain and interact with that,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.700
it becomes very,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.850
very difficult for me to do that in the current state.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
Because other individual I cannot hold tokens off each and every Blockchain and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
Cryptocurrency that's available care like I need one broken.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.370
And if I am bridge,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.500
I'll be holding that broken,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.630
which I'm here to which I am Sandoz.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.760
I cannot expect the other person who I'm trying to transact with in the world to hold the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.950
same Cryptocurrency that I hold intended to be able to send some token and that gets

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.650
converted automatically in tow,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.840
talking that they prefer,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.450
Right?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.180
Also,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.220
Bennett comes to dlrs r p.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.570
APS.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.090
It's very important for a developer to spend corporate is that he asked,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.550
on the guts that he's spending so he cannot expect its users tohave apart.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.310
People are Cryptocurrency transactions in the Blockchain,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.680
and hence interoperability becomes a very,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850
very important issue that needs solving in the Blockchain ecosystem.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.720
Many companies,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.040
such as Cardinal Branching Year and etcetera,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.450
are working on solving this.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.030
So when we look at in Problem T and Howard works,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.330
this is the purport solution.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.670
As you see on the screen,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.150
there is a distributed ledger,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.550
one on the civil religion.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.760
So currently,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.600
this deal D one and D lt to our existing in silos.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.070
The proposed solution for interoperability is that there will be a gateway nor indeed lt

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.450
one,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.950
and they get the Norden deal veto on These two cannot be each other.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.720
This talking needs to be moving on as we science I changed.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.400
It needs to be a simple payment verification nor as well.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.210
So many of the proposals coming now are proposing that if you're trying to inter operate

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090
between Bitcoin and Ethereum,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.750
let Bitcoin and Ethereum B side change for each other and helps that can be possible.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.010
There there is an interface,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.340
and there are Gateway Lords and they can talk between each other.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.380
There's a lot of issues in that manner,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.820
and we hope some hold this gets all on.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.650
There is a global block scene where a new any Blockchain can't doctor any other Blockchain

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.310
in the future.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.280
For example,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.340
the cardinal direction is working on this kind of a solution where they treat other block

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.670
chains apart from cardinal aside chains.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.150
So after so in the section,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.090
starting side chains and internal probably deep are three burning issues in the Blockchain

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.580
ecosystems and people are trying to solve this,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.260
you can go read about it,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.890
and it involves a lot of mathematical verification and a lot of implements on a daily basis

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.890
.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.030
So stay updated.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.000
If you want to know where the Blockchain future is going through,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.840
a lot of such way,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.460
we are going on,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.370
so who knows?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.950
You can also solve this problem In a very simple matter.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.600
Let's look at the latest addition.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.830
Subtraction like a tree in Puerto Carreno,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.380
etcetera,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.850
in the next section of this course.
