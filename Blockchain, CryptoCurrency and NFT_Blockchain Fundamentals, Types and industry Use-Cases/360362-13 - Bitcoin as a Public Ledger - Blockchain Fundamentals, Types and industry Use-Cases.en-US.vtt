00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
We know that Bitcoin is a global currency and like any other currency,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.050
it should be transferable to others as transactions.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.380
So the same concepts that we saw in the previous sections,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.880
like everyone in the ecosystem having a copy of the public lecture all of the constructions

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.520
being known to all the North's The network being distributed in nature uses a pistol

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.350
signatures to validate transactions.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.550
I'm Daryn transactions two blocks on having a Blockchain all hold group in case of Bitcoin

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.550
.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.050
Also,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.550
however,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.960
between the previous understanding and now there's an important difference to Lord down.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.380
I expect Public ledger where U S dollars are transferred between people since because a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.350
separate ecosystem on the global currency by itself,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.420
enough us dollars Bitcoins are only transferred in the big going Blockchain big concert

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.370
usually represented as BTC.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.090
Since the Blockchain is kept a graphically secure And since Bitcoin is a currency by itself

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.090
,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.070
we can call it a Cryptocurrency.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.250
