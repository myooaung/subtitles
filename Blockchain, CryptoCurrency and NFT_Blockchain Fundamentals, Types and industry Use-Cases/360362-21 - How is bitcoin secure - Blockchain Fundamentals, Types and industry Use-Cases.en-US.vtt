00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
we saw what is proof off work and how would helps in mining.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.150
Now,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.890
proof of work is a consensus algorithms being which our Lord needs to spend a lot of

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.600
computational power toe,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.150
satisfy a certain conditions for a block on Lee.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.060
Then the block can be added to the Blockchain.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
How is this proof off work going to help us make the Blockchain more secure?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.770
Let's look at an example in Nando's dot com again.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.370
When you go to this tokens demo will have blocks with some transactions and hashes as well

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.070
So if I am a person,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.370
.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.870
I'm a hacker.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.650
I want to change the transaction.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.200
This $97.67 from Ripley to Lambert.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.680
I want to change it to 1002 $100.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.050
Lexi.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.570
If I do this,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.770
we have seen that the house changes and hence the entire Blockchain goes for a toss were

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.390
saying that this block is not accepted now because the hash does not have the leading zeros

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.350
as we require.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.890
But the person who is changing this can mind this block again.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.150
By finding a different Lawrence,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.830
he can make this block ballot again,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.050
but then he needs to also mine.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.670
Yeah.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.330
Now you can see that the mind,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.780
the block with the new norms.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.130
Now,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.150
the hash off this entire block put together has the four leading zeros has to be expected.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.400
But then the other blocks in this Blockchain still have to be changed.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850
He can also go on to mind the third block,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.250
then the fourth block.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:44.490
Look at how long be required to mind a block and find unknowns.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.710
We require only four leading zeros.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
When the difficulty increases to something like 18 zeros and between ecosystem,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.390
you can imagine how long it takes on.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.170
Let's say the minor also successfully minus the 50 block.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.790
That's the last block in the Blockchain.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.700
So this is all valid blocks?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.040
No.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.660
And this transaction of 1002 100 will be accepted by the Blockchain.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.050
But not yet because there are other peers in the Blockchain which hold the actual

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.150
transaction that happened.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.060
And when this piers go to this theory,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.620
until that you know you have a different transaction.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.450
Please take a copy of my Blockchain because minus what is accepted by the entire thing and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.320
your transactions seem to have changed for the manner it was difficult to change four

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.110
blocks itself and took a lot of computational power on time to do that.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.090
How can he managed to change the entire data in very beer?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.570
B and all the other Pearson,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.090
the Blockchain.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.360
This will take a lot of time and other minus will not let them do that.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.690
And the reward that is getting for this with nothing compared to the computational power on

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.840
investment that he's going to put it to do this.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.370
That's the reason why we called Bitcoin as a very secure network.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.430
What we understood the power off proof of local garda them by this example.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.290
You are welcome to go to this Anders dot com that's slash Blockchain slash tokens on trade

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.080
for yourself and see how it is difficult to do it.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.820
See in the next video.
