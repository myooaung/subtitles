00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Hi,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.250
everyone.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.450
Welcome to the section on Bitcoin when we look at Bitcoins in detail and Howard templates

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.250
as a fraction,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.640
having seen blocking briefly on understanding how it works without any intermediaries,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.550
this section will help you understand all the nuances off the technology itself.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
We know that Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.780
This is immutable security.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.650
So what would be the use cases of Blockchain?

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.460
The very first really very use case of Blockchain is called Bitcoin,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.550
where Bronstein was used as underlying technology to build a global currency.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.970
There is no government or a bank intervention in this global currency called Bitcoin.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.250
The next time someone says Bitcoin is blocking you know it's not.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.890
It's like saying that email is intended.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.090
We know that intelligence,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.610
a technology that enables email on Internet,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.340
can be used for many other applications in the same way.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.810
Blockchain is a technology that enables Bitcoin,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.150
but there are multiple uses for Blockchain technology.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.280
All the other points are shown in the slide like Ethereum,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.440
new light going ripple except for on the applications of Blockchain they've upside going.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.860
Market cap shows you that there are more than 2000 applications.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.050
Beijing Rajan as after doesn't 19.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.080
This is the kind market caps upstate which are starting the box.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.290
When you scroll to the end,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.450
you can see that there are 2399 coins listed on this website.
