00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
resulted in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.970
Anyone can become a minor,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.980
and anyone can my inbox toe and add it to the Blockchain.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.580
This minor needs to find.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.060
The knowns says that the hash of the block has some leading zeros.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.910
As for the difficulty off that particular period.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.300
So what will happen when there are two miners who found valid blocks at the same time?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.420
So if I am a miner who picked the first finder transactions from the transaction pool find

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.480
the knowns says that the harsh off that particular block has so many leading zeros minus a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.150
valid blob.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.080
And you are a person who takes the next 500 transactions from the conception pool at the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.280
tower,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.210
Block finds.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.060
The lawn says that that hash also has so many leading zeros,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.380
as required by that mining difficulty.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.270
So these two are valid notes on here.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.100
If you notice the Blockchain itself splits in tow because both are married drugs that can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.690
be added to that particular block on,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.150
then this situation will exist only for a short amount of time.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.460
Later,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.120
when other blocks are other,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.400
Either it will be under tow,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.400
mine or yours and big oil has this rule that it has to accept the longest chain only,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.440
Let's say the block in which I added,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.410
is being taken by another minor.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.100
And then he adds two more blocks in my chain.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.690
On in yours there is only one Miller who were gone it and he created money one block after

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.340
some time,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.560
let's say there are 15 blocks.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.560
Mind after my block in the chain that I am working on and in yours there are only three

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.190
blocks in this case.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.200
The longest chain will be taken by the system and the three blocks that started with your

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.350
block will be left out.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.810
And these leftover blocks are called us on from the blocks.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.800
What did happen to the transactions that were in your block on the blocks that followed?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.340
These transactions will be checked.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.150
If that is present in my chain are it will be put into the transaction pool again.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.850
That is a concept often blocks.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.400
Also,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.120
we saw that competition power is the deciding factor here on how much probably you have to

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.290
my in a particular bronc.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.850
Let's say you and a few miners joined together to form a network and you have more than 50%

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.650
off the entire computational power in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.530
Right?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.170
So what will happen in this case,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.040
US.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.120
A.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.050
Group will have more power than all the other miners combined in the ecosystem.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.360
When you have more than 15% off the competition power in the ecosystem,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.370
you being in hacker can detach yourself from the network for some time,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.850
create your own blocks with transactions that you would like and then after,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.710
let's say about 100 blocks come back into the ecosystem.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.070
Since you have more computational power,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.880
there will be only about 80 blocks that were mined by other miners in the ecosystem Still

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.450
like them,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.950
since you come back with 100 blocks made on since the rule called longest chain is accepted

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.950
,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.020
is there the Bitcoin ecosystem that will be replacing the entire 80 blocks that were mind

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.050
with the other miners?

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.640
So if I am a person who did the transaction on data to enter the 80 blocks done by the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.410
other 14% of the miners,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.450
that becomes invalid and this is the 51% attack.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.080
This is a theoretical possibility,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.410
but still nobody has heightened this way in Bitcoin ecosystem because gaining 51% of the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.150
competition power in the Bitcoin ecosystem is very,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.050
very costly on the reward is very less and helps people would not want to do it.
