00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
like any application that we build.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.060
We need a lot of people to build this application and also users who need to use this

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.850
application called US actors.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.910
We also need a lot of competence,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.600
and we'll see all the different components in the I permitted architecture in this video.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.770
We'll also take a look at the transaction flow.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.260
How it happens in pipe alleged.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.500
So you get a pretty good overview about how permission to block 10 yards personal.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Just look at the different type of factors here,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.100
which are blocked.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.810
An architect,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.540
a Blockchain developer and a block to NATO evaporator.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.520
Apart from this,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.050
there are users who use this blocks in application as well.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.550
An architect or a business analyst is a person who uses the composer modelling language as

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.630
we signed hyperplasia composer to create the business network architecture so he or she is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.410
responsible for the architecture and the scent of reduction,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.160
as it will be the players.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.050
What is the kind of logic that we need and one of the answers that the company has,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.120
what kind of transactions that we need need to do exactly.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.350
For example,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.210
they haven't company.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.080
It'll need so transacting.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.650
Tell this ticket book a particular flight.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.860
Change the route off a particular flight from here to here.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.930
When does that stop?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.290
Except for these other transactions and our troops and assets that are there in the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.590
Blockchain ecosystem off this permission to Blockchain space next on the Blockchain

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.800
developer who will be the person who is writing the smart point for our business logic

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
Between Praxis of logic in high politics?

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.930
Probably the chain gold can be returning either north or goal,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.930
and it's the smart contracts Are Qantas Jane Goods in high politics,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.050
Family in a stadium?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.600
It was smart,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.220
competitive in hands of Whenever we talk about permission to block chains,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.670
remember that change or reversal smartphone?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.910
That's then we have the Blockchain network operator who manages someone It does the doctor

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.350
make work.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.420
We need a lot in the drug authoritarian permission to block trains because this is not a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.980
completely decent place system,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.270
and hence there might be a made for operation off the being.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.980
Me and someone new my comment,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.300
and they need to be sure you card or certificates with that person.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.650
Except so that's why a blocked in that boat operator is also present in this,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.150
but not people.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.780
Let's also look at the various components that are present in the hype religion,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.750
fabric space.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.810
We have membership services,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.190
certificate authorities,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.550
Nords and Piers.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.360
The function of the derivatives does is to provide the identity of the users were going to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.290
transact in the box,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.750
and it is providing the visitors that gets through to these numbers.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.730
Users can use this descent certificate to sign the transaction and some reputable auction,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.330
as you've seen earlier.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.370
But going in a tedium,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.770
use diesel certificates to find the transactions as well that this all started getting the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.170
permitting.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.350
The Blockchain is provided women budget services.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.480
Then he absolutely get authorities.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.720
A certificate authority in the hyper Villager is probable,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
and so it can either be internal or an external certificate authority as well.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.390
The certificates lay on the public infrastructure where the certificate authority would

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.020
announce in the network that particular for blinky itself a particular user and then the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.550
user will use this private key.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.760
So we can say that the certificate authority actors,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.530
an identity management and the formation of Blockchain space.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.760
So I am a person and I want to interact with the Blockchain certificate.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.830
A lot of people told Bill about in who I am,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.450
and I can use this certificate provided by membership services or do the transactions.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.510
There are also different types of lords in the permission to block to network.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.760
All the notes are not people and it's in the public luxury in because we have seen that any

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.980
noted above the protein can be a minor when they can do the mining process.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.180
But in hyper little beyond specific notes through specific things in the election,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.750
we have a client told which initiates the transaction.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.560
We have appeared,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.050
nor which maintains a little later in ST grabs a network.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.940
An order was responsible for the distribution of transactions,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.770
which means I planned it will be a person with the user in the Blockchain.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.320
I will initiate a transaction.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.380
The beer will need to maintain the consensus by broadcasting the transactions toe the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.900
entire dropped in an order will be the North,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.090
which is ordering the transactions that are from England.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.350
These are the ordering is done by the miner,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.680
the Bitcoin here that is done by the order,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.570
for we saw that a pure maintained relatively return.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.940
SingTel,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.700
president of one of the types off,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.060
feels in hyper religion.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.410
They're goners in boxing piers and permitting Pierce are committing here,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.900
maintains a letter in the state.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.850
This commits the transaction on the smart contract.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.140
Mrs.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.410
Rita,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.930
I can go over the chain.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.870
Corbett is returning.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.990
The typology will be in the committing.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.730
The early and endorsing here is a specialist committing here,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.090
which received this transaction.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.670
Proportion from the plant floor between either grants are beneath.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.980
The investment on also holds this month.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.250
Hence,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.270
these fears are responsible for maintaining the legitimate in sync across in it.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.340
Now let's look at the transaction flow that happens in paper.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.120
So first extracted the proposal of the contraction execution of the transaction responds

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.900
given to the plane will started the transaction order the same deliver on valid it so they

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.520
never planned.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.590
Initiate certain transaction in a block to native of the land with the application.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.660
Interacts with the blocks in using hyperlinks fabric as Dickie,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.070
the Ark Indication and user privileges are taken care.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.260
But even budget services.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.870
The certificate authority would be ascending a public E and a priority for each user in the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.170
world the plan proposes the transaction for the endorsing fear.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.450
Who in turn will captured the really great sits on validate the smart contract available.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.150
This endorsement is called That's Execution.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.620
So when the blind here's a transaction in Big Colombia of seeing that because of the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.870
transaction pool validated by a minor in orderto abroad here that is done by the inverse,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.250
it's this step is for less execution.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.880
Once the execution is done at the investment beer that respond to be sent back to the plane

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.350
with endorsement signatures.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.980
Yes,

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.480
we saw,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.970
they can be about five endorses will need to validate a transaction.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.730
So whenever princess and goes to the first in boxer,

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.610
he can sign and send it back to the plate.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.450
The second does that can do the same.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.530
Once all the responses were received by the claim and the client knows that he s far enough

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.590
number of endorsements,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.150
Then he can broadcast this to the order.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.290
So once the transaction is similar to the order of service,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.090
the ordinance always would order him as ordered set here and then delivered to all the

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.050
Pierce Milito.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.610
This order is responsible for creating the bloc citizens once it orders all the transaction

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.940
as it comes from the claims,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.450
it will add it to a block and then broadcaster to the network.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.030
When the Ordinance of Us creates a block,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.510
it descent all appears on.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.140
The Pearson validated the transactions as well before adding it to the popular deduction.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.680
This is how the entire transaction floor works in hyper nature.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.030
I hope you have a pretty good understanding about typology project on the permission to

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.350
blocked in space in this section of the course.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.280
Let's look at the differently in the sea.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.750
Use cases off part motionless and permission elections in the next section because
