00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
Now let's revisit the challenge Number two in our current state of the public ledger,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.300
who verifies transactions how to make sure that everyone has the same set up data.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.920
How do they want the person doing valuations?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.880
These were the questions we needed to answer.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.150
Let's go through a step by step solution for this challenge.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.080
First,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.490
consider the public Ledger.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.250
We know that the alleged consists of transactions,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.060
but we can't have an infinitely long ledger,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.620
just like a notebook or a physical injure began divided into two pages.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.750
Let's be hard for 1st 5 transactions in the first page.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.650
We need to have the next fight transactions in the second pitch and so on in the digital

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.110
world,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.950
begin group transactions into blocks in a physical book.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.830
The pages are linked by a page number.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.540
However,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.500
here we need to link them digitally.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.270
Cryptography is the solution for this,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.870
you know?

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.110
No,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.260
the concept of hashing.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.890
You know that it is one way easily verifiable and has an avalanche effect as well.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.390
Can we use that link the blocks together?

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.940
Shall we can we can take all the connections together and hash toe find the harsh off a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.450
block.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.690
Here is where the beauty is.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.610
This hash off block one will be added as an input to the block does hash.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.990
When you look at this hash off block number three,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.930
that would be added as an input to block number four.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.770
And this will be also considered less in input when finding the hash off block number four

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.770
.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.230
That's any change in transactions in Block three will change the Block three sash and in

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.460
turn,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.100
it will change.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.400
Block Force has completely because off scientific,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.930
let's look at this as a demo or nando's dot com.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.850
Find that there are five blocks here,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.890
connected to one another by ashes.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.550
The hash off the first block is the input in the second block,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.180
and so on.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.580
So now imagine that I am a hacker.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.710
I want to change something in Block two.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.120
I want to add a transaction with Say's Gives B $20 in block toe.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.470
What happened is the hash off this entire block number two changes and hence the hash off

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.550
the the previous hash of Block number three changes and so on.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.510
That's the entire Blockchain goes for a toss.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750
This is how a Blockchain is formed.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.770
Reform blocks consisting of transactions linked these blocks using hashes,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.350
and that makes it immutable.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.800
Immutable means we cannot change anything that's already return in the Blockchain.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.530
We look at how this helps in appeared to be a notable and the concept of mining in the next

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.850
video.
