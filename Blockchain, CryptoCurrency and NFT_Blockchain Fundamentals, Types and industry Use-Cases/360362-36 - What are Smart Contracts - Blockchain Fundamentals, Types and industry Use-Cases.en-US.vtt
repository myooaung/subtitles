00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
as we saw earlier.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.280
Smart contracts enable you to build decentralized applications based on a Syrian platform

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.510
or any other programmable Blockchain for that matter.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.840
Like so,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.860
what are smart contracts?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670
Really Smart contracts for digital contracts,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.950
which are verifiable and enables trust between two parties.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.280
Smart contracts are usually used to eliminate intermediaries between two parties playing

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.450
for transact with each other.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.990
We can expand it better with their small example.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.790
Let's take you want to buy a house?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.760
This involves a lot of intermediaries like the government registrar,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.290
where you want to pay money to someone get their house.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.920
That's the only thing that happening.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.050
But then there's a lot of paperwork involved for you to register that you are the person

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.300
who is buying that house and you become the legal owner off that particular house from

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.690
tomorrow.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.560
So you have to go to the the garment district on Register formally that you are paid this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.270
much money and you'll be the legally and forced to owner off that particular house from

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.770
next day.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.680
And this also involves a lot of fees that we need to pay to the middle men.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.550
Call the registrar if this is done on smart contract,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.950
etc.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.810
The smart contracts can have conditions with,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.830
say or leave.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.020
This person has transferred so much money to the other person are the seller.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.280
The buyer will get the ownership of the house so the house can also be an asset on this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.150
month contract in which it stays.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.420
If the buyer has paid this alert,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.430
the exact amount that they agreed upon,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.650
then change the ownership of the house from the seller to the buyer.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.460
This makes it very easy and you eliminate a lot of intermediaries.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.100
Onda lot off East in this process.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.310
Let's take another example where centralisation pace of major pool,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.030
right?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.120
Let's look at the concept of lotteries not resist.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.650
When I am a person,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.930
I want to take a big risk and invest in a lottery.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.700
I will invest something like $10 into the lottery and buy a lottery ticket.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.660
The thousands more who were investing $10 each to get into the lottery.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.070
So the entire amount that's there with the Central Party called the Lottery Management is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.520
about $10,000 now,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.160
so they will do a random function and find out the person who has won the lottery.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.890
So the embarrassment of $10,000 after paying some fees to the largely management will go to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.270
the winner.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.420
Do you see a problem here that there are 1000 people on?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.790
There is a central authority called Is Largely management.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850
Who is thinking someone at random?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.210
How can these 1000 people be sure that this lottery management Ismar cheating us?

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.340
They could very well pick a person,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.820
and if they noticed that they don't want them to win,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.020
then they can go for the random for again,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.330
pick up another person.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.440
This is not possible with a smart quarterback with the core being return.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.110
Ethereum Blockchain on the core,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.870
being visibility.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.410
Everyone participating in the notary.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.720
They could see how the court works and be sure that it will only choose a personal random.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.890
And it cannot do any cheating with respect to the lottery villa.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.380
The most important advantage of this kind of a smart contract is that the amount you pay,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.960
let's say $10 are in the atrium ecosystem.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.730
It'll be eater,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.200
right?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.480
So when I'm paying 10 meter to enter into the lottery and 1000 more people are doing the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.890
same thing there will be a total of 10,000 meters stored somewhere in the earlier case.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.530
It was with the lottery management team,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.550
but here it will be with the smart contract itself.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.640
Remember that the contract can hold money.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.750
This money held by the contract can be given to the vendor only if they meet a particular

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.230
condition here.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.480
The lottery management cannot run away with the money that they had caught from.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.940
All the people on the money will only be transferred to the minority contract.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.050
This way we secure and then we make it transparent using a smart contract.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.280
Another good option would be a working system barren if there is a ballot work for a cheap

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.960
war or even digital boards,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.340
right?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.710
I cast my word to a candidate,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.490
but then I don't know if that particular word is being countered.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.100
Are the Central Party is doing some conquer feeds with that?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.760
Because all the words are going and stored in a central party.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.320
If any of the candidate is politically very strong,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.390
he can impact the result of the working through all these contracts.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.580
This is not possible with a smart contract because it is immutable and transparent.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.850
I hope this concept of smart contract is slowly getting in your minds.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.340
No.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.520
Well,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.750
look at what all the atrium note contains.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.040
We thought that a Bitcoin nor will be a software which is installed in your system so that

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.980
you can do mining.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.520
And it also contains the entire copy off destruction.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.060
Right?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.010
And William notice no different.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.630
Just that it will contain the history of all transactions.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.790
And along with that,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.750
it will also contain in history off all the smart contracts in the bacterium Blockchain and

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.290
also the Garden state off all smart contracts in the Italian Blockchain.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.930
What I named by the current state off all smart four types in the first example that we

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.370
give the ownership of house rate.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.880
So that would be a smart contract between the buyer and the seller.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.950
So this house in the smart contract will have a state.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.260
The state will have a variable Carlson owner.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.940
So the Warner variable,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.050
maybe the address off the seller first before this transaction happens.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.780
Once the transaction happens,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.610
the state off this very well called us Warner will change from the sellers are dressed Cody

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.450
Buyer Centris.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.770
That is our states in just in a Blockchain smart the Ethereum.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.640
Nor are each of the ethereum nodes will hold the current state off.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.740
All this more contracts in the ethereum Blockchain in the next video,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.310
we'll see some more concepts off it.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.560
Did you?
