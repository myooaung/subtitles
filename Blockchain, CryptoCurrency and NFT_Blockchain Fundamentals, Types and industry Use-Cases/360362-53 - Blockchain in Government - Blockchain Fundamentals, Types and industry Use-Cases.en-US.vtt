00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
So the last videos we have seen that Blockchain can actually improve a lot of industries

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.790
efficiencies.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.860
By bringing in transparency and Providence thinking further on these lines,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.090
it can actually improve our entire governments working and make it more efficient.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.950
Toe manage the country on the whole.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.520
Let's look at this example of passport data right.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480
There are a lot of places in which market chain can integrate.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.360
But then I thought,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.770
Passport can be easily explainable because the part of locked in comes out very easily in

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.340
this passport.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.210
Their example,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.550
right?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.450
So let's consider passport data that is stored in the Blockchain.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.030
They should be sort by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that's managing the passport data,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.480
and then it'll be related with the income tax department and national intelligence or hard

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.480
,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
it forbid the latest black Mr People in the date of this,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.770
They're also be are important seaport custom check that will review the exit and enter.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.130
So when you go into this airport and when you give your passport,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.010
apparently they can be forgery in the passport but me,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.800
right so I can create a duplicate passport and fly out of the country that has been

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.620
happening a lot.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.370
But then,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.790
if it isn't the Blockchain and I have anything happen to be scanned on the port differently

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.450
or it sick,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.560
the person can easily,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.650
very far in the Blockchain.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.110
If I am the right person to do it with my fingerprint,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.180
that cannot be changed and helps.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.550
A lot of forgery can be solved with this being in the auction.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.680
They will also be the National Army,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.090
our defense agency,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.870
into this approach in part one that also be the national Police Agency for investigation.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.110
And they can also update whether someone should not be allowed to exit the airport.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.630
Except they'll also be this public service identity database,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.330
which means all of these departments Darman departments working together to maintain this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.400
passport data on bringing good citizens into the country and not let people who are under

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.340
investigation out of the country come together in this Blockchain platform.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.350
And they can you release this power off this technology.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.550
Two made it processes more efficient.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.380
Imagine this.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.900
Property transactions can be a live not chimp that foot because Blockchain is immutable.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.360
If I want to sell my land to someone I can sell it to him on the back end platform through

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.150
this mark contract.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.560
So this fine woman will have the winner of that particular piece off line.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.060
And if it is in my name,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.640
I can sell it to someone else.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.460
This cannot be tampered with our made any forgery it right?

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.350
So the land registry is induction.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.810
Property order can automatically check their own a super whether they're eligible to sell

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.640
the property back in India.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.250
We have this concept called That's incumbent certificate.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.670
We just before someone buys the line,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.780
they can go check in the register office with that particular piece of land are holds that

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.270
they're playing has an illegal proceedings happening.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.340
So imagine all these things are in D block,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.750
genital.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.410
They usually very thin within seconds.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.770
That this particular legal person is going on against this particular piece of land are

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.450
real estate.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.750
And hence there is a problem in buying this.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.450
Thank you.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.280
This takes about a week so it issued by the government because our for the background

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.830
verification,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.440
that need they need to do before giving you the UC.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.170
Also,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.260
whenever people go for residential properties or any real estate,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.240
they go to the bank for to get loans.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.710
The bank can also take the status of the ownership for the doctor perform on whoever is the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.560
legal owner can be you in the room.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.470
The parties If executive using a smart contract is very easy,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.000
the sale of just times First they want to put it by your they don't automatically transfer

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.990
from this person suffering for the other person tackle using this month everyone,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.910
including the buyer seller on the bank,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.580
can very be the status of the contract over this market.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.000
Because of these advantages,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.210
the under this government in India make the partnership with chroma B.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.210
That's just reading based startup to use.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.370
Blockchain commended Land registry records having spoken about garments on one news case of

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.650
a government using Blockchain re registered land records.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.290
We look at the other worldwide use cases that are they.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.620
So the government says that 50% of the government transactions will be trump process toe

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.290
Blockchain by 2020.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350
This will make their government transactions very,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.550
very fast and efficient.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.790
South Korea is bringing in something called US icon,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.970
which are departments,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.690
universities,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.490
hospitals,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.310
everyone to come together and your place a Blockchain technology.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.050
So imagine I think I'm going to the hospital.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.170
They will check my letters on the Blockchain like my brother group and dominated my medical

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.570
history.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.820
Except if I go for an interview,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.380
they can also take my education certificates and all my experience in the production

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.950
platform itself that will act as a single source of fruit for most of the government

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.150
transactions that I can do.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.770
Singapore government has initiated this project called Let's Move In,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.350
which is used for domestic interbank payments so we can say that they're trying to harness

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.820
the power of Bitcoin within the country itself.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.610
India is bringing something going on India chain,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.100
which is strange with bitter taste.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.420
Validate on.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.920
I had all the educational certificates to the Blockchain,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.250
so that has told before if someone can go for an interview,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.030
they can check.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.770
Are his educational qualifications using the Blockchain itself?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.780
That would be very,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.480
very minimal for jury in this case,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.710
because production is immutable and very trustworthy in the United States.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.040
They're trying to store all the IBD letter information on developed change ideas,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.900
intellectual property which comes in the forms off patrons,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.510
copyright tech sector so all this I P information,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.900
which are very valuable to a person or a company,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.870
can be stored on the auction so that they're not cheated by someone that their patent

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.760
infringement person.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.870
Let's also look at how Blockchain can power the smart cities on books.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.150
It is a triple in the next video.
