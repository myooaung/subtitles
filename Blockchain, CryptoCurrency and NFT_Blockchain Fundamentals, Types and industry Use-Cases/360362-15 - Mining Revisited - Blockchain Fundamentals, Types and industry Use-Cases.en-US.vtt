00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
I don't know.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.680
We have seen that Bitcoin is a global currency,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.420
which works as a public ledger in a distributed environment.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.000
They also saw Hope and Section pulls timestamp on market trees are using Bitcoin.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.030
So now let's look at this concept of mining meaning,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.980
as we saw in the section One is the concept where the Lord has to prove to the other boats

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.480
in the network that is a valid no trying to put invalid transactions into the project.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.740
We saw the example in Real World,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.700
as in you go for an interview and you show some proof of education like your degree

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.550
certificates on projects to let them know that you are a valid person for the job.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.980
Let's say in your enemy,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.440
if you have to give a five star rating for the scores,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.820
I need to prove to you that I have good knowledge on I can explain concepts in a clear and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.430
simple bill.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.500
We can call that proof off knowledge.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.160
Maybe I just came up with that in general consensus algorithm is when I know trains toe

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.000
prove to the other notes of the ecosystem that I am worth it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080
I am we're daily words that you are giving me for the worker.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.620
So in the distant world,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.190
what can we ask a computer to do to prove that it has done something we look at The

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.020
different types of cancers are algorithms used in the next life.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.820
The first guard improve off work is widely used in the Blockchain ecosystem.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.480
Now improve off work.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.550
We can ask the Lord to prove that it has done some complex mathematical computation do

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.790
whatever this block.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.480
And hence because of the competition of work that it has put him,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.340
we can agree upon saying that the Northwestern's of work and hence it can be accepted as a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.690
valid in the second order call proof of stake.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.330
We can has the Lord to stake some off the real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin material,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.960
etcetera depending on the Blockchain,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520
that person improve for steak,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.430
I say I am staking some off my actual cryptocurrencies for the sake off getting the reward

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.550
that you're providing me.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.470
So if I'm finding a valid block and adding into the Blockchain,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.750
you can reward me with that with the nuclear pregnancy.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.110
If not,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.270
I am billing toe.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.250
Let go off my entire stake.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.050
So this is provide stick.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.380
The 3rd 1 called Prove Off Elapsed Time was devised by intel.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.530
Prove off.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.460
Elapsed time is when you ask the Lord to wait for a certain period of time hoping that ah

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.510
hotter will not bait for that time.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.510
Toe hack all the North's the Lord our validator is selected at random Improve awful abstain

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.510
.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.970
There are multiple other countries protocols like practical bison 10 for tolerance delegate

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.370
approve of Stig Exeter.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.170
One point note here is that these proof off consensus algorithms need to be hard to prove.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.160
An easy to verify it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.510
Imagine solving a camp complex mathematical solution will be very difficult for anyone.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.350
But then,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.830
once he finds a solution,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.810
the other people can easily verify that the solution is rate.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650
That's the concept behind some countries particles
