00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
Hello,

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:00.980
everybody.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.210
I'm very glad that you made it so far in this course.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.550
Welcome to the section of because I'm use cases of Blockchain in various industries.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.000
We have seen the theory behind Blockchain,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.730
Bitcoin and small contracts.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.780
And I'm enlisting the features of Blockchain like transparency in mutability,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.050
security and trust.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.210
However,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.980
understanding the technology is wanting ongoing hope.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.750
You place that.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.580
So we look at a few interesting use cases off good permission list on permission to block

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.490
change in the current section so that you can really,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.870
really,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.520
really understand and appreciate the power block General.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.370
Its capabilities don't get me wrong.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250
But centralisation is actually good.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.370
It has improved the lips off mankind.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.210
To a large extent in the past decade,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.700
we have seen so many improvements in the disturber that our lives completely different on

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.870
them.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.490
Now Facebook has about two billion people using it.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.300
And if tomorrow Facebook Shack stone,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.240
many of us will lost most of conference and lose most of the beautiful memories off our

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.750
legs.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.280
Google,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.090
for instance,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.870
is there in all parts of our lives.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.880
And there is no Google maps tomorrow.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.650
Many office would be lost on the road.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.400
Same goes for companies like uber Amazon,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.010
Airbnb,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.550
etcetera.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.450
All of this happened because of civilization,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.950
and hence centralization can be considered good.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.450
But we're not being anything to Facebook or Google for their services.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.850
Imagine how they're incurring and paying for all the expenses.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.850
It isn't data because data is the new oil.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.270
These companies probably know more about you than you yourself.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.650
And as the famous saying goes,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.320
if you don't pay for a product,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.650
you become the product.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.050
Do you want to let that happen to you?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.350
I don't think so.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.500
And there should be a savior to bring us out of the situation that night in the shining

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.850
armor is blocking.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
That's the reason why so many people in other places appreciate the part of Blockchain on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.850
Want to harness the same?

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.560
Take any industry,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.730
late financial services,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.730
public sector,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.260
retail insurance,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.750
subletting and logistics.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.650
Larkin can increase the efficiency drastically in these industries,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.460
so let's look at a few examples in both permission list on permission Directions.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.150
To understand the power of this revolutionary technology,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.760
you can go to Google and type in Blockchain in any industry.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.130
I leave that space open to you you can find some of the other use cases of Blockchain on

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950
how to make that in the sea more efficient.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.250
They get into the details of the industry use cases now.
