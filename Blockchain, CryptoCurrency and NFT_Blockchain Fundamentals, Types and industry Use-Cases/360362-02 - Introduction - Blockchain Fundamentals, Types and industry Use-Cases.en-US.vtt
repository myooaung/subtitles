00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
welcome to the course on Blockchain fundamentals,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.850
types and industry use cases.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.080
I'm sure you watched the preview,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.320
which talks about how in demand action jobs are and how revolutionary the technology is in

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.490
this course will be looking at first.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.730
My Blockchain is important and what features make it so different from the traditional

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.450
technologies.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.280
Features like security,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.450
transparency and image ability will be understood in this section.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.430
Then we want to understand the working off a Blockchain and how would be operates

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.680
autonomously without a central bank.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.050
We will take the first Blockchain called Bitcoin to understand the Blockchain technology.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750
Afterwards,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.300
we'll take a look at the alternatives to Bitcoin and other use cases of Blockchain beyond

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.650
because this is where smart contracts come into the picture.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.750
We also understand the various types of Blockchain like permission,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.620
less permission and programmable.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.250
No chance.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.430
Once we understand the abo,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.740
it is essential for us to look at how Blockchain can help very industries with some

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.850
industry use cases to understand the technology in a step by step manner,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.350
I have diverted the course into five more goals.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.750
The 1st 1 will talk about Blockchain and how it works.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.220
The second modern about Bitcoins and our doctorates as an efficient application based on

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.570
logic.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.110
Then the more toe end up look at transactions and other details in model.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.670
For we look at all the coins and smart contracts and in the course.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.050
But some industry use cases.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.250
Let's get into the course Welcome all.
