00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
I'm as excited as you are as you have successfully completed this course.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.400
I remember very started in the beginning of the course.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.330
We started with whole bank works.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.150
And what is the problems with self organization?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.340
From there?

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.720
We only got into Blockchain Bitcoin ethereum permission the block change.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.510
And then we saw a lot of use cases,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.250
and that was an exciting journey.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.620
So I think it's time to congratulate yourselves and give a pat on your back as you are

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.700
promoted your time and energy in learning this revolutionary technology called has not

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.950
changed,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.450
but the learning never stops.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.650
You need to keep yourself updated,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.390
but absolutely coindesk inclined.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.970
Telegraph.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.450
Because news around Blockchain technology is coming out every day.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.620
You can also start following the hostile Blockchain in Twitter,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.750
and they've got to exit.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.550
If you feel that I have missed any concept,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.190
will discuss,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.230
or if you feel anything interesting and want to add it to the course,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.610
please post your questions or send me a private message,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.450
so I cannot the same to the course.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.490
If you have any queries or whatever has been discussed,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.250
police pose the same in the question section,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.510
also please read the course and provide feedback that could help the other students in

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.250
finding the scores and help me improve the course as well.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.930
Having said that,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.150
I understand that no courses from the person satisfactory for everywhere and hence some

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.750
more research about a few things might be required from your it probably or in prisons

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.720
engineer or a mathematical person who wants to understand more about the technical and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.820
mathematical details involved in Blockchain that has not been discussed here because others

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.100
might find a too technical or too mathematical.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.180
I wanted to keep this course very logical.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.350
I'm to the ground so that you will get a pretty good understanding.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.100
But the single leaders off any Blockchain is available lists its white paper on the low

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.450
people.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.850
You are always free to go through that if you want more details on the same.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.000
So that's it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.550
See you on a fresh new course on Welcome to the new Decentralized Award
