00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Now let's look at a permission.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.240
Less use case off Blockchain Cardiff Open Bazaar Currently,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.300
what do we do if you want to do some on Lee Thomas Porteous,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.750
be either for planets on dot com arcadia dot c in Canada.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.820
Why did you go to these subsets if you want to buy some products So we know that Amazon has

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.200
a brand name and that is providing at the US the trust that I can believe in Amazon so that

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.780
the seller will deliver the product.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.050
Me.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.540
But what Amazon is really doing is just immediately it is promising towboat the seller and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.990
the buyer a few things and that's the reason it is generating customer.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.560
For example,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.900
Amazon tells the buyer,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.480
See,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.060
once you pay the money to me,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.260
that's a level definitely delivered the product.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.040
You and I also give a 30 day money back guarantee Same for the seller.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.490
It is saying that once you deliver the product,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.050
the buyer will definitely pay money and I'm gonna transfer that to you.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.950
But for this we are gonna pay some peace to Amazon on the seller is also not getting the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.310
money.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.690
Really.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.890
Amazon is holding money for about 30 days,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.540
90 days.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.850
And there's a lot of protested chaplains against Amazon and other e commerce giants by all

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.580
the selloffs.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.030
So what is their survey that I can trust?

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.150
The seller were sitting in another part of the world who might not know physically.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.960
I'm byproduct from him in a custard manner,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.090
just like for we can believe in the Bitcoin Blockchain by eliminating at a street party

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.050
called us a bank.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.150
That's when blocking can come with the picture.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.010
Open Bazaar is an are decent lazy e commerce platforms.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.470
Their buyers and Taylor sellers can interact with each other.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.420
Trans am doing them seven goods and bring it back.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.960
All this is possible by smart contracts.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.870
The contract suggest that the buyer has already paid money to the smart contract.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.230
Smart Content is acting as an escrow to hold that hunk the seller.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.370
Cancel it because he has to store this month contract.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.820
Once the delivery happens that the buyer send this among from the smart contracts

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.920
instantaneously is sent to the cellar,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.020
and that's ah,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.650
open bazaar can recently lace e commerce
