00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
In the last video,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.720
we saw how publicly just looked like and we concluded by saying that there are challenges

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990
with the current state of our public legis.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.000
We will look at the challenges in detail in this video in the public legend that we had.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180
Since everyone has a copy of the ledger,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.270
anyone can write a transaction of the ledger.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.900
For instance,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.110
let's say the access transaction to Dillinger,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.950
which is a transport $60.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.450
40.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.790
This will be accepted by everyone and added to their copy of the letter because there is no

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.250
verification of the transactions at this stage in our public ledger,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.190
this is the challenge number one in a public ledger.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.020
As we saw anyone can have a transaction.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.400
How do we prevent this?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.500
Also,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.940
another problem with district later is that destroy data can be copied and replicated very

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.330
easily.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.460
For example,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.580
you can create a copy,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.840
often image file and send it to multiple people,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.650
since transactions are distilling a public pledge if we need to prevent duplication as well

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.650
.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.910
Another issue is that currently,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.420
in our washing off the public ledger,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.950
there is no verification off balance off a person before the transaction happens if year

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.100
wants to send $50.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.600
Toby,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.870
who very face that year,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.750
has at least $50.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.730
All these form part of Challenge one in our public ledger.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.910
Let's get into the challenge to challenge to is the problem of consensus.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.290
Consensus means that at any point in time,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.920
all the North's Internet work hold the same sort of transactions in the same order as you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.880
can see here.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.900
See has received transaction three before transaction toe and hence is not in consensus

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.600
with the other lords continuing from Challenge one who we verified that a person has enough

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.900
balance before a transaction and how to make sure that all notes have the same transaction

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.810
in the same order.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.770
Also,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.450
we need to discuss game theory here.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.240
Game theory is a study conducted to understand a person's behavior based on rewards and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.950
penalties.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.050
For example,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.210
if we don't follow traffic rules,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.850
they're being lays in the real world.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.050
However,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.430
if we follow all the rules,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.530
there is no immediate time.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.940
Typically,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.170
work Game theory talks about these kind off rewards on penalities given to people.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.280
So based on game theory,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.380
if someone needs to validate the transaction.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.320
We need to reward them something,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.220
and if someone is trying to harm the network,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.650
then we need to penalize them.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.000
How do we do this?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.550
How do we achieve this kind off game theory based consensus protocol in our network?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.380
So those were the two challenges in our current state of the public ledger?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.610
Let's look at the solutions to these in the following videos.
