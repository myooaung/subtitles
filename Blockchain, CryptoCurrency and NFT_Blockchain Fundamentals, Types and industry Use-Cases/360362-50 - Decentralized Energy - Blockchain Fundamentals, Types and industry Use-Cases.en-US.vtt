00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
Let's take a quick look at the energy sector,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.950
and how can block chain make it more efficient and more decentralised?

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.980
In the current energy sector,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.770
energy is produced by the thermal power plants are higher up our plans.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.080
Our nuclear power plants,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.850
located far from where the electricity is actually being used.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.490
This is for safety purposes,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.290
and once the energy is generated there,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.940
it stands for two ways.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.250
To the localities like cities and towns.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.750
Very electricity is used.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.750
We all of us.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.560
As a result of this,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.860
there's a lot of leakage happening in the process of transfer,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.150
and hence electricity is not so efficient in the current world.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.650
So what can Blockchain do in this space?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.550
Let's imagine a situation where you have solar panels installed on top of your building.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.300
So let's their school and a company and I t park everything has solar panels installed,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.130
and they can tell the city from that you've been installed solar panels with generate

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.600
electricity more than what we use.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.730
Then we can use,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.040
let's say,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.500
70% off what the energy is generated by my burdens.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.100
On the rest,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.550
30% stays idly.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.680
This energy can be talking,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.610
raced and sold toe the nearby people who is generating the serenity than the usage.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.140
Can you place my 30% left over so that whenever I sell my energy that I'm producing,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.440
I get paid in Balkans This way.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.260
There are you are one pages one.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.740
I used energy 100% efficiently.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.680
I'm not basing and any energy that I'm producing here.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.370
Also,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.450
because of the solar,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.930
this can be considered as low carbon energy where we don't across a lot of environmental

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.380
pollution.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.250
Because of this,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.570
there are companies working on this.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.200
For example,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.790
in Canada,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.230
there's a company called a story um sort network,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.250
which is working on this concept so decentralized energy.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.340
So we looked at a few examples which fascinated me in the permission less Blockchain space

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.790
and how the world can be decentralized in using Blockchain in the near future.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.620
Next we look at permission.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.950
The Blockchain use cases
