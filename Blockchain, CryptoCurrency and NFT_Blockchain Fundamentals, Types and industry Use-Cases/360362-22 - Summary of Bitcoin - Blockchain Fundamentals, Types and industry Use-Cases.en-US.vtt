00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
We have seen all the concepts off a Bitcoin ecosystem in the previous videos.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.900
Now let's look at the somebody off Bitcoin.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.550
This is how the transaction flow happens with the number corn ecosystem.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
First the user requests for transaction and broadcast.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.450
It would appear to be a network.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.650
The transaction is out of the transactions pulling.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.850
We can also called Business Memory Pool,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.790
which contains all the transactions that are not committed in the Blockchain.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.210
Yet miners will pick this transaction from the transaction pool based on the fees that is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.950
given and added to a block.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.800
Other details,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.240
like Timestamp previous Hash Merkley route block number etcetera,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.110
are in the block Header Minor will find the norms,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.500
which is a random number,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.490
says that the harsh off the block has a very different number off leading zeros,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.680
depending on the mining difficulty at that period of time.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.010
Once the hashes found the minor broadcasted Brock on other lords added to the Blockchain

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.150
after verification,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.140
the verification happens both early block if it has the leading zeros on in all the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.950
transactions.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.370
Once a blocks added to the Blockchain,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.250
it is nearly impossible to change the transactions within the bloc making it immutable.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.060
This is how Bitcoin works and this is the reason why we call it a revolutionary global

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.610
currency based on auction.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.250
We look at the other smaller details off it going in the following videos.
