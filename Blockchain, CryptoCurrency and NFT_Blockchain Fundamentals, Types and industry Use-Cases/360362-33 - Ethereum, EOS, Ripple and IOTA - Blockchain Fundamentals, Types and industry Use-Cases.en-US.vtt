00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
get some more use cases of Blockchain in the form of art coins.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.290
So Bitcoin is a use case off Blockchain.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.880
Very.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.090
It tried to create a global currency and then came right coin and other similar

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.940
cryptocurrencies,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.150
which is also only used for global currency on payments.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.620
Then came material.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.090
In the year 2013.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.390
This person called metallic Putin was so impressed by the Blockchain technology that he

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230
told the other Blockchain technology is so beautiful.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.610
When should I want lead restricted for global payments?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.160
I can also do something more with that.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.810
And that's when he came up with this concept off bacterium and smart contracts that is a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.120
recently Bybee call atrium as a global decentralised platform for money and new kind of

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.950
applications.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.460
This new kind of applications based was not possible that Bitcoins So what was happening

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.150
between going came up and then Ethereum was coming up.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.480
In those years,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.110
if I was a person who knows Blockchain technology,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.740
I have to create a new production for myself in orderto utilize the Blockchain technology

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.960
and build a different use case using Blockchain.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.550
Let's say I wanted to build an application for Iot devices I had to create a new blocking

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.200
by itself with all the underlying protocol big by myself.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.650
And that's the reason we have a lot of clients in the initial stages,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.420
Atrium said.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.810
Use my platform called ethereum so that you can build applications according to your wish.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.230
You can build applications using smart contracts on these applications will also have all

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.700
the properties off the block chain ecosystem like decentralization in mutability,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.270
etcetera for no Imagine smart contract to be a digital contract there in the difference

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.920
between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.040
Let's see in Bitcoin if I want to transfer you 100 Bitcoins,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.450
I can do it directly by giving your address,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.150
but in material,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.980
you can do it based on our condition as well.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.450
Let's say I need to transfer you 100 Bitcoin one leave if I deliver this training properly

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.450
,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.480
that is not possible with Bitcoin,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.720
but in the Italian world,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.040
this is definitely possible.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.350
Using smart contracts,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.850
a medium uses its NATO Cryptocurrency called US Eater.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.790
It also uses a concept car gas,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.850
which is paid for all the execution that happens using smart contracts,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.490
gas and smart contracts will be dealt in detail in a new course that I'm creating that will

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.830
be dealing with development of smart contracts.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.710
Signed decentralised applications based on Italian platform.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.320
Let's also look at this platform called US Airways US.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.940
Another black change platform based in China,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.870
which is similar to the Italian foundation.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.650
Right.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.290
This is also Carla Seaquarium killer,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.610
because the idea behind us is to bring together the best features off.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.180
Both devils been going security on the computing support off material,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.480
So Ive always talks about Constance is based on evens.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.350
It is also a platform where you can build smart contracts on so any Blockchain platform

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.380
where you can build smart contracts on our coldest,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.850
programmable block chains.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.610
It the remedy ways are examples of programmable launchings,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.380
while interesting point to note here is that Block Down one,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.050
which is the parent company off the ways who is building the Seaways platform,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.580
was invested with about $4 billion in comparison with atriums.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.030
I see well in the beginning,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.350
which only got $6 million as investment.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.520
So this is because off the promises that he weighs this planning and let's see if they

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.650
delivered their promises.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.300
The police are real time grass settlement system.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.130
Lorna's RTGs on currency exchange on Remittance network,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.410
created by a company called Less Ripple Labs.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.920
This was released into doesn't well,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.650
and this focuses on banking transactions.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.220
So when I want to transfer money between me and someone else in another part of the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.800
geography,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.190
then the transfer can be validated by either bank are appear.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.330
This is why banks will be able to use report software to shift money between foreign

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.950
countries.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.560
Bangs are planes off Tripoli,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.850
and they use report software for the transactions.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.530
The native currency used to buy report is called US Ripple itself,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.850
and it is denominated using accepting.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.120
We'll also look at this interesting Blockchain implementation called Us Iota Iota,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.940
as the name suggests is for Iot devices they call themselves and Cryptocurrency the same

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.150
for Internet of things.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.730
The properties include scalability,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.640
decentralization,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.070
modular and fearless.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.460
So in material or Bitcoin,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.910
whenever the door transaction,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.600
you based on fees to the miners.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.470
But here,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.310
since there is no concept of mining,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.680
there is no fee in world.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.850
This also aims at scalability on the transaction fees is very less as we saw already.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.050
The interesting thing to note here is that iota doesn't call itself a selection.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.960
Instead,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.890
they call this algorithm that they used to maintain the conferences between North asked

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.540
angles.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.650
There are a lot of resources available to go through about IATA and you are free to go

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.860
through if this interest you.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.250
I have created an assignment so that you could work on your own on a few more blocks in

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.270
implementations and that some old coins so that you get to research you ourself and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.110
understand more about the Cryptocurrency.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.950
And hence you'll get a better understanding off whatever theory via I've seen.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.170
Don't know the assignment will have instructions.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.270
Please follow the same.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.680
And once you do that,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.560
you will be in a very good position to understand our clients on different implementations

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.160
off Blockchain.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.250
See you in the next video.
