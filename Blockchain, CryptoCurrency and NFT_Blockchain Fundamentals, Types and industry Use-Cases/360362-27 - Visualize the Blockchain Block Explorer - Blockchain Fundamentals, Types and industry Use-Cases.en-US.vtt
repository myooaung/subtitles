00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
having seen on the theoretical concept of our Blockchain and watching someday most off how

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.030
hashes Blockchain and distributed in towards work.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.850
Now I think it's time for us to look at something so that we can visualize how the real

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.490
Blockchain books block explorers.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.450
Help us do that.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.710
Blockchain dot com is an explorer which has been going ethereum and Bitcoin cash in its

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.150
upset.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.850
You can go through the entire history of Bitcoins in this Blockchain explorer.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.880
So let's dive into this and see what other details we can observe from here on.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.450
Link it to whatever concept we have learned to love.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.350
As you can see,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.850
we can see the latest blocks here.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.670
It shows the height the hash Ben with it was mine was a minor and the size here This is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.600
just an overview.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450
You can get into the details on this.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.960
What is the block?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.750
Height Mean block Hate is just the number off block in the Russian.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.850
So the first block is called the Genesis Block in any bludgeon.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.450
And did he have a high doctor?

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.750
One.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.980
The second block.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.510
We love the height of two and so on so we can conclude that there are 598,000 blocks in the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.050
big current location now.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.340
So when you click on any of this,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.990
this takes you into the individual plates off that particular block and you can verify

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.850
other details about that block here.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.450
If you can see,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.000
the hash of this block is displayed here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.820
Which us?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.990
Leading zeros off.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.110
I think it is 18.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.830
That's a difficult,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.250
you know,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.880
the previous block hash the next block.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.690
Once the next block was created that will also be displayed here.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.170
It will not be stored in the Blockchain,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.550
but this is just for display purposes.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.090
The monthly route which we discussed about only the route hash,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.240
will be saved in the block.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.550
Editor.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.450
The number of transactions in this particular block is 2000.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.420
Always the number of transactions in the Bitcoin block with very from 500 a couple dozen

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.250
transactions.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.820
When we see the Uncle total,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.850
this is 6000 Bitcoins the transaction Will you miss 1000 Bitcoins here the daughter

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.450
transaction fees in this particular block is find one total Bitcoins.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.330
This is the height there number off.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.900
I mean,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.600
they're in the Blockchain.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Is this block ticking.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.530
Sometimes down this will be UNIX.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.250
Timestamp in the Blockchain there is in here it is represented in the normal time.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.390
This was related by mining,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.600
pool,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.650
gardeners and pool.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.750
The difficulty is here.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.450
What is the size of this block ones?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.460
You don't want to give you all this.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.530
Also remember that the maximum size off a block in Bitcoin Russian can be only one MB.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.780
That's 1024 Gaby's on most of the time.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.950
It will be lesser than that.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.300
Like finder Gaby 800 kb,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.550
depending on the number of transactions started has inside the Blockchain.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.650
You can also see the norms value here.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.120
This is the random number that the minor generator so that the hash of the block has paid

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.150
in leading zeros.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.570
The block we were currently is 12 point favorite coins.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.750
That's the one here.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.590
You can also see the list of all the transactions in this particular block in the list.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.350
Here there will be 2000 transactions here.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.790
Let's come back to the contractions partier.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.750
When I click on this previous blanc,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.670
it takes me to the previous plant and see that this hash off the previous block and it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.490
would be five for beef.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.340
I pull for you see him as the previous block hash in the next knock that we were looking at

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:51.330
B 54 I wanted to tell you about this property called the pseudo anonymity in Bitcoin in

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.850
this video.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.050
So in the Bitcoin ecosystem,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.000
please know that this Blockchain is completely transparent.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.770
Whatever transactions are happening between accounts is known to all the lords in the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.850
credible because it is peer to peer and public.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.000
But then,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.920
if I am a person who was very rich and has a lot of Bitcoins,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.420
I don't want to reveal my real identity and told me face and profile picture and my address

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.750
on the Bitcoin deduction for anyone of you.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.990
What if a robber wants toe kill me and then get all my money right?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.160
I don't want that to happen,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.270
but still the Blockchain expects that they need to know Marion.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.830
What happens in this case is that only my address is shown to the Blockchain at this.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.500
But I mean,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.550
I'm talking about the big winners.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.450
So you need a bank account who send me money,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.850
right?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.320
Big ownerless.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.220
It's like me bankable that can be public.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.020
And anyone can see that this actress has transferred so many Bitcoins and see the entire

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.670
history off.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.550
What that assistant didn't know.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.550
But then who is behind the godless cannot be a little bit anyone.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.670
That is the reason why we're not able to find who is Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.110
Unless that person shows as the private key,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.350
you will not be possible for a student.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.040
Certainly say that this person is subtle ship May and then let's look at the transaction

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.530
itself.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.690
So when I click on the transaction hash here also no doubt that every transaction has its

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.440
own hash,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.050
right?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.720
So many people,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.250
The construction last year Let me take a normal transaction like this.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.260
When I look at this transaction,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.630
you can see that this address has sent.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.850
So these three addresses and I'm all right.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.990
So who is behind this actress and not be ableto this property or in Bitcoin is called

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.690
nestled on a And here you can see that one input has been transformed.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.870
Us.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.370
Three outputs on the same Samothrace is being used here as well,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.550
so cant for the last 0.23 favorite coins And this is the utx so mortal we were talking

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.610
about in the last week.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.130
They also display the fees that is paid in this particular transaction and all the other

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.790
days,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.200
Right?

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.550
Let's look at this special transaction.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.740
No inputs,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.150
newly generated coins.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.560
What does this mean?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.750
Does this number 12.6 to strike anything for you?

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.250
I enjoy you Guessed it right.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.230
This is the newly generated coin given actually work with the miner who mind this

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.050
particular flock.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.540
Remember that 12.5 Bitcoins was given a city work.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.390
And the point 12 Bitcoin is the transaction fees.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.620
When we look here,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.060
the transaction fees here waas 120.1 people So 12.5 plus 0.1 photo Bitcoins were paid for

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.950
that particular minor.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.150
So when I click on the minor,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.590
I can get you know,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.960
water blocks were mind away.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.050
This person are this mining pool.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:09.950
And when they get into a particular address,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.870
this is Annapolis.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.250
That I publicly and this will kill me or all the transactions that this actress has done.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:24.120
This is why the history off any address can be known from the Genesis block.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.820
Billy Fine,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.150
98,000 Splunk.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.650
In the grand logic,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:38.750
I also wanted to show you another property here for the block confirmations.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.350
So let me take our transaction.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.690
We're busy here.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.880
The number of confirmations is to win number,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.450
right?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.980
So what does these confirmations mean?

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.400
When I go to the other transaction that long?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.750
So have group informations.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.750
When I go to some other block,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.110
then we'll see are different confirmation number.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.130
They let me go to an old block.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:13.050
So here I can see that this particular transaction has 14 informations.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:19.050
So what is this information means is that I saw that your transaction in first the block

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.050
and that is being added to the Blockchain.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:27.070
You get for about 50% certainty say that that transaction has been accepted in the

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.980
Blockchain and that cannot be changed.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.400
But then we saw this concept off are often blocks were to minors,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.560
find new palate blocks at the same time,

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560
and then the longest block was accepted.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.780
Except right.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.600
So what if that happens for your transaction on the block that in which you are transaction

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.130
is present?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.740
Right?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.540
Because of these cases,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.050
we need to wait for some other blocks to get other into distraction.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.970
So as soon as they are one more block next to your broke,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.750
then that will be one confirmation.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.380
If there are two blocks after your from block,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.280
then there will be two confirmations and in the same way it keeps on going on more than

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:05.540
number.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.440
For informations you have the better with certainty.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.840
You can feel that because on phone and accepted by the doctor,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.480
right,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:21.240
so there can be a dream or chance that the Genesis block itself gets replaced by a block by

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.950
51%.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.980
But we know that it is remote,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.950
and hence we can say that we can be 99.999% sure that once they get about 6 to 7

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.610
confirmations in the big blind logic,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.290
it is not possible to tampered with my plans,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.620
actually,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.150
right.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:43.760
Another part of seawater to tell you is that I do a transaction and it goes into the

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.430
transaction pool on the roof.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.390
Off work happens and by the pain in my transaction and doesn't to the black change.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.990
It will be a minimum of 10 minutes because every block has created 10 minutes once in the

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.810
Bitcoin Doctor.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.450
Right.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:01.310
So let's say I'm going push up to buy some small item and I want to transfer Bitcoins with

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.450
him.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.130
I will transfer the Bitcoin and then for it to go into the Blockchain and get a

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:06.920
confirmation.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.970
It will take 10 minutes at least.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.100
So after that,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.800
if the person has to be some pain about this transaction,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.970
we need to wait for six block informations.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.000
So it will be about one hour from the time I transact.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.650
I'm through the time he gets up information that,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.050
yes,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.760
this transaction is running right.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.250
So that is the reason why Bitcoin cannot be used for micro payments like using it in

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.410
supermarket ex cetera.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.590
But then real world applications there are other implement tensions in Blockchain to rule

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.150
the same thing.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:40.820
So Bill going can be talked off mechanism where you can send the higher value transactions

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.460
to others,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.060
but not for micro payments.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.550
Right?

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.460
Let's look at the other things here.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.970
Card transactions made.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.850
So when I look at the transactions,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.320
all the constructions will be displayed here and the most of these transactions would be in

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.100
a block by now.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.150
And the average fees per block.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.470
Even so,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.550
the average feast but transaction in the big green ecosystem,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:11.050
the average value off Bitcoins being transferred per transaction is 0.35 Bitcoins.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.140
The difficulty,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.910
as you can see,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:21.650
is going on Increasing hash rate no is or 104 million data hashes per second.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.020
This is a conception pool and the size of the transaction pool.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.470
Great.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.000
Sometimes it may be higher because more number of transactions are coming into the

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.940
transaction pool,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.070
and sometimes it might be very low because those transactions were picked up by the blocks

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.550
already.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.650
This source is the price of Bitcoin in USD,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.750
the number of transactions pretty and the unconfirmed transactions.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.520
Why would some transaction be unconfirmed?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.880
If you think about it,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.570
let's say you want to do a transaction and you're not giving any transaction teeth as they

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:54.890
don't do.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.460
The transaction fee is an option of me that you can pay for the minor right?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.930
But the minor.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.640
When he picks transactions from the transaction pool,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.170
start sitting a visiting order based on the fees and so if you give,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.580
have made very minimal t are no vehicle,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.760
then that will be left in the last part of the transaction.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.250
Food right through Minor would be interested in taking your transaction on and adding into

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.110
the book because he's not getting any word from.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:27.160
That's the reason why some of the connections might be unconfirmed in a few situations.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.940
But then,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.990
let's say I'm a minor.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.040
I want to pick some transactions in a block.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.220
So even if I picked 500 are 1000 our photos and transactions,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.900
it's going to be the same thing anyway.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.330
I need to find a random non Stember to find the hash before they get added to the doctor.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.310
So instead of just having 500 transactions with that transaction fees,

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.130
I will out of pity,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.720
probably choose the transaction with your transaction fees and also added to the election

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.450
because I'm not losing anything that way.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.350
Transitions might get confirmed even without any fees,

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.040
friend.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.020
And so we have seen the entire deal Bitcoin in this section off this year,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.670
amid cores,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.550
we have seen the signatures transaction pools,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.360
Afghanistan,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.220
more glittery mining and consensus algorithms,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.330
hope Krucoff Worker Garden books,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.680
mining difficulty.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.410
The monetary policy Mining hardware,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.850
41% attack resenting $4 beauty excess on Bitcoin's like people.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:32.070
We also so just know that whole Block Explorer can help you visualize the direction.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.310
It you're welcome to go through the individual videos again.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.120
If you will want to replace a concept that's unclear.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.440
Our post Your query in the question section of you.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.400
This is everything that I know about Bitcoin and everything that you need to know about.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.230
Bitcoin took on yourself up.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.620
It kind export with this knowledge.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.830
You know Novaya Blockchain based system s tamperproof,

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.550
secure on revolutionary.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.970
I would not recommend you binge watch the series,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.650
but rather spend enough time in each concert.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.850
Give it some time on die just the same on then get under the next section.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.150
See you in the next section because
