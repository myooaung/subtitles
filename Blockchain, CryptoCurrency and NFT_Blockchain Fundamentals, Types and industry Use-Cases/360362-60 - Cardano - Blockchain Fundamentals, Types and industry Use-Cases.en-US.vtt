00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
next over the cardinal abduction being built by Cardinal Condition You HK and Embargo.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.490
These three are organizations working together to build this Blockchain three point will

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.390
card a scanner.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.940
This is being built by a charge for Stinson,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.050
who was a co founder for Atrium as well.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.390
According to him,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.680
this is blocked in 3.0 were washing.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.040
One was considered as Bitcoin on global payment system.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.880
Question toe was when smart contracts came into picture dr in 3.0 that this cardinal will

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.230
be a programmer election and it will solve all the issues of the existing Blockchain like

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.140
scalability.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.190
Interoperability,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.100
sustainability it.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.130
Sister Doxy Main three focus points of cardinal and they have a lot of researchers working

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.350
on to build this platform.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.150
Let's look at the first point called scalability.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.310
These are in a Toronto quinto.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.740
That scalability can be increased using post on steak and shouting.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.150
It's the same thing that Karen is also doing.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.000
God knows the first doctor toe prove to the world that proof of stake can work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.770
In July 2017 they have this book of sickle garden called us or a boroughs,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.950
which is mathematically proved to work.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.210
They also use starting toe split the Blockchain in two different things on that increases

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.760
scalability on throughput.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.550
Off this project,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.350
the second thing they're concentrating on is interoperability.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.060
These other interoperability is a problem in the current law actions and hence cardinals

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.180
trying to build a Internet off Lachance where they treat the other doctors like Bitcoin

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.310
like corn Ethereum,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.480
etcetera aside,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.640
changed by building interface between these two Mitchell a.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.950
Tosa to weigh interface on and provide a bridge.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.540
So when you want to convert cardinal into ethereum are Bitcoin you don't need to go through

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.920
a decent place exchange on change this currencies to use them in the other Blockchain There

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.990
is also this problem off sustainability very if you want to keep building new features in a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.050
particular Blockchain.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.210
Andi In this case,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.180
there are researchers working in the garage change.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.730
So you need to pay the developers and researchers who are working on this Blockchain So do

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.300
the book,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.650
right?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.610
That's why I gotta know came up with this concept conflict,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.100
actually.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.570
So,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.620
whenever necessary,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.300
what being paid to the miner who mines the block using proof of stake algorithm ah,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.180
particular portion of that it's added to a separate account.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.990
Korda's depression.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.370
This city will be controlled in a decent place matter.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.730
And whenever there is a spending request that's given these people have toe worked on it in

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.860
order for the Cardinal Foundation to spend it on development.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.390
So this increases the sustainability of the Blockchain because they have money,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.580
and they can afford to bring in more researchers and developers whenever a new feature is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.550
required in the future.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.890
Also,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.120
when they told you that this is a programmable Blockchain,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.170
this uses a separate programming Long,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.670
which called us Brutus to write the smart contracts.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.040
This POTUS programming language is Beijing,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.250
a functional programming language called us Haskell.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.930
The advantages with functional programming languages is that it is mathematically

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.190
verifiable on very deterministic.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.280
Hasn't there is no problem off re entrance?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.420
He possibly the functional programming language and a lot of other advantages that the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.950
functional programming language gives.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.400
Also,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.150
the native Cryptocurrency used to buy a car.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.510
You know,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.810
it's called the Sierra Coin.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.620
So this is how cardinals known at the block 10 3 point,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.710
the kind of promises they give are very laugh.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.050
But if they are able to do it with the ultimate,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.210
such as that they have,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.900
then it will definitely prove to be the next step towards at once when the Blockchain

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.550
ecosystem
