00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
we love that one.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.190
Bitcoin Mining is and other details about how depict transactions what they are being

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.160
rewarded but how they're penalized.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.190
And also we looked at what does that they lose.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
They lose a lot of computational power and a lot of electricity when the possible.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.430
In my name we look at what are the mining heart based that we can use to mine in approve

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.150
off work based consensus mechanism?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.020
Well,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.320
first,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.520
look at the CP use,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.170
which are central processing units.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.450
This is presenting all the gentle hardware like laptops and their stops.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.590
These are multi because missions and how religious hash rates like less than 10 my gosh,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.250
just for second.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.410
The 2nd 1 GPU,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.160
which is a graphical processing unit,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.710
is a bit more specialized.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.050
And that's about one Giga hashes per second.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.640
The next 26 application specific integrated Syracuse,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.190
which are totally specified.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.910
And these are integrated Syracuse,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.130
especially the same for one purpose only in this case,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.190
Bitcoin or any other Blockchain mining.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.650
These are totally first place in the sense they room more than 1000 jigga hashes per second

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.970
in order to be at least able to find the block among all other miners.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.970
You need thousands of Jigga hashes per second,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.650
and that's why a six are primarily used in Bitcoin mining notice.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.150
We look at an example of a six in amazon dot com.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.760
This is an example,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.450
often a sick,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.950
which is not going my knee.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.060
And they also mentioned the ashes per second.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.650
This can do 68.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.830
Terror has just per second,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.260
and that's very fast Computational power required to do Bitcoin money in this case,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.050
but just 1 may see it's nearly impossible to get it most of the time.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.910
So that's the reason by we saw all the mining firms which have so many Essex and that so

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.350
mining pools are generated.
