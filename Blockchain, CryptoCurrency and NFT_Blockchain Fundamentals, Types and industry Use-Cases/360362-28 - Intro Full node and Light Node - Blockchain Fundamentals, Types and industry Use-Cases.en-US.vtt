00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Hello,

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.590
everyone.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.120
Welcome to the section of the scores on wallets,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.250
art coins and keep doing miss minutes.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.660
So the obscene Holberg line works.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.720
And how weird is acting as a global currency,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.270
etcetera.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.030
And we have also known that Bitcoins are stored and the water off a Bitcoin is no only by

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.320
their address.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.950
Right.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.060
And we also saw during the search signatures on the asymmetry Kika photography's that we

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.730
need both a public e on the private key.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.250
Don't do any transaction.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.770
So these public e and private,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.270
you need to be stored somewhere.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.210
And we also need a place where we can access our Bitcoins and send them to someone else.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.190
Wallets access this place where we can store Bitcoins Are you neither Cryptocurrency and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250
use it to do transactions as well.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.730
So these wallets can also act.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.950
Us plans wanted to which actors claims are called is full loves.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.450
So what is a full nor,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.900
ah full or,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.820
for example,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.890
Bitcoin core is a full nor for Bitcoin go Ethereum is a full north for go and did less well

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.890
,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010
it is a full nor for the cardinal Blockchain.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.470
So these are software claims which you don't look into your one system.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.120
And then when you don't look this this software helps you download the entire data off the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.750
Blockchain.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.880
Let's say from the genesis block off going auditorium our current abduction and have it in

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.650
your system,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.210
and then you become a nor in the Blockchain ecosystem.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.040
With this entire Blockchain stored in your system,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.250
you can also start mining blocks and generating new coins as rewards for yourself.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.940
There are also other types of Rolex called us light loads was just not enter into mining.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.350
Are does not download the entire blocks in into our system that only can act as a regular

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.780
wallet,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.250
where you can store your coins and transact with them.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.470
These late wallets would need to contact a full lord in the Blockchain ecosystem so that

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.100
they can get the history of the transactions and then do transactions in a violent manner.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.900
So let's look at the different types off wallets and different types of exchange is one of

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.270
the different outlines.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.410
A few examples,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.690
and then we look at the risks in crypto investment as well.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.250
Let's get into this
