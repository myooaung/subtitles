00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
having understood the Blockchain technology completely,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.350
Howard works and its use cases.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.970
I think it's a good time to look at the future of election.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.920
What are the limitations existing and what are the proposed solutions in the future for

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.120
Iraq?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.850
Chance to scale.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.790
You see scalability and interoperability between doctrines are the two main issues that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.850
elections are facing now,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.130
and charting can be one of the possible solutions in which a production can actually scale

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.950
to the real world.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.770
So what is the problem with the existing block chance?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
What is the limitations off Bitcoin and ethereum and the likes?

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.740
These public Blockchain suffered from scalability issues as in any transaction processing

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.210
system.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.450
If it has to be our doctor by the general public,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.350
it needs to process a lot of transactions per second.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.560
For example,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.230
the Bitcoin Blockchain can only process 3 to 7 transactions per second.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.970
My late idiom is a bit faster,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.050
can do about 30 transactions per second.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.590
Imagine the entire world using ethereum Blockchain and they all have only 30 transactions

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.140
per second.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.750
That is not enough for the people of the entire world to root transactions.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.550
There are a lot more transactions that happening per second.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.580
For comparison,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.570
let's take Visa or MasterCard transaction processing numbers.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.640
They are in thousands on compact toe,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.480
3 to 7 transactions or transactions per second.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.290
That is very true.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.540
Hey,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.890
why does this happen?

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.340
Because Visa and MasterCard,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.350
how central databases where all the transactions are getting process and store.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.160
This is very fast and easily maintainable.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.610
Last week,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.050
VeriSign Blockchain every note needs to validate the transaction.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.800
Save the copy off the entire transaction history from the Genesis block to the latest block

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.940
in their particular north.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.810
And then only these notes can stay in a consensus.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.170
All of this process slows down the entire block chain ecosystem,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.800
that is,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.150
well,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.860
shotting comes into the picture shot.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.030
It is not a new concept.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.980
Charlie is already being used in horizontal data basis.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.140
If you have a large set of data,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.390
you can store smaller sets off dark last data into different databases,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.610
and all these databases can be brought together whenever we want to.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.090
Real data and held charting helps.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.050
Maintenance off database is very easy.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.160
The same can be taught off for the public Lachance as well Imagine the entire Ethereum

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.680
Blockchain being split into sharks on each other can be thought off us and many Blockchain

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.680
,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.300
which follows all the protocol,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.390
sir Ethereum follows.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.890
But they contain lesser number of nodes and hence lets the number of black sensible so they

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.430
never knew.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430
Transition is submitted in a particular sharp.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.900
These notes only validate that transaction and added to the collection.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.250
Same happens between multiple charts that are available for the Italian notable.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.470
What happens here is that the Internet eliminate work.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.720
If it is divided into 10 different tax,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.670
there will be 10 different many block chains,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.180
which validate transactions.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.810
And the security of the Blockchain is not compromised here because it follows the same

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.330
protocol.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.880
A civilian pressed the proof of work on census and all those things,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
but it is proved to the 51% attack we saw.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.350
What is this 51% attack?

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.540
Whenever the Blockchain follows thes proof of work until December them and more than 51% of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.460
the computational power is being controlled by one particular minor or a group of miners.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.630
Then that doctrine becomes vulnerable.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.810
They can manipulate the transactions and add blocks according to their old bill,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.350
because they have work on traditional power for the same example that I give before.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.710
If Ethereum Network is converted into 10 different charts,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.690
then for a malicious minor toe tagged a little work on a particular shot,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.920
he just needs Piper.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.670
1% of the competition part off the entire validators are minors in the network,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.210
5.1% on traditional power is very lesson number on health and that scenario,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.450
the security of the election can be compromised.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.830
But a shot for this.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.440
There are a lot of propose solutions,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.660
as in random is the North,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.230
in which each other's percent and all these things.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.730
But nothing is proven yet,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.570
and hence it is only development.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.250
So these artists for 10% are being maybe seeing a new use shots and a Blockchain etcetera

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.770
right.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.420
There is also another problem called us Intershop Communications.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.150
All these shots together from this Internet will call That's it medium.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.490
So when you want to do some Intershop transaction,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.630
let's say first time,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.410
when I am doing a transaction in Ethereum,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.660
it goes and sits in charge.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.870
Number one second time I'm doing it.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.270
It has to go and sit in chart number two because I'm talking to a full lord,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.930
which is there in chart number two,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.510
right then it needs to be a transaction between two shots.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.550
That is also a problem because that communication might be hard destiny.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.020
So these are the issues being worked on by startups developers on the existing auctions,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.450
hopefully charting,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.600
plus proof of sickle guard.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.480
Adams might come together and solve the problems off scalability,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.150
but that is in the future of Blockchain and we look forward for the same.
