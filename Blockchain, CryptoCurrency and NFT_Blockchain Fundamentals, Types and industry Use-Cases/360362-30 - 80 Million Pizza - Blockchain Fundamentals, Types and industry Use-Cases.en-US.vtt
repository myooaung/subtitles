00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
talking about wallets and going transactions.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.760
I don't know your fun factory the 80 million beads on order,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.280
right?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.670
In 2010 On May 22nd there was this person called Last Low agreed to pay about 10,000

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.750
Bitcoins for two pizzas.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.940
So he just contacted to on Lend someone They want an intermediary who got two pizzas for

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.430
him by being $25 to prop agents.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.950
There were there were two large pizzas.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.590
So he got them and delivered it to this person.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.350
Got 10,000 Bitcoins in Britain.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.170
That intermediary was also getting a still deal at that point in time because 10,000

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.950
Bitcoins were worth $41 at that time in 2010.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.780
And since nobody was accepting Bitcoin as a currency at that time,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.290
this person who bought de pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins was also happy attacked him.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.840
But then slowly it increased.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680
And the current value of Bitcoin today is about $8000.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.620
So do pizzas that were bought for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 are worth $80 million.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.620
At this point in time,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.280
it might increase as well.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.840
Who knows?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.650
On this day became so famous that this is celebrated has been going Pizza Day Every year.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.950
