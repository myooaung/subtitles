00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
in the last video we saw,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.910
a whole Blockchain can make global read more efficient and cost effective.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.250
Can it also improve the efficiency off close feeling the industry called extrapolating?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.550
Of course it can.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.550
So see this news article by Wal Mart an idea.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.450
So they're partnering to put Chinese pork on a Blockchain.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.850
What does this mean?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.110
The problem started when Wal Mart Hearts on Chinese spoke,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.080
which was a win,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.550
and it was there in the stores already.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.670
So Wal Mart tried to see which patch of Chinese pork was well,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.220
and I do recall them back.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.310
But because there was not enough last 30 data,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.500
they had to recall each and every batch on that particular day from the whole of China so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.490
that people are not getting affected by this.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.850
So this costal not for Wal Mart and hence they thought,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.500
Why not have a Blockchain platform very compact,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.560
my Chinese book,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.090
where it is getting manufactured better my getting it from which batches airtime things

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.450
like that.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.850
So once they decided,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.150
they partnered with IBM with their high political fabric platform to bring the prominence

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.970
off their entire separating.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.760
So what is the result off this.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.430
Let's say I'm going to the supermarket part of Wal Mart Store to buy something.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.560
If there is a product,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.570
I can't take it out.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.750
Scan the barcode orders Pure scandal to see where this product has exactly come from.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.200
Then it was manufactured.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.390
Which logistics person delivered it and all the entire track and history off that product

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.750
on my mobile Just like a normal application.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.850
This is also possible using traditional technology.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.810
But hey,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.610
that dissenter list on Walmart can change it anyway,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.990
right?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.610
So how would I believe in that?

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.220
I wouldn't.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.060
That's the reason,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.940
by blocking play a major role in bringing some plating providence together.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.650
Now what is?

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.150
We talk a lot about organic food and organic vegetables,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.700
etcetera.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.690
So how would we really know that organic food is original?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.770
So with this matter,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.570
we can scan that your coat and get to know that this poor has come from such a place and it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.440
has been grown organically and helps.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.080
I can be very confident while buying this improvement trust on the company that I'm

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.590
purchasing.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.190
So that's when this concept,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.560
called us full press ability,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.450
came into the picture.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.370
So blacktail has these capabilities like asset identification.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.920
Watership.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm transfer using smart contracts and die OT in technician Asset aggregation in the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.840
segregation as well your specific complaints.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.510
Traceability they use food recalls except for all these Air Corps that can be integrated

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.060
into the smart contracts off the doctor.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.150
And then we have I already any a capabilities.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.510
I only can track the location temperature on all the other smaller details in this entire

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.190
supplication.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.630
They can also detect anomalies in real time and let the person responsible know that there

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.280
is a problem.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.580
The ultimate Olympics and optimization can also be done using cognitive and I ot

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.360
capabilities.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.250
So what of the farm where it is getting produced The manufacturer,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.500
the logistics person on the retail store around on a similar Blockchain.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.620
This concept is called US Farm to Fork,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.540
wherein you know exactly where it started and what is happening to the entire journey off

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.650
boots that travels from farm to the fork off a person.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.130
We also got this concept called a separation visibility,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.080
so this provides a single view and source of fruit regarding the life's taken off a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.730
purchase order.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.010
So manufacturer trucking company,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.000
the retail company.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.390
Everyone is in the same block chain,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.730
just like we saw farm to fork and helps.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.770
They can all depend on this Blockchain ledger.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.560
You know where the goods are and what is happening to the entire.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.050
There are companies,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.380
especially providence dot org and sq chain dot com,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.560
who are working on this.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.730
Stand off a concept to improve this operation.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.390
Disability.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.060
When we talk about Providence,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.500
it is getting importance for a small thing as Chinese pork and are getting full itself.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.880
Imagine diamonds.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.250
So there's a lot of problems with diamond mining and transporting diamonds,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.650
and there's a lot of insurance parts also happening.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.280
As you can see in the statistics,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.840
there's $45 billion that's lost annually to insurance fraud.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.250
60% of all the fraudulent claims go undirected itself.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.190
10 to 15% off claims paid out that there later for him to be fraudulent and $2 billion is

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.930
the Arnold cost.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.460
A jewelry cost in Children's.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.120
These are the problems faced by diamond industry during their providence,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.510
and then came every religion as a solution.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.500
Beverly Jurist,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.750
a platform to build on hyper religious fabric,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.530
which is especially used for diamond problems.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.940
So a religion tries the providence of diamonds from mines two jewelry stores to combat

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.250
front.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.980
So every little did something.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.450
Whenever you take a diamond,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.470
it Muchas party.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.740
Also,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.770
physical attributes offer diamond like the card they carried the size offer.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.070
China offered etcetera,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.300
and it can be used to uniquely identify timer recorded on the Blockchain.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.850
There's also a unique serial number microscopically inscribed on the diamond,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.470
and hence nobody can seat where the diamond came from.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.390
As a customer,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.380
I can go to the store on before buying this particular diamond,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.940
I can scan the microscopic inscription and see that the artisan off this diamond,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.030
this of valid place on It's not a smuggle diamonds.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.650
Based on this platform,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.540
over two million diamonds have been tactile.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.780
Now this microscopic inscription really on me when I saw this for the first time,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.920
because imagine if you just have a solution where you tracked your courts and then that is

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.780
put on Blockchain.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.000
Let's say I have a box full of diamonds and I have a bar code on this,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.260
the box saying Okay,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.750
this is what I'm going to cut,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.540
but you can easily replace the contents of the box with smuggle diamonds and then make me

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.230
believe that the diamonds are good,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.850
right?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.790
So that is why this out of box thinking by a religion where they microscopically in

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.060
straight something and that can never be changed after a diamond has been called,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.610
he said.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.510
Probably nice way to improve the trustworthiness off Blockchain on traceability Let's look

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.850
at the use cases of Blockchain in the government in the next media.
