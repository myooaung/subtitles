00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
in this model,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.690
I'm gonna show you how to create a simple arrest ful factories using Jack's orris as the

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.240
FBI and Jersey as the implementation.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.650
So the first thing we have to do is tow.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.750
Are few like Registrar Project,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.320
So you can see that they bombed our XML.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.660
I'm gonna open the same.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.090
And there is a section here which is ponder XML,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.290
which will show you the example.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.550
Correspondent to the same.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.370
I'm gonna full screen that by double clicking here.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.430
Andi,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
I will Are your a section called dependencies.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.650
You can type control space and then you get the best options.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.650
You can select dependencies.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.280
Double click this,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.250
Andi.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.590
The first dependency I want.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.120
Our here is about the Jacks artist A peer.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.940
This dependency is about Jack's artist a p I,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.850
which is the chase of 11 standard a special committee process and made it an implementation

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.540
for Besim on the implementation.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.590
We're going to use Jeffy now Instead of using Jersey,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.510
you can also use something called rest easy from J bus that a few other implementation

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.390
available now Every time I say my fight,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.290
Tom carries tryingto reload the context for the timing I'm going to stop the Tomcat by

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050
clicking the red button there.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.750
Now there is one more set of dependencies that we might want to work with,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.490
which is for converting or java objects into Jason.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.840
And as soon as I see,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.600
my fine eclipse will don't lure the necessary jobs for our project,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.250
and they will be lifted under Java resources libraries.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.640
And you can see that in the May 1 dependencies.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.080
And I got all the jars from this.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.630
So in,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.690
Get if I remove any off these and save the file,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.120
you can see that the jar files are also going to be removed from the list off a win

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.950
dependencies.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.450
So let's have one new job plus into SRC main Java.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.540
Let's clear the new Ford your class,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.960
the package name I'm gonna give.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.840
It s cooler,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.300
you know,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.560
dot resources and the class name is going to be for Hello,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.590
resource.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.080
Look,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.680
finish.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.980
The class is just going to have a function that returns a string for example,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.450
colored as great as the function mean and return hello from the no.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.930
In order for me to expose this particular class as a web series,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.410
we have toe associate apart to that.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.030
So I would say at the right path Andi,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.100
specify that this has to be accessed from the client as flash.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.590
Hello.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.690
Now you have to import this part.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.170
There are many ways to import.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.270
I can just move the most on this error.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.860
It'll say important part from our xws artists.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.720
This is one method to do now.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.740
You also have to expose this function as a handler for an HDTV matter.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.750
Now,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.320
typically,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.950
when you work with rest full Web services you would be working with get too matter.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.140
Post put on delayed methods.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.850
So to represent the seem this particular package has a couple of other annotations.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.870
For example.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.430
On Did Get is an annotation that say's whenever there is a get request for this particular

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.030
Ural.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.040
This is a function that you dress point now once again,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.790
get has to be imported,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.770
and this time,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.800
instead of going with this option,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.890
you can select source,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.350
and there is an option called organized imports on Macintosh IT Scholar Command shift go on

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.720
Windows.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.790
It's control shift.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.800
So if you press that it will automatically at the import,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.930
let me say this fight while we have got the Web service ready or Apache Tomcat has not been

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.500
told that this is a Web service for this Just see comes with a friend controller,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.610
sub bridge which we have to configure in our web dot xml I'm gonna open SRC may,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.180
But that is that dryness and web dot xml Now the same thing you can also do in eclipse by

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.820
pressing control shift our on Makris command shift are And then you type your vector XML

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.090
and you can see it comes from my project as a less from Apache.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.320
So I want from my project I select the same thing.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.190
If you're seeing this in a Jewish state here there is a source you click the source and now

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.370
you have this web dot xml Now the display name and welcome finalists are off No use in our

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.910
projects.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.730
I can delete that on press command shift If our control shift f on windows to farm it the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.150
same.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.350
Let's make an entry for the friend Controllers of red Probably pay jersey.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.690
I'm gonna press control space and start typing starlet Select the separate option here and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.550
someone has to have a minimum separately.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.960
I give it us Jesse on a separate class.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.260
Now this class is provided by Jesse and you had to be the fully qualified class name like

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.710
this.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.560
We want hunger toe.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.960
Create an instance off this average when the don't get boots.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.040
So to do so,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.300
we have our Lord on starter and given a number,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.450
and this number is a religion number with other suffrage.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.150
There's one more thing that you have to do your to create and emit para with a harem name

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.050
off calmed or Sunder Jesse conflict ERP operator packages.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.520
And the value for this is the list off packages.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.510
Very a Web services are available.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.150
So when this particular friend controller is in Stan,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.950
she hated and loaded into the tongue get container.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.380
It will read the value for this particular form name and scans all the Web services from

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.290
that packages.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.810
In our case,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.180
we need the packages quarter in order to resource is so I have to get the current value as

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.580
1/4 of the North art resources now engaged.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.460
If you have different packages consisting off Web services and other related artifacts,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.770
you can give space de limited list off packages.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.670
The last part off this particular configuration is toe map a Europe pattern to this

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.770
particular sewerage.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.410
So to do so,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:59.060
I have to say suddenly it mapping on the name of the sender to which we want Oh,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:06.820
map is just see And I don't that we want to give you slash ap i slash star I saved this

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.170
fight.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.660
Close it.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.480
I go to the servers and start the several once again.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.220
If you read the logs here,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.120
you can see that it's a scanning for root resource and provided classes in packages quarter

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.120
,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.290
you know dot resources and it is also phone one Hello,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.260
resource in the same package when the server is running.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:43.300
If I go back to the browser on then at the end of dizzy for time ap a slashed hello And

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.950
this tender you can see we get the hello message from we know
