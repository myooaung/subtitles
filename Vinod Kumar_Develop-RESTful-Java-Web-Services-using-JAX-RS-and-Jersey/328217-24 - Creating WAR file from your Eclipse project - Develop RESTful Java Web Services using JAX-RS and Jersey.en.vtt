00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
If you're planning to deploy this Web service on toe an external Web server,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.310
you must first can work this project into a bar.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.620
Project War is an acronym for Web Archive,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.160
which is the standard from Java community process.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.540
All I have to do in Eclipsys to select the project right click on that and then say Export

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.540
war file and this will open a dialogue box asking which is a project you want really want

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.500
to export this,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.920
too,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.460
so I can kick on the browse button and choose my estan and I have this Jack's forest

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.980
resources I can say save.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.290
And there are other options.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.720
Like if you don't you have any preference of a server like tomcat.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.100
Nine.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810
You can always enable some optimization rules,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.800
and then you have export the source.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.150
Fine.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.250
If you're deploying this on some third parties that works,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340
you don't want toe export the source file.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.430
But if we're sharing this with your customer and of course,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.920
you may want to share the source code,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.440
also,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.280
you can say already existing.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.680
Five.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.120
Since this is the first time override does not help so I can click finish to come up this

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.880
Andi,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.680
it is generated now can always go back to desktop Jax RS resources.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.690
And you can see the Jackson restraining dot What is there now?

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.140
If you want to know what are the content of the same so I can goto a new command front and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.050
then I can check your job Miners E v f followed by Jack's Artists Training About what?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.670
De for table of content before we're boost and have to specify the file name here.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.710
And this is going to show you the content off.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.270
Enter project,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.220
which is the list off all the Josh on classes.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.740
You can see that Babineaux has a classes folder and it has got all my dark glasses without

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.630
any source for and in the weapon.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.280
If live,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.200
it has exported all the main one dependency jar files,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.480
which means that this is an independent warfare which doesn't have any more male

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.510
independence is
