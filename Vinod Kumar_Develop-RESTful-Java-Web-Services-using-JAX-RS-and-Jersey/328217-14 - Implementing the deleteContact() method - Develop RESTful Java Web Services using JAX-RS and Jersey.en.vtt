00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
in this video.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.350
I want to show you the implementation off.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.540
Delete contact based on the idea.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.740
Once again,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.630
we'll start by pleading a stream SQL variable,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.760
which is deleted from contacts where I ve quotes to question Mark followed by tribal

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.920
resources block catch with an exception,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.190
variable and engage the many exceptions we're gonna say throw knew the exception off the X

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.190
,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.630
the tribal resources blocked.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.210
Once again,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
we're gonna have here a connection on statement,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.970
and that is pretty much the same as the previous one.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.740
So I got a copy.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.300
Those two lines from here and based We had to set the value for this,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.190
which is here.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.240
So with the STM did or set in each off one,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.620
which is the only barometer we have.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.070
And then the perimeter,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.340
ideally seen here,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.430
is the before that once regarded,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.650
we're gonna do this one.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.220
So this is the same statement that we want to do here.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.730
Because now,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.440
in case if you'll supply their own idee,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.880
obviously we will have zero as the number of records being deleted.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.970
So we say if concrete zero,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.070
we can say no Records deleted in value already supplied.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.760
Of course,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.260
This is supposed to be the variable i d be sued as function perimeter.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.100
Now,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.260
if the count is not equals 20 that means there is one record that articulated.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.590
So this if block is skipped,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.600
there is no exceptions that catch block escaped,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.050
which means you are successfully going away from this particular function without any

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.650
errors.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.150
So let's save this on the delete contact is done.
