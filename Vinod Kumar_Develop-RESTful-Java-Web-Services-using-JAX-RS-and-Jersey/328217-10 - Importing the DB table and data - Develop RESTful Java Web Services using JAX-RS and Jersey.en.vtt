00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
as part of this lecture,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.080
I have shared a file called Contact Stable and Data doubts it,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.790
which contains an SQL script file.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.650
So please don't look this and until the same,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.610
I do that by double clicking the fight.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.160
And once it is unzipped,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.800
I don't need this if I anymore,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.320
so I will delete the same on deck startext.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.810
You'll creates one people called contacts and inserts 1000 rows to import the same into our

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.510
database.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.240
First,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.780
let's run our database by going toe.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.030
It's too big on windows.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.600
Double click.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.790
It stood out back on Mac.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.040
I have toe copy this part and then go to the terminal and then bass That was tender.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.250
And that brings up this client.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.680
I can kick on Connect,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.720
and I am successfully connected to the Thera recommended one script from on In single

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.130
course,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.930
your toe give the actual location of the file,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.880
which is,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.770
in my case,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.400
it's their right here.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.070
I'm gonna copy the part by going toe services copy pot and then based here and end the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.050
single courts.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.360
Are there two days to click the run button and that will import 1000 rows.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.100
You can click on the clear button toe,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.250
