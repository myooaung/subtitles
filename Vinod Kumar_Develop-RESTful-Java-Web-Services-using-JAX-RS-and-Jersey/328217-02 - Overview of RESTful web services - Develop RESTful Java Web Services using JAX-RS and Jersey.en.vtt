00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
first,

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.650
let's try to understand what rest really mean.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.770
It is an acronym for representational state transfer.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.730
But if you want to understand in simple English already from rewards,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.680
it sounds like transfer of state in different representations.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.020
The term stayed here refers to the state off a collection of objects known as a resource.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.220
For example,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.160
products customers orders users can all be considered as resources In general.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.620
Resource has some information which is called estate on the client.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.580
Answer was made.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.420
Exchange are transformed the same in different formats,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.950
which is called a presentations.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.040
For example,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.440
a mobile application may request a sore toe.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.420
Provide State of Health resource in XML format,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.640
while another Web application may request the server for the same state.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.780
In Jason format,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.460
both server and claim gang bargain for the representation off state from each other,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.330
which is stoned as content.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.090
Negotiation.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.370
This type of communication between the client on decide what is carried out using the Web

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.310
as transport platform onda leverage the http protocol features while working with wrestle

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.820
but services following must be Remember number one at the source is accessed.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.830
Wear uniforms.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.790
This is identify,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.690
where are you?

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:30.980
Are number two The http request methods such as Get post put on delete actors.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.890
Words are action to be performed on a resource.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.850
For example,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.540
while they get requests for a given you are,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.710
you might get the state from the server a post request for the thing you are.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.630
I might add a new state to the existing This source number three the http header except is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.270
used by inclined to negotiate with the server.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.210
What kind of representation is needed by the claimed,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.500
for example,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.520
a value off applications like Jason for this header tells the server to send a Jason

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.750
presentation of the resource and number four.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.180
The It's DDB header content type is used to buy a client to indicate what representation of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.750
the state is sent as Taylor by the client where it's TDP posed are put method
