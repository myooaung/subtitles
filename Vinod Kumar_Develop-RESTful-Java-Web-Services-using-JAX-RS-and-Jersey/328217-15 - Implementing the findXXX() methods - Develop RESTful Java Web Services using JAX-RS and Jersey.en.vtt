00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
in this video I want o implement find by i d which executes a select statement on the other

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.340
fine functions like find all find by city and find by country all of which execute SQL

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
Select statement So a lot of things are in common.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.550
Let's see how we can use eclipse toe influence the court.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.290
So the first thing is,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.360
we need a select statement here.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.730
So I really like your street.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.220
SQL equals toe select start from contexts where idee imports to question mark So the idea

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.700
is supplied by the user even supply toe the prepared statement.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.840
So once again,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.820
we need the tray with resources block.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.880
So we're gonna add a try on catch in,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.540
give off any exception.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.430
Viverito four does new dog exception.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.520
And in this wrong package,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.730
we're gonna create a connection and the big statement,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.690
Like the previous cases,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870
we have two awesome.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.100
The value for discussion marks are gonna die.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.280
Pure Festen guitar set in and the bottom it is one on the value for that is the function

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.340
argument ivy.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.500
Now that we have done with that,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.760
we have executor.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.620
So it's a STD empty door.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.860
Execute quiet.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.470
The return value off.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.320
This is off type called results said you can see it.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.990
It artist equals two,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.420
which gives an editor.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.050
So on,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.470
Mac,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.260
I pressed command one on windows IQ and press control one and then saying create a local

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.010
variable orders you press tender and you see that the variable is declared with results

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.850
such type.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.750
Now that I got the results,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.030
it there is a possibility that you might have given an invalid ideas.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.060
So there is no rule selected at all.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.390
Are you have given evaluated,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.060
In which case,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.450
there's only one single record here.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.520
So we will be using an if condition to check if others start next,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640
which means is there in a a car,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.870
Then we will be clearing a contact object and copy the value from the results it into the

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.810
contact object.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.630
So we're gonna say contact C equals toe new contact and I have to copy the values from this

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.630
,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.370
results it into the sea.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.150
So there are seven off them.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.770
Are is a seed or set ivy.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.670
And then I can either supply idea which is the exact same thing,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.990
or I can always say arrest are get it off the column for Heidi and the same thing I do for

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.650
all other six of them.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.890
So said name artist,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:51.200
Don't get string off lead on DSO on and one last Cedar said Country on our start get

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.650
strength off country.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.700
So now that we have got this,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.180
I can simply say you're often start clothes on.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.050
Then I can say but they don't see intended artist start next written falls,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.540
which means there is no record.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.880
I'm outside of the block.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.740
I have to actually say artist are close and then probably return now because there was no

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.880
record phone for that particular contact I d not this part with an creating a contact

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.550
object and copying the results,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.400
it data into the contact object is going to be common even for others.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.910
Also,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.660
for example,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.720
even here also,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.530
we will be creating an SQL statement saying Select Star from contacts which returns money.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.670
People rose and for every row we have a result,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.870
said,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.950
pointing to the truth,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.750
and the results of data were to copy that into contact object.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.600
So the same thing applies for this also.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.050
So because of which we would like Toa convert this into a function and eclipse has a very

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.660
nice we have doing the same thing.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.760
We select contacts easy for the new contract on copying the results.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.240
It later into the contact.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.130
That section we select and they re factor extract method.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.200
They last you.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.900
What is the name of the method you want?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.710
For example,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.520
It will be like private contact means that returned a please contact.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.910
The name of the function is extracted the results That artist is the perimeter.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.370
And of course,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.460
it does skill exception because ours don't get in and get string Detroit school exception.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.890
So we need to name this function.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.700
So we're gonna need this function as,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.760
for example,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.680
to contact and then click on OK.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.510
And you will see now that the entire statement here is now reduced toe contacts easy going

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.810
toe to contact off artists.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.400
And if you see down here,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.390
there is a function which is private returned the contact object taking it isn't said as a

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.980
perimeter.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.600
Now let's use the same thing in other functions also.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.470
So let's come down to the find All my string SQL is select start from context and then I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.290
can say Try with resources Block where I say catch.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.110
Exception.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.050
Yes.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.540
Throw news.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.590
The exception off the X this time we have to return a list instead of a single contact.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:29.970
So I'm repeal A list valuable for list equals Two new realist off contacts are listed to be

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.790
imported from you till you can press command shift on Mac control shift on windows on that

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.520
imports.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.630
And here is where I would be defining the election.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.450
So connection,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.470
conical stoop,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.950
a beauty don't get connection And then we have a prepared statement STM deep books to corn

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.620
about the statement off s your We don't have any problem.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.900
It does,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.050
in this case where there's nothing to be set so I can declare the MSM set Also here,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.590
as estimated are executed quite a we got there,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.560
isn't said and then I have to look through that here so that their wide orders start next

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.440
because we have multiple chose this time,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.830
not just one row.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.770
For every record we got,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.590
we have to create a contact.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.570
Objects like it's a context equals toe to contact off.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.120
Honest.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.170
This is a convenient function that be extracted a few minutes back.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.870
And now we have got to sleep.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.350
I said at least start R.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.130
C.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.200
So inside the loop I'm creating a contact object from every record adding it to my list.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.050
So the list of gross as the loop proceeds for them at the end of this amulet on a list.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.870
So when you come out of this strike edge block connection statement,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.100
onda results it,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.620
all of them get automatically closed as well.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.650
So let me say this.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.390
The next function is very much similar to that off this so I can copy the whole thing

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.640
basted,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.080
make few changes.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.840
For example,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.490
since we wanted from a particular city against a city equals to question Mark Onda.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.750
Since we have a question mark a perimeter here,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.160
we cannot just executed right here.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.760
So it has to be.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.020
After setting the parliament wrestles,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.550
they set string off one that's the first perimeter.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.020
The value is the city which the function argument really suit.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.600
And now we have this.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.610
I have to say results that are secret straits tempted or makes a good quality.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.460
Now,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.750
since results that needs to be closed,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.550
I can say your artist start closed after the look is over,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.360
the last one is exactly click off the same.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.870
Except city is changed to country somewhere a copy paste.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.700
The same thing This is gonna be good on.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.390
Of course,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:53.490
this variable also is gonna be a country on our deal.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.190
Functions are completely,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.750
really not.
