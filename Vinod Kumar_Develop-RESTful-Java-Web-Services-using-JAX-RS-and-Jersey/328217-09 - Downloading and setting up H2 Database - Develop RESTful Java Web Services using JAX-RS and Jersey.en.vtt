00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
for this training,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.670
I'll be using a database called Hit Student ofhis while if you have other data business

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.650
like my SQL or Post Chris,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.430
feel free to use the same thing.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.380
However it's to read.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.930
Abyss is more or less like zero configuration database.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.000
So in order for me to work with the same first weirdo,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.750
download that from his two database dot com.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.330
So I will visit.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.450
It's two database dot com.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.750
Andi,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.530
there is a download sexual here that the windows installer.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.950
But I would suggest use this one because it quotes with all the platforms.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.820
Plus,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.370
it doesn't have to be installed.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.990
You just started.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.910
Unzip that and start using.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.030
So I'm gonna select this all platform sick,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.450
fine,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.830
and choose my works location,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.910
which is under that storm.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.010
I have this.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.740
Jacks are three sources,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.550
and I'm gonna don't let the door here.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.050
So once the download is done,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.390
I'm gonna close Crume and open my folder without the zip file.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.200
I have to unzip the same And once the NDP is finished,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.060
I don't need this file anymore.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm gonna delete the same if you expand hedge to you'll see that there is a bin directory

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.250
and there is a student at bat.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.690
This is for Microsoft,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.170
Windows on for UNIX based operating system,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.490
like Mac OS or Lennox who want to etcetera.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.250
It's true,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.930
that s it is the fire to use on windows.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.380
You can simply double click this.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.900
It stood out bat and the Java application will run,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.920
which is your it's two database server on Mac.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.690
Copy this fight that copies the part also open a new terminal and then I'll simply pace

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.350
that and tender.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.710
And that will actually start the H two,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.640
a database server,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.250
and opened the plant console on the browser.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.990
And you also can see that there is an icon here which follows us toe exit or find the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.610
staters are reopened.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.860
This you are in Kazik,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.200
case is closed.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.020
So the first thing that you have to do is tow Change the genetic each toe embedded server

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.520
toe genetic.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.650
It's to server Andi.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
Then you have to specify the driver plants which is appropriately given here.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.070
GBC you order it says Julie.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.060
Physical and hitched.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.660
Local and incipient is the protocol for connecting from jail application toe the H two

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.010
server and the only thing that really change is the gate of his name.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.900
You can keep the same but I would say Just change this to something else.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.260
I'm gonna change this toe.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.510
Jack's artists work db and then you can specify a user name on password optional eso You

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.760
can test the connection.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.500
It would have created a new DP and the next time on North Street to connect to the same db

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.500
.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.050
So I keep the unimportant to connect the same.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.630
This is really gonna issue the SQL Command for creating tables,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.530
inserting data,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.070
selecting etcetera in order to shut down.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.530
You can go to the beach to icon here on,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.790
then click the exhibited.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.780
That's one way to do The other way to do is go to the command front where you started age

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.040
to server and press control C and that actually stops the DB server.
