00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
Now that the records off,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.800
just it up is done.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.270
Let's open a clips and configure.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.710
It keeps toe work with.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.650
Don't get to do so.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.850
I click on the gifts icon here,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.310
and when you are asked,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.600
what is the location off your workspace,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.610
you can select the appropriate work space it might get.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.150
It is Jack Scotus resources slash eclipse dash workspace,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.890
nor that this folder doesn't exist.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.100
Eclipse will create one for us on and make that as a workspace folder and click the launch

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.550
button.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.240
Get it up.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.350
The welcome view.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.810
Now,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.830
since we don't loaded the eclipse for Java e washing,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.060
you already have servers view here,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.860
then get If you do not see the servos view here,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.090
you can go to a window,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.850
but stick to open perspective other and make sure that you're in Java e prospector.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.180
So the several stab here shows no service available.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.950
Check this link to create a new server.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.050
You can take the link and this dialogue box appears.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.970
And in the dollar books,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.900
it is listing some of the plug ins.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.640
Over here.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.770
I have the Apache,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.250
the 1st 1 expand and I'll see that there are very deserve from Catalyst it over here.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.500
Since we don't know that the Washington nine I have to select this particular option.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.450
When I click next,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.780
it will ask me Where is the damn get location and I can get the browse button Onda under my

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.300
desktop Have Jack's artistry sources.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.440
Apache Dunk it.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.550
9.0 point 14 Click Open.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.580
Now,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.240
in my case,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
I have two different portions of Java Java eight job.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.350
What then?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.150
And for this I have to choose Java and C eight as the Tomcat name doesn't work with our 10

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.150
.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.810
So I click the next button And in this option,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.480
it asks,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.970
Do you have any projects that you want to Acto?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.280
Tom?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.070
Get right now.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.480
I don't have any project listed.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.210
I simply have to click Finish Know that the Sarwar is currently in the stop The state.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.840
If you want,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.160
you can click the green button here to start alternately.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.650
You can also right click and say start.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.540
This will take a few seconds and you will see that the Apache Tomcat comes up at port

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.850
number 8080 by default.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.300
Now,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.080
when you work with Java applications,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.200
we quite often use browsers,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.070
it looks,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.110
comes with an internal Brazil butt.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.400
For better experience,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.380
I would generally choose a browser from my computer,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.130
which is the default system where brother here,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.910
which is chrome on.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.440
Of course,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.220
I would like to go back to Crume and then open local host Colon 8080 I pressed.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.090
Enter and you will see that I get a 4.4 error message.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.390
But coming from Apache Tonka 9.0 point 14.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.570
Sometimes a druid report might have already been occupied by another server,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.050
in which case Tomcat will not work.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.390
So you know how to stop the server right now.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.890
In case if you want to change the part number,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.400
you can just double click this.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.800
That opens the configuration for Tom catch.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.530
And you can see here that there are four specified and they contain dates to the people.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.660
So some other number Since I do not have any other server running in a 00 I would like to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.450
keep the port number at 80 80 itself
