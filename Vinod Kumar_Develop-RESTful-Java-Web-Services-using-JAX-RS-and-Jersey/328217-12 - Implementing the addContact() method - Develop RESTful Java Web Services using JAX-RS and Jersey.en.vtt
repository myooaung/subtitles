00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
in this model.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.580
I want to show you the implementation for I contact function.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.560
So let's get it up.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.260
This debuting Andi opened the GBC contacts Dio,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.610
let's full screen this on this The function I want to show you how to do so We received a

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.090
contact object and there is no idea for this contact object.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.510
And when we send the SQL in third command hits,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.780
two will automatically generate a primary key and we have retreated primary key value and

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.950
assigned to this contact object 100 the same thing.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.290
So we will also be using the child with three sources option so that we don't have to do

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.060
closing off connection and prepared statement First time the SQL String here.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.550
This is how it's gonna look like insert into contacts.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.530
Since I do not have the i d.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.370
I have to specify what other columns that I'm supplying the values for,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.640
which is name,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.500
gender,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.280
email,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.080
phone,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.870
city and country.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.990
And since there are six of them,

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.700
I have to say values six question marks separated by commas.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.370
So this is my SQL String statement.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.000
Now let's add it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.070
Fight with resources block,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.650
but also safe catch any exception we get,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.860
We will read for the same as Newdow.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.450
Exceptions.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.490
So I said threw you off exception off the X.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.970
Now,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.210
this particular place is for declaring and initializing variables off types which are auto

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.840
plausible.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.180
Connection statement prepared statement results it all these interfaces extend auto

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.780
plausible,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.050
which means we can use the same over here.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.430
So I'm gonna take your connection call.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.220
He puts toe BB,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.250
you feel start get connection.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.810
I have to import.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.760
I'll press command,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.520
shift off on windows based controls it for and then I take a a fair statement STM d It

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.350
could stow conduct prepared statement off the SQL that we have created over here Now that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.000
we have got the two variables that we require on which automatically get close when this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.450
try catch block is over.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.280
Now we have to initially the six perimeters with the values coming from this particular

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.540
contact object to do so I come inside the try block on the STN regards Set strength Param

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.700
Eter Number one is convict or get name and like West Nile,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.020
say s t empty dot Said strength to is the perimeter and the value is contractor Get gender

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.590
STN did or said string third perimeter is contacted.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.810
Get email and said String off four perimeter contactar get phone places dealers sets tree

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:12.450
But I met a fine contact dot Get city on one last S t empty Dart said string 61 which is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.890
conduct out get country Now we have got the insert statement In order to execute any PML

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.050
SQL statement,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.920
we have to say s t empty dot Execute up it so this will add a new record,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.170
but heads toward a tender to the new primary key value for this.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.890
Now,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.440
in order to redo the same,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.930
we have toe add another flag here,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.750
which is called statement dart Written generated piece.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.960
Now with this,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.540
what happens when you executive this?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.060
It will also bring up the newly generated key or keys in case if you're inserted.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.890
Multiple roles using this insert command now do the same thing I can say here Keyes equals

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.970
two STM t dot get generated peace.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.690
Now,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.000
one thing that you can observe here is that I did not declare this variable keys off any

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.120
particular data type.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.140
So because of which I get an era and the fix this.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.750
Just move the most on dirt and say create a local variable keys.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.370
Now Eclipse identifies the return data.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.050
Type off this and declared this automatically.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.320
You can also press command one or control one on windows on,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.530
then press enter.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.550
It's automatically clear the variable off appropriate day today in this case with those it

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.550
.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.420
Now we know that we have inserted one drinker.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.240
Obviously,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.610
this brings up one primary key value.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.050
So we can say your key start next on.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.880
Now I can say keys dot Get in off one and that will give you the primary key value.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.190
So this auto generated Primerica has to be ascend to the contact.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.840
So I will cut from your and it's a contact or set I d.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.550
Then I'll supply this value.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.110
So now that we have a contract already,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.250
we can now return the same and then get off this return statement from here.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.010
So I say this file and now my function at contact is ready
