00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
in this video,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.210
we'll show you how to create a resting point and handled its TTP get request and produced

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.390
Jason Output.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.890
So to do so,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.780
let's go and clear a new resource for context resource.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.940
And we want to use the Deal factory and the context here that we have created in the past.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.580
Let's create a new class by right clicking new class.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.190
Call it,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.830
Ask contacts with source and straight away.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.450
Let's add an annotation for font slash complex.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.230
So if you look at the web dot XML,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.290
we have already said ducks slash ap a slash star will be handled by Jersey and Jesse will

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.650
now look for resources in that particular package.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.050
So slash ap a slash contact will come to this particular object.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.640
So we're gonna define a function here,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.100
and this time around,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.820
we're gonna do it a little bit differently.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.890
Import professionally.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.300
The first thing is,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.770
they say that the function is public and produces a response Object.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.480
Let's name the function as get all context and we're gonna important the response from Java

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.020
extra please Rx cool response that the plants were gonna say you're returned response start

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.020
,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.940
okay.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.130
And okay,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.890
will produce a state of scored off 200 an optional object can also be supplied over here.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.750
Since we're supposed to return a list of all the contacts were gonna specify here this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.450
entity,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.110
which is a list and the list is supposed to come from our you.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.160
So we have not got the deal.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.210
It So that's clearly a variable here called context zero on in the constructor.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.950
Let's initialize the same thing.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.820
And to initialize the same,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.740
we're gonna say deal equals toe deal factory don't get contact Steel.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.710
So get context.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.110
Deal with a factory function and that throws a dollar exceptions.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.630
We're gonna throw it away from the constructor as well.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.720
So we have the Dearborn already,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.430
and I can come here and say the award or find Paul,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.990
and that's going to give me a list of contact objects with their sponsor.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.670
Okay,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.510
Andi said Dr Bill.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.920
So this also has an error because the order find out what's check exception.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.640
We have toe throw it away from the function or handled that for the time being.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370
Let's throw it away from the function,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.300
and later we will handle the exceptions in different face.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.480
So now that our function is ready,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.460
let's annotate the same with after it yet and then had their producers.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.990
And we're going to specify the mind application slash Jason,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.180
do the import by prison command ship off controlled shift Go Syria Fight Now I know that my

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.510
baby,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.740
sir,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.070
Where is stopped?

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.710
So I have no started.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.710
So I go do my desktop.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.460
Jax RS resources.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.780
It's to been on windows.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.350
Double click it stood Are bad.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.270
Justin,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.450
give if your server has been stopped.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.350
So in Mike,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.340
is this a rolling stop?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.940
So I have to run the eight student.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.050
It's it's showing a copy.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.490
This one and then open in your terminal and based the park.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.370
Just enter.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.090
That will start the BB server.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.220
That's okay.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.500
I don't need the client here.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.750
Know that our db,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.960
sir.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.070
Where is open during?

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.580
There's one last thing to do.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.750
Know that our GBC that properties refer toa a driver class called are its to the driver

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.420
that is not part of,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.790
or May 1 dependency list here.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.950
Now there are two things that you can do.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.390
One is you can go to the main one bomb dot xml and add an entry so that its true Trevor can

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.150
be used.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.190
Ultimately,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.540
you can feed a family enough lib and then populates the jar file band early.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.600
So let's go to the maps.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.380
Robin.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.610
If and there is no live directors,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.610
let's at a new folder card mill and I go toe my kids to folder.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.450
There is a job,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:26.070
I hope you that and come back toe Eclipse based the same over here and know that this file

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.930
is available.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.370
Let's restart over time,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.990
get the ones that don't get it.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.780
Really Lets go back toe postman.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.380
That's at a new request that's copy the previous one and then changes to on a best Andi.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.970
Make sure that the except Header refers to applications that Jason get the thing,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:59.050
but and now you can see that we got the area off 1000 Jason objects representing all the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.730
context that we have in the database.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.690
Suppose if you want to read through a specific contact details,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.320
let's say,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.830
for example,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.350
I want true this I might be invested in safe contact,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.850
slashed,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.110
eat and then take the same button.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.220
Now,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.450
this time we will get for not for because we do not have the mapping for this particular

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.850
Europe.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.460
Another,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.720
it'll send the same thing would be questioned.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.670
More really.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.630
Quotes toe eight.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.190
So this is called as a quiet string perimeter.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.030
So the previous one is for both perimeter.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.290
This is called quite distinct perimeter.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.130
So to handle our perimeter,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.720
let's define a new function on then test the same thing.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.950
So let's go back to our gives.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.150
Go back to our context resource and it's had a new function like this.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.840
So I would be adding a function this time because the response get one fun intact,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.510
but the user supplies and ivy as part of the part and that we want in the fall off in vigil

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.070
I d.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.450
I also say throw strong exception the begun response start.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.150
Okay,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.470
The object here is dear would or find by idee.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.480
And the variable is the serious function perimeter.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.910
We want to supply the same thing I was I have possessed Bill.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.890
So which brings that response.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.690
All right,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.860
Well,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.090
this idea has to be part of the pot.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.760
So to specify that it is part of the pot,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.880
use a credit fought so with a slash contact followed by slashed something.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.460
So we're gonna say slash I really like this.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.320
Now you can give any name you want here,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.860
for example,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.610
I can say contact underscore idea Doesn't matter.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.610
We're to map this.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.650
I didn t fire to this variable here.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.270
To do that,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.550
we have to say I three parts omitted on.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.600
Then we say contact underscore I now whatever that comes after.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.560
Contact slash will now be positive toe this indigent valuable i d.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.270
And that is now received by this deal with Fine by me,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.930
which returns one single object are American novel.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.660
We also have to specify that it produces application slash Jason.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.310
So let's talk.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.860
It is the same thing over here.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.350
Also,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.450
we have to say that they get save it.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:31.620
We start the server and go back to postmen.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.160
Click the send button on.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.840
We should be able to see a single contact corresponding because 88 intensify supply and I

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.210
leave it.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.060
Is not it?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.730
For example,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.950
8009 Easily valley ready?

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.450
Perfectly consent.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.050
You still see that?

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.030
It's blank and it comes with 200.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.530
Okay,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:56.640
So you might be interested to send for not for our some other court that indicates that the

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.320
record does not exist.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.650
We will learn about the error handling mechanism a little bit later.
