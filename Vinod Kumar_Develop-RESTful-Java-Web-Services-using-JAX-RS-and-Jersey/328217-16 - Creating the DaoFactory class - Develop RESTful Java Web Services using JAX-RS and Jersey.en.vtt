00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
The reason we created an interface on an implementing plants is to provide loose coupling,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.860
which means at any point in time,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.520
I would be changing the implementation from Jerry.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.940
BC toe Probably I pernet are probably to JP are something else,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.870
but my Web services will be using.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.950
The context here will interface,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.120
which means that the function signage is used for my Web service,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.350
our peace and not off the implementation at all.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.050
So this gives us flexibility in terms off replacing the implementation at any point in time

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.320
But there will be one problem because in your that services,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.050
.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.830
you may have to say on text deal.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.240
Deal equals toe new cherry.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.290
BC context Deal No,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.410
no aware this.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.950
What we have something called is a virtual constructor or a factory matter.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.400
Soto forward this factory method.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.950
We will create a new class for doll factory or Deol factory,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.320
so this is how it's done.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.690
Let's create a new class called the Aero Factory.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.830
As the names of this,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.740
it's job is to manufacture dio object,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
understand the same thing and since this is also like utility plants,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.560
so we make it as final,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.120
indicating that it's not going to be inherited as well as we will also write a private

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.670
constructor instead of a public instructor.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.310
So you do not instance she ate the same thing.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.970
The next thing we want to do here is to clear a function for public contacts.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.950
Dio get contacts Teoh,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.950
which returns a new contact hero based on what kind of implementation the user wants.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.340
Now suppose that you have a jelly BC implementation off the same as well as I burn it,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.530
as well as a similar Jason etcetera.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.480
Now the users should be able to specify what kind of implementation is that now that can be

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.540
specified sometimes as function argument as well,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.520
which is called discriminator and based on the discriminator value,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.520
you would be returning appropriate one now.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.180
Ultimately,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.290
you can also declare a variable here,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.860
for example,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940
like it's a high rate static final.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.780
And then I can say string,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.770
I can say I am field type equals toe jbc,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.620
and now I can use that like switch.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.710
I am feel type and I can check.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.850
What is the type off this If this is hibernated,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.830
everything a different implementation.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.430
If this is Jerry,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.940
BC written jelly,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.820
busy implementation and so on.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.500
In this case,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.550
we're gonna use the discriminator in the same class.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.460
You can even externalize this toe environment variables as well.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.940
So in the switch case has a case Jelly V C.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.390
I have to simply say return new jelly.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.070
Busy contacts deal in case off any invalid One I can promise they throw knew the exception

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.500
and then say that no suitable implementation.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.960
All right,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.280
say this.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.040
Of course,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.820
since I'm throwing a checked exception here,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.070
either I have a handle that here what?

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.570
I can say that the function who were calls this must be ready to catch this exception that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.380
they are throws.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.110
Declaration.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.410
Save the file.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.190
Now My deal factory is also ready.
