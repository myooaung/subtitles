00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
so far in our application were able to get the data in applications.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.630
Last Jason format.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.460
We see an array of Jason objects,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.310
but sometimes we might want this in different formats.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.070
For example,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.150
I might be interested to get CSP data,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.910
But if I send this,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.800
we're gonna get another called 406 which is a state of school for not acceptable.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.540
Meaning you are trying to negotiate with the server for this particular mind.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.180
Take the third World doesn't have a provider for this paper to fix this.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.160
Let's go and create a new plants in our providers so well lately on our package.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.190
New class will call this as contact toe CS three Marshall and say,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.850
Finished.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.400
We need to annotate this with two annotations at the rate provider and at the ready

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.460
producers What kind of data it produces in our case,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.610
it is gonna be a Texas that CS Week.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.710
That's important.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.410
Same thing by President Command shift book This close must also implement an interface card

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.670
message body writer on and off data contradict.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.260
So if you import,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.930
you get an I don't know,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.540
saying that this particular class must implement the members off this particular interface

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.540
.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.050
So we add unimplemented methods and you're now having three different functions over here.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.330
That's one screen,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.950
this one.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.190
The first function you can see here is is irritable.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.390
We didn't true or false,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.280
depending on whether an object has to be converted in tow A C s,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.080
we are not.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.490
In most cases,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.890
this might be true,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.620
but what we do is we take the data,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.290
let the risk given and we check.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.260
Is it equals to the contact,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.790
then yes.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840
Then we're going to return that the syntax for doing so.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.010
Is it this variable which is the data tape off the object being they want to me.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.430
So we'll say time is a sign able from contact.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.210
This is where we see that this particular Marshall er should be used only for an object off

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.480
contactar class.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.690
The second function here is gonna get say's You can calculate the size of the old going CS

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.590
free content.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.600
But if you're not sure,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.810
you can always return minus one to indicate Jesse should automatically calculate and update

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.390
the same thing.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110
So eventually this is going to be the content.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.050
Lend http response header The actual function look unworthy contact object into a CSP is to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.940
Britain over here where we received the contract object and all other additional type off

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.570
information.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.980
The last perimeter here is the output stream to which we have to write the data.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.550
So we take this contact later and we write something else to this particular output stream

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.550
.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.910
So to do so,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.580
I'm gonna create a stream off equals toe stranger for much.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.900
Now,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.960
since I wanted it that CSB format,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.450
I'm going to use a percentage d for the i d common percentage.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.930
Yes,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.420
for the name percentage s for gender percentage,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.550
pests wasn't age this and one more percentages for country.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.380
And the argument for this would be a dot So t being this particular object here,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.050
they don't get I d date or get me.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.250
And so on.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.750
Now that we have the open to be sent,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.610
we're going right into the opportunities for entity stream.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.730
Don't right.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.230
And then I need the bites so I can say old dirt get bites so it will convert this industry

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.370
into bites and will be returned to this particular output stream.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.080
If you wanted the headers for the same.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.990
You can also do the same thing by giving entity Stream about right And then,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.580
of course,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.140
whatever that you want to write.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.980
Don't get fights.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.450
This would be I'd name gender female for city and country.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.490
Now that we have a forwarded that know how to convert a contact into CSP that's also good

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.320
over resource and say whenever a single contact object is asked for along with the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.280
applications large.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.950
Jason,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.830
this is also able to purpose a CIA sweet.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.400
So they have this mind pain save it Restarted the Tomcat go back,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.450
toe postman and these in the request.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.870
Then we got the response.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.860
No,

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.990
no,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.670
it is that we did not add a new line here.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.310
So it is coming in the same line.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.260
Let's go back to our provider and at the U Lane.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.840
After this,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.340
if you want,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.650
you can also add a new link.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.110
Your save it,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.980
you know,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.700
toe wait for the server Could be start or let's restart manually.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.810
Go back to postmen,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.950
send the request begin and we should get the modified response Probably.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.550
Let's go back to our resource.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.040
Let's give the same pictures.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.730
Last years before this one as well.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.050
Baby,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.370
we're going to get all the contacts and see if we can get a single output.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.950
Let's go back to most men on it.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.210
Is this slash one?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.160
So we get all the contacts,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.000
the header,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.350
things,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.160
text last year.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.440
Sri.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.470
When I click on Send,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.720
we get an editor 500 Let's go see what's the actual letter in the eclipse?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.990
Cancel This time it is a message body writer for a realist and mind FCS we waas Not for a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.660
while.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.930
We have created a martial er for contact to see a stream Arcelor similarly be also won an

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.670
array list marshal as well.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.790
So let's do the same thing We're gonna vote to you their new plus and therefore waiters

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.110
Name of the blood that's given us released to CSP,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:45.950
Marchena and Implements message body writer And the little babies are a list off contact

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.580
and so finish We got an interface.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.770
Let's add unimplemented methods you got all of them.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:06.700
Now we have to say that this is a far wider as the less it produces ticked its last CS.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.580
You know,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.990
as in the previous case,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:15.080
let's go on our return statement here saying that if the type is assigned Nable from

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.950
released our class,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.340
then it is fine.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.300
Similarly,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.800
the type should be automatically calculated by jealousy.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.050
Savidan minus one.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.970
And here is where we know that it's in a release here.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.560
So we have looked through and then bring the CSB or put on the question.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.390
So let's change the name from B to list here so we can look to that also like the previous

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.760
one,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.630
we would like Toa header somewhere are this better?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.700
And then as it for conducted d in this,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.250
it's going to copy this score and based over here,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.470
of course,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.390
we also have toe right.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.470
The same thing on two about would seem so.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.280
Save this.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.450
Now we bring the heading ones on the data multiple times for each of the contact objects.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.560
So let's save this that he started.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:22.450
Don't get go back to full strength and recent that it quest.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.120
And this time we got the response appropriately.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.410
So one line header and the rest of the lines contain the actual data.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:32.750
There
