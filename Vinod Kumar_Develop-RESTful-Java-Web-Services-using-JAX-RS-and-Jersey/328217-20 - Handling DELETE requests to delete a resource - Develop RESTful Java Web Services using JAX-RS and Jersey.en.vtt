00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
in this video.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.570
Let's try be leading a resource by sending an http delete request to do so.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.110
Let's frustrated function that produces a response.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.890
We call it as the contact we need an i.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.280
D.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.030
So we'll say integer Ready,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.680
throw stuff exception because what?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.420
Deleting it there the problem began.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.580
An exception on all I have to do is to say,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
first deal would not delete contact i D.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.270
But once this is done,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.890
we just want to send in okay,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.340
response over territory response start okay,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.060
without any parameter.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.700
And then you can save big toe build that now in cases.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.270
This through an exception because it was an invalid,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.820
i d.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.190
Then that Saddam exception will be thrown further.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.900
Jesse will take care of that,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.410
displaying the other message.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.130
Of course,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.970
we also like to handle the exception in different place.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.180
Will take a look into that in another video.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.150
No,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.440
to complete this stance.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.730
Let's say you're going forward after it fast with slash contact on the score pretty and

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.060
then we say that it produces.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.450
We say application slash Jason,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.660
this doesn't consume any data,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.040
so we don't have to mention anything else and one last thing is weird to say that the rate

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.450
delete and that's a new annotation we have to import.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.110
We also have to map this contact underscore.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.210
Ready to this variable.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.840
For that,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.410
we have used part perimeter in the past.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.570
Similar copy paste.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.710
The same thing over here.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.450
So the lead handler is now ready.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.350
Let's go and re start Tomcat and test the same thing in Postman.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.390
So let's send the same request with the delete hits TDB matter.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
I'm gonna copy this entire urine and then create a new request.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.180
Select delete from the drop down the euro is this I click on send and you can see it is 200

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.180
.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.750
Okay,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:14.800
so goto the database and check if I d one doesn't one exist,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.350
it will come back with no rose.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.800
So if I go and delete this again instead of doing it,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.300
Okay,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.030
we get at a 500 because there is an exception.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.450
Troll.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.720
And if you check the exception,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.880
it says here no records.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.460
Deluded,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.240
invalidated,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.680
supplied.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.500
1001.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.710
Not This is a message coming from our GBC context,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.850
dear Will implementation plus
