00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
Jonah.

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.530
Maybe a Forest Full Web services,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.100
also known as Jax RS,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.300
is a specification.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.950
Standardize fight the child community process.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.810
This provides support in creating Web services,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.550
according to the arrest Architectural battle.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:22.770
Jax RS uses annotations to simplify development off the surface and part from washing 1.1

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.250
onwards.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.500
Jack's orders has become on official part of Job i e.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.980
Six.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.230
A notable feature off being an official part of reality is that no configuration is

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.770
necessary to start using jack service for non Java ee six involvements.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.810
A small injury in the web DOT XML,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.610
which is called deployment descriptor,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.450
is required.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.090
Jackson has provided some annotations toe help in mapping a Java class.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.170
As a Web resource,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.430
the institutions are part of the job.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.380
Our X dark W start artist package.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.200
Let's have a look into most commonly used and patients at the red part.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.670
The sanitation specifies the related part.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.500
For a resource,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.890
plants are method.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.850
For example,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.770
the euro 80 typical and double slash example dot com slash ap slash product can be mapped

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.550
your function that can respond with a list of products using the sanitation.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.330
The innovations get put post delete and head.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.470
Specify the http request type of resource.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.390
For example,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.800
the urine It's typical and double slash example dot com slash a.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.460
Piousness products can be mad toe two different functions,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.850
one for retaining all products and one for accepting a product data from the plant.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.040
The produce is an addition,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.210
specifies the response media type,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.950
also known as mine dates.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.650
This is used for content negotiation by the client.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.810
For example,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.250
Dysfunction returns a product object,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.830
but the Jackson is random can convert the same into either Jason or XML based on the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.120
negotiation by the plane.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.870
If the clients and the request header called,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.850
except with applications like Jason,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.900
then Jansa is runtime uses a Jason Marshall like Jackson or Matsui to convert the product

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.180
instance in tow,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.370
an equal and chase under presentation.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.080
But if the client sends applications lashed X similar,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.050
the value for it questions our exit,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.270
then the theme.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.480
Jackson sometime will use a different martial art.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.840
This time Jax Be Marshal to send an ex similar presentation of the product.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.450
Instance.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.870
Finally,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.790
the consumes annotation specifies what media types are acceptable by the end point.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.640
This works the same way as producers But this time the client sends the data using its city

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.420
people's output as request matter,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.420
along with the payload consisting off either Jason are examine.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.950
Later.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.190
The client negotiates by sending,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.890
and it's TDP request header card content.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.030
That's time with applications like Jason are applications Flash XML or any other custom

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.920
mind type based on this value?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.310
JAXA Restaurant Time uses that Jason or Jack's P or some custom on Mutscheller to convert

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.950
the pillar into an appropriate tell object.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.550
The chat services only an A B A specification by Jolla Community Process,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.500
however,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.840
toe actually clear the rest.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.690
Full Web service.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.880
Using this FBI,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.170
we have to use an implementation.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.740
This allows us to choose between different implementations based on various factors such as

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.680
ease of use,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.340
age licensing and,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.810
of course,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.550
performance.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.690
Some other implementations off Jackson is include Jesse as part of glass fish project from

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.300
Oracle.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.530
Arrest Easy from J Bus Gela Framework,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.170
which is optimized for Google,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
our engines on sea except from a patches after foundation.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.480
For this course,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.750
we will be using the one from article card.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.350
Jesse
