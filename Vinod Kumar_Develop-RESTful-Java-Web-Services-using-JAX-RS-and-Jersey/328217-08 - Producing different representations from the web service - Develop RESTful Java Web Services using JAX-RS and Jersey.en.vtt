00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
No.

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.620
The World Arrest is an acronym for Representational State Transfer,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.380
which means transferring of state in different representation.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.310
We got a plane response here on Let's say we want to get XML or Jason.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.650
How do we do this?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.190
To understand the same,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.080
Let's go and take another example.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.700
So let's stop the Sarwar for a while and open our hello resource.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.980
You can press command,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.990
shift our on Mac and control shift or on meadows,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.940
and they've here.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.020
Hello on.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.400
You'll see that regard the file.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.190
Now.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.840
This function is mapped with other it get,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.480
which means that all the good request will get this particular or put as the response.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.810
But in order the handle different flying the requirement,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.630
which is called content negotiation,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.850
which means if the user wants an example,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.840
we want to give a different or put if the user wants a Jason,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.290
we want to give a different output.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.000
So let's add two more functions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.590
I felt public string great as examine.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.230
Let's your done anything String for now.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.840
On another function,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.940
public string,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.070
greet as Jason on and so they don't empty string for now.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.210
Now,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.190
if you are here at the reel get just like the previous one.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.070
Now Jesse has a confusion.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.150
Which one?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.740
To return when the user Mexican request.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.610
So obviously we have toe distinguish the same.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.750
To say that if the user is asking for plain text and send this if the user is asking,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170
for example content send this.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.360
And if the user is asking for Jason,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.050
send this particular outward.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.990
No,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.620
To do so,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.380
we have to add another innovation for factory it produces.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710
This time I'm gonna press command shift.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.160
Oh,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.200
toe automatically import the same.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.040
And then in the bracket,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:07.090
I can see that this producers fixed slash play and this is called mime type and we have toe

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.560
map,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.920
different mind types what these two functions.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.450
So I'm gonna copy the same,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.640
but make a change here.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:26.370
This time I'm gonna say application slash xml and this one application slash Jason save it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.370
.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.150
So we have to send some XML content here.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.340
Let's take this example as an example.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:43.450
It's something greeting slash bleeding and inside I have a message.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.900
What would wrong?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.450
You know.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.340
So if this is the text that we want,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.850
you know,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.650
could this from here?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.710
Andi Goto eclipse and based here inside this double correct text.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.610
And you'll see the clicks automatically strict there into multiple lines by adding escape

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.160
characters as required.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.860
And similarly,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.270
I want apologies on here.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.660
So I go back on.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.710
Let's assume that this is the Jason that we want to know where hello Work is the message

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.550
from the user,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.930
you know.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.760
So I select this,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.450
cut it from here and then I go back to my stream here On that basis,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.370
I say this core and then restart the Tomcat.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.590
Sir.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.830
What?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.700
So once the dunk,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.140
it is up and running.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.900
They open.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.400
Crume Andi,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.630
refresh this Obviously here we only specified the Ural and we did not mention what kind of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.980
data were expecting.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.320
But when I refresh,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.600
you will see that we got an XML or put The reason for this is by DE for grooms in the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.300
header bar.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.930
Except with examine as one off its mind type to see the same.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.750
You can goto view developer.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.920
You can go toe developer tools on DSA Lecter network tool here and then make sure that you

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.700
are seeing all the requests.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.600
Click the refresh and it's either the request has gone from here.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.690
If you expand it the request fitters,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.300
it says.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.240
Except extra slash html obligation accepted.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.400
Gmail blocks XML,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.280
but you can see that it's saying applications lash XML.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.930
So there is no mentioning off extra slash plane.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.950
Are applications left Jason?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.450
So if you want to send a request by specifying a different value for the except Header,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.550
you need a tool for the same.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.440
And these tools are available under net as Google chrome extensions.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.260
The most popular one is called Postman.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:59.180
You can look for postman chrome extension And then you said like this.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.980
You just show you a dialog box here,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.020
which is Actiq room.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.870
Since in my case,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.030
I already have this.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.400
It says lunch app.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.040
Once you add to your crew,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.120
you will be able to see that in the list off abs here,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.980
Oregon tape,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.880
chrome colon,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.440
double slash APS And this is the postman.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.500
I click on this.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.600
You can get it up all these dialog boxes for imminent and type in the same urine.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.910
So the euro is this.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.700
I could be the same urine goto post my taste it.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.820
And now I can just click on this.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.650
As in the previous case,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.010
you can see that I just got a hello from we know that's a text.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.080
So there was no header sent by me,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.180
But there was some header sent by postman itself.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.770
I gotta headers.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:57.320
I can type your except and then say I want it to the form off applications like Jason and

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.150
then ascended.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.750
We gotta Jason or put we change this to slash xml.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.860
Andi send it.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.050
We get the example.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.040
Of course,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.520
if you want to explicitly mention text slash played on,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.690
you will get the next plane message and Northern In all the cases,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.120
the response status was 200.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.220
But if I change this to something like extra slash CS,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.410
we,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.200
for example,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.510
and says send,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.830
you will get an editor to see the actual American border.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.710
The review here and that says 406 not acceptable.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.280
The same thing is also listed here as 406 not acceptable,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.920
which means if you're asking for a specific representation on your Sarwar doesn't have the

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.750
representation.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.890
The thorough is expected to send another court 406
