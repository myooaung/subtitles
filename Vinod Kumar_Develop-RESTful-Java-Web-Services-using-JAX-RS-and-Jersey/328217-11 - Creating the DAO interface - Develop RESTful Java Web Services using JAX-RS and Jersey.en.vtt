X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
in this model,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.950
we're gonna work with a deal interface which provides functions for our resting point.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.960
So to do so,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.400
First,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.270
let's create an entity class representing our table.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.260
So we go toe job our resources main.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.170
And we already have one package here.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.610
So we're gonna right click on this package here.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.970
A new class.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.820
The class is going to represent the table record,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.950
so we're gonna call it us contact.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.810
But since it is not a source,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.550
the package name that's changing toe entity,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040
you go on finish.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.290
Come on out to sea.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:46.250
Now we're gonna have your variables representing each column on appropriate type.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.270
So I would say you're five id in digital.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.850
I d fly red string need very extreme gender.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.830
And he made four number.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.600
We have two more city on thank you.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.780
Now,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.820
as a good practice,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.250
always at a default constructor.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.390
To do so,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.060
you can press control space and then type contact and you can see that there is the contact

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.060
.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.250
Constructor here can remove this comment by prison commander D on my control on the juice

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.990
next because these are private in nature and may need to expose the mask properties.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.070
You have our get doesn't centers can go to the source milieu,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.210
generate getters and centers on it'll list or all the fields.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.550
We want all of them and then say OK,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.500
and they all are added us get doesn't sitters over here save this file and close the same?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.260
Next,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.630
we're gonna create an interface.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.250
So I'll say new interferes,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.390
which is gonna provide credit in quality operations for this particular contractor.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.890
Charla.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
Since this is gonna be a d able layer sunder type,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.500
you're be able as the package name.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.100
And then I did a pure context.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.090
Do you finish?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.350
And that comes up with empty interface.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.400
So this interface defines current operations and qualities.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.000
So the credit operations include adding a new contact,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.870
getting a single contact based on the i d,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.290
updating a contact object and deleting a contract based on the idea.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.000
So that's probably a similar functions here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.500
1st 1 public contact eye contact,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.750
which takes a contact object.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.530
Probably.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.600
We told a primary key value and then added to the database table.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.350
So that's type your available called contact.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.440
Now you have to import the contact so I can press command shift on back our control shift

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.250
on Windows toe automatically import the same by convention,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.390
every deal operation should,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.440
through a deal specific exception.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.550
So I'm gonna call this as close D.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.510
A rule exception now,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.010
since we do not have a Class Scorpio exceptions to getting in and actually for move the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.320
cursor on the same,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.990
it says.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.430
Here,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.370
dear exception cannot be result where type fear a classical dive exception or change it to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.190
something else.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.980
Now,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.940
by clicking this create class deal exception,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.670
it brings up a dialog box,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.520
which is pre filled with the package.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.180
Name a class name,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.780
the super class name everything and I click finish toe,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.190
come out of the same generally exception.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.870
Classes defined few useful constructors to do so you can put a source,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.530
generate constructors from super class on and choose any off those things that you want.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.760
General Convention is that you have a no argument constructor.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.700
An exception that is created out of a string are an exception that is created out off.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.640
Another exception,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.540
click OK to come out of the same on you can see that these tools are no longer useful,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.140
so I'm clicking a man be to delete the entire line and our exception plus is ready.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.910
One other thing that you can see here is that this class is giving me a warning.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.060
And that's because this last extend from exception which extend from trouble,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.900
which implements cereal Izabal because of which my class is also a sea realizable.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.790
Plants on generally cereal Izabal plus must to define a variable car serial washing you

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.940
every Now this is not a an editor,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.920
this is a warning.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.350
So just to await the warning just mother cursor on that and then say are deformed serial

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.350
Washington You,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.250
Eddie and now my classes ready?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.620
It saved this close this exception and then come back to the context evil way.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.470
We have added one function now similarly,

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.740
I want our another functions off public contact.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.050
This is gonna be called us find by Ivy on the supply an integer Heidi that throws exception

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.050
.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.500
So given an I d.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.850
B will search for the contact and attend the contact object.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.920
So the next one is perfect.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.240
Contact update contact.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.710
It's takes the contact object on throws the Rexhepi.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.810
So the last one in the crowd operation is a cognitive work,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.150
delete contact,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.490
which takes in integer I'd on throw storm exception.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.990
For example,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.590
if the idea is a player is an invalid one it Metroid.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.250
Other exception saying invalidating for tradition are if the ideas proper,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.490
it may delete the actual record from the DP as well.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.840
No.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.830
The qualities on the choir is,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.550
for example,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.380
may give you a list off all the contacts or list off contact from a particular city or from

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.690
a particular country.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.240
So that's are a function off like list off in effect,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.470
that's gonna dust find on they're throws.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:21.890
Exception list is supposed to be important from job Or do you kill I Press command shift

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.430
full on Windows Press Control shipped.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.780
All this time,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.980
it shows different classes here because the same name multiple pluses exist.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.780
How to select Job What are you doing?

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.350
Dirt list.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.750
Click finish to come all the same.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.960
Another function for public list.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.110
Off contact.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.610
Find by city,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.900
which takes a string city throws exception.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.850
One more off legs list off contact.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.520
Find by country on.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.200
It takes the country as a perimeter.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.180
I didn't get a Penny Meadows.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.450
It's going toe a job description.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:10.400
You can press control shift F on windows and command shift F on back for formatting on

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.230
Syria it.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.900
And now we're done with that deal interface.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.760
Let's create an implementation for the same that implement all the functions using Jerry

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.170
Busy to do.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.250
So I'm gonna right click on,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.530
say,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.790
a new class.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:38.240
I'm gonna call this US GBC on text deal that implements contacts to you All the abstract

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.760
functions will not be implemented with empty bodies over here on.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.990
That's OK for now it's close this and come back to this later.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.310
In order to work with Jerry BC,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.240
we always need a jerry busy connection to provide a J BBC connection.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.340
There are three or four lines off core and ah y repetition.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.120
Let's make a you deal class.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.720
So I'm gonna create a new class.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.640
Andi,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.050
change the package from deal toe beauties on that.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.050
This is gonna be called us dvu tin finish.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.480
Generally,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:23.000
utility classes are final so that they cannot be inherited on also will define a private

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.670
constructors,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.740
so it cannot be instance created.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.630
So this is a general practice,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.830
but you don't have to really follow this now.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.430
This is gonna defined a function which is static in nature.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:44.030
But the Britons a connection on Let's call this as get connection and connection needs to

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.800
be imported from job order.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.150
SQL package.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.810
This function should return a DP connection Every time it starts to open a connection,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:58.120
we have to load the driver class and then use the Ural user name password,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.730
etcetera.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.500
Now,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.730
instead of hard coding,

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:06.610
the values over here we can keep them in a properties file on the properties file are

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.090
generally kept in the resources folder.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.770
So I rightly can say new Andi.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.470
I want to create a new file.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.960
The new file is not listed.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.020
I got the other under gender.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.450
You'll see that there is a fight.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.460
I click next icon and asked Jerry,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.500
BC Dark properties This properties file will define the Ural user name,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.350
password and driver plus name.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.040
It's a general convention to use Jerry visit dot u R equals to Jerry.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.550
Busy dot driver,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.500
Equal student.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.780
Previously thought User equals two and Jerry Rezidor password equals Strazzer cheese.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.920
The value for Ural here is GBC,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.450
which is the claim miracle.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.870
It's to Poland.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.950
Recipe is the server protocol,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:10:00.540
colon location off the computer is local most followed by a slash and a tilde ana slash

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.510
followed by the name of the baby which is Jack's honest won t be the driver.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:06.810
Plus,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:13.550
here is our it's Tudor de Capital Driver User s A and there is no password.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.320
So save this file in get if you want to work with my s Still are other data basis on Lee

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.170
Her to do is to come here and change this parameters and everything else will remain intact

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:25.170
.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.780
So let me close the same.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.480
And now I want to use those values over here.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.860
Now for this I will declare for variables Private,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:43.880
ecstatic string driver You are user and password which needs to be initialized when this

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.790
class is loaded on the via and to do so am unlikely it s static block.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:55.550
This is where I would like to load the properties for using the respondent assigned the

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.680
values for each of these variables.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:06.950
So the first day is I have to clear the resource bundle R B equals toe resource bundle dot

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.930
get bundle and you have to give the face name which is Jenny busy,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.880
so it will look always for this particular jdb.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.120
See dark properties in the build apart and SRC slash main slash resources is one of four

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.370
bill,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.390
but folders I once I got the source bundle.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.500
I cannot say you're the variable driver equals toe RB taught Get strength,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.900
Jerry Rezidor driver and the same thing.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.650
I have to do it for the other three variables.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.380
I'm gonna change this toe.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.940
You're obviously this is a very busy dark urine.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.060
Use it on and chili BC,

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.860
the user password equals toe arbiter getting off.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.130
Jerry,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.150
visit our class work.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.690
So we have externalized these values.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.710
Now the static blood gets executor when the d beautiful is loaded on the BM which means

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.980
that the first thing that happens So by the time someone calls this function,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.950
these variables have already been initialized.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.040
So we're gonna use that by typing class.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.980
Start for name,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.350
off driver and then I say return driver,

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.740
manager taught,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.670
get collection,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.370
have dysfunction that takes your user password Semicolon.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.090
I mean,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.800
it's saved this.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.120
You can see that there are two errors because thes to throw checked exceptions either have

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.750
to put it right.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.650
Get in and building or I can throw it from this particular function.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.490
There are two ways toe automatically at the throws class here.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.460
Number one.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.240
The smoother cuts are under our throws.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.020
Declaration.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.850
Choose that.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.940
And you got that post last night for an exception.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.740
The other way is click on the other line.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.910
Press command one on Mac control,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.360
one on Windows on that will give you a quick fix.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.450
Usually the 1st 1 is the correct one.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.570
Less enter and you'll see that it is throws Eskil exception.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.580
So everything is done.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.890
Save this.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:15.080
And now we can use this get connection function from our deal implementation.
