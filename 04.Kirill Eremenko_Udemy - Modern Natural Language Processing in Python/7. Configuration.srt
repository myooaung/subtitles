Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:08,450
This email because we are here for a very quick step which is just to create all the global fireballs.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,850
The configuration of our model so that we can define it later.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,010
So let's do it right now.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:22,740
The first thing that we wanted to define is the size of the vocabulary so we get it by calling took

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:35,550
an idea that's vocab size then we will define the time it is that we want to use for all models so I

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:44,880
picked a limiting dimension of two hundredths the number of filters will be one hundred the number of

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:56,310
units in the feed forward thoughts will be 256 the number of classes we can just get it by calling the

9
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,700
length sets train levels.

10
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:14,180
So then let's define the drop rates all points to and the batch size which we will set to thirty.

11
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:23,480
And finally the number of epochs for our training phase let's say five so those are numbers that I found

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,320
worked quite well achieved good accuracy with them.

13
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,700
These are maybe not the best ones you can actually do a whole optimizing work with that but they work

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,290
pretty well.

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,420
And if you want to play with each other to improve the accuracy even more after training please do that.

16
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,430
So here we are.

17
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,040
And we're ready for our next step which is to finally create the objects and then and trainings.

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,110
So it's using.
