00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.820
In this next year I'm going to show you how you can optimize your description for the search results

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.470
to a description doesn't actually have any SEO impact meaning that Google does not take it into consideration

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.800
when it is deciding how to arrange these web pages in the search results.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.000
However it does have an impact in terms of getting people to click through because I can see the better

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.760
description here underneath the title tag on your l.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.500
So as a user I'm going to have a quick glance at this to see really which is the best page that I can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.100
click on.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.030
That's going to get me the result that I want.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.010
So similar to the title tag it's going to be important to include your keyword in this.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.850
But what's more important is really to show your value proposition.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.760
Great way to do that is really to start with a verb and already tells me is either what I'm going to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.590
get at this page so compare cheap home insurance quotes get six year off and get home insurance quotes

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.870
and protect your home.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.420
These are kind of grace and action based you know calm focus and starts to the mental description that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.930
are attractive for me as a user.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.160
I think it's also important to differentiate yourself here in the mentor description if you're cheap

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.070
or foster whatever you really want to show that here.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.170
So people will click through.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.810
So as well as having an ad focused mentors scription that includes the keyword we want to make sure

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960
it's the right length as well.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.040
Otherwise it's kind of you cut off similar to the title tag.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.980
So you really want to keep it at a hundred and fifty six characters.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.160
Samantha you know the theory.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.580
Let's head over to WordPress and I want to show you a really great plug in to make sure that she got

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.060
this right.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.500
Every time I come over to plug in just type the same hostess go right up.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.700
This is the same plugin that we use to optimize our title tag and really can do both these at the same

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.740
time if you want to optimize title type and description.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.420
Once you got the lowest plug in installed you're going to scroll down to the bottom of the page and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.930
you can see it here.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.120
This is the section where I got my mice to really enter and modify or metor description.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.220
So all we really have to do is pasted in there you can see that I'm using the Zambal that we saw in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.300
the search engines but this is a key question here that you want to be asking yourselves.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.440
How does it compare to the competition and could it be made more appealing.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.860
And you've seen what I've done as I've actually put a verb like I suggested you do at the start of the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.090
description and also some sort of incentive like a free consultation.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.620
So that's what the guys here and they had this at the end.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.650
But I think putting it out at the start is stronger.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.670
And so those are key questions to ask yourself even if they're not using this plug in you still want

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.470
to follow that format.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.370
So if you're using another Web site builder no WordPress it should be fairly simple for you to add a

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.640
minute description.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.760
And if you're coding it in hatred you know you'll be able to add in and demented name talent here as

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.530
well.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.540
And really I mean the minute description that way as well.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.870
So just recap you've learned that the better description doesn't have an impact.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.750
However it does really help it click through rates because the visitors can see them in the search results

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.070
.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.740
So I would encourage you to make them come focus.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.040
Start with a verb include the key word have it the correct length which is 156 characters.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.280
Keep in mind as well as the same as the title tag.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.920
Description is unique for every page.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.330
So you really want to craft a unique one for every page that you're trying to rank for it and the search

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.290
results.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.290
So let's move on now to the next lecture
