00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.840
Great.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.640
So welcome to this lecture where I'm going to show you how you can find out what are the back killings

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.690
that are putting your competitors at the top of the search results so that you can really then replicate

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.450
thereby killings.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.110
And so you can really rank above them and put yourself at the top of the search.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.260
So to keep this process off we want to do is simply type our keyword into Google and this will show

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.390
the top ranking pages and what we really want to do now is find the links that are putting those pages

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.150
to the top of the search results sort of find out the links for each of these different web pages what

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.690
we can use is the Mars Bar Chrome extension.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.220
If you haven't done so already you can type that into Google Chrome if you remember we looked at this

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.650
too before in the keyword research section of the course when we were really trying to assess the key

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.420
word competitiveness.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.490
But now we want to use it again and really look at it in terms of links.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.720
I've already got it installed and you can see I clicked on the button there to make this toolbar appear

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.010
.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.000
And what she can see are the links here under each of the web pages.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920
And this is really what we want to have a look at now.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.530
So here is the top 10 results and we can see all the links for them there.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.210
Let's start looking at the individual links I'm going to skip over Mashable because that's kind of a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880
content news site.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.940
I want to look at a site that's actually selling drones.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.590
And look at the links that they're using to get themselves to the top of the search results.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.800
So when you click on that link then you'll open up what's called the site explore.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.490
And while we really want to do is put in some of these filters in place to make sure that we're only

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.210
looking at links that come from external sources not page not links just from other pages within the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.080
Web site.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.080
And also we don't want to look at just all of the links.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.420
One look at only follow links if you remember from the last section we learn that follow links are the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.120
ones that really have the CEO power.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.570
No follow links such as links that are on social media.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.860
No as CEO powers is passed through them.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.200
So in terms of us here we want to look at only follow links if you want to direct traffic to your site

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.570
.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.090
You could maybe look at all of these links and get the benefit of that.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.700
We have this list of bottlings what we want to do is start having a look at them see the context in

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.250
which these backlogs are being earned.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.870
And ask ourselves really is this something that we could replicate in order to create content or these

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.460
links or cells so let's have a look at this link here.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.870
What you might want to notice before you open the page is the anchor text so he can see that the link

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.200
on this page is contained in the words under $300 for this particular one it'll be my first drone dot

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.060
com.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530
So let's have a look to find these quickly.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.830
Probably the best way is to control F and just type in the text that you see there and you can see that

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.730
this is the link that is contained there.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.790
So this article I guess is a general article that bag drones and some of the risks in terms of you know

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.840
people flying them.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.770
That's quite a topical issue No.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.130
And Bik Let's see this piece of content was referenced in it a citation by clink.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.930
This is the best drones for sale and why that this my first turn has created so potentially this is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.570
a type of piece of content that you could create.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.090
And there's proof that this is getting a lot of bottlings from some big hitters and some big authority

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.010
sites.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.990
So you don't only want to look at the banking profile for one of the search results you want to have

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.180
a look at really all of them.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.870
And so essentially what you do is you moved in the search results page.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.120
We'll take the URL your Parfit into this tool again and you'll go through the same process again then

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.620
looking at how were they earning these links what type of sites are they coming from.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.980
What is the context.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.980
What is the type of content etc. that's going to give you a lot of understanding about the marketplace

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.010
and how these things are really being are and so you can replicate them for yourself.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.850
So just to recap what you've learnt in this lecture is really a process to find the bottlings for all

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.250
of the top ranking sites for your particular keyword.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.320
This is a fantastic place to really start.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.810
Your link building building strategy from because you know what works you know what puts people at the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.420
top of the search results and then you can really once you've analyzed that go off and replicate that

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.210
and soon you'll be at the top of search results as well.
