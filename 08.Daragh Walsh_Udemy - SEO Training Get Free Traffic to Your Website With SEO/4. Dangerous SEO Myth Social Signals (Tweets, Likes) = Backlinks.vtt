Great Swen this is actually want to look at social signals and understand if they're important for as

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.920
CEO and getting us higher in the search engine results.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.170
And in one line social signals are important but they're not important for as CEO they impact as CEO

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.400
and rightly so.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.320
You know what are the social signals that we're talking about.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.480
We've seen that links posted directly on social media or no follow.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.190
So we saw using that to The Last Lecture social shares are also not counted as bottlings.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.590
Now some of the other social signals that come up in the conversation about whether they impact SEO

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.960
or things like the number of shares throughout the world the number of people that like your brand on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.910
Facebook the number of Facebook shares.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.560
Number of Twitter followers.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.210
Number of tweets mentioning your brand including a link to your Web site.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.330
There's a lot of debate in the U.S. here or whether these really impact your rankings in the search

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.220
engines.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.160
Some fairly well-known as heroes have done some experiments to show some results but really the definitive

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.750
answer that came back from two was yes there can be correlation in terms of content.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.370
That's widely shared also rank science search engines but it doesn't mean it's the causation.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.440
So let's look at why it's social is 10 important.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.850
Well number one things build awareness of what you are offering so doesn't matter if there are no fallings

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.310
if when people see them it creates awareness which your business and watch your offerings.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.080
They don't even need to be clicked.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.300
They just need to be seen and they're creating awareness.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.590
Links can also lead to profits so even if there are no follow people that we can become aware.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.290
Click on that link and say go onto the site do free trial and then Altamonte they've purchased your

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.260
products so again that's hugely beneficial.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:12.420
Even though it might not help you rank in the search engine results and also links can create more links

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.460
.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.990
So say for example someone posted something on Twitter and Like a citation.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.300
I go have a look at it.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.880
I think it's a great resource.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.980
I write a blog post about it and I create and do follow link to the resource so that's the way that

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.480
it can indirectly then you know create things that actually do matter for us.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.130
So that's I hope that cleared that for you if you'd if you had any questions about that I want to say

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.270
.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.900
The one exception in terms of social media that actually directly impacts the rankings in the search

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.140
engines is Google Plus some probably won't might not be too surprising since Google Plus is made by

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.780
Google knows that gives them a little bit of an advantage there.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.480
And that's why in the next section we're going to spend one next year looking about in some more detail

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.510
because it's the one thing that really can affect your rankings directly.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.160
So that's quite exciting.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.650
And we're going to look at that more detail Ederle
