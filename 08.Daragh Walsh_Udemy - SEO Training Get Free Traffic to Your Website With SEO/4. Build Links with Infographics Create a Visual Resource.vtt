00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.380
So by now you've got the attention of the key influencers in your age by putting in a bit of ego based

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.770
You may have also then done a bit of research on which are the most popular posts and you want to model

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.530
the success of them.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.590
Now a form of content that you can put out is an info graphic and really what you want to do is create

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.760
a visual resource that people want to link to.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.030
So in this lecture what I want to show you is you know what is an info graphic.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.040
Show me some examples of really good ones and then explain how you get links from infographics.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.890
How do they track links and then finding a way to show you a couple of online tools in order for you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.470
to build your own even for ground graphics so you can attract links to that.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.860
So let's look at a couple of examples of infographics seeking a sense of really how good they are as

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350
a piece of content.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.390
And what I've got here is a post that's actually like a best of list if you remember this is one of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.990
the strategies that you can use to get the attention of the key influencers or just create a piece of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.460
content yourself.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.050
So this guy is basically just compiled a lot of the best him for graphics.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.390
And as you can see this page itself has attracted over 99 links so I mean this is a great example of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.550
the best of strategy.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.510
He hasn't created any of these infographics but he's put them together in a best of list so a great

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.870
example there of the DOT DOT piece of content.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.220
So let's have a look at.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.930
So basically these infographics are just visual representations of information usually quite a lot of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810
information that's hard to understand.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.700
And quickly by reading is an easily understood visually so let's have a look.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.350
So the history of search for example you know this is great just to see all the companies that were

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.120
involved in search engines getting started.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.380
You can see very easily that Google came in quite at least six years after the first search engines

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.780
were there and have really remained the dominant search engine since then.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.910
And let's look here's a good visual guide to CEOs So a lot of the stuff we talk about in the course

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:34.160
here is summed up very quickly in a lot of different and slides here basically and then for graphics

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.630
so social media the history of it here.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.410
Google's long history of forays into social media.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.950
So these are all maybe the things that they've launched that haven't been successful or have been successful

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.310
.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.540
It's just a great visual timeline very easy to consume these pieces of content and much easier than

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.220
just reading.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.190
So what I wanted to show you then is well Heidi you actually get links from something like this so this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.670
is another example of an in graphic.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.760
Pretty huge you here from on bands dot com.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.560
And as you can see at the bottom of the infographics here you can embed this info graphic into your

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.990
site so you can embed this into a page on your site write your own notes about this.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.550
And that came to that as a link back to the site.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.820
And the other way then is just actually people linking to the page that this graphic is zones.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:45.030
You can see that there's over 700 links for this particular page which is a huge amount of links for

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.550
one piece of content obviously they've put a lot of work into this.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.660
But there's great return on this investment.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.390
If you're willing to make it so and let's have a look at how can we make these infographics herself

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.530
.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.410
And so what I'm going to show you here is a couple of online tools that you can use for free.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.470
And essentially they're like drag and drop so they have templates and you can just drop in your images

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.800
drop in your text and create infographics.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.340
Very quickly you can also then generate that embedded code that other people can put into their sites

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.550
so am I.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.760
I think I'll just direct you to maybe watch this video pick churchyard one of my favorite ones is a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.300
very good explanation over how it works.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.380
What Taito chart is a great option.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.320
Another option is visual dot l y and the third option and I'm going to give you is in foreground this

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.360
can be particularly good for charts so it's very quick to get open running on these and create a visual

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.620
resource that's going to attract links from your audience.
