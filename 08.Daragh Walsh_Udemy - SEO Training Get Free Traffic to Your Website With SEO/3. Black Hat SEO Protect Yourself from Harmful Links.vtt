00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.590
So in the last lecture we talked about the best ways to buildings for your site but there is another

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.380
way and it's actually paying for the links.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.380
So I just wanted to call this head separately on a next share and discuss a little bit because it may

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.680
be something that you've seen or heard about.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.130
So let's explain that more about this painfully Lincs really comes under the heading of black hat as

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.230
CEO and black hat is a reference to the old cowboy movies where the bad guy wore the black hat so you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.810
probably get a sense that this is something a little bit risky.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.840
That's not playing by the rules exactly am.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.810
So let's talk about pain feelings a little bit more.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.170
The first thing to note is US generally when you're paying for links you can go on to freelancing side

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.870
you're paying me five or ten dollars.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.110
And really what those people are doing are creating links generally to things like blog comments forum

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.460
signatures pure directories user profiles and other types of directories.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.740
Now the thing is that generally these links offer the lowest amount of value that's the lowest amount

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.310
of power in these links because they're unlikely to come from authority sites and they're unlikely to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.530
come from sites that are within your niche.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.660
If you remember those were the characteristics of some of the powerful backings.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.440
So the other very important thing to consider and this is really where the risk comes in is the recent

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.010
updates to Google's algorithm means that a site can be penalized or suppressed if they have engaged

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.510
in manipulative link building.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:52.080
So this is a relatively new addition to those of the rhythm that they will actually negatively affect

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.490
your your chances of ranking in search engines if they determine that she's trying to manipulate the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.110
building.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.380
So that's really the main risk by this method.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.100
And what I thought would be interesting is to maybe show you an example of where things can go wrong

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.600
and I had a client that had Bosch a link building package from one of these freelancing sites and I'm

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.520
going to show you that it's very obvious to anybody that this is very manipulative looks very unnatural

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.750
.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.240
So let's have a look at us.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.740
Great.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.630
So this is the client that I was saying that had bought the boxings package and this is just a screen

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.440
shot because I didn't want to kind of show.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.570
And it was.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.670
But essentially this is a I've used a bottlings checker tool.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.590
It's called a page A.H. rest site explore.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.180
We're going to look at this how to check packings profile a bit more in more detail and a further lecture

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.230
.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.310
But really important point here is that you can see that this looks very natural they've almost no Millings

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.320
been a huge surge in a very short space of time.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.880
And then a lot of them have dropped off as well.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.720
So you can see that a lot of it do follow links.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.110
These are the blue blue ones the new links were then subsequently lost.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.550
And so it looks very unnatural.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.830
And if we can see it's Wamsley like this in a backings checker too you can be sure that Google picked

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.940
up on this as well.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.980
So another interesting point is when I did a poll the CEO report for these guys I saw that the top five

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.850
keywords on their site were Viagra Cialis Levitra.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.190
These are all types of Troggs I think.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.030
So obviously what happened is when the person who bought when the the guy who runs the site he handed

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.760
over the log in details to the the bottlings sky what the guy actually did was then put and put a load

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.160
of links on this guy's site pointing to all these other sites about five Agric cetra So the double whammy

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.720
of confusing Google in terms of SEO on page optimization of washer's site is right because they have

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.700
all these new keywords in there plus as well.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.180
The bad reputation that looks all these spammy sites pointing to you now.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:31.710
So the question is then how to get rid of these and links that are pointing you from behind the Internet

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.940
.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.220
In short it's a difficult and slow process.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.620
You can use what's called the Google disavowal tool which is in the Google webmaster's tool.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.410
And we basically say to Google these are all the links I want you to ignore them please because these

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.280
are spammy etc. but if you really want to be sure the only way to remove them is to actually do manual

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.270
I reach an e-mail to people where the sites you have these site links pointing back to you and ask them

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.180
to do news.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.960
And so again a very tedious process.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.860
And I can take a lot of time.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.160
So in short what I'm saying is that it's messy to clean up.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.920
It's risky from a search engine perspective.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.020
I'm not saying the findings can work.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.020
I think it can answer concerts and sounds is only showing you this kind of worst case scenario.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.150
Walk in happen
