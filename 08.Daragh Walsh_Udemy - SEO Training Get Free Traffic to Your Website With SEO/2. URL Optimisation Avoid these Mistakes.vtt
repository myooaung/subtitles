00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.890
So the first part of on page optimization of we want to look at is your optimization and really I guess

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:14.430
the the message here is that search engines treat you whereas the way that real humans.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.210
So essentially you want to make them readable you want to make them rich and you want to make them short

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.760
.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.040
So as I said you want to make them readable so you want to avoid something like your domain account

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.980
for Slash p equals 2:59.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.750
Neither the search engines or a real human can really understand what your page is is about if you're

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.010
URL is like that's what you really want to have is.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.550
It may not come forward slash no whatever keyword you targeting for that particular page.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.100
You know what you want to avoid is something that's you know you maybe have your key word there but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.750
you include the full post title in the OR L itself.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.940
It's just a little bit too long.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:10.060
Plus the search engines only would really look at the first three to five words in the aura.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.530
Just another thing to avoid as well as make sure that your you are L's and the words that are in the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.810
whereas separated using hyphens.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.380
So as you can see here a keyword hyphen retarget hyphen keyword hyphen that's the form much you want

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.470
.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.160
You don't want to have your L's and with underscores show you an example of how you can add it to where

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.220
you are l.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.220
And I'm just going to do this in the Ogmund panel of them a word press size.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.230
Essentially you're going to Meum to make these same changes in whatever web site builder you're using

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.950
.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.480
But let's say my title of the article I want to publish here is about your optimization as you can see

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.180
by the fold it's pulled the or else from the end the post title.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.980
SEE can see that there's hyphens separating the words which is great.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.270
It's got my key word at the start of the.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.450
You were out as well which is perfect.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.030
And if I want as well you know I can shorten it then and for quite a long post title just into the core

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.180
keyword itself that makes it a little bit easier.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.900
You know if you're posting it across social networks want people to link to us and they won't have to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.070
shorten your you were using to like piddly etc. so that can be a good thing to do as well.
