00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.540
Grade so in this lecture What do you want to have a look at it is do follow links versus no follow links

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:06.600
.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.910
We want to understand what they are and what's the difference between them on which one is the one that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.250
actually gives power to our SEO efforts and which is going to get us to the top of the search results

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.910
so we're going to start with a little bit of TV then we're going to move into some real examples.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.920
I think this is great to do it now.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.050
Before before we start talking about specific think attraction or link building strategies.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.870
And also if you have any doubt whatsoever about what actually is and think when we go into the real

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.450
examples I think that's really going to care.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.420
OK so just to recap a little bit.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.430
We know that search engines see a link as a sort of vote a conference by either that were in authority

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100
on a particular topic.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.130
So we have a lot of sites from around the internet pointing to our page or this particular topic the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.120
search engines pick up on that and say Wow we must be great if everybody's linking to us.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.720
And as a result they put it in front of their user who's searching for it in Google.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
So by default all links are to follow.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.530
This means that the vote is passed through the link.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.270
The authority is really passed through the link.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.700
However Google developed what's called no follow the link attribution reading with the purpose of tackling

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.660
spam.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.090
So no follow links do not pass a vote through that link.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.000
And here's an example of what that actually looks like.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.920
This is the hate mail code.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.370
So as you can see this is the actual link here in the dot com.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.840
And you can see relationship no follow so no vote will be passed through.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.360
No authority will be passed through and through this link.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.780
If I say publish that on my page on this would be the context this is what I would see on my page.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.640
OK so you know a lot of sites by default are no follow because they want to reduce bombs to sites like

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.100
Wikipedia and many blog comment boxes.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.610
Most of the social networks by default they have no follow links.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.110
And again that's really to prevent spam spamming.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.590
Imagine if all the social networks had to follow links.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.700
By default everyone would be everybody would just be going to Twitter going to Facebook going to read

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.670
it and just posting loads and loads of links back to their site.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.040
But of course there's no sense in that so they made up this rule the no follow on that really takes

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000
away all of that activity.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.780
Great.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.570
So to bring it to life really let's look at a couple of real examples.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.590
Here's a blog that you may be familiar with.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.290
It's a guy called Tim Ferriss it's the four hour workweek.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.310
He wrote a very famous book Brazee you can see he's got a new article published today.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:16.740
And in the article we can see about do follow and no follow links so for example we can see a photo

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.670
credit here on linked off to serendipity.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.520
So watch you can actually do is go to View.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.110
This is on chrome what you can do on their browsers as well as an option for a senior developer.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.520
You can go use source and so you watch you can see in here is the actual page DML code of this particular

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.070
page so if we search for let's see serendipity.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.400
OK.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.950
So this is the photo credit that we saw here and while we really want to see here is if this is if do

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.170
follow link or no follow link.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.340
So while we can see is here's the actual link.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.520
This is the anchor text and we can see on the page when we can see that God is just a normal link.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.940
There is no and no follow put in there.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.810
So that's that's going to pass through the vote to her flicker page.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.960
A bit of authority from a high authority site here and very popular blogs so good.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.690
Well done to serendipity there.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.280
Now let's have a look at some of the comments then.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.950
So let's have a look if these are no follow links or do follow link.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.190
So let's just type in Jeff.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.840
Yes

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.570
sir.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.380
Jeffrey S. Here we go.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:55.380
So Jeffrey asss made a comment and really this is what this is is a link back to his Gravatar profile

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.770
.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.720
And so as we can see here it's external No follows So as you can see if you were to make a lot of blog

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.480
comments there on this site you wouldn't be getting votes back to your site.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.530
Even though there is actually a link there.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.880
Great.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.550
So he should be looking at the source code how we can find out if the link is to follow or no follow

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.850
.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.660
But really is a quicker way to do this.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.960
We don't have to do it manually every time.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:34.160
What we can do is if you type into Google no follow Chrome extension and you can get basically an extension

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:41.490
that's going to show you very quickly whether we link on the page is follow or no follow up.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.680
So you can out of there.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.090
I've already added it in when it went out today and you'll see in it a link symbol here.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.310
And so to enable it and disable it you can just click it.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.940
So this is a much faster way you can see now on Wikipedia for example that these links off the page

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.520
are all no follow if they're red.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.940
There are no follow on if they just stay normal and they are followed.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.900
So as you can see all of those you know follow Twitter as well as you can see the links that people

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.070
tweet as are all know follow as well.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:21.370
Facebook as well as the links here are no follow what Samangan grade.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.600
So summing up really do follow links are the ones which are the most harware for us SEO.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.530
And so you can use this chromis extension that I showed you when you're link prospecting to have a look

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.130
at the sites that you think could be potentially good sites and see if they alone do follow links.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.580
And just to have a bit of analysis to determine what is their current policies and that would help to

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.460
determine then which might be the best sites for you to target in terms of building links from
