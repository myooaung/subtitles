00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.910
So the first step in our keyword research is really to do some keyword brainstorming.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.640
And in this lecture I want to give you a process to do that using three different tools.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.260
By the end of this lecture then you will have an excel sheet full of about 50 to 75 key words which

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.470
then in the next lecture we're going to bring into the Google Keyword planner to narrow that stand by

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.610
really checking the monthly search volumes.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.010
But for now we want to get as many ideas as we can because if we want to find a low competition keywords

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.670
we've got to find keywords.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.240
Maybe our competition aren't targeting.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.490
And so that is the objective of this election.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.610
So there are many many different tools that you could use for keyword brainstorming but I've selected

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.290
three in particular.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.680
Firstly because they're all free and secondly because each two will help us think in a different way

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.410
and that means that we will have the greatest list at the end of this process.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.770
The most diverse and broad range of terms that we can.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.960
So the first two we're going to look at using Wikipedia you're probably already very familiar with this

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.100
.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.440
But in terms of SE1 key we're brainstorming a great thing about it is that there's a lot of linking

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.310
between the pages and that can help us find closely related terms.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.740
Secondly we're going to look at red dot com for an unfamiliar readed It's a Web site where people post

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.860
links and have discussions usually a very passionate group of people and they have very specific conversations

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.190
there so there can be some really high value keywords that we want to look at and pull out of there

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.660
.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.550
So the final tool in our keyword brainstorming session is called suggest dot org.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.270
And what this tool is going to help us to is really find longtail keywords what I mean by that is key

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.390
words that contain two or three words.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.690
So for example with this tool you'll pop in say drones and it'll spit out hundreds of suggestions of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.540
longer tail keywords like drones cameras drones that follow you drones for sale.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.270
And often these key words the longer tail keywords are less competitive and that's why we want to use

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.290
this tool as well.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.050
So those are the three tools we're going to be looking at.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.370
So let's get straight into it.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.710
So first let's head over to Wikipedia dot org.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.420
We're going to try and think laterally here and find synonyms for a keyword example drums.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.930
OK remote controlled pilotless aircraft unmanned aerial vehicle unmanned combat aerial vehicle quad

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.120
copter quad rotor helicopter.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.760
So these are all I mean good ones and as you can see they are all in call to other pages which probably

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.010
have a rotorcraft fixed wing aircraft rotors tail rotors.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.210
I mean there's just this UAV.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.070
There's a whole sort of key words there that seem very very interesting.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.730
So next we want to go over to Ratatat come on and try and find some.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.650
So Brad it's root by drones.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.950
So here's something that looks interesting.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.120
As you can see there is different so Brad it's so DIY Drones is one UAV drones is another multi copter

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.120
drone that's just have a look in this on DIY Drones.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.610
So what you'll see here is probably a lot of hard core people talking about drones.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.250
And that's the general consensus so this looks H.K. this is some type of product or product.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.830
Harsh

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.180
quadcopter part lists that could be that could be interesting.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.710
People talking about the different parts selling arms and parts and quad parts drone versus or Halles

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.840
.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.900
Is you know another key word as well.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.560
Specific questions as well that people are talking many refuting blog posts.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.240
And if these are popular you can see how many people are talking about them.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.060
So really there's a lot of stuff in there.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.220
But you can really just explore and see what it looks interesting and put you back to your own spreadsheet

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.450
.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.850
So the final way we're going to get hundreds of potential keywords is to use this tool called it was

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.990
suggested to work again it's free and all you have to do is type in your keyword right here.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.750
So I've already typed in drones and as you can see they've given me 370 suggestions.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.860
This is very similar to when you type into Google.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.780
It gives you some suggestions here but there's only about 10 or so.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.980
So this tool really gives you much more suggested keywords.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.940
And so what you can do is ignore them through the lists.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.650
And so you can kind of to a clipboard.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.240
The key words that you think are relevant and that are good so for example drones for sale drones camera

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.400
that's relevant to fun.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.650
Tryna sell drones drones White has it's more of a news story.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.570
It's not a keyword that somebody would type in who wouldn't necessarily want to buy a drone.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.110
It's more something just news related.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.950
So let's keep moving now and you can see they have the key word plus another word starting with the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.580
letter A.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.380
Here drone aerial photography that's quite interesting.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.340
Drone attacks OK in transit zone.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.100
Yes those are interesting grounds passed by drone battery life.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.990
Quite interesting there could be an article of someone looking to buy a drone etc. so you click the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.130
ones that you like and then you can just copy and paste these back into your cell.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.600
So just to recap on this lecture the purpose of it was to really build a list of potential key words

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.990
.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.120
The reason that we wanted to do a bit of research and think outside the box think laterally going deep

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.810
and finding longer tail keywords is because the most obvious key words are going to be extremely competitive

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.080
.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.400
It's unlikely that you're going to get to the top of the search results and get the traffic for those

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.180
key words.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.650
So that's why you have to do a little bit of digging and find keywords that maybe your competitors have

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.510
overlooked.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.450
So now that you put the key words that you find from these three resources into an Excel walk we're

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.970
going to do in the next is really make a data driven decision and find which of those key words actually

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.930
gets the most searches.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.630
And then we can start to narrow down the list.
