00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.100
In this lecture I want to give you an overview of SEO for local businesses and really explain why as

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.790
CEO for local businesses is different than it is to normal Web sites online.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.710
So Google displays the search results for local businesses differently for a couple of simple key reasons

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.990
and the first of those being is is the restaurant is a local business really close to where I am.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.800
They really want to only display most relevant search results and a key factor in our relevancy is proximity

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.050
is it actually close to where I'm searching from.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.020
If not you know I'm not going to be interested in it so Googling away to identify location of local

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.950
businesses very easily and a way to systematize that so then they can display the search results as

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.440
accurately as possible.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.690
So as well as location and other key consideration is is the information mobile friendly.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.160
A lot of people who are making searches for local businesses are doing so on their mobiles and already

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.830
we know that searches performed on mobiles have surpassed us top.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.560
So they need a way in order to get all the most important information.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.560
Categorize it an easy display is on mobile devices.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.790
So the way that Google has solved that problem and really get the location of the all of the local business

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.790
categorize and also make sure its mobile friendly is to create what they've called the Google local

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.620
park.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.960
And what you can see here is is the local pocket's displayed at the top of the search results.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.620
When I type in a keyword like this and you can see these three different results on how businesses really

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.540
sign up and get shown in this Google local park because firstly by creating a google my business account

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.630
and then really by building up reviews.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.200
So we talked about earlier in the course of the two steps for us SEO optimization and authority.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.390
Those are still the two steps to a.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.300
The difference being for local businesses that you build authority by really getting more reviews instead

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.920
of backings.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.650
Bottlings have less importance.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.960
What is really important is to build up reviews and that is the way you build authority for your business

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.010
locally and the way that you are going to rise and be displayed in his Google local park for a particular

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.020
keyword.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.490
So as well as ranking for a keyword using the google my business profile its very important that she

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.400
ran for your brand name as well so you can see are typed in here a name of in the burger restaurants

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.370
who are looking at and you can see that they've done very well to dominate the search results for their

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.000
brand name.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.130
So they've got their Web site here.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.630
They've got to google my business profile here as well displayed in the sidebar.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.940
They've also got their Facebook Yelp and Trip Advisor profiles all set up.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.990
So it's important not only to optimize your web site and your google my business profile but also build

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.370
these profiles on these or their local business directories and also build up reviews on those as well

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.880
.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.580
Each Facebook Yelp TripAdvisor etc. they all have slightly different markets.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.040
People come to those platforms to do slightly different things.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.300
And so it's important that you set up all of those and build reviews on all of those to help generate

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.540
more exposure and traffic and sales for your local business.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.310
So that's an overview of SEO for local businesses.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.660
Again the key takeaways are that mobile friendliness on your Web site is of extreme importance and also

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.070
that you need to set up these local business profiles and build up reviews on those profiles.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.780
That's how you really build that already.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.320
Instead of links links are still important.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.770
But really reviews on the local business profiles are more important if you want to learn more about

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.570
local SEO I've got a course on that which includes a 14 point checklist to make sure you really optimize

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.180
your local business for the search results.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.860

OK so I hope you enjoy that lecture and let's get on to the next one.
