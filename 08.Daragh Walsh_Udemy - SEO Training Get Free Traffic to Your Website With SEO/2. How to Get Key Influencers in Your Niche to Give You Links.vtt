00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.590
Grade in this lecture you want to look at creating ego base and getting the attention of key influencers

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.640
in your needs.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.880
This is another strategy.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.480
In order to get more links pointing back to your site from authority figures within your needs which

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.260
is exactly the type of powerful links that we want to go after so you may have noticed in the competitor

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.430
and back link analysis that you saw individual links coming from a couple of different Kiem influencers

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.630
and you want to replicate that.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.790
Well I'm going to give you a way to really replicate that quite quickly otherwise.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.910
If you notice during your competitors Pocklington there seem to be an absence of thought.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.260
This is a strategy that is going to be able to put you above them and get to the top of the search engine

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.870
results.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.500
So what we've said before is that naturally get traction is really the best way to build links and building

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
something that's genuinely genuinely worth linking to.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.350
Whether it's your products services content or the opinions you're sharing with your industry the problem

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.290
is that it can be difficult to create awareness about the great things that you've created.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.280
And it's not enough just to push it out on social channels especially if you've got small social media

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.230
profiles.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.470
It's going to be very hard to create a lot of links and if even if you produce a great piece of content

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.650
because people are just not going to be aware of it then they can link to it.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:46.310
So the way to really amplify the awareness is to get strategic and get the key influencers in YOUR needs

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.270
to put the content in front of their users.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:59.390
And that's really going to just hugely accelerate your process in terms of getting things because he

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.660
had they were going to put it in front of a lot of people that are in your knees that are interested

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.160
in what you're talking about.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.080
True.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.160
So the way that you need to do this is to what launched what they call ego bait that makes those key

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.210
influencers look good.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.870
And so that's content.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.390
Ego is concept's really made and designed to flattering to to get the attention of a specific he's his

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.470
while also providing utility to their audience so people on social media and in blogs like to share

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.400
things that make them look good.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.980
So if you can create a piece of content like Dash that can really help flatter your audience you can

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.310
be sure that they're going to pass it on to their audience to make of self good look not good.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.500
But in the meantime that's going to open up the door for you for you to truckling sat truck traffic

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.850
.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.910
And to your senses is a really smart strategy.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.030
What I want to look at and there was a couple of examples of what does the type of ego bait that she

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.230
creates.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.600
So we got best of lists.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.310
I mean you probably seen this all the time on the Internet.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.870
You can create a list of the greatest content or writers or teams in your space and that lazy to really

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.830
include and and you know give a holistic picture of the space.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.500
So the second idea for creating the two ego betas to have an interview with a top leader or leaders

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.250
over the phone using Google Voice or or or whatever and you can really put that content down on the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.570
cheap.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.110
But obviously if you want to attract things to your site what you can do is take that video put it in

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.630
a blog post but also lay out the key points for people.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.570
So it's a half an hour video an hour long video.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.960
You know people don't maybe want to read watch the whole train without knowing really what first about

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.820
and so what you can do is put a screen transcript and summarize the key points put in the link somewhere

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.760
may be referenced within the video.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.670
The tools the strategies et cetera and they've got a piece of content there that's that people will

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.260
want to link to the to the actual post on your Web site rather than just the video.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.390
I mean this can be one person it can be a couple of different people but you can just combine this and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.380
create a session.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.960
And again it's very quick to create to start content includes a lot of key influencers.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.250
So another great idea.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.590
So that is another way today is similar to an interview with a lot of people is due to crowdsourced

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.780
hosts so you can reach the influences asked them what it takes by certain current events.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.710
Maybe something that's creating a lot of noise and it really needs some clarity from a couple of different

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.180
opinions.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.150
And then by rushing in and asking them they can feel important to listen to their voice and opinion

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.700
heard.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.930
They don't have to write a full host themselves and maybe do all the research on their own.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.140
They can be combined as in.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.840
And again not something you can publish on your site.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.200
They're going to want to link to it because that looks good for them.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.830
And there's a good easy piece of content for them to share around their audiences.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.320
So finally there's an awards or bodges And really what you can do here is create a and awards in your

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:42.600
space and you can send the people they want to link to you a kind of a badge and that they can put on

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.150
their site.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:50.570
That's maybe a small piece of a code and it makes them look like they're the number one and social media

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.110
influencer in golf say in a particular country or worldwide or whatever.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.740
You know obviously doubt they're going to want to put that on their side because it makes them look

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.370
good to their audience gives more credibility etcetera.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.470
And so you go that's for very simple ways I think anybody could do this for any industry.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.110
And so it's really going to help to get the attention of Team parents who get links back from them also

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.940
creates opportunities for their audience then to King as well.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:34.680
So just to give you an example of eco bait and how effective it can be to attracting size I just typed

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.930
in here top 10 cooking blogs.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.780
So this is the kind of best of list.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.630
Also a cross between maybe the awards on as well so as you can see let's just have a look 10 13 cars

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:55.500
and the things Kirti to those links from the same web site and Huffington Post 24 links OK 49 links

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.140
still pretty good.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.380
Two cars and nine hundred ninety nine and thirty six.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.090
Great.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.140
So let's have a look.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.170
Then when we were there

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.590
.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.220
So what we've got here

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:27.980
is OK best food blog awards and you can see they basically become the authority on this.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:35.680
And they've got different categories best cooking blog baking blog Cocteau and love your blog.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.350
So they've got huge image categories there.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.450
Let's have a look at some of the links.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.610
So this is probably one of the winners.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.160
Love and demans food blog about healthy simple and seasonal recipes.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.540
And so you can see they're probably one of the winners.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:04.190
They're linking back to that which is exactly the idea that they want so a lot of links from 180 to

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.790
main's.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.560
That's probably the more important figure there to look at.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:18.210
But again just very effective food created these are food related blogs with a decent amount of authority

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.020
.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.200
All tangs to creating some good ego bait so I hope that really highlights how powerful this strategy

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.220
can be.
