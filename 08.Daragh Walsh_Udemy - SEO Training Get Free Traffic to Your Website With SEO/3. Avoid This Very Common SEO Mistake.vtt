There's one important Nescio concept I see a lot of students making mistakes.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.470
And so I just wanted to make this lecture to clarify it for you in case you're not aware of it and it's

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.680
really the difference between Web sites and web pages and the difference for SEO.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.040
See a lot of students will say or just want to get my size to number one in Google but actually Google

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.870
in the search results doesn't list the most relevant web sites.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.500
It actually lists the most relevant web pages.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.010
For example if I search for digital cameras in Google the first search result that comes up is that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.200
digital cameras page on the Best Buy web site.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.250
The reason Google displays this is obviously it helps me get the information that I want faster.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:57.000
So the point that I'm making is that when we learn about keyword research content optimization and building

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.630
authority and links around our content you need to think about it as on an individual page basis.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.300
The three steps you'll have to do for each page you want to rank for you won't want to rank for every

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.420
single page on your Web site is your contact us page or about us page.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.950
You wouldn't expect to rank for those but for the pages you're trying to rank for.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.390
You really need to engage all of these trat three steps on an individual page basis.
