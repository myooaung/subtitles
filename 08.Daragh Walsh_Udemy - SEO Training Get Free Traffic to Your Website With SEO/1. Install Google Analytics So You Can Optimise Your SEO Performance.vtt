00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.240
See you're very welcome to this lecture where I'm going to show you how to install Google Analytics

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
for both Wordpress and non WordPress site.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.850
Most are going to show you how to enable a very important report inside of Google Analytics and then

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.240
finally I'm going to give you a high level overview of how you can use Google Analytics to grow your

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.200
business and direct you to a research resource.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.050
You really want to learn more about that.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.310
So the first step to install Google Analytics is really to come over to Google dot com forward slash

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.230
analytics and click sign.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
So once you log in you can come across to our I mean you can see I've got a number of properties here

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.170
already.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.360
But I want to create a new property get a tracking ID for this and this is a Web site that I'm setting

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
up I'm going to set it up for the same site.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.110
We've been showing in our examples as well.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.300
While as the Web site you were all going to pick arland time based on the country and the time zones

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.420
like that there category we're going to select jobs and education.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.320
I'm going to click and get tracking ID so that we have our tracking ID for a non WordPress site.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.910
Really what you want to do is take this hate's Tim script and paste copy and paste this code into every

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.830
page that you want to track and you really want to put that in the heading section of the page for a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.520
WordPress site what you want to do is head over to WordPress log in and download a plugin called Google

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.280
Analytics by iOS going to search in the search bar to find out.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.480
You can see that I've already gotten installed there and then also that over a million sites have already

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.520
installed this.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.320
See now that you can trust this.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.760
And once it's installed you will see a little an icon here appear.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.290
You really want to come up into the dashboard then and you really want to authenticate your Google profile

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.310
.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.590
Here you can authenticate it which Google I can't just click live and really what you do is paste this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.060
code back into the plugin.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.290
So say that an authentication code.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:33.030
Now I really want to save changes then so now we want to come back over to Google Analytics and make

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460
sure that that's worked.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.870
It's now you see in your property section property that you have just added.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.540
Now I want to show you how to enable a very important report.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.550
That doesn't automatically enable c come across to property settings and you really want to enable demographic

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.720
and interest reports that allows you to collect information on the age gender and interests of the visitors

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.470
not visit your web sites.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.940
And I can be really good information if you want to say how that targeted advertising on Facebook etc.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.160
.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.800
And if you want to find out maybe what else your visitors are interested so then you can develop products

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.900
and offer them products on that as well.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.000
So very important to enable that and then click safe.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.360
So finally if you or your clients want to learn more about how to use the data in Google Analytics and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.640
really turn it into actionable insights to grow your business I recommend you have a look at mine Google

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.220
Analytics course and some of the things that you can use Google Analytics for and what you'll learn

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.460
in the course if you take it is having a look at all of your traffic searches so not only the search

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.410
engines and the results from SEO but social media email marketing paid advertising etc. you can really

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.870
look at all of those see what you're working and which ones you should really double down and focus

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.530
on.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.780
You can check things like your best and worst performing content so you can optimize it and make more

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.210
of it to get more traffic to the site.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.730
You can you also look at geolocation to really identify your primary markets and uncover new ones and

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.790
you can also use it to find other technical areas like you know one of the browsers that people are

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.060
coming into this site on.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.440
Is it really on mobile or desktop et cetera.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.560
So of course if you want to learn more or at the very least if your client asks about it you can refer

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.660
them to this course.
