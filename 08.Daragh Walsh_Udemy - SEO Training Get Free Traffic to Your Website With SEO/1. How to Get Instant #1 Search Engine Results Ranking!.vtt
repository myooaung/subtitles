00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.540
So congratulations on reaching the end of the course I really want to thank you for your attention and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.680
I hope that this course has helped you better understand search engine optimization and in particular

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.940
that you know how to find the right keywords for your site head to optimize random and also learn some

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.710
strategies for creating content that's going to attract links from here toward these sites within your

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.780
niche.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.340
So if you have found the Course helpful and you've learnt a lot I'd really appreciate if you could give

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.550
me a rating and a comment here on me.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.690
Of course if you've any questions or suggestions about how I can improve the course you can under discussion

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.900
.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.120
I'm in the discussion forums almost every day.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.610
So my final piece of advice would be that if you still find all of these SEO technicalities too much

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.870
you can just by chance if you want to get instantly to the top of the search engine results Google and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.750
the other search engines will be delighted to promote your site and feature you in the sponsored area

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.460
on the search engine results page.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.480
Just remember that you're going to have to place your ads around certain keywords so perhaps review

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.290
the keywords section of the site.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.380
So that's really a guide.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.450
Don't forget to ask questions and writer reviews.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.900
Thanks again for your attention.
