00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.750
You're very welcome to this.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.800
Of course we're all going to demystify this soft and intimidating topic and show how you can profit

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.900
from this.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.110
Now I know you're here to learn so let's get straight into it.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.840
As CEO is so exciting and everybody wants to learn about it because it's one of the most cost effective

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.670
marketing strategies out there.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.930
It's really cost effective because of its in-band nature.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.690
If I type something like best desktop microphone into Google I'm actively searching for the best desktop

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.790
microphone and that's probably a good chance that I'm going to buy one.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.190
So the first result in Google here is going to get 33 percent of the visitors who search for that term

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.770
so that's a lot of traffic that Google is delivering to this Web site 24/7 365.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.140
And as you can see here they have quite a good article on the five best desktop microphones but you'll

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.220
also see that they have an affiliate link to Amazon.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.990
So everybody who makes this purchase one of these microphones through this article Lifehacker will receive

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:21.090
an affiliate commission so Google is effectively acting like a sales person for them.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.270
And so that's really the huge benefit of SEO it's targeted it's automated and it's in-band in nature

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.010
in this course.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.490
I really want to teach you how you can get to the top spot so you can enjoy the benefits of SEO on the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.480
first step in that process is really doing some keyword research.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.960
You want to understand what your customers are searching for online and you also want to make a data

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.330
driven decision then about which keywords you want to focus on.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.460
And then the keyword research section of course I'm going to show you all the steps to finding the most

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.980
profitable keywords for your business.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.970
The second step in as CEO is really optimizing your content around those key words.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.580
It's absolutely no coincidence that the first result here in Google is really optimized around the key

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.810
word you can see here what I've typed in best does top my phone home it almost matches exactly the title

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.370
of this article here.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.590
Best desktop microphones sold so in the war L and it's also in the content of the page as well.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.740
So I'm going to show you exactly how to do all of this stuff in the On page optimization section of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.190
this course of course optimizing your content around the keyword might not be enough to get you to the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.140
top of the search results.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.350
The next step and the final step is really building authority around your content.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.350
If Google is going to be your sales guy they want to make sure that your content is good and the way

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.590
that they determine that is through links.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.910
So here's an example of a link to that life hacker article.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.860
This is somebody else's blog.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.790
He talks about a different topic but at the end in terms of equipment he links off to the Life Hacker

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.320
article as a kind of endorsement to say hey guys check this out.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.610
This is a good list.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.970
So Google takes note of these links and goes Well if this guy plus you know 50 other guys have linked

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.160
to it it must be good.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.800
And as a result they'll rank you a lot higher in the search results.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.900
So building links is important.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.640
And I'm going to show you how to do that in the link building part of this course.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.160
So I hope that example helped bring a CEO to life for you.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.800
You're clear on what the benefits are now and you're clear on the basic three steps.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.820
The next lecture I think you're going to enjoy as well I'm going to reveal all of the tools that you're

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.570
