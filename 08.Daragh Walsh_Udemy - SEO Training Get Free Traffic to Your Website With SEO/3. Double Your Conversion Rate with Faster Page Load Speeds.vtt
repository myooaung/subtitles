Page load speed is a very important factor for conversion and SEO.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.870
And in this lecture I'm going to show you how you can use a free test to see how fast your pages are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.090
loading and then also get specific instructions on how to increase the load speed of your pages.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.810
All of this is going to be for free and it comes from the most reliable source for SEO Google themselves

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.380
.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.830
So if you're not sure what page loads is it's really how fast it takes your page to load up after I

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.010
click on it from the search results.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.460
So you can see for example there that was very very quick.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.490
And the reason that this is so important as shown in this article here is that even a 2 second improvement

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.880
in page load speeds can increase your conversions more than double.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.620
So 100 percent increase just for two second improvement so that is absolutely massive.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.100
So it really helps increase conversions but also it's important for us.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.810
You know Google obviously is running these tests anyway.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.620
And if they see that your page load speed is very slow they're going to push you down the search results

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.770
because obviously they want to present the best information for their searchers.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810
And if it's slow it's it's not a good service.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.850
So those are the two reasons fire is very important for us.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.940
You know you appear higher in search results if your page is less fast and also you get more conversions

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.400
.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.020
Definitely worth while taking this test and taking any actions that you need to to increase your page

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.880
load speed.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.580
So that's why it's important.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330
Now I'm going to show you how it works.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670
So performing the test is pretty simple.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.280
I'm just going to take randomly or L here and you just popped into this tool.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.460
Then what Google is going to do is analyze the page and give suggestions to make that page load faster

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.900
.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.660
So here we go we've got our page speed on both mobile and just hit the top 20 percent.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.270
You can see is highlighted in red and really want to getting this up to 80 out of 100 or above model

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.060
then changed to green.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.130
What is great about this as well is that Google has prioritized these fixes for us.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.070
You can see now in red here they should fix these.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.910
Maybe consider fixing.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.200
But really these are the priorities for you to address.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500
If they do come up.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.450
So just to recap then in this like she learned the importance of ensuring that our page speeds flowed

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.820
fast for both CEO and user experience reasons.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.650

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.020
