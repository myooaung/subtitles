WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.040
Send and that we've covered on page optimisation we want to move on and focus on off page optimization

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.000
and in particular building power for bad things for your size.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.770
So if you remember in a previous lecture I explained on Google sees a link to your size as a sort of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.070
vote of confidence of a vote of confidence that your content is great that you are an authority on a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.770
particular subject that you are a trusted entity in this space.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.000
And really it's it Google takes all those things they look at them and they say well if everybody's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.600
linking to them they must be great.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.130
And as a result they run to you a lot higher in the search engine results what's crucial to remember

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.240
is that not all bottlings are created equal and because we want to really focus on the most powerful

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.780
quality by killings in this lecture I wanted to talk a little bit about the types of things that really

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.970
matter and at a high level water the strategies that you can use to get these.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.180
So now let's talk about the characteristics of powerful babblings.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.430
And these are the things that really matter.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.870
So the first characteristic is that the link comes from web pages that are relevant to your needs.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.180
So Google is pretty smart or don't understand the content of a web page and a Web site.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.170
What it's advised and what they really like to see is links from web pages that are rather than tyrannise

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.410
.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.460
So let's say for example you have a site that's about drones and you get a link from a site that spied

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.960
something completely different like babies or cars.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.050
Well Google is not going to give that as much importance as if a link from another site that's related

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310
to drones and be in the same area as you.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.120
Because obviously this site that's about drones is a better authority on determining if your content

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.100
is good if it's relevant if it's better than anything else.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.990
And that's why they give more ways to a link from a relevant page to the one to the new century.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.640
So the second characteristic of a powerful bicycling is one that comes from a ranking web page.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.380
Obviously a vote that comes from somebody who's already got a lot of authority is a great indication

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.820
that your content is crude and this is why it's so important to try and target web pages that have a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280
tortie that are in Aneesh and Gatlings from them.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.760
And a third characteristic of a caricature by a claim because one uses in context effectively so is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.400
spoken about an angry text before really that's just the text God.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.740
The hyperlink is contained within.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.420
So here's an example I've got click here.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.890
That's the anchor text.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890
And then I've just got Google doc harmless link in there Sereny.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.800
The reason that I'm context is so important is because Google sees this as an indication of watch your

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.120
site is really about.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.130
So instead of just having an anchor text like Take care Bobby you really want to try and encourages

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.670
Tabar key words in that bottlings that people are linking back to ISIS.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.730
And that really gives Google a good indication of waterside as advised when they see that arist sites

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.740
say that drones and they see that Texas says drones see their rank a lot higher now.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.110
It's very important to remember that to look natural.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.930
We don't want to have every back pointing to us saying drones you want to mix it up make it look natural

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.600
.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.170
See might have drones you might have your brand name you might sometimes have take care of synonyms

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.720
for drones.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.620
That looks unnatural and that's what we wanted to see.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.910
But it's just important to know abash under-taxed and in trying encourages teaser branding keywords

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.370
seeking rank for all of those terms.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.760
So the final characteristic of powerful back things are ones that are consistently being built.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.390
This looks organic to the search engines Lechter growing your business getting better.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.540
So it's important not just to build a load of back links in one month and have known the next month

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.890
.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.680
What's better really is to get a handful of Bacchantes every month and grow like that looks natural

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.120
and that's what the search engines want to see.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.540
So really to sum it up we want to focus on quality things.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.650
We don't want to focus on just low quality and loads of links.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.290
Really what's effective is honing in and trying to Gatlings and are following these characteristics

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.610
.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.890
Snap we know the types of links that really matter.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.000
Let's look at how do we get these links.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.220
And you know earning them naturally is really the best way.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.690
So you should have you think building is really a byproduct of building something that's genuinely worth

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.170
linking to whether it's your products or services the content that you produce or the opinions that

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.440
you share with your industry and peers.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.490
So this is this type of thing because known as an editorial link and it's really where somebody places

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.830
including the body of a Content.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.690
And it's it's kind of specifying the research.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.360
So I'm sure he's never written a blog post he naturally linked off to something great you find where

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.670
even if you've ever written an e-mail you've linked off to some great resource that you say to somebody

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.300
you should check this out.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.340
So it's really a form of citation on the web and on and generally This indicates that the destination

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.490
of the link is the original source of the the data the idea the concept or this statement.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.440
So this is very natural I'm sure you've done it yourself.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.660
So this is the best type of way to get things.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:20.460
So the second way to get links is to do manual outreach and it's really this is actually e-mailing bloggers

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.350
and web masters and asking for links.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:32.220
Now I see history as a supporting activity to the natural way of getting such really is creating something

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.380
really great that people naturally link to.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.300
But sometimes you need to develop opportunities you need to draw their attention to your new content

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.960
and you really want to maximize the links for your content campaign.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.370
So this is not something that's kind of dodgy.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.780
I think if you really create a very good value proposition by explaining to them why the target is so

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.750
good and why creating things is in their best interest so later on in the course.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.190
And I'm going to show you a couple strategies to hold to do this in a very effective way that's beneficial

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.230
for both you and the person linking to you.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.070
Okay great.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.060
And that concludes this lecture no kind of high level stuff.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.310
And but I think it's really important to set the context of what we're really going after here because

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.380
these are the strategies that we're going to be pursuing in the next section.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:39.090
These type of strategies to build powerful backings from sites that are within our reach and on a consistent

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.980
basis as well.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:49.610
So I'm really important to take the time to lay that as a man let's move forward to similar clarification

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.940
.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.460
You are the building introduction section
