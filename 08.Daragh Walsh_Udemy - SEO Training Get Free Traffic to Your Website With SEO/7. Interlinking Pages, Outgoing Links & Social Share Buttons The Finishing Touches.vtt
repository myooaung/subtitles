00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.560
So welcome to the final lecture in the On page optimization section of this course by now your web page

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.050
is already extremely well optimized for search engines.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.540
But I wanted to share with you three more very simple and effective ways to give your web page that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.040
final essay or booze and put you ad in front of competitors.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
So the first of these tips is to interlink between your pages.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.680
Essentially that this means that when you publish a new post or a new page you should link back to the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.970
other pages on your Web site to give an example of this.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's have a quick look at Wikipedia to see how the interlink between their pages so returning to an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.260
example we saw before.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.910
This is the Wikipedia page for drone.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.170
And as you can see it links solve to all other pages.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.860
Unmanned aerial vehicles for example.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.310
And in this page again it links off to the other pages that it has that link you know are referenced

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760
in this particular page.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.530
So the reason that we want to interlink between our pages is really because it helps sort of search

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.690
engine rankings.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.810
So say for example we have a tardy on one page which really means that we have a lot of external links

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820
from around the internet pointing to is showing that the content is great.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.970
Well if that page is then linked to other pages on our site.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.700
The little bit of that authority is going to be passed on to the other pages through those links.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.760
So essentially you're helping the pages on your Web site if you link to them across your site.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.000
So really the action here then is to add two to five keyword rich links to your older posts.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.340
Whenever you pull English a new one.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.230
So to tie that piece of information to that interlinking back into the sample that we've been working

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.550
through in this section you can see here that I've wandered in and link back to my keyword research

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.360
post and you can see that I've used what they call the anchor text.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.220
This is just the tax in which the link is really contained it's keyword rich so keyword research there

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.240
.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.120
And if we have a look at the link is well I've selected that it opens the link in a new window that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.960
really enables people to stay on the page that they're reading and opened the page in a different town

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.150
.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.080
So essentially you're not bringing them away from your particular page.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.840
So we've looked at interlinking between your pages.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.140
Now I want we want to look at another very simple thing you can do to increase your as SEO which is

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.400
to add outgoing links to your pages.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.700
So essentially this is in your content what you want to do is drop in a couple of links to authorities

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.180
sites within your niche.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.250
The reason that we want to do this is because it shows Google that we're in good company with good authority

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.940
sites and out where a hub of quality info.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.710
So what you need to remember is that you don't want to link to competitor sites that are trying to rank

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.030
for the same keywords as you.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.320
Otherwise you're just going to be giving them a free back link which is going to push them up the search

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.200
results.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.500
So really we want to link to authorities sites that are related to your topic that you're focusing on

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.670
but not direct competitors and roughly what you want to be doing is adding 3:58 I going Millings her

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.400
tears and words.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:03.060
So to get an example of outgoing links and Hattie's and less returns more you are at optimization post

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.420
when he can see here that I've got it in a section underscores versus dashes in your elves and I say

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.240
here that Mark cuts gives a definitive answer on whether you are underscores first the dashes in your

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.350
browser are best for as CEO.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.060
So this is the outgoing link that I'm doing and I'm linking it off to an article written by Mark Kurtz

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.000
and which really has high authority because he's the guy who's essentially the face of Google search

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.370
.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.010
And there's been a lot of news and shares etc for this article.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.390
So as you can see I've linked it off the anchor text underscores Rhys's dashes and you.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:51.570
Or else that's the title of the post as well so it's not directly competing with my key word which is

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.090
you are optimization but it's very closely related.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.630
So the final tip in this lecture is just really that you should get social sharing buttons on your page

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.400
and it's not such a huge factor for SEO but it is a growing one.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.690
But really more importantly it's for bringing traffic to your side and making people find your page

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.940
.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.630
If you put so much work into it and done all these optimizations you want to make sure as well that

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:30.140
people can share an edge across the social network so PM plug in that I would recommend for Wordpress

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.310
is called the take.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.230
You may have seen this before.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.530
So this is what it looks like Quincy added set up an on a blog and it's completely free and kind of

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.260
follows Iran the article which I think is good for social sharing.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.290
There you go you can go to both front to come forward slash dig dig and download and install us for

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.010
your wordpress site.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.290
So that really concludes the on page optimization section of the course.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.080
I really hope you've enjoyed it.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.500
I learnt a lot and now understand the anatomy of a perfectly optimized page for MCO.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.460
So in the next section.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.450
Let's move on to link building and building authority around are key words.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.740
This is where the real magic happens for a CEO and the team that's really going to push is high in the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.070
search engine results.
