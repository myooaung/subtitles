WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.390
So this is a really exciting part of the course because in we're going to generate an SEO over of course

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.880
and find out what the score is for your particular site.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:19.380
I think it's a fantastic exercise to help demystify SEO and also give you some very personalized information

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.550
about what you need to do in order to inquire in search engine results.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.480
Doing this now and having the report at your side as we go through the subsequent lectures I think is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.870
going to help make the course far more relevant more interesting and will help you take the necessary

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.040
actions that you need to do.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.390
So in order to generate Briscoe's score I'm going to give you the option to use two different free tools

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.800
.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.820
So the first is a way to rank Chrome extension.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.020
And secondly is a free to add on my size.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:02.670
So w w w r r Walsh dot com forward slash ASIO's scores so maybe there's advantages to both of these

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.600
different tools.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.920
Number one it will run because it praiser extensions so it's going to be your own.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.310
You're going to be able to see his score for any site that you visit and just open the extension when

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.230
you want to.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.120
And the CEO report that will generate on my site I think is really useful because it gives a lot of

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.090
very detailed information.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.000
It's something you can download and take away which you can and also you can do as you comparisons so

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.230
you can compare your score to the side scores.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.530
So let me just show you briefly how to get the we ran Chrome extensions set up and then I'll show you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.780
my report as well.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.400
So that we rank Chrome extension.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.270
All you need to do is typing.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.770
We run Chrome extension into Google and it comes up at the first result and you can install it as a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.010
extension into your browser says he can see I've already got it installed here and it shows up my good

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.640
symbol.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.020
So let's just say I'm visiting a Web site and want to check out and understand a bit about their SBO

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.300
.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.250
Well I can just click this button to open the tool and it's already generated in this score here and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.740
it's broken in and sit for different sections and gives advice about what you should do to improve your

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:29.600
side so as CEO Q consistency index pages I anchor text broken links and how it looks on mobile and i-Pad

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.020
.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.160
And so maybe a lot of this doesn't mean too that it might not mean a lot to name but it definitely will

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.950
the end of the course you're going to be a lot more familiar with what's on this tool and how to interpret

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.480
the information to improve SEO.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.000
So in order to generate the second as CEO report news head over to my side.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:01.080
Towelled stock come forward slash as CEO score and as I said this is great because you can get an escrow

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.050
score for specific web page which is what Google writes and the search engine results whether it be

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.210
an awning page or blog post or home page etc..

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.020
And what I also like about this report is that it forces you to put in a keyword and that automatically

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.040
gets you thinking about.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.440
Oh yeah.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.530
What keywords do I want around for.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.940
What should I be optimizing Arends So just put in an aside to lingo dot com.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.940
Just taking this as an example we're going to put in that trend the key that I want to rank for trunk

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.120
translation services.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.420
And I also want to put in a competitor that's ranking on the first page of Google because they want

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.520
to understand what they're doing right and how you can find models to get myself to the top of search

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.360
results as well.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.450
So what you want to do then is putting in your email.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.220
This is any more of a spam deterrent.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.150
I wouldn't be blasting guys with a lot of stuff.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.740
So you really scan now just in the interest of time and I'm going to skip on and I've already sconces

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.880
here.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.450
And as you can see what you're going to see a report here is side by side comparison with your competitor

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.170
.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.860
So really I mean this is a great outline of what we're going to be doing in the rest of the course because

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.650
here we've got things like the type and type description the images the heading tags.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.880
This is all about optimization and placing our key words in the right place in the search engines.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.650
And then we really come down to the authority building part of the course in terms of building authority

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.090
on social media and also in terms of getting page links and back links to our two main as well.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.870
So here you can see some of the outlines there.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.950
And then also what we've gotten here is a task list for your particular site which I think is very helpful

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.020
so we're not going to really get into it in too much detail because we're going to be touching on all

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.700
these areas throughout the remainder of the course.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.320
What I'd suggest is and download the report save it for yourself and keep it by your side as we're going

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.140
through the remainder of the course.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.520
So just a final note and that if you see onerously a report that you're not seeing things like your

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.360
description time's heading tags images even though they're on your site am what may be happening is

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.990
that you haven't put in the right page where you're SU information is contained so this is an example

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.530
of a site where that happens.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.630
You can go to the browser view developer view the source code and then you can see in the source code

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.960
that it says find DSTO content and the site's home page on the home page there.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.850
But then it has escaped fragment.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.820
So you want to put all of that back into the app to hear you want to put that on the page so try that

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.070
.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.360
If you have any problems at all just go back and rely on the room and Chrome extension that's going

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.380
to give you more than enough information.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.470
So that's it guys.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.580
I really hope that that was helpful.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.290
I know it's going to thrown you in the deep end there but hopefully that will demystify a lot of the

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.270
information.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.130
And really we're going to be working through the rest of the course.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.410
And you
