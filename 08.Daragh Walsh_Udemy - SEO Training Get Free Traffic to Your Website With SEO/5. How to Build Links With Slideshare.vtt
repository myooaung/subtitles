00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.570
So by now you've had a very successful piece of ego base you've put out a successful in for graphic

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.050
and anger thinking about hey can you follow that up and have another successful piece the content that's

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.010
going to generate some buzz and links.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.080
And so that's why in this lecture I want to show you how you can build things by uploading a presentation

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.730
online.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.260
And what I also want to show you is a very successful presentation that was uploaded on to slides should

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.050
I come from a local venture capitalist company here in Dublin and I think that really highlights how

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.890
SlideShare telcom can be used and how successful in Arnone building things but also building your brand

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.760
building social media marketing.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.640
And also just a great content marketing tool as well.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.850
So SlideShare as you can guess from the name is a document sharing site and its comparable to the YouTube

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.000
in its field in terms of its size.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.330
And then also the reason that people upload presentations on a slide show is number one.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.710
The presentations are viewable across all devices.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.650
They don't need to have PowerPoint or whatever.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.690
Number two as well that people can embed the presentations into their sites so that's hugely powerful

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.620
for building things.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.470
So the slide show is really great because it often appears on the first page of Google.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.840
So as you can see Teigen Irish tech startups in the top four results we've got a SlideShare example

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.770
here.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.320
So I've already opened it up and we can just have a bit of a look at it here but it's prepared by venture

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.390
capitalist firm here in Dublin.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.990
And really what it gives is an overview of the text of startup scene in Dublin a topic that's quite

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.220
interesting.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.380
I made a point to the presentation is to show the growth in the tech startup scene so as you can see

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.540
there is no bit of branding about the guys who have written it's so great brand building going on there

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.850
.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.870
And so let's have a quick look through some numbers.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.540
Fox their world competitiveness etc. Some almost infographics type visuals.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.370
This is the really interesting part for me and I think this is really caused a lot of people's attention

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.790
that they show over a kind of a time line visually how much the technology scene has grown into them

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.890
.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.970
So this was before 2000s then this is 10 years later all the new companies that came in and then that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.210
was two years later again all the companies that are comments are really showing the explosion in the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.590
tech scene and dozens of very interesting very visual.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.220
And summing it up quite fast.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.120
You know we talked about ego bait before and creating content that that will make other people look

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.590
good and they've done that very well in this presentation is less so as you can see they've included

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.560
here a lot of enterprises and SAS companies based in Dublin so obviously want to share this if you're

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.250
you know data hog or log entries or any of these guys because it looks like you're one of the top startups

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.140
in Dublin and you're being recognized as taught CD-ROMs the going to share this and push it down on

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.590
social media to your followers.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.480
That was the really very smart part about this presentation is that there was that ego bait aspect to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.160
it and really creating something that people want to share with their followers.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.290
So social media is today broken it up into different sections again really capturing a huge amount of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.290
people.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.110
And again this is just like you know the most important people so ego bait all over again.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.930
And some of the important people obviously they want to share with them so they've really captured a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.380
lot of people very quickly.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.680
All the startup accountants et cetera recruiters So really everybody involved in the scene so I think

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.760
does it Bridie brilliant example of ego based.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.050
No it's an important part.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:30.210
Let's look at this desists so as he concedes had 77 times and views on SlideShare share Froman then

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.270
imbeds it's hard.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.810
Twenty five thousand views so that's people taking this presentation.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.650
You can see here you can get the embed code and putting it onto their blogs or their Web sites.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.610
Here we go.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.710
We've got a market in Ireland.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.020
Irish Central Frontline has a couple other guys here meaning Casey broke she's probably a lot of people

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.910
mentioned in the presentation.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.900
And that again generated a huge amount of awareness about Frontline and a huge amount of links back

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.340
to this site as well.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.370
So I really just think this is a great example of how it was done well and across social media than

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.050
Linked-In very popular.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.660
Facebook and Twitter so these guys did it really well.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.330
And I would suggest you follow that example if you're creating these SlideShare first create that kind

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.290
of interesting story in terms of the groet the over time line visually represent that and then include

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.950
everybody you can in order to get lots of shares.
