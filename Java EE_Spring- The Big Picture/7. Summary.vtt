00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:05.603
We've reached the end of this module, so let's recap what we've learned.

2
00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:07.877
This module was all about Spring Boot.

3
00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:10.830
You learned that Spring Boot makes getting started

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.485
with Spring both quick and easy.

5
00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.104
Then we saw how Spring Boot uses intelligent auto-configurations to

6
00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:21.680
automatically set up and configure an application.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.707
Next we understood the standalone features of Spring Boot and how it

8
00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:29.530
drastically reduces the time it takes to run an application.

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.308
And last,

10
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:41.000
we covered how Spring Boot is opinionated and uses this as an advantage so that developers can get started as quickly as possible.
