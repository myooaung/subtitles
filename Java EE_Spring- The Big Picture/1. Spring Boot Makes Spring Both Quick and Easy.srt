Hi.

2
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:06,095
My name's Dustin Schultz, and in this module of Spring: The Big Picture course,

3
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:08,818
we'll learn about one of the key projects in the

4
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:11,970
Spring family called Spring Boot.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,642
We already had a very brief introduction to Spring Boot in the previous module,

6
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:20,976
so we'll use this module to take a slightly deeper look at Spring Boot.

7
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:23,288
Again, remember that we're keeping things high level,

8
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:26,061
so we don't want to be digging too deep here.

9
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:29,148
We certainly won't be learning how to use Spring Boot

10
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:31,949
or doing any sort of in-depth demos.

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,913
Instead, we'll be focused on what Spring Boot is,

12
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,290
and what it's about, and what it provides.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,851
We want to use Spring Boot as our first introduction to Spring

14
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:44,773
and sort of get a flavor for what it's like.

15
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:49,627
Learning any new technology can be both confusing and frustrating.

16
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:53,013
It's really, really hard to know where to start,

17
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:55,270
and you can quickly become overwhelmed.

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,706
Thankfully, Spring Boot makes learning Spring both quick and easy.

19
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:05,098
Developers can jump right in and get started without having to fully

20
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,018
understand everything that's behind the scenes.

21
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:10,490
Then as they get more advanced and knowledgeable,

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,179
they can circle their way back and learn more about the details.

23
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:20,970
I want to be absolutely clear though, easy does not mean lack of features.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,874
It's somewhat common for frameworks to boast about how

25
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,035
great and easy their technology is,

26
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:29,638
only to be disappointed when it's used in real-world

27
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,596
scenarios and falls flat on its face.

28
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:42,000
Spring Boot on the other hand is fully-featured and is heavily utilized in production by many companies today.
