00:00:01,823 --> 00:00:06,018
In this section, we'll take a quick tour of the Spring Security project.

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:11,151
You can visit the project page for Spring Security by visiting projects.

3
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:12,994
spring.

4
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,836
io/spring-security.

5
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:18,346
The Spring Security project is a framework for

6
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:19,662
securing Spring-based applications.

7
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:22,009
It handles both authentication and authorization,

8
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,718
and it covers all the standard ways of handling security,

9
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:29,985
as well as the ability to meet any sort of custom needs if needed,

10
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:32,714
and it's not only for authentication and authorization.

11
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:37,752
The Spring Security project also has additional features that help to

12
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:40,542
protect your application against common attacks,

13
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:43,508
like cross-site scripting or click jacking,

14
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:45,654
and you don't really have to understand what those

15
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,139
are to understand the benefits,

16
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:50,989
just know that Spring Security is also used to make

17
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,839
applications that are developed with it,

18
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:54,789
more secure.

19
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,611
To see a quick example of how the Spring Security project is used,

20
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:02,472
let's click on the Getting Started link under the Additional Resources section,

21
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,322
and this will take us to a page that lists a number of different

22
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,737
getting starting guides for Spring Security.

23
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:13,478
And we'll be looking at the Hello Spring Security with Boot example,

24
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,768
which uses Spring Security along with Spring Boot.

25
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,262
Once you're one the guide page,

26
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:21,047
locate the table of contents and click the section

27
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,651
Creating your Spring Security configuration.

28
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,501
This is the main part of the application that

29
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,732
demonstrates using Spring Security,

30
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:31,528
and will really give us a taste of what Spring Security is like.

31
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:33,136
If you scroll down a bit,

32
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:37,621
you'll see some code that configures the security in a web application.

33
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,415
As always, the details of the code aren't important,

34
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:44,730
but let me explain at a high level what some of the code is doing.

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,745
First, there's the @EnableWebSecurity annotation,

36
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:50,036
and this, as the name suggests,

37
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:53,682
sets up the application to be able to handle secure web requests.

38
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:56,490
Now let's focus on the configure method.

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,081
The code is configuring what paths are allowed and

40
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,655
what paths require authorization,

41
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:06,234
and it's also configuring the location of the login page for the application.

42
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:09,197
And if you look at the code, it's very readable.

43
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:15,943
You can see that any request for the path /CSS or /index,

44
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,355
are always permitted,

45
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:22,161
but any requests for /user path require the user to be

46
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:25,335
authenticated and authorized with the role of user.

47
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,497
This is a very real example of code that you might find in an

48
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:30,302
application today using Spring Security,

49
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:34,925
and it shows you just how easy it is to allow certain paths

50
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:37,984
of a web application to always be allowed,

51
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:41,602
or other parts to require security.

52
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:50,000
