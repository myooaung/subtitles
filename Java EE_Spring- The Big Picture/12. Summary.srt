00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,328
We've reached the end of this module,

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,996
so let's take a moment to recap what we've learned.

3
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:09,735
We've covered a lot of content in this module.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,193
We first saw Spring Core and how it's the foundation of the Spring

5
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:17,431
Framework and how it provides support for dependency injection,

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,376
which is a key component of the Spring Framework.

7
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,997
Then we got to see the web support within the Spring Framework,

8
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:27,771
as we talked about Spring Web MVC and Spring Webflux.

9
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:31,279
After that, we got to learn what AOP is,

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,568
or aspect-oriented programming,

11
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:38,178
and how Spring AOP can be used to solve cross-cutting concerns.

12
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:41,609
We then learned all about the Spring Framework's Data Access

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,755
module and how it removes a ton of boilerplate code and

14
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,037
makes it easier to access data.

15
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:49,038
And then after that,

16
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:53,099
we took a brief look at the Spring Framework's integration features and how

17
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:56,384
they help different applications and systems work together,

18
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:06,000
and we finished out the module by learning about the Spring Framework support for unit and integration testing.
