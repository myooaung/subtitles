Hi.

2
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:06,055
My name is Dustin Schultz, and in this module of Spring: The Big Picture course,

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:10,344
we'll be taking a tour of several of the other Spring projects that exist,

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:15,193
understanding what they do and how they make development easier.

5
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:19,409
If you open up a browser and visit spring.

6
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:19,877
io/projects,

7
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:22,475
you'll be brought to a page that contains all the projects

8
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:24,160
that exist within the Spring family.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,636
You can scroll through the projects and see what's available and

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,782
click into any of the projects for more details.

11
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:34,115
There's over 20 different projects at the time of this recording,

12
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,614
and as nice as it would be to be able to explore all of these projects,

13
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:41,270
we'll only be focusing our tour on a subset of the most

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,080
popular and widely used projects.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:53,000
The projects we'll be exploring in this module are Spring Data, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security.
