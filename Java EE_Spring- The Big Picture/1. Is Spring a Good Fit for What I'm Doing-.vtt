Hi.

2
00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:06.797
My name's Dustin Schultz, and in this module of Spring: The Big Picture course,

3
00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:10.468
we'll be focusing on one very important question.

4
00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:15.203
Is Spring a good fit for my project, my team,

5
00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.538
my company, etc.? And in order to answer that question,

6
00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:23.898
we'll go over a number of advantages and disadvantages to using Spring.

7
00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:28.736
And also, let me be absolutely clear, I'm likely biased in my opinions on Spring,

8
00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:37.000
whether I want to be or not, but I'm going to try my hardest to be as unbiased as possible.
