00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:04.682
The Spring Framework utilizes a modular architecture,

2
00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:08.180
meaning that it's broken up into separate individual

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.654
components that can be connected together.

4
00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:14.578
And each of those components is then responsible for

5
00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:17.951
providing a specific set of functionality,

6
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.921
and together as a whole, they make up the Spring Framework.

7
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.353
The Spring Framework can be broken up into six different key areas,

8
00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:32.078
core, web, AOP, or aspect-oriented programming,

9
00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:35.424
data access, integration, and testing.

10
00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:38.301
For the remainder of the module,

11
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:48.000
we'll take a look at each of these key areas and understand what they are, what they provide, and how they simplify Java development.
