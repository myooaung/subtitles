00:00.850 --> 00:06.840
OK before we bring this into unity we need to save as a piano file that way.

00:06.850 --> 00:09.310
Unity will be able to use it as a spreadsheet.

00:09.550 --> 00:14.340
What a P and g file is is it's a flattened version of your photoshop file.

00:14.350 --> 00:20.590
The difference between a p n g and a jpeg is a P and G can save out with empty space.

00:20.800 --> 00:27.100
So everywhere where there's no color is going to save out as transparent which we need it to in order

00:27.100 --> 00:29.890
to create our straight she animation.

00:29.890 --> 00:36.500
We also have to recreate all of our frames and flip them so that way they're all going left.

00:36.940 --> 00:42.940
So the way we're going to do that is first we're going to select all of our folders then we're going

00:42.940 --> 00:51.000
to make a copy of a Next let's add a new layer underneath all of those copied folders and we're going

00:51.000 --> 00:53.890
to fill that layer in with white.

00:53.910 --> 00:56.510
Now you'll see why did this here in a second.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.370
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go up to image come down to canvas and we are going to

01:02.370 --> 01:04.610
double the size of our canvas.

01:04.710 --> 01:08.580
We want to make sure that it adds it to the bottom of our document.

01:08.580 --> 01:15.300
So we need to make sure that this little ball here is at the top of the document and in the center next.

01:15.300 --> 01:24.360
Let's change this to pixels and we're going to change the height to 36 hundred to that's been doubled.

01:24.530 --> 01:25.600
OK.

01:25.920 --> 01:32.280
And you'll see it create some new grids down here for us to put our new frames into next.

01:32.310 --> 01:37.800
Let's select all of our new copied folders along with this white background.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.710
Now the reason why we filled in the background white is so we can realign all of our characters up perfectly

01:45.270 --> 01:48.150
like so.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.910
Now let's go ahead and delete that background.

01:51.970 --> 01:56.620
So the way we're going to have to flip these characters is one at a time.

01:56.620 --> 02:02.980
Now the reason why we can't just select all of our poses and flip them is because it would also flip

02:02.980 --> 02:07.600
the animation meaning that our animation would run backwards.

02:07.660 --> 02:12.730
So rather than him jumping up he would play backwards.

02:12.730 --> 02:18.640
So what we have to do is we have to select each one of our poses and flip them one at a time.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.170
Now this shouldn't take too long.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.110
So the first thing we want to do is we want to open up our walk cycle and we're going to start with

02:26.110 --> 02:27.790
frame 1.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.250
Now using the rectangular murky tool we're going to go ahead and select out this grid that poses in.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.450
Now when you select out your grid it might be a little bit tricky but with some practice you'll get

02:40.450 --> 02:44.680
the hang of it and it should click about into place a little tip.

02:44.680 --> 02:51.160
The further away you are from it the easier it is to select a grid shape and the easier it is for it

02:51.160 --> 02:53.800
to click into place.

02:53.830 --> 03:00.180
So once we've selected that grid what we want to do is we want to use the Transform Tool.

03:00.400 --> 03:08.210
We're going to right click our image and flip it horizontal like so then we can just hit enter and that's

03:08.210 --> 03:09.470
all there is to it.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.190
So now we can go ahead and move onto the next one.

03:12.350 --> 03:16.770
Make sure that you have the layer selected that you want to work on.

03:17.090 --> 03:26.940
Go ahead and select that grid and we'll use the Transform Tool right click and flip horizontal and that's

03:26.940 --> 03:28.260
all there is to it.

03:28.260 --> 03:34.060
So go ahead and flip all of your poses and then we can go on to finish creating our sprite sheet.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.880
OK so now you should have all of your bottom characters flipped.

03:38.880 --> 03:44.160
Another thing that I did is I went ahead and I relabeled all of my folders so that they were labeled

03:44.160 --> 03:46.400
with the left instead of right.

03:47.610 --> 03:51.510
So now let's go ahead and save this out as a Photoshop document.

03:51.510 --> 03:55.560
That way if we ever need to come back and make changes we can do that easily.

03:55.680 --> 04:02.370
So we'll go file save as and then we'll just save it out as final spreadsheet

04:07.650 --> 04:08.240
OK.

04:08.280 --> 04:14.910
Next what we want to do is we want to turn off this grid before we save it out as a P and G.

04:14.970 --> 04:21.510
So we're going to come up to view come down to show and then we're just going to go ahead and uncheck

04:21.600 --> 04:23.440
grid.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.820
Great.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.110
Now let's go ahead and save this out as a P.

04:28.170 --> 04:35.790
So we'll go file save as and the way you're going to change your document type is by coming down here

04:35.790 --> 04:42.540
where it says Save As type and you're going to change it from Photoshop to pee ngi which is right here

04:42.540 --> 04:45.110
towards the bottom.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.650
Now let's go ahead and save that.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.500
OK.

04:49.820 --> 04:50.490
So great.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.660
That just saved as a PNB.
