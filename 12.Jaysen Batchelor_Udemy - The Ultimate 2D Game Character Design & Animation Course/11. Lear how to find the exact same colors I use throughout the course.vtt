If you want to follow along with me in the course and you want to know the exact same colors that I'm

00:05.930 --> 00:13.280
using what you can do is watch me when I go to my color picker and you'll see down here at the bottom

00:13.280 --> 00:18.440
of the window is a pound sign with some numbers behind it.

00:18.800 --> 00:25.270
When I switch my color you'll see that that code changes to different numbers and letters.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.700
If you want the same color that I'm using.

00:27.710 --> 00:35.130
Go ahead and copy that number from my screen and put it into your box on your color picker.

00:35.150 --> 00:37.760
Now I don't really pause for you to catch this.

00:37.790 --> 00:43.340
So make sure that you pause the video yourself so that way you can get that number.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.160
I hope this was a good tip to help you follow along with me.
