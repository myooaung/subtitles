00:00.390 --> 00:08.280
So what is character design character design is much more than just the colors and shapes of a character.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.120
It's about telling a story it's about telling a story through the emotions through the facial expressions

00:15.120 --> 00:18.540
the body language the costume of the character.

00:18.930 --> 00:22.840
It's definitely what character design is all about.

00:22.860 --> 00:27.660
Now that's not to say that the colors and the shapes of the character aren't important because they

00:27.720 --> 00:33.240
are that's what makes a character iconic are their colors and shapes but when you're trying to make

00:33.240 --> 00:39.240
a character likable it's all about their story and the emotions that they're giving off.

00:39.240 --> 00:46.560
Walt Disney was actually one of the first people to put emotion and depth into his characters before

00:46.560 --> 00:48.150
his cartoons came along.

00:48.270 --> 00:53.190
Many other cartoons were just very simple and all they did were jokes and gags.

00:53.190 --> 00:57.140
They didn't have any story behind them or any real true emotion.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.670
You didn't relate to them at all.

01:00.210 --> 01:05.000
So what do I mean when I say that the character is telling a story.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.860
I don't mean that they're literally telling you a story but I do mean that they're telling you a story

01:09.860 --> 01:15.870
through the way they're dressed through their facial expressions their body posture their surroundings

01:15.900 --> 01:17.810
everything it all tells a story.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.430
And that's what it's all about.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.410
That's what's going to make your character likable.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.220
Let me show you some examples.

01:24.310 --> 01:29.460
So right here you can see that I have some character designs that I did in the past.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.530
The first one is a girl with blue hair.

01:31.530 --> 01:33.190
Her name is Summer.

01:33.570 --> 01:38.880
Now the first things that jump out at you are obviously that she has the blue hair and she has an orange

01:38.880 --> 01:39.750
dress.

01:39.780 --> 01:44.280
She also has blue eyes and very red lips.

01:44.340 --> 01:48.950
Now these are all things that make her iconic because these are shapes and colors.

01:48.970 --> 01:54.420
There are things that people are going to remember and a picture when they think of your character but

01:54.420 --> 01:57.870
they're only going to think of your character if they like your character.

01:57.990 --> 02:03.950
And so that all comes down to the emotions that are giving off and the story they're telling you.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.780
So if we have a look at her what kind of story is she telling you.

02:08.040 --> 02:14.880
Well for me I think that she's telling a story that for one she has a friend.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.920
Why do I think this.

02:15.960 --> 02:22.710
Well obviously she has a toad on her head and it appears that this toad could be our friend or her pet

02:23.070 --> 02:28.920
because if we have a look at her face which is her facial expressions you see that she's not scared

02:29.250 --> 02:34.350
she's not disgusted she's actually seems pretty happy and pretty content.

02:34.350 --> 02:38.910
She seems like this is a normal thing for her to have this toad on her head which leads me to believe

02:38.940 --> 02:45.230
that she's probably friends with this toad and it's probably her pet if we also have a look at her body

02:45.230 --> 02:49.320
language her body language says that she's a little perky and a little happy.

02:49.640 --> 02:56.490
She's also not disgusted by this toad by the way her body language is saying things also if you have

02:56.490 --> 03:01.830
a look at our costume first one of the first things I notice is that she's wearing a satchel.

03:01.880 --> 03:07.550
Now she could just be carrying a satchel around but this kind of indicates to me that she has some sort

03:07.550 --> 03:11.880
of an adventure or an adventurous girl.

03:11.930 --> 03:17.600
Another thing that you notice is she has rolled up sleeves now rather than having her sleeves rolled

03:17.600 --> 03:19.950
down or having short sleeved shirt.

03:20.090 --> 03:22.460
She has a long sleeve shirt with rolled up sleeves.

03:22.460 --> 03:28.850
Now this is kind of symbolic of a hard worker or somebody that's not afraid to get down and dirty somebody

03:28.850 --> 03:30.640
that's not afraid of an adventure.

03:30.890 --> 03:37.870
So this also leads me to believe that she's possibly an and adventurous girl.

03:37.910 --> 03:42.410
So like I said all these things are really telling a story.

03:42.560 --> 03:48.620
Now I encourage you to look up other characters that you like and look at their characters and study

03:48.620 --> 03:53.610
their facial expressions and body postures and see what kind of stories they're telling.

03:53.630 --> 03:59.040
You're going to start looking around and seeing stories everywhere from all different types of characters.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.720
Let's have a look at the second character that I've designed.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.240
So this is a French bulldog that I designed a while back ago.

04:07.010 --> 04:12.950
If we look at them obviously the shapes of this character and the colors make them very iconic.

04:12.950 --> 04:19.280
It's very simple it's pink black and white and that the shapes are also very simple.

04:19.280 --> 04:28.300
We have a square head kind of a square body oval legs oval ears very iconic very simple now.

04:28.490 --> 04:35.650
But what kind of story is this character telling through his body language through his expression because

04:35.650 --> 04:40.910
his dog isn't wearing any clothes or has any type of prop around him.

04:40.910 --> 04:46.060
He can only tell his story through his facial expressions and his body posture.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.830
Have a look at his body posture.

04:48.950 --> 04:53.720
It's kind of saying that he's at attention kind of like a soldier a little bit whatever his eyes are

04:53.720 --> 04:54.710
fixated on.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.840
He's paying very close attention to it and he's interested.

04:58.850 --> 05:05.330
Another way we can tell that he's interested is his ears are very much propped up almost like he's listening.

05:05.330 --> 05:10.640
The third thing that tells us that this dog is very interested in whatever he's paying attention to

05:11.000 --> 05:13.270
is that his head is slightly tilted.

05:13.340 --> 05:18.230
You'll notice if he's studied dogs or even human babies when they're interested in something or when

05:18.230 --> 05:22.980
they're paying attention to something they'll very often tilt their heads.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.070
This is also something that a lot of humans do subconsciously when they're talking to friends or family

05:28.490 --> 05:32.600
and they want to show them that they're actually listening and paying attention is all slightly tilt

05:32.600 --> 05:33.630
their heads.

05:33.950 --> 05:41.330
So like I said it's all about the body language the body posture the emotions and the costume.

05:41.330 --> 05:47.360
This is what tells your character's story and tells you what kind of emotion they're evoking.

05:47.360 --> 05:52.700
I really hope this lecture was helpful for you and it gave you some really cool insight into the world

05:52.730 --> 05:54.420
of character design.

05:54.740 --> 05:58.870
Thank you for watching this lecture and I can't wait to see you in the next one.
