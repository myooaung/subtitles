WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:01.860
All right.

00:01.860 --> 00:03.350
Now let's get animated.

00:03.690 --> 00:08.910
So first off we're going to grab all of these layers that are creating the spear and we're going to

00:09.240 --> 00:13.080
put them into a folder and we're going to call that folder speir

00:16.050 --> 00:16.550
next.

00:16.590 --> 00:22.060
Let's turn off our sketch folder so we can no longer see the sketch once we've done that.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.800
Let's change the size of our canvas the way you do that is by coming up to image then coming down to

00:28.800 --> 00:31.440
canvas size hitting that.

00:31.570 --> 00:34.630
Now you see you're given the option for width and height.

00:35.310 --> 00:42.400
So we want to change it to pixels and now will give us the width and height in pixels.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.560
Now we want to create a perfect square.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.270
So what we're want to do is we're going to make this a perfect 600 by 600

00:54.310 --> 00:59.950
and what that will do is it'll change the size of our canvas but it won't affect our character.

00:59.950 --> 01:03.990
Next let's make sure that the background color is white.

01:04.450 --> 01:07.870
Ok then we're going to hit OK.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.110
And then we want to proceed.

01:12.330 --> 01:17.880
And I can see a change the size of our canvas to a perfect square 600 by 600.

01:17.910 --> 01:22.620
Now when you're creating your own character it doesn't necessarily have to be 600 by 600 You just want

01:22.620 --> 01:26.310
to make sure that they're on a perfect square canvas.

01:26.370 --> 01:26.890
All right.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.630
Now we want to save this as a frame.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.360
Now this is just going to be the standing frame.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.530
He's not going to be doing any action.

01:34.530 --> 01:39.720
And so what we're going to do is we're going to come up to file then save as.

01:39.950 --> 01:48.520
And then we want to create a new folder or create a new folder and we're going to call this folder standing

01:50.950 --> 01:51.790
Brett.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.360
Now let's go into that folder.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.000
And now we're going to save this as frame one.

01:57.010 --> 02:05.950
So we're just going to put one for frame 1 and then we can save it OK great.

02:06.060 --> 02:11.820
Now before we get into creating our walk cycle we want to make sure that everything is correct on our

02:11.820 --> 02:17.010
character and there's nothing we want to change because once you start animating it's very hard to change

02:17.010 --> 02:23.770
something on your character once there's already up to like three to 10 different frames of that character.

02:23.820 --> 02:28.580
So we want to make sure that everything looks good on our character and there's nothing we want change.

02:28.590 --> 02:34.080
I think it looks pretty good but I'm noticing one mistake and that mistake is down here at his feet

02:34.140 --> 02:36.150
his feet are not level.

02:36.150 --> 02:42.160
So if he were to be standing on the ground this leg would be higher up than this one.

02:42.160 --> 02:47.890
So first what we need to do is we need to grab a line from our ruler and we're going to make sure that

02:47.890 --> 02:50.630
those feet become level.

02:50.650 --> 02:54.510
Now the way you grab this line from your ruler is up here at the top.

02:54.550 --> 02:59.680
Now if your ruler is not showing up at the top of your page what you need to do is you need to come

02:59.680 --> 03:12.430
up to view and then come down and just make sure that your rulers are checked.

03:12.470 --> 03:17.890
Once you've done that just come up to your ruler and click it and drag out a line.

03:18.050 --> 03:22.740
So bring that all the way down to his feet and we're going to bring it to his higher foot.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.600
So right about there now let's go ahead and zoom in.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.970
So as you can see this foot is way off from the other foot.

03:31.010 --> 03:37.610
So what we need to do is we need to go into our body layer and we're going to go to the main body piece

03:37.610 --> 03:39.490
which is this one right here.

03:39.800 --> 03:45.980
Then using the arm Marki tool we're going to select just his foot like so.

03:45.980 --> 03:51.740
Next we're going to do is using our grab and move tool and then using the arrow keys on our keyboard

03:51.830 --> 03:57.830
we're just going to nudge that up until it lines up with this level line.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.410
Great.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.570
That looks good.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.580
Now we can unselect out of that selection.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.320
Awesome.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.830
So now that's fixed now to get this line out of here.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.440
All you have to do is switch back to your grab and move tool.

04:10.550 --> 04:16.640
And when you see this little guy appear above the line you just grab it and drag it back up to the top

04:16.790 --> 04:17.890
and it disappears.

04:19.710 --> 04:25.070
Now that we've made that change let's go ahead and resave this out with the fixes.

04:25.380 --> 04:33.900
So all we have to do is go file and save and an even quicker way to do that is you can go control as

04:34.080 --> 04:40.500
if you're on a Windows or command as if you're on a Mac and that will automatically save your image.

04:40.630 --> 04:41.080
All right.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.920
Now let's move on to creating our walk cycle.

04:44.920 --> 04:51.370
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add a layer above our body now and this layer

04:51.370 --> 04:56.160
we are going to sketch out the legs of our character in its new position.

04:56.440 --> 05:02.830
So if you remember the first position of the walk cycle is going to be the contact which is means that

05:02.830 --> 05:05.940
the legs are going to be spread apart and touching the ground.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.660
So it will look like this.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.350
This will be our first frame.

05:11.690 --> 05:14.930
So let's go ahead and sketch some legs in.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.100
Now these are going to be the final legs.

05:17.180 --> 05:28.630
They're just going to be used as a reference to create over.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.750
So you just want to make sure that his heel is touching the ground right about there.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.190
And then for the back leg come back like this

05:47.850 --> 05:48.660
awesome.

05:48.660 --> 05:52.920
So you saw how easy that was if you did the assignment from the last lecture.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.570
This should be somewhat simple for you.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.200
All right.

05:56.220 --> 06:00.810
Next hour we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and create these legs now.

06:00.870 --> 06:04.610
This leg right here on the right side is going to be pretty simple.

06:04.740 --> 06:09.630
What we're going to do is we're going to come back down to our body layer then switching over to our

06:09.630 --> 06:10.580
Lasso tool.

06:10.590 --> 06:15.630
We're just going to draw a selection around this leg then we're just going to slice right through the

06:15.630 --> 06:25.560
center of his drawstring like So next we're going to use our Transform Tool to rotate and position our

06:25.570 --> 06:32.270
laig.

06:32.330 --> 06:36.630
Now it may not line up perfectly with your sketch and that's all right.

06:38.270 --> 06:38.830
Great.

06:38.990 --> 06:43.090
So enter now as you can see that was pretty simple.

06:43.100 --> 06:48.350
All we really want to do now at this point is we're going to use our brush tool and then we're going

06:48.350 --> 06:55.660
to select our skin tone and we're just going to fill in some of these empty spots that we missed.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.050
Great.

06:56.080 --> 07:04.650
Now that we've done that let's add a new layer and using our Polygonum Lasso tool which is the Lasso

07:04.650 --> 07:06.970
tool that makes straight lines.

07:07.050 --> 07:09.150
We're going to trace out this leg.

07:10.460 --> 07:16.650
Now like I said sometimes you can reuse body parts and just rotate them and reposition them.

07:16.910 --> 07:20.240
But sometimes you have to completely recreate new body parts.

07:32.130 --> 07:35.430
Now let's go ahead and let's fill that in with our color.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.530
Awesome.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.080
Now you can see we have two legs in the way.

07:40.100 --> 07:47.040
So what we want to do is we're going to come back down to our original body layer and using our Lasso

07:47.040 --> 07:51.660
tool we can go ahead and make a selection around the old leg.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.070
And then we can just hit delete and it will delete that.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.140
Awesome.

07:57.300 --> 08:01.030
Now let's turn off our sketch layer and see how that looks.

08:01.080 --> 08:01.570
All right.

08:01.650 --> 08:04.520
Well as you can see this leg looks way too big.

08:04.530 --> 08:10.680
So we're going to go ahead and fix that real quick so using our Lasso tool we're just going to cut away

08:10.740 --> 08:11.700
some more of this

08:20.680 --> 08:25.160
make sure you're on the layer that the leg is on and then hit delete.

08:25.780 --> 08:26.170
All right.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.170
Great.

08:27.190 --> 08:28.330
That looks better.

08:30.340 --> 08:35.800
Now the last thing I want to do before we're finished with this frame is I want to go ahead and animate

08:35.800 --> 08:36.650
the arms.

08:36.790 --> 08:42.190
So we're going to start with his back arm his back arm is already on its own layer.

08:42.190 --> 08:47.350
So we're just going to select his back arm layer along with the spear folder.

08:47.350 --> 08:53.860
So holding down control or shift and selecting the spare folder along with it then we'll use the Transform

08:53.860 --> 08:57.400
Tool to rotate and reposition his arm.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.150
Now this part of his walk we're going to have the arm come down a little bit

09:04.860 --> 09:06.510
so about there should be good.

09:06.540 --> 09:14.120
Just make sure that the edge of the arm and the shoulder line up to enter great.

09:14.240 --> 09:20.030
Now lastly let's go ahead and let's animate his other arm sort of come up to our body layer because

09:20.030 --> 09:24.350
that's what the arm is attached to and using her Lasso tool.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.050
We're going to select that arm

09:30.750 --> 09:33.500
then we're going to use the Transform Tool.

09:33.610 --> 09:41.320
We're going to rotate that arm down like so and we can reposition it if it doesn't go right into place

09:41.330 --> 09:47.280
you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to reposition it right about there should be good.

09:47.390 --> 09:54.020
Enter All right now we can unselect out of that.

09:54.120 --> 10:00.330
Now I'm kind of noticing that these legs aren't very level and I'm pretty sure this leg is still a little

10:00.330 --> 10:00.990
bit too big.

10:00.990 --> 10:06.330
So if we grab a ruler line and bring it down you can see they're pretty far off.

10:06.330 --> 10:14.250
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to shrink this leg down so I'll come up to the layer then

10:14.250 --> 10:16.220
using the transform tool.

10:16.290 --> 10:22.080
I'm going to grab the corner at the bottom and hold down Shift while I do this.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.500
That way it keeps its proportions.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.260
Then I'm just going to shrink it down just a little bit about there should be good.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.850
Enter right.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.080
That a much better.

10:33.270 --> 10:33.740
All right.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.680
You just finished the first frame of your walk cycle.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.000
Now let's go ahead and let's save this out in a walk cycle folder.

10:42.000 --> 10:54.070
So we'll come up to File Save As and let's go back to our original folder and create a new folder and

10:54.070 --> 11:00.090
we'll call this one walk cycle.

11:00.300 --> 11:05.390
Then let's open that and let's save this as frame one for the walk cycle.

11:05.400 --> 11:09.300
So for short we'll just put one hit save.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.480
OK.
