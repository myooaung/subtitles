If you've never created art for games or animations.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.810
One of the best places to come to to find jobs and gain experience are freelancing sites like the one

00:11.810 --> 00:12.830
we're on right now.

00:12.870 --> 00:14.650
Freelancers dot com.

00:14.870 --> 00:17.740
There's a ton of other sites out there such as e Lancer.

00:17.930 --> 00:23.510
If you do a google search for freelancing sites that will give you a ton of them and you can just choose

00:23.510 --> 00:25.430
whichever one you want.

00:25.430 --> 00:30.350
Now I'm going to take you through a walkthrough on freelancer because this is the one that I've found

00:30.440 --> 00:33.120
the best success with in the past.

00:34.760 --> 00:42.110
So what freelancer is is it a site for people that have projects that want to get them outsourced to

00:42.110 --> 00:48.710
other people so they can bring their project to freelancer you the freelance or will bid on their project

00:48.770 --> 00:51.710
along with a bunch of other freelancers.

00:51.710 --> 00:57.290
Then the employer will take a look at all the bids and they'll look at all the freelancers profiles

00:57.380 --> 01:03.710
their reviews and their portfolios and based off that they're going to choose a freelancer to do the

01:03.710 --> 01:05.160
job that they have.

01:05.210 --> 01:08.050
And then once you do the job you'll get paid.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.470
I'll talk a little bit more about that stuff later.

01:10.640 --> 01:17.330
Now once you've created your account you're going to want to add some details to your profile now because

01:17.360 --> 01:24.220
I just created this new account and my accounts not linked to anything like my paypal or any of my information.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.340
It won't allow me to fill in my information.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.880
But when you get in here and you have a real full fledged account it will allow you to fill in all the

01:31.880 --> 01:35.350
information and add all the things to your portfolio.

01:35.540 --> 01:40.310
So you're going to want to add your name down here and I'll ask for a description in there you'll just

01:40.310 --> 01:44.110
put your background and what you do.

01:44.330 --> 01:47.570
You're also going to want to put in a profile picture.

01:47.960 --> 01:54.500
Over here you can put in your hourly rate and then down here there there's usually a button that will

01:54.500 --> 02:01.190
allow you to add to your portfolio and you can add files or images and that's the most important part

02:01.310 --> 02:08.210
about your profile is because when a employer comes to your profile to see who you are and what you

02:08.210 --> 02:14.450
do they want to see your work and they want to see that you have good reviews up here.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.150
And those are the two most important things on the site are your reviews and your portfolio.

02:20.330 --> 02:26.300
So when you create your account make sure you try to build up the best portfolio you can.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.160
And as you create more art you can just keep adding to it.
