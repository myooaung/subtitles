So I said that if you can't afford a tablet or you don't want to purchase one you can draw your images

00:07.190 --> 00:14.600
with paper and pencil and scan them in or photograph them and bring them in Photoshop and use those

00:14.600 --> 00:17.170
as your base to create your artwork.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.530
I'm going to show you how to do that right now.

00:20.060 --> 00:24.250
So I drew a little sketch and I took a picture of it with my iPhone.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.850
It doesn't have to be super professional or super nice.

00:27.110 --> 00:33.610
You just want to get that image into Photoshop so you can create shapes and colors on top of it.

00:33.620 --> 00:42.710
So what we'll do is we're going to come up to file open then I'm going to go to my pictures and I'm

00:42.710 --> 00:50.110
going to come to my game character and now I'm going to select him and open an next what I'm going to

00:50.110 --> 01:00.040
do is I'm going to rotate him by coming up to that image dropdown menu and coming down to image rotation

01:00.780 --> 01:05.630
and I'm going to rotate him at 90 degrees counterclockwise.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.130
So now he's right side up.

01:07.510 --> 01:13.300
So now that you have your image in Photoshop and you're ready to start creating your character what

01:13.300 --> 01:15.670
you'll do is that you'll add layers above them.

01:15.670 --> 01:21.520
So you want to make sure that when you're painting on your character you're not actually directly painting

01:21.590 --> 01:28.780
onto this background layer so you'll add a new layer by hitting the layer button so that the brush tool

01:28.900 --> 01:30.660
and let's bring the size up.

01:32.670 --> 01:33.920
So it fits his head.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.590
We're just going to put a dot there.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.470
It's about the size of his head.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.670
And so now we have a shape there for a character's head.

01:41.150 --> 01:46.260
And you'll see that it's not affecting our original drawing at all.

01:46.260 --> 01:52.530
So this is how you're going to upload your physical drawn into Photoshop and create a character on top

01:52.530 --> 01:53.440
of that.

01:53.580 --> 01:59.340
I really hope this lecture was helpful for you and insightful and I hope to see you in the next lecture.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.090
Thanks for watching.
