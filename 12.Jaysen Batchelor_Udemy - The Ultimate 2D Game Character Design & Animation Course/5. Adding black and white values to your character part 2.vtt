WEBVTT

00:00.730 --> 00:10.200
Now let's label the goggles layer.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.310
Next we're going to work on his shirt so we'll add a new layer and using the Lasso tool.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.600
We're just going to trace it out like we've done with all the other shapes.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.150
Remember Take your time on this.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.950
You don't have to go super fast.

00:26.190 --> 00:29.700
You just want to make sure that you're accurate.

01:11.790 --> 01:13.420
Now let's fill that in.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.100
I want to fill it in with the same exact color as the goggles.

01:17.100 --> 01:23.670
But if you unselected that color like let's say I have unselected it and I'm on a light gray now but

01:23.670 --> 01:26.290
I still want to get back to that exact color.

01:26.670 --> 01:31.570
What you can do is use the eyedropper which is this little guy right here.

01:32.160 --> 01:38.580
We're going to select him and then when we click on the area it's going to switch our color selection

01:38.850 --> 01:41.340
to what other whatever color we've just selected.

01:41.340 --> 01:44.470
So if I click here you see it turns to white.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.700
If I click here it turns to black.

01:47.010 --> 01:53.490
So I go ahead and select that dark gray and now I'm going to fill our shapen with that color.

01:54.770 --> 01:55.620
Awesome.

01:55.970 --> 02:00.310
Now let's drag our layer underneath our scarf layer.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.360
Perfect.

02:02.510 --> 02:07.400
And then let's not forget to label it so we'll call it shirt

02:10.930 --> 02:12.080
gray.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.990
Now let's go ahead and move on to his gloves.

02:15.110 --> 02:17.580
No we can't see where his glove starts.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.170
So we're going to go ahead and turn off the shirt layer so we can see that line there.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.580
So let's go ahead and let's trace that out.

02:26.130 --> 02:30.510
And we want to put both the gloves on the same layer.

02:30.620 --> 02:34.610
So once we get this guy traced out I'm going to show you how we do that

02:41.580 --> 02:42.150
all right.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.080
Now that guy is traced out.

02:44.390 --> 02:48.500
So now we're going to come over to our second glove and hold down shift.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.950
You'll see a little plus sign come up next to your cursor.

02:51.980 --> 02:57.400
What this means is now you can add another shape to this shape even though they're not touching yet.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.360
They'll still be the same selection.

02:59.720 --> 03:05.350
So while holding down shift make your first point as you've made your first point go out and make your

03:05.350 --> 03:11.110
second point and after that point you can go ahead and let go if you don't like go it's going to try

03:11.110 --> 03:14.320
to make these perfect degree lines.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.790
So it's going to try to make 45 degree lines and 90 degree lines.

03:18.790 --> 03:19.540
You don't want that.

03:19.540 --> 03:25.270
So let go of shift and it will continue to let you add the shape to your first shape

03:45.980 --> 03:46.700
great.

03:46.720 --> 03:51.390
Now let's go ahead and fill that in.

03:51.410 --> 04:00.600
We're going to fill it in with a light gray color a little bit past the mid grade up there.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.100
So use our paint bucket.

04:03.650 --> 04:05.440
And don't forget to create a new layer.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.730
I almost forgot.

04:06.890 --> 04:07.630
Don't forget.

04:07.660 --> 04:12.100
So add that layer in and fill our shapes in.

04:12.410 --> 04:12.890
Great.

04:12.890 --> 04:19.480
Now let's label that layer and call it loves.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.260
Now we can turn on our shirt layer.

04:23.260 --> 04:26.320
Now you can see our character is starting to come together.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.620
Now let's go ahead and do those pants.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.640
So let's create a layer underneath our shirt.

04:35.690 --> 04:42.420
Now we'll do that by selecting the folder underneath the shirt layer and adding a new layer.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.770
Now let's trace those pants out.

05:09.520 --> 05:16.510
Now the reason why we make our shapes overlap other shapes is because we don't want to see a gap between

05:16.630 --> 05:17.680
our two values.

05:17.680 --> 05:24.430
If we were to create a shape and try to go right along this edge we'd probably create a tiny tiny gap

05:24.670 --> 05:28.760
or we'd see a pixel of white from the background.

05:28.790 --> 05:29.920
And we don't want that.

05:30.140 --> 05:32.330
So that's why we make them overlap.

05:32.770 --> 05:36.200
OK let's go ahead and let's fill these pants in.

05:36.230 --> 05:40.890
We're going to fill them in with a color a little bit darker than our gloves.

05:40.940 --> 05:45.600
So using my color picker I'm going to select that Gray.

05:45.620 --> 05:50.950
So now I can come over to the color selection and bring down that Gray.

05:50.960 --> 06:00.650
So we know that it's just a little bit below this color of gray it will fill that in great novelists

06:00.650 --> 06:01.800
label that path.

06:05.470 --> 06:12.740
Next let's do our Boop why add a new layer do just the same thing that we have before and trace out

06:12.740 --> 06:18.370
those blue shapes fill them in with a dark gray.

06:18.540 --> 06:24.740
Let's turn off our pan Slayer so we can see where the top of our boot is.

06:24.980 --> 06:29.170
Let's go ahead and trace those boots out.

06:47.920 --> 06:52.820
Then holding down shift will add a new selection.

06:52.990 --> 06:56.040
Remember to let go of shift after you've made your second point.

06:56.080 --> 07:24.470
Otherwise it's going to try to create these straight lines.

07:24.500 --> 07:24.840
All right.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.960
Now let's fill that in with a dark gray

07:31.400 --> 07:36.220
and they go about their And we'll fill that in.

07:37.770 --> 07:47.970
Now we can turn our pants layer on and label our boot layer we call it boots.

07:48.150 --> 07:51.880
Now lastly we need to add the values to our sword.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.900
Let's create a new layer

07:58.650 --> 08:01.730
we're going to separate the sword into two different parts.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.460
We're going to separate it into the handle and the blade.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.520
So let's start with the handle.

08:07.620 --> 08:29.610
Going to go ahead and trace that and allow.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.160
So let's fill that in with a dark grey.

08:32.610 --> 08:38.550
Let's use the same color as a scarf now rather than go in and selecting the eyedropper the hot key for

08:38.550 --> 08:43.550
it is the letter I on your keyboard will select it.

08:43.650 --> 08:49.140
Now we'll switch back over to the paint can by hitting the letter G and we'll fill that shapen

08:52.330 --> 08:52.700
next.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.830
Let's do the Bley So we'll add a new layer.

09:02.420 --> 09:08.870
Let's label that layer we'll call it handle.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.930
Now let's add a new layer.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.910
And let's trace out the blade.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.370
Then let's fill that in with a gradient.

09:32.540 --> 09:37.580
So we're going to create a gradient with the color we already have selected which is the same color

09:37.610 --> 09:44.010
as the scarf and is handle the second color is going to be a little bit lighter than that.

09:44.330 --> 09:52.420
So let's use the eyedropper and we'll select that color again and then we can bring that color up to

09:52.420 --> 09:55.020
about midpoint will hit.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.410
OK.

09:56.470 --> 10:04.060
Now let's make sure that our paint can is actually the gradient tool and we'll create that gradient.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.910
Awesome.

10:08.920 --> 10:14.850
Now let's drag that layer below our handle layer and let's label it.

10:14.850 --> 10:15.440
Blade

10:24.820 --> 10:25.560
great.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.980
Let's zoom out and see how this is working.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.280
Awesome.

10:31.300 --> 10:35.950
You can see that we're really starting to develop our character and bring them to life.

10:35.950 --> 10:40.150
I hope this lecture was helpful for you and you found it very useful.

10:40.150 --> 10:44.920
I can't wait to see you in the next one where we're going to start adding the details her character

10:44.980 --> 10:46.890
that are going to really bring them to life.
