00:00.820 --> 00:04.210
Next we're going to work on his goggles and his hair.

00:04.210 --> 00:09.570
So first what we want to do is we want to come to the top layer in our goggles folder.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.880
We're going to add a new layer on top of that.

00:13.040 --> 00:18.550
Once you've done that we're going to use our circular marquee tool to create a perfect circle that's

00:18.560 --> 00:21.300
going to be a little bit smaller than our goggle shape.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.460
Next we're going to fill that in with a dark brown.

00:25.640 --> 00:31.010
So we're going to select our goggles color then we're going to bring that color down to the darker side.

00:32.710 --> 00:33.440
OK.

00:33.710 --> 00:37.650
Now it's filled out shapen awesome.

00:38.190 --> 00:42.700
Next what we want to do is we want to add a new layer on top of this.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.130
Now with this layer we're going to use the same selection.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.910
We're just going to fill it in with a different color.

00:49.490 --> 00:55.480
So using our color picker we're going to revert back to our goggles color and we're going to bring that

00:55.480 --> 00:55.880
up.

00:55.900 --> 01:01.100
So it's a lighter somewhere about their looks good.

01:01.330 --> 01:05.030
And we're going to bring the color down more towards the red side.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.020
OK.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.510
Now let's fill that shapen.

01:10.650 --> 01:16.830
Next we unselect out of that selection then we're going to turn this layer into a clipping mask.

01:19.130 --> 01:23.890
And using the Graben move tool we're going to nudge it over with the arrow keys on our keyboard

01:26.670 --> 01:32.330
out there tonight you can see it's created the illusion that there is a lens in his goggles and it's

01:32.330 --> 01:38.880
set back next what we're going to do is we're going to select this lens shape by holding down control

01:38.940 --> 01:45.310
on a Windows or a command on a Mac and hitting the thumbnail on the layer.

01:45.320 --> 01:50.210
Now we're going to come back to our color and we're going to take the same color but we're going to

01:50.210 --> 01:51.960
make it a lot lighter.

01:52.550 --> 01:53.230
OK.

01:53.850 --> 01:57.130
He's in our brush tool and bringing down the size.

01:57.130 --> 02:00.130
We're going to just make a few streaks through there.

02:00.190 --> 02:07.540
These will act as reflections in his goggles I think are going to make the second streak a lot smaller

02:07.600 --> 02:09.970
and thinner like that.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.340
Awesome.

02:11.350 --> 02:12.430
Now just for texture.

02:12.430 --> 02:15.070
I'm going to add a few little spots in there.

02:18.370 --> 02:19.280
Cool.

02:19.330 --> 02:25.720
Now we can unselect out of that and we're going to merge those two layers together.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.840
So select both and merge.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.180
So now that's one layer.

02:31.030 --> 02:36.040
Next what we're going to do is we're going to use the marquee tool to select that we're going to copy

02:36.160 --> 02:43.310
and paste it and bring it over to the other side of our goggle using the Transform Tool.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.000
In shape that to fit into our second goggle

02:55.860 --> 02:56.650
great.

02:56.850 --> 03:02.410
Now the last thing we want to do on our goggles is add an under shadow to it to give it some form.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.870
Let's select this dark brown that we use for the shadow on the inside of the goggle.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.220
Then we're going to come down to our layers and let's create a new layer.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.440
That's a clipping mask.

03:12.600 --> 03:18.000
So make sure you create it underneath another clipping mask so it will automatically create a clipping

03:18.000 --> 03:19.240
mask.

03:19.390 --> 03:26.550
Then we're going to drag that up to the top of our clipping masks and using the brush tool.

03:26.700 --> 03:30.220
Let's zoom in there using the brush tool.

03:30.220 --> 03:34.590
We're going to just paint in this bottom edge.

03:34.800 --> 03:41.880
So as you can see now it gives a bottom edge to that strap so it's not just a flat strap.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.240
Next we're going to add some form to the goggle piece

03:54.640 --> 03:57.160
and we'll do the same thing to the other side.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.590
Now this piece that's connecting the two goggles is going to have a little bit of form too.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.000
And we want to show that and it's under shadow

04:20.080 --> 04:20.990
great.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.190
Let's just add one more under shadow underneath this strap.

04:32.650 --> 04:33.450
Cool.

04:33.970 --> 04:36.980
So our goggles are looking pretty damn good.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.110
Now let's move on to the hair.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.390
I like the hair right now.

04:40.390 --> 04:42.470
There's just one thing I want to do to it.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.010
I want to add a darker color on this edge.

04:45.040 --> 04:52.420
So what I'll do is coming down to the hair layer I'm going to create a new clipping mask and I'm going

04:52.420 --> 04:58.620
to drag that above our original clipping mask that I'm going to select this orange right here that he

04:58.620 --> 05:03.110
has in his hair and using my brush tool.

05:06.110 --> 05:09.670
I'm just going to paint a streak on this edge of his hair.

05:10.430 --> 05:13.550
So maybe I want that a little thicker

05:16.550 --> 05:17.990
awesome.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.780
Let's also not forget to label our layers.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.430
So really quick.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.950
We're just going to go ahead and label these.

05:24.950 --> 05:30.560
I'm going to merge these two lenses together just to clean things up a bit.

05:30.560 --> 05:36.040
Now those are one we'll call those lenses.

05:36.440 --> 05:41.130
Call that chateau MacColl this color

05:44.640 --> 05:47.080
then come down to the hair.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.760
And we'll call this chateau

05:56.670 --> 05:58.140
and we'll call this color

06:01.980 --> 06:03.320
great.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.320
Now we can close both these folders down.
