00:00.560 --> 00:03.890
All right you guys let's talk about animation.

00:03.980 --> 00:05.420
So what is animation.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.970
Animation is a series of Frings still shots of motion.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.180
So when you're watching a movie and you posit you'll see that you can skip forward frame by frame or

00:17.180 --> 00:19.160
backwards frame by frame.

00:19.310 --> 00:23.530
Each one of those frames are still shot of a motion.

00:23.930 --> 00:30.380
So when somebody is walking you'll see here there's all these different frames that go in to a character

00:30.380 --> 00:31.610
walking.

00:31.610 --> 00:36.350
Now this is a very simplified version of a walk cycle and this is what we're going to be creating for

00:36.350 --> 00:37.630
our character.

00:38.090 --> 00:39.700
So we're going to go over it now.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.760
So the first frame is just our character standing there.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.750
We've already created this frame.

00:44.990 --> 00:49.370
The next frame is going to be the contact frame contact frame is where the feet are both touching the

00:49.370 --> 00:51.560
ground and they're spread apart.

00:52.440 --> 00:57.810
The next frame is going to be the passing frame with the passing frame is when both legs come back to

00:57.810 --> 01:02.040
about Center and they're passing each other to switch sides.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.400
The next frame will be another contact frame.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.860
And as you can see it's just like our first contact frame.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.670
The only differences is the legs have switched positions.

01:11.710 --> 01:14.900
So now this leg is going to be on the front side.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.450
And this leg is going to be in the back.

01:20.070 --> 01:25.800
Then once they've done that second contact frame they're going to switch back to a passing frame where

01:25.800 --> 01:30.750
the legs will pass back by each other so that they can get back to this position.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.160
Now if you start to get confused with which way the leg should be crisscrossing you can go ahead and

01:38.160 --> 01:40.690
use your fingers as a little walking person.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.690
Make sure they're pointing in the same direction as your character and use those as reference and pretend

01:45.690 --> 01:48.190
like they're just walking.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.970
You'll also notice that the arms change a little bit.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.130
Now sensor character is holding a spear.

01:53.130 --> 01:58.300
He's not going to do a full swinging back motion with his arm but his arms are going to move.

01:58.350 --> 02:03.840
So you'll see here he is holding the spear and it's going to come down a little bit in this frame.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.080
This arm is in the next frame.

02:06.090 --> 02:10.730
His arm is going to come up a little bit and in the next frame it's going to go all the way up.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.720
And then when it comes back to the crossing frame it's going to go back to mid level and then when the

02:15.720 --> 02:21.510
animation starts all the way back over at this frame his arm will come back down and it will just go

02:21.510 --> 02:25.890
through this over and over again until the character stops walking.

02:25.890 --> 02:30.270
Now you may be thinking this is going to be really hard to recreate your character in all these different

02:30.270 --> 02:31.090
poses.

02:31.110 --> 02:37.320
There are simple ways to do this such as cutting off parts of the body and switching their sides rotating

02:37.320 --> 02:38.840
them with the Transform Tool.

02:38.970 --> 02:43.270
So it's basically just going to be repositioning parts of the body.

02:43.290 --> 02:46.600
That's mostly what this animation process is going to be.

02:46.650 --> 02:51.320
There is going to be a little bit of drawing and recreation of some of the body parts.

02:51.360 --> 02:58.360
So your assignment is to download this image from the resources on this lecture and bring it into Photoshop.

02:58.380 --> 03:05.160
And what I want you guys to do is I want you to redraw all of these poses and draw them at least three

03:05.160 --> 03:06.660
times each.

03:06.660 --> 03:12.870
Do this three times and you'll be pretty set to go ahead and start animating your character.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.930
If you don't have a tablet to draw in Photoshop you can go ahead and just draw these poses with paper

03:18.930 --> 03:20.500
and pencil.

03:20.750 --> 03:25.340
If you try to draw your poses and something doesn't look right about them go ahead and post them in

03:25.340 --> 03:31.100
the Q and A section of the course and you can ask for help and me or another student can help you and

03:31.100 --> 03:34.180
point out some of the things that you might be doing wrong.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.490
All right.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.720
I hope to see you in the next lecture and I can't wait to get animating.
