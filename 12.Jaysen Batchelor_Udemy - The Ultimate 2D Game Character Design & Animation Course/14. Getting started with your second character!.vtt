WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:08.100
OK let's move on to our next character now this character is made out of very simple shapes.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.060
And we want to keep him very simple overall.

00:11.220 --> 00:16.790
So we're going to make him out of solid colors without really any shadowing at all.

00:16.830 --> 00:19.450
So let's go ahead and let's get started.

00:19.800 --> 00:25.470
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to select both our layers we put the sketches and

00:25.470 --> 00:27.200
we're going to put them into a folder.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.910
And we'll call this for their sketch.

00:33.130 --> 00:37.870
Next we're going to do is we're going to bring down the opacity on that folder.

00:39.410 --> 00:42.460
About 50 percent.

00:42.630 --> 00:51.660
Now let's add a new layer and we'll go ahead and zoom in on our document then.

00:51.720 --> 00:58.300
Let's switch over to the Lasso tool and let's cut out the shape of his mask.

01:22.060 --> 01:22.860
Great.

01:23.290 --> 01:26.730
Now let's fill his mask in with a brown.

01:26.770 --> 01:32.740
So we're going to come over to our color picker and the color range that it's in right now is probably

01:32.740 --> 01:36.040
good but we want it to be a little bit lighter.

01:36.670 --> 01:38.650
Probably somewhere in there.

01:38.710 --> 01:39.430
OK.

01:40.260 --> 01:45.760
Let's go ahead and let's fill that in with our fill tool awesome.

01:45.910 --> 01:50.220
Next what we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer on top of that.

01:50.770 --> 01:55.650
And then we're going to make that into a layer clipping mask.

01:55.660 --> 02:01.870
Now let's grab our light brown and let's make it even lighter out there should be good.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.150
And I'm going to move more towards the yellow side

02:07.340 --> 02:13.560
and we'll switch over to our brush and making sure we have a hard edge in the paint and the edge of

02:13.560 --> 02:16.550
his mask like so next.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.570
Let's create another clipping mask.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.680
Will drag that to the top.

02:23.270 --> 02:29.630
Now let's re select this brown and then we're going to create a darker version of it.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.040
There should be good.

02:32.330 --> 02:35.770
OK then switching back over to our brush tool.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.280
We're going to paint the mask lines.

02:39.210 --> 02:45.980
Now in order to see our sketch better I'm going to turn down the opacity on our bottom layer and now

02:45.980 --> 02:48.340
we can see through all of that and see your sketch.

02:50.190 --> 02:52.880
Now let's come back to our top layer.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.680
I will go ahead and paint in those lines.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.520
Great.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.500
Now we can turn the opacity back up and see how that looks.

03:09.810 --> 03:10.700
Awesome.

03:11.160 --> 03:17.790
Next let's turn down the opacity again so we can see our sketch then we're going to add a new layer

03:17.790 --> 03:19.040
to the very top.

03:19.050 --> 03:20.910
This doesn't have to be a clipping mask.

03:22.760 --> 03:29.770
Outlets switch over to our circular marquee tool and we're going to make a circular selection about

03:29.770 --> 03:30.980
the size of his eye.

03:35.190 --> 03:38.100
Next let's fill that in with a dark green

03:46.990 --> 03:51.380
somewhere around there should work the myths fill that in.

03:52.820 --> 03:59.680
Next we're going to create a new layer on top of that and we're going to select a lighter green color

04:01.550 --> 04:03.460
somewhere around here should be good.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.870
Well OK then let's fill that in.

04:07.220 --> 04:13.760
Now unselect out of your shape then let's use the Transform Tool resize the circle.

04:14.540 --> 04:19.670
Resize it and keep it's proportions hold down shift and that'll keep it in a perfect circle.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.860
Well there should be good will.

04:23.900 --> 04:30.460
Enter ben using the grabbing move tool and the arrow keys on the keyboard are going to nudge this over

04:30.460 --> 04:32.230
till we get it about in the center.

04:35.610 --> 04:40.600
Next what we're going to do is we're going to switch over to our research tool.

04:40.760 --> 04:45.370
Now let's bring down the size until it's about the size of his iris.

04:45.410 --> 04:45.700
All right.

04:45.710 --> 04:46.550
That looks good.

04:46.550 --> 04:51.970
And now let's go ahead and make a dot and erase out that space.

04:52.810 --> 04:55.320
Now I'm going to make it a little bit bigger.

04:57.200 --> 04:57.460
All right.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.220
That looks better.

04:59.410 --> 05:06.280
Now I want to make sure that it's kind of more to the left side of the screen just because when we copy

05:06.280 --> 05:11.470
this I over to this side I'm going to flip it so it looks like his eyes looking in the other direction

05:11.770 --> 05:14.300
and just kind of give him that goofy look.

05:14.290 --> 05:21.870
Next I'm going to come over to my light green and I'm going to create an even lighter green OK.

05:22.230 --> 05:28.920
Then switching back over to my brush tool and enlarging the size I'm going to go ahead and make a spot

05:28.980 --> 05:29.640
in there.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.180
All right.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.860
Now we have one eye done.

05:35.150 --> 05:38.240
Let's go ahead and let's merge those two layers.

05:39.960 --> 05:45.830
Now there is one layer and we're going to select it with the marquee tool.

05:46.040 --> 05:55.280
Copy and paste let's drag that over to the other I now I want to use the transform tool.

05:55.460 --> 06:00.460
Then right click on the eye and come down to flip horizontally.

06:00.980 --> 06:06.500
That's going to flip it so his eyes looking in the other direction then that's resizes just a little

06:06.500 --> 06:09.140
bit should be a good way.

06:09.180 --> 06:14.340
Enter make sure it's in the right position.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.720
Great.

06:15.740 --> 06:20.400
Now let's just merge those two eyes together to make things clearer.

06:20.600 --> 06:29.780
Next let's add a new layer then let's bring the opacity back up on our bottom layer so we can see everything.

06:29.980 --> 06:31.060
It's looking good.

06:31.830 --> 06:36.690
Now I want to create the mouth and the eyebrows and the same brown just darker.

06:36.690 --> 06:43.200
So we're going to select this broom then we're going to darken it.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.770
But there should be good.

06:45.060 --> 06:45.930
OK.

06:46.340 --> 06:50.830
Next let's bring the opacity back down on our bottom layer.

06:51.960 --> 06:58.540
Then we'll come up to our top layer and out a new layer above that and let's switch over to our brush

06:58.540 --> 07:13.730
tool and we're just going to paint in these eyebrows and this mouth.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.720
And again just go ahead and use my race tool if I want to reshape the shape that I created.

07:31.620 --> 07:36.470
Now let's turn the bottom layer back on so we can see it.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.760
All right it's looking good.

07:38.760 --> 07:44.520
Now I'm going to add just a little bit of shadow to give these eyebrows and this mouth some definition.

07:44.520 --> 07:54.590
So coming back up to that layer and then darkening my brown and I'm going to shrink my brush size down.

07:54.750 --> 08:00.540
I'm just going to follow along the top of his mouth like so then I'm going to fill in this corner of

08:00.540 --> 08:01.670
his mouth was chateau

08:08.650 --> 08:09.700
awesome.

08:09.700 --> 08:13.490
Now let's add a shadow to the bottom of his eyebrows.

08:22.620 --> 08:23.040
All right.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.920
Looks good next.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.140
Let's put all of his mask into a folder.

08:28.650 --> 08:34.080
So we'll select all the way down to the bottom layer and then put them into a folder and let's call

08:34.080 --> 08:35.670
that Fuller mask.

08:39.260 --> 08:47.510
Now let's add a new layer underneath our mask folder and we're going to use this to create the ear.

08:47.810 --> 08:51.210
So let's grab a bronze skin tone.

08:54.430 --> 08:55.940
Someone there should do it.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.910
OK.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.480
And then we're just going to paint that ear I'm using our brush to

09:04.680 --> 09:15.460
like so Next let's create a new layer above that then we're going to select a gray color should do and

09:15.460 --> 09:34.090
then we're just going to use the lasso tool to trace out this feather.

09:34.100 --> 09:39.590
Next we're going to use the lasso tool to cut out some niches into our feathered

09:47.030 --> 09:49.750
just like we did with the chips on the sword.

09:51.350 --> 09:54.370
Now this is just to make it look more like a feather.

10:05.610 --> 10:06.030
Awesome.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.620
That should be good.

10:07.620 --> 10:12.110
Next we're going to grab a darker gray about there should be good.

10:12.480 --> 10:18.630
And using our brush tool and bringing the size down we're going to go ahead and make the stem whips

10:19.080 --> 10:24.220
make the stem of our feather like so now that we've done that.

10:24.260 --> 10:28.490
Let's add a new layer above this feather next.

10:28.530 --> 10:34.870
Let's add a new layer above this one and we're going to make it into a clipping mask.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.130
We've done that.

10:37.130 --> 10:42.950
Let's make a copy of both these layers so we'll select both of them and then copy them by hitting control

10:42.970 --> 10:43.670
J.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
Recommand J.

10:44.810 --> 10:51.050
On a Mac then let's use the grab and move tool to move our copy.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.020
All right.

10:52.040 --> 10:59.410
Now let's come back to our original clipping mask and we're going to fill it in with the color blue.

10:59.720 --> 11:08.270
So let's come up to blue and somewhere around there should be good.

11:08.260 --> 11:08.840
All right.

11:09.030 --> 11:09.910
OK.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.020
And just using our fill tool we'll go ahead and fill that in.

11:14.180 --> 11:20.570
Next we're going to change it's a layer type to multiply which is up here at the top.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.050
I hit that.

11:22.370 --> 11:23.270
Awesome.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.120
Now let's work on our second feather.

11:26.300 --> 11:34.200
So we'll come up to the second clipping mask and then we're going to fill that with the color red.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.300
So somewhere in there should be good.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.410
Let's do saturated.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.480
Just a little bit.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.380
OK.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.710
And let's fill that in.

11:44.730 --> 11:50.670
Next we're going to also change this the layers type to multiply.

11:50.670 --> 11:51.340
Great.

11:52.260 --> 11:55.810
Next let's add these cool little stripes that we put in our sketch.

11:56.010 --> 12:00.810
So I'm going to darken our color to a pretty dark version of it.

12:00.870 --> 12:01.820
OK.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.850
Then using our brush tool will go ahead and we'll brush in those stripes.

12:05.850 --> 12:18.230
Now let's paint them in and sort of a fashion.

12:18.260 --> 12:21.590
Now let's go ahead and let's merge these two layers together.

12:21.590 --> 12:24.000
So the feather is one layer.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.060
So now that's one layer.

12:26.300 --> 12:30.510
Let's do the same with our blue feather.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.330
So that's one layer.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.550
Great.

12:33.590 --> 12:42.170
Now let's grab our red layer and let's move it into position like so now we can go ahead and copy that

12:42.170 --> 12:46.360
feather by selecting it with the marquee tool and pasting it

12:49.310 --> 12:51.390
and then we can use the transform tool.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.750
To rotate it in position

12:58.190 --> 12:58.570
next.

12:58.600 --> 13:05.250
Let's come back down to our blue feather and let's select that with the marquee tool and we'll copy

13:05.430 --> 13:09.660
and paste and put that into position.

13:10.860 --> 13:20.810
So like so paste it one last time bring it into position use the Transform Tool to rotate it.

13:20.830 --> 13:28.360
We're also going to right click it and come down to flip vertically That way the feather won't have

13:28.420 --> 13:31.500
the patterns on the same exact side as the other one.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.700
Let's turn it.

13:33.760 --> 13:40.040
So now you can see that little snippet is on the right side of the feather rather than the left side

13:40.040 --> 13:40.660
of the feather.

13:41.870 --> 13:42.220
OK.

13:42.310 --> 13:44.230
So get that into position.

13:48.210 --> 13:51.570
Now let's go ahead and let's merge all those feather layers.

13:51.570 --> 13:53.200
So we'll select all of them.

13:53.220 --> 13:58.250
Make sure you don't select the ear and we're going to go ahead and merge those.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.210
So now the feathers are one layer.

14:00.210 --> 14:04.560
Now let's go ahead and let's put the feathers and that year into their own folder.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.440
We're going to call this full their feathers

14:11.500 --> 14:12.160
awesome.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.870
So we just finished the entire head of our character.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.790
That was pretty quick.

14:16.810 --> 14:21.180
It just goes to show you that you can create game artwork pretty fast if you just put some practice

14:21.180 --> 14:21.880
in.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.120
All right.

14:22.130 --> 14:26.000
And the next lecture will go ahead and we'll move on to creating his body.
