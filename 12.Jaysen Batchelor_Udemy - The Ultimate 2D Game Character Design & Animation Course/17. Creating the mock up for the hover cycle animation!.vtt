00:00.630 --> 00:03.930
All right let's go ahead and create our mock up.

00:03.930 --> 00:09.330
So first thing we're going to do is we want to open up one of our old mockup tasks doesn't matter which

00:09.330 --> 00:12.420
one it is because we're going to save it out as a new test.

00:12.420 --> 00:16.910
So I have our animation test too which is where he's jumping up and down.

00:17.160 --> 00:24.140
So first thing I want to do is I want to delete all of my layers then I'm going to go ahead and delete

00:24.350 --> 00:28.150
all of my friends.

00:28.520 --> 00:35.060
Now we can go ahead and start grabbing our brains of one of the time and dropping them into our mock

00:35.060 --> 00:37.130
up test.

00:37.130 --> 00:40.520
So go ahead and get him into position.

00:40.520 --> 00:49.960
Now this will be very easy to line up since all of their poses are exactly the same.

00:49.970 --> 00:55.910
Remember you'll get the pink box around your character if they're completely lined up.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.820
So everything looks good.

01:25.820 --> 01:31.760
So first off what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn off all of my layers except for frame one and

01:31.760 --> 01:37.450
we can go ahead and add a new frame and turn off frame one and turn on frame 2.

01:37.520 --> 01:44.090
And like we've done previously we're going to go ahead and do this for every frame so add a new frame

01:44.140 --> 01:47.510
turn off the previous frame turn on the new frame.

01:47.600 --> 01:53.770
We'll just do that until we get to frame 6.

01:53.770 --> 01:54.130
All right.

01:54.160 --> 01:54.490
Great.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.180
So we've done that

01:58.330 --> 01:59.400
looking good.

01:59.400 --> 01:59.760
All right.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.540
Let's go ahead and play it and see how it looks.

02:05.270 --> 02:05.560
All right.

02:05.580 --> 02:06.550
Awesome.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.350
It's got a nice little hover there to his head.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.690
So this looks pretty good.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.320
All right.

02:12.470 --> 02:17.180
I hope this has been really cool and exciting for you to learn how to animate your own character in

02:17.180 --> 02:19.450
Photoshop in the next lectures.

02:19.460 --> 02:25.610
I'm going to show you how you can bring in these right sheets into unity the game engine and get them

02:25.610 --> 02:28.890
ready and prepped for an actual game.

02:28.910 --> 02:33.980
Now this isn't a programming course so I'm not going to show you how to program your character to move

02:34.010 --> 02:34.870
and do all that stuff.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.530
But I will show you how to get them ready for that stage.

02:39.310 --> 02:42.860
Thank you for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
