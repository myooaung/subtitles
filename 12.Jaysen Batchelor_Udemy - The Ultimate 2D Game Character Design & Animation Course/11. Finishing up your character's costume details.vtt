00:00.780 --> 00:04.720
All right next let's work on the pants and the boots.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.410
So let's come to our pants layer and we're going to create a new clipping mask.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.930
Will drag that above our color layer then.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.030
Let's select this color.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.030
Now let's find a shadow for it.

00:19.260 --> 00:24.200
It's best to go darker because you can always bring down the opacity on your.

00:25.660 --> 00:30.630
OK now let's brush in those shadows.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.360
Right here just the shadows for the

01:00.820 --> 01:01.710
Great.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.880
Now let's bring down the opacity on those shadows.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.110
Think about their looks good.

01:14.110 --> 01:19.900
Next let's add an extra dark shadow right here on this alleged between the shirt and the pants.

01:19.900 --> 01:25.630
The way we'll do that is by coming over to our shadow layer and selecting its shape by holding down

01:25.630 --> 01:33.200
control or command and then hitting the thumb extra going to create a new clipping layer.

01:33.940 --> 01:40.210
And we want to make sure it's above our shadow layer then we're going to use our color picker to select

01:40.210 --> 01:42.040
this shadow blue.

01:42.380 --> 01:44.760
And then we're going to darken that even more.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.090
But there should be good.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.190
And make sure you're on a soft edged brush.

01:55.330 --> 01:58.720
We're going to paint in a line right about there.

01:59.750 --> 02:00.690
Awesome.

02:00.710 --> 02:02.530
Now we can unselect out of that shape.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.650
Looking pretty good.

02:05.730 --> 02:10.080
Now let's label these layers so we'll call this layer shadow

02:13.610 --> 02:14.850
called the next layer chateau

02:19.260 --> 02:21.530
call this last layer color.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.750
Now we can close the folder.

02:26.830 --> 02:34.000
Now let's work on our boot those create a new clipping mask and let's bring it to the very top of our

02:34.000 --> 02:35.780
layers.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.190
Now we'll select our blue color.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.700
We'll create a shadow color for it.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.070
OK.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.040
Now let's brush that in.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.560
Make sure we switch back over to a hard edged brush.

02:50.590 --> 02:53.390
Now we can paint in those shadows.

02:53.740 --> 03:15.260
So I just go ahead right away the areas that I don't want.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.320
Sometimes the best way to learn is to just watch somebody do

03:36.940 --> 03:38.260
great.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.600
Now let's turn down the opacity on the shadow

03:46.470 --> 03:47.640
think that looks good.

03:48.530 --> 03:52.970
And now we're going to do the same thing we did with the shadow from our shirt.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.980
So let's select the shape

03:57.880 --> 03:58.240
next.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.620
Let's add a new clipping layer and bring it above our shadow.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.610
Then we'll select this color we'll bring down the darkness

04:12.620 --> 04:15.490
then switch over to a softer brush.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.710
And then we'll paint in that under shadow

04:26.950 --> 04:27.770
great.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.200
Now we can unselect out of that shape.

04:30.310 --> 04:35.460
Now as you can see it got up here on the top part of the Buu which we don't want it there.

04:35.510 --> 04:37.940
So using our race tool will just erase that.

04:44.690 --> 04:47.070
Now let's add some highlights.

04:47.810 --> 04:49.060
So we'll select or boot colored

04:51.980 --> 04:53.460
and we're going to lighten that

04:58.290 --> 04:58.760
next.

04:58.800 --> 05:05.560
Let's add a new clipping mask and bring above our shadow layer.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.090
Make sure that you switch back to a hard edged brush

05:12.630 --> 05:17.400
and I'm going to add a highlight right here on the top of the boot.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.000
This little lip.

05:22.440 --> 05:38.510
I'm also going to add a highlight here on this top of the boot.

05:38.550 --> 05:43.120
Then let's not forget to label our layers so we'll call this first one.

05:43.550 --> 05:43.890
I like

05:49.750 --> 05:51.260
call this next one to Chateau

05:56.320 --> 05:57.590
called the next one.

05:57.620 --> 06:03.490
Chateau.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.860
And then we'll call this the last one color.

06:10.350 --> 06:11.460
We can close up fuller.
