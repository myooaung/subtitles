00:00.630 --> 00:04.380
Now we need to do the final sketch of our characters.

00:05.160 --> 00:11.130
Now the first one you want to do is we want to select all our layers with our drawings on it and merge

00:11.130 --> 00:12.770
them into one layer.

00:13.820 --> 00:21.230
The way you do that is by clicking the top layer holding down shift and coming down to the last layer

00:21.230 --> 00:27.520
you want to select which will be our layer right above the background layer.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.720
So do that and now you can see it selects all those layers.

00:31.720 --> 00:37.090
Next we're going to do is we're going to right click on one of those layers and you'll see these menus

00:37.090 --> 00:38.110
come up.

00:38.110 --> 00:43.510
We're going to select merge layers and now those layers have become one layer.

00:43.510 --> 00:48.040
So if I turn that layer off you'll see all of the drawing disappears.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.770
Turn it back on.

00:49.810 --> 00:54.800
The reason why we did this is just to keep things clean and organized.

00:54.820 --> 00:59.210
Next what we're going to do is we're going to bring down the opacity on this drawing.

00:59.650 --> 01:07.460
So we'll come over to the opacity and drag it down to about 40 percent what we want to do with this

01:07.460 --> 01:11.590
final sketch is really get in all the detail and define everything.

01:11.630 --> 01:16.060
So as you can see here this arm is pretty undefined in this final sketch.

01:16.060 --> 01:18.590
We want to define that completely.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.460
So let's go ahead and get started.

01:21.500 --> 01:27.150
I'm first going to move my drawing over by using the grabbing move tool and I'm going to re Centrum.

01:27.290 --> 01:31.660
So that way we can see the whole image next.

01:31.680 --> 01:39.560
I'm going to add a new layer that I'm going to select my brush tool and we're going to continue drawing

01:39.560 --> 01:40.010
on this.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.700
And we're basically going to trace it.

01:42.770 --> 01:55.080
We just want to trace it with better definition.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.360
Now this doesn't have to be perfect because this isn't going to be the final piece of artwork.

01:59.370 --> 02:09.080
This is just going to be our guide when creating our final character.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.820
So what I'm trying to do now is really define this

02:16.420 --> 02:23.110
want to get away from the sketch you look and start writing solid lines that will act as guidelines

02:23.110 --> 02:30.080
for us when we're creating and filling them with colors can be a little tricky when you're trying to

02:30.080 --> 02:33.150
fill in shapes are not hard to find.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.490
So right here you'll see way more definition to them actually how a shape

02:48.770 --> 02:51.200
don't worry about making mistakes you can always undo

03:07.430 --> 03:11.990
this on was pretty undefined it was based.

03:12.410 --> 03:15.090
You got the idea that it was an arm right here.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.370
I'm really going to draw that.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.750
You can see where it is our

03:35.760 --> 03:41.500
right here what I'm doing is I'm creating one from one point to another.

03:41.540 --> 03:47.810
And the way I'm doing that is by cooking with a brush holding down shift and then clicking on any other

03:47.810 --> 03:52.860
area and that will create a straight line from one point to be over.

03:53.030 --> 03:58.230
Once I've done that I would just go ahead and sell the areas that are in front of his face.

04:24.870 --> 04:27.890
Also any lines that shouldn't really be there.

04:27.890 --> 04:28.850
I'll leave those out.

04:28.890 --> 04:33.670
So this year before it was basically a circle but now it's more of a C shape.

04:33.990 --> 04:38.710
So it looks a lot more like a leaf at the bottom of his eyes.

05:09.080 --> 05:13.790
I don't have some lines just to define where his gloves begin.

05:19.970 --> 05:20.330
All right.

05:20.390 --> 05:25.080
Now let's move on to our second character.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.850
I'm just going to do the same thing.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.250
Going to select all my layers I want to merge by clicking the top layer pulling down shift and coming

05:33.250 --> 05:35.290
down to the bottom layer.

05:36.440 --> 05:45.030
And then right clicking going to merge layers will bring down the opacity.

05:45.280 --> 05:50.130
I had a new layer and then we can begin to sketch on top of this.

05:55.420 --> 06:04.240
So the sky wasn't very defined in the first song on a one word definition defined his eyes a lot more.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.690
I'm going to define this side of his mouse.

06:06.750 --> 06:16.000
You can tell I wouldn't also see very simple eyebrows and I'm finding those feathers on his head also

07:15.800 --> 07:17.180
with the style of this character.

07:17.180 --> 07:24.160
I want to keep them extremely simple which is why I keep enormous shapes such as feet and whom's

07:36.970 --> 07:43.450
remember if you don't have a drawing tablet you can go ahead and do this with a pencil or pen and then

07:43.450 --> 07:45.320
just scan didn't put it in for

07:50.340 --> 07:51.330
fantastic.

07:51.390 --> 07:55.290
So now we have our final refined sketches.

07:55.290 --> 08:00.480
And like I said they don't have to be perfect they just have to get the idea across and have to be enough

08:00.570 --> 08:05.180
of a base that you can actually create your character from it.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.790
I hope this lecture was helpful for you and I can't wait to see you in the next one.
