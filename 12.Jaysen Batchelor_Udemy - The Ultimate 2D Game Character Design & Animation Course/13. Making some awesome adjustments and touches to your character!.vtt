00:00.910 --> 00:06.410
All right now that we're at the end we're going to add a few things to kind of make our piece of artwork

00:06.530 --> 00:10.090
pop and also look more professional.

00:10.190 --> 00:13.430
Now you may be designing a character for various reasons.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.580
It might be for marketing.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.660
It might be for actual game play.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.310
It might be for an animated short that you're creating.

00:21.830 --> 00:28.640
I'm just going to show you a few things you can do to help create more of a presentable character design.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.850
So the first thing I want to do real quick is I want to add a shadow to the edge of his head just to

00:34.850 --> 00:37.080
make his head pop out a little bit more.

00:37.190 --> 00:44.840
So I'm going to come to the head folder then I'm going to come down to the head shape which is our original

00:44.840 --> 00:52.280
value and on this layer I'm going to add an effect the way you do that is by coming down here to this

00:52.280 --> 00:54.610
little f x symbol.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.510
So we'll click that and it gives us some options.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.760
What we want to do is we want to do an inner glow.

01:00.930 --> 01:06.450
So we'll hit inner glow and you can see it adds a glow around the edge.

01:06.470 --> 01:14.540
This can also be used as a shadow so the color we want is going to be the same color as the shadow on

01:14.540 --> 01:16.370
his forehead from the goggles.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.820
So we're going to come over here to our color selection will click that.

01:20.090 --> 01:25.490
And now we can use our eyedropper to select that color in there.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.980
All right looks good.

01:27.210 --> 01:28.220
OK.

01:28.550 --> 01:33.620
Now I think the size of my shadow looks good but just in case yours doesn't.

01:33.620 --> 01:39.920
You can see here you have all these different ways that you can change your shadow so you can see here

01:39.950 --> 01:48.370
the choke changes the heart or softness of your edge and the size will change the size of your shadow.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.040
So let's bring that back down.

01:52.310 --> 01:52.980
Right.

01:53.420 --> 01:54.960
So then we can hit OK.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.400
And I think that adds a little bit more depth to our image.

02:00.430 --> 02:06.610
Now if you're creating this to present as a character design in itself you'd probably want to ground

02:06.610 --> 02:10.720
your character and what that means is just giving it a little bit of floor right here for him to be

02:10.720 --> 02:12.440
standing on.

02:12.880 --> 02:19.910
The way we can do that is by first closing our head folder then we're going to come down to the very

02:19.910 --> 02:21.890
bottom and right above the sketch.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.850
We're going to add a new layer now on this layer.

02:25.850 --> 02:28.810
We're going to add a shadow on the ground.

02:28.850 --> 02:38.360
So I'm thinking we're going to use a grayish yellowish maybe in the lighter areas up here.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.600
And we want to make sure our color is more towards the yellow side.

02:42.690 --> 02:51.360
OK then let's use our brush and we're going to kind of paint in an area right here.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.070
Just like that.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.550
Now doesn't have to be perfect.

02:57.550 --> 03:00.250
It can be a little messy a little abstract.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.170
That's right.

03:02.410 --> 03:09.880
Now let's take the same color and let's just darken it and let's maybe move it more towards the orange

03:09.880 --> 03:10.600
side.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.360
OK.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.170
Then bringing down the size of our brush.

03:16.110 --> 03:20.000
We can paint in a second line.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.140
That will act is the darker part of our shadow.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.780
Now if you want it can even add little bits of grass or rocks down here.

03:31.790 --> 03:36.190
So I'm going to add some tiny little pieces of grass just paint them in

03:47.380 --> 03:47.950
cool.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.890
I'm going to do the same thing for a lighter color.

03:49.900 --> 03:55.240
Saw recently that color going I'll just add in some more little pieces of grass

04:01.110 --> 04:02.470
cool.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.710
So now he's got a ground to stand on.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.650
The next thing I want to show you is how to add texture to your character so you may want to add some

04:10.650 --> 04:17.370
speckles on your character or you may want to add some watercolor type texture to it whatever it may

04:17.370 --> 04:17.810
be.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.870
You can easily add texture.

04:20.190 --> 04:25.320
We're going to do this is by selecting all of our layers except for the background then we're going

04:25.320 --> 04:27.900
to put them into a folder.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.580
Next we're going to grab a texture.

04:30.780 --> 04:35.530
Now I already have a watercolor texture here that I grabbed off the Internet.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.760
It's really easy to find textures online.

04:37.770 --> 04:44.340
All you have to do is google image search them and you can find everything from paper textures to rock

04:44.340 --> 04:47.220
textures to wood textures whatever you want.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.620
You can find it.

04:48.690 --> 04:54.010
So once you brought it into Photoshop let's just go ahead and copy it.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.640
Then we're going to paste it into this docu

05:04.500 --> 05:08.400
next what we want to do is we want to turn this player into a clipping mask.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.450
Now since everything is in that folder it's going to create a clipping mask around everything that's

05:14.460 --> 05:15.340
in that folder.

05:15.510 --> 05:23.670
So we'll go layer create a clipping mask and you can see that watercolor paper is only showing up within

05:23.670 --> 05:25.670
the shape of our character.

05:25.680 --> 05:31.770
Next we're going to change our layer type to multiply that will allow us to see the texture and our

05:31.770 --> 05:36.160
character and its colors through like so.

05:36.510 --> 05:41.310
So now if we zoom in there you'll see we have some good texture on our character.

05:41.310 --> 05:45.270
It looks like he was painted with watercolor.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.210
Now let's just do one more example.

05:47.230 --> 05:51.610
So you want to add some paint speckles in there.

05:51.850 --> 05:57.360
We can go ahead and copy our paint speckled texture and paste it in.

05:57.370 --> 06:01.570
Make sure you paste it in underneath this watercolor texture.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.380
That way it'll automatically turn it into a clipping mask.

06:05.830 --> 06:10.360
Next what we want to do is we want to change the layer type to screen.

06:10.480 --> 06:16.850
What screen will do is it'll get rid of all the black and leave the white and we can bring down the

06:16.850 --> 06:21.740
opacity.

06:21.970 --> 06:25.810
And now you can see it leaves some nice speckling on our character.

06:26.810 --> 06:30.630
Next thing I want to show you is how you can change colors on your character.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.640
So let's come to the very top layer.

06:34.070 --> 06:38.840
And then let's add a hue and saturation layer.

06:39.100 --> 06:45.280
Now if we come up to the hue you can see if we change it it changes all the colors and we don't want

06:45.280 --> 06:45.830
that.

06:46.120 --> 06:51.220
So what we're going to do is we're going to come up here to this master dropdown menu.

06:51.220 --> 06:54.870
Now you can see that it has all these different options for colors.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.580
Well that's going to do is it's going to change whatever color you have selected.

06:59.680 --> 07:05.140
So if we do yellow for example now everything that has a yellow in it will be affected when we start

07:05.200 --> 07:06.780
changing the sliders.

07:06.790 --> 07:11.280
So if we start changing the hue everything that's yellow will start changing colors.

07:14.930 --> 07:22.670
If we turn up the saturation everything that's yellow will go up and saturation and we can also turn

07:22.670 --> 07:26.730
down the darkness on everything that has yellow in it.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.070
So pretty cool.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.670
Lastly I want to show you how to add a cool glow to your character.

07:33.080 --> 07:39.860
Sometimes you'll see and animations in games in anime they'll have a glow around them and I'm going

07:39.860 --> 07:42.090
to show you how you can create that glow.

07:42.470 --> 07:44.740
So we're going to open our full there back up.

07:44.740 --> 07:52.430
It has all of our layers in it and we're going to select all of them including the bottom layer which

07:52.430 --> 07:54.880
is the ground.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.170
Then we're going to copy those.

07:57.180 --> 08:02.990
By going control J on your keyboard and if you're on a Mac it's going to be command.

08:03.230 --> 08:06.480
And now we've just copied all of those layers.

08:06.590 --> 08:10.540
Next we're going to merge all of those together.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.310
So now we have one solid image of our character.

08:14.540 --> 08:21.410
We're going to drag that up to the very top of our layers and then we're going to use the one tool.

08:21.410 --> 08:24.400
Now the one tool is this little tool right here.

08:24.830 --> 08:30.320
The Haki for it is the letter W and what to do is it will select solid colors.

08:30.320 --> 08:37.250
So if we click on this white area it will select everything that is white and let's hold down shift

08:37.610 --> 08:42.950
and that will allow us to add other shapes to this so we can add in that empty space right there and

08:42.950 --> 08:44.850
the empty space between his legs.

08:47.110 --> 08:56.140
Now let's add a new layer above that and we're going to fill it with the color white so using our fill

08:56.140 --> 08:58.010
tool will fill that in.

08:58.090 --> 09:02.830
And since it's a completely new layer with nothing on it it will fill in everything so it'll fill this

09:02.860 --> 09:04.450
outside area between the legs.

09:04.450 --> 09:07.630
And over here just by clicking one.

09:07.810 --> 09:15.950
Now what we want to do is unselect out of the selection and let's delete this copy of our character.

09:16.320 --> 09:24.110
So Will had delete and now what we're left with is we're left with just this white outside shell.

09:24.110 --> 09:28.460
So if I use my grab a move tool you see that I can grab it and move it around.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.730
So it's there.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.090
Let's undo that.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.510
So it goes back into position.

09:33.620 --> 09:40.250
Now let's go to our filters and we'll come down to learn.

09:40.610 --> 09:43.940
Then wash and blur.

09:44.070 --> 09:47.750
What this allows us to do is blur our layer.

09:47.850 --> 09:53.520
So as you can see the white part of our layer is being blurred and it's seeping over onto our actual

09:53.700 --> 09:58.570
character which is giving us the illusion of a back glow.

09:58.620 --> 10:03.660
So I'm going to leave this at 3 pixels but if you want you can play around with this if you bring it

10:03.660 --> 10:03.810
up.

10:03.810 --> 10:07.580
You see how blurry it gets if you bring it down gets a less blurry.

10:07.830 --> 10:13.350
But I'm going to leave it at 3 so I'm just going to type 3 in that I think that looks good.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.000
Hit OK.

10:15.140 --> 10:20.570
Now if that's too much glow for you what you can do is you can turn down the opacity.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.380
So I think about 80 percent will look good.

10:24.950 --> 10:25.480
All right.

10:25.490 --> 10:26.060
Awesome.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.800
I think this character looks really cool.

10:28.820 --> 10:29.790
I hope you agree.

10:29.870 --> 10:33.830
And if you're creating your own character Oh yours looks awesome too.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.320
I'd love to see it in the Q&amp;A section of this course.

10:37.370 --> 10:43.580
So go ahead and post your artwork to the Q&amp;A section of the course and also post them to the Facebook

10:43.580 --> 10:44.480
group.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.460
All of us would love to see your progress.

10:46.580 --> 10:50.230
And it's really good to get feedback from people and critiques.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.190
I'm always going through the Facebook group and the Q and A section of the course to give people feedback

10:55.250 --> 10:56.750
that want it.

10:56.780 --> 11:00.460
Thanks for watching this lecture and I can't wait to see you in the next one.
