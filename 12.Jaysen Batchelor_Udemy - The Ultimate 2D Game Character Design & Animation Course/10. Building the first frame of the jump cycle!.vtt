00:00.770 --> 00:05.000
Let's start creating our first frame of the jump cycle.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.360
So if you remember the first frame of the jump cycle is going to be the crouch where the knees bend

00:11.360 --> 00:17.390
into a crouch the back bends over the arms come up a little bit and that's going to be him getting ready

00:17.390 --> 00:18.550
to jump.

00:18.560 --> 00:25.010
So the first thing I want to do is we want to start off with our frame one of the standing pose for

00:25.010 --> 00:34.010
our base so we're going to start off with the frame one of the standing pose as our base for this frame.

00:34.010 --> 00:41.090
So first what we want to do is selecting our body layer or going to cut out these legs.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.450
Now we want to keep the feet there and you'll see why in a second.

00:44.670 --> 00:58.920
But for now we're just going to select the legs just like so make sure you don't get the feet.

00:59.490 --> 01:04.770
Now the reason why we left the feet is because when you start to crouch down we want the feet to say

01:04.770 --> 01:06.280
in the exact same position.

01:06.300 --> 01:13.430
It's just the legs we want to move next for we want to do is we want to copy these feet so we'll go

01:14.160 --> 01:18.460
copy and then we're going to paste them paste.

01:18.510 --> 01:24.250
Now let's grab these feet and we're going to drag them above all of our other files and folders.

01:24.630 --> 01:25.940
Now using our grab move tool.

01:25.950 --> 01:32.430
Let's go ahead and make sure that those line up with our original fee then we can go ahead and select

01:32.430 --> 01:38.100
the feet on our body layer and we can go ahead and delete those.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.790
So those have been deleted.

01:40.140 --> 01:44.370
Now the reason why we put those feet all the way up at the top of our layer is because it's going to

01:44.370 --> 01:52.140
be quicker and easier to just hold down shift and select all of these folders rather than having to

01:52.140 --> 01:55.720
use control to select each one individually.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.830
So by putting the feet up there it leaves them out of the selection.

02:01.080 --> 02:08.390
So now let's use the Transform Tool and we're going to grab this point right here in the center of our

02:08.390 --> 02:09.330
selection.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.020
Now what this is this is the pivot point.

02:12.110 --> 02:16.460
This is where if we rotate our selection it's going to pivot at this point.

02:16.460 --> 02:19.960
So we want to move that to his hip.

02:20.030 --> 02:22.000
So somewhere in there should be good.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.370
So now we rotate it will rotate at that pivot point

02:28.400 --> 02:35.540
Great we'll go and hit enter next what we want to do is using the grabbing move tool and then using

02:35.540 --> 02:37.320
the arrow keys on our keyboard.

02:37.580 --> 02:42.310
We're going to nudge him down just a little bit so we can begin to squat him down.

02:44.070 --> 02:45.530
But there should be good.

02:45.810 --> 02:49.350
Next what we're going to do is we are going to animate those arms.

02:49.350 --> 02:55.060
So we want those arms to come up just a little bit enough that a spear isn't touching the ground.

02:55.290 --> 03:01.500
So we're going to select this arm layer and the spear folder and then using the transform tool will

03:01.530 --> 03:02.940
go ahead and rotate

03:10.030 --> 03:11.980
about there should be good.

03:12.190 --> 03:16.590
Then let's come up to our body layer and using the Lasso tool.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.250
We're going to go ahead and cut that arm out.

03:21.450 --> 03:24.750
So then let's go ahead and rotate it

03:27.600 --> 03:29.850
and get it in two position.

03:30.780 --> 03:37.200
Now using our paintbrush tool we're going to paint in this empty area.

03:38.650 --> 03:43.710
Make sure you're using the same skin tone awesome.

03:43.750 --> 03:50.200
Now let's go ahead and let's move on to the laig area now first thing I want to do for the legs is since

03:50.230 --> 03:55.830
he's bending over the gravitational pull on his loincloth is going to be different.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.150
So now it's kind of pulling at an angle.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.480
We want it to be pulling straight down.

04:00.520 --> 04:07.000
So what we can do is come into our loincloth folder and we're going to merge our two loincloth layers

04:07.000 --> 04:08.170
together.

04:11.540 --> 04:18.380
So now that's one next what we're going to do is we're going to turn on the Transform Tool.

04:18.380 --> 04:24.370
Then right clicking on our image we're going to come up to where it says warp and just like before.

04:24.380 --> 04:27.030
We're going to work this into the shape we want it.

04:27.110 --> 04:31.300
And in this case we want it to be pretty much the same just hanging.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.240
It's more straight down.

04:39.170 --> 04:42.420
Like so go ahead and hit enter.

04:43.450 --> 04:50.050
Great now we can close down that loincloths folder and let's come back into our body folder.

04:50.050 --> 04:54.010
We're going to add a new layer above our body layer.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.520
And on this layer we can go ahead and start sketching out these new legs.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.270
So I'm going to select a black color and I'm just going to go ahead and start sketching in my legs.

05:04.270 --> 05:08.340
Now just keep in mind that your legs need to connect to these feet at the bottom.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.210
That's the reason why we left him there.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.140
So we're kind of getting a front on view of this leg.

05:14.500 --> 05:22.390
So this leg you're not going to see too much of the band that will be kind of like so then the next

05:22.390 --> 05:33.930
one you're going to see it from the sides you're going to see a lot more bend.

05:34.190 --> 05:38.500
Now we can add a new layer above that then using our Lasso tool.

05:38.510 --> 05:41.180
Let's go ahead and we'll trace those shapes in

05:54.720 --> 05:57.850
then we can fill that in with our skin.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.690
Now let's go ahead and do the next one.

06:14.870 --> 06:19.060
Let's go ahead and turn off our sketch and see how that looks.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.480
Now I don't think that we got enough bend in this left leg.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.370
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and redo that leg.

06:27.620 --> 06:33.920
So I'm going to go ahead and use the erase tool to erase that leg away and then I'm going to try it

06:33.920 --> 06:34.550
again.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.840
So I think it needs a little bit more bend

06:51.480 --> 06:52.090
great.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.470
I think something like that will work better.

06:54.480 --> 07:01.410
Now some people get frustrated when you have to change things or redo things tweak colors but it's just

07:01.410 --> 07:03.680
part of the process of creating artwork.

07:03.690 --> 07:08.010
And I wanted to sort of capture that in my courses here on you to me.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.580
So that's why leave some of this stuff in.

07:10.850 --> 07:11.360
OK.

07:11.400 --> 07:19.650
Let's go ahead and put our first frame into our spreadsheet so we'll go ahead and we'll select our speir

07:19.650 --> 07:25.740
folder and select everything up all the way to this top layer that has the feet on it and we're going

07:25.740 --> 07:27.840
to copy those.

07:27.870 --> 07:30.950
Go ahead and merge them now.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.300
We'll select our top layer along with our background layer.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.630
So I'll grab both those layers and drag them into our spreadsheet and go ahead and drop them in.

07:42.630 --> 07:47.280
Now when you're creating the sprite it's all right to have different animations right next to each other

07:47.790 --> 07:52.290
because when you program your game the computer is not going to read all of them it's just going to

07:52.290 --> 07:57.960
read the specific ones that it's been assigned to for a certain task.

07:57.960 --> 08:03.600
So go ahead and put that guy into his grid and we can delete that background.

08:03.910 --> 08:08.700
And let's take this layer that we just brought in there and we're going to drag it out of this folder

08:08.790 --> 08:11.860
because he's not part of the walk right cycle.

08:12.030 --> 08:15.480
So we can go ahead and close the folder out.

08:15.800 --> 08:21.470
Now let's add a new folder and put this guy in it.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.790
And now let's label this guy from what let's label this folder.

08:27.790 --> 08:28.690
Jump right

08:31.660 --> 08:32.480
great.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.370
Now let's not forget to save out this first frame.

08:35.380 --> 08:38.190
So if we need to come back and edit it we can.

08:38.530 --> 08:46.170
So we'll go file save as and we're going to save this in a new folder.

08:46.570 --> 08:51.150
So let's add a new folder and we're going to call this jump cycle

08:54.240 --> 08:58.590
and we'll open that up and save it as EF 1 for frame 1

09:01.300 --> 09:02.170
fantastic.
