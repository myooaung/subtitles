00:00.580 --> 00:05.190
All right now let's really get started on creating these characters.

00:05.440 --> 00:12.080
Now the first step in the process is creating thumbnail sketches and a lot of them.

00:12.130 --> 00:17.070
Now this is to help you refine your character and make them very readable and unique.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.820
And just a good character overall.

00:19.810 --> 00:26.650
Now in the industry most professionals will do at least 100 thumbnails for anything from a character

00:26.650 --> 00:28.990
design to a logo design.

00:28.990 --> 00:34.900
The reason why they do this is because the first drawing you do is almost never the best one.

00:34.960 --> 00:40.600
The more you do the more ideas you can come up with and the more you can start combining different thumbnails

00:40.840 --> 00:43.710
to create the perfect sketch.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.570
Now if you don't want to do 100 thumbnails or you don't think you have the time.

00:47.710 --> 00:48.370
That's OK.

00:48.400 --> 00:55.060
But I do recommend that you do at least 20 different thumbnails so that you get the best results for

00:55.060 --> 00:56.620
your character.

00:56.620 --> 01:01.340
Now our first set of thumbnails are going to be basically just shapes for our characters.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.450
And when I say shapes what I mean is every character at least good characters can be broken down into

01:07.450 --> 01:09.190
simple shapes.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.580
I'm going to show you what I mean.

01:10.600 --> 01:16.810
So right here we have my little character sketch that I've done and I'm going to break him down into

01:16.870 --> 01:19.110
the simple shapes that he's made out of.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.810
So the first simple shape is pretty obvious.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.130
His head is just a circle.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.270
I may bring my breast size up so you can see it better.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.290
It's a circle.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.620
The next one is his body which is a rectangle.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.580
The next one would be his legs.

01:35.820 --> 01:41.380
And I'm going to leave his arms out because he's not really part of the overall simple shape of them.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.040
It's a part of his shape but not the simple shape.

01:44.580 --> 01:50.700
So you can see we've got to circle his torso and his legs and they're just broken down into very simple

01:50.700 --> 01:51.870
shapes.

01:51.870 --> 01:52.100
All right.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.780
Let's do another one.

01:53.820 --> 01:56.910
So now we have this bulldog that I did.

01:56.910 --> 02:05.470
His head is obviously a square his ears can be looked at as either ovals or even triangles.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.160
It just depends on how you look at it.

02:08.010 --> 02:19.400
The body can be looked at as a rectangle with two triangles or it can be looked at as a full triangle

02:22.230 --> 02:23.050
like so.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.130
Let's do one more.

02:27.970 --> 02:34.500
So here I have a character sketch that I've done and he's a little bit more complicated.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.450
But if we really look at it you can see that his head kind of makes the shape of a triangle with this

02:40.450 --> 02:42.540
hat.

02:42.640 --> 02:49.840
Now it's very rough but that's basically the shape that is making his body with his coat is making a

02:49.840 --> 02:51.670
big broad rectangle.

02:53.620 --> 02:57.530
Then his legs would be a little rectangle sticking out the bottom.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.590
And that's his basic character shape.

03:01.600 --> 03:08.110
Now I recommend that you also go online and go to Google images and do a quick search for character

03:08.110 --> 03:15.490
shape and this will come up with a ton of great examples of character shapes so see here they have characters

03:15.520 --> 03:18.910
and then they have their broken down shape above them.

03:18.910 --> 03:25.780
See one right here and this will help you to start thinking of your characters and drawings in terms

03:25.780 --> 03:29.460
of shapes and not necessarily lines.

03:29.470 --> 03:29.960
All right.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.900
So I'm going to go ahead and start creating my thumbnail sketches.

03:34.090 --> 03:37.810
If you don't want to watch me create all these thumbnail sketches you don't have to.

03:37.810 --> 03:43.220
You can go ahead and skip ahead if you want to watch me create these and see how I work.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.710
Go ahead and stick around.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.680
And I'm going to get to work right now.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.080
OK.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.280
So I've done about 14 sketches now.

06:34.330 --> 06:35.510
So this is a good amount.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.140
You might want to do a few more.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.880
And it's even better if you can do up to 100.

06:40.120 --> 06:45.360
I'll see you in the next lecture and we'll start to get to work on refining our thumbnail sketches.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.210
Thanks for watching.
