00:00.900 --> 00:05.870
OK let's go ahead and create the mock up for our jump cycle.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.280
So the first thing we want to do is we want to open up our animation test document.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.310
This is the document where we created the mock up for our walk cycle what we're going to do is we're

00:17.310 --> 00:22.370
going to delete out all of these layers that have the lock cycle on it.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.490
So now it's an empty document.

00:24.720 --> 00:33.030
Next what we want to do is we want to delete out all of our Frayne's just to make this document cleaned

00:33.030 --> 00:33.490
up.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.780
Now let's jump back over into our Spryte sheet and what we're going to do is one at a time.

00:39.780 --> 00:44.430
We're going to click and drag our frames over and horse Frenchy.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.680
So starting with frame one will drag that in and put it into position.

00:52.250 --> 00:56.360
So about there should do then we'll grab it frame to

01:00.140 --> 01:05.090
drop that in and get it into position as best as possible.

01:06.370 --> 01:11.570
Now this is where it's going to get a little bit tricky because our character needs to be in the same

01:12.290 --> 01:16.080
position but he's going to be in different poses.

01:16.340 --> 01:19.400
So do your best to line him up right here.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.460
We can use things like his feet to get him pretty well lined up.

01:23.960 --> 01:30.610
So now let's come back into our spreadsheet and we'll grab frame three now frame theory will also be

01:30.610 --> 01:35.930
a little bit difficult because he's airborne in this one so we need to put him up higher.

01:35.950 --> 01:43.210
So about there but again try to keep those feet lined up as best as possible.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.730
Now let's grab a frame for.

01:46.180 --> 01:48.000
This is where he's free falling.

01:48.010 --> 01:54.230
So he's going to be close to the position of frame three but a little bit lower.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.270
So right about there.

01:56.700 --> 02:04.800
Now let's grab frame five and frame five will be easier to position because he's going to match up with

02:04.800 --> 02:09.430
our first frame.

02:09.950 --> 02:14.470
You'll see when we get him lined up perfectly a pink box appears around him.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.000
That means that he's completely lined up with the first frame because they match each other.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.100
Awesome next what we want to do is we want to turn off all these layers except for frame 1

02:32.150 --> 02:39.530
next what we'll do is we'll add a new frame and then we're going to turn off frame 1 and turn on frame

02:39.530 --> 02:47.580
2 and we'll do this once more turn off frame 2 and turn on frame 3.

02:48.050 --> 02:57.290
Add a new layer turn off frame 3 turn on frame for add one more layer and turn off frame for and turn

02:57.290 --> 02:59.420
on frame 5.

02:59.420 --> 02:59.950
All right.

02:59.990 --> 03:06.830
So now we have our animation set up great.

03:07.050 --> 03:10.350
Now let's go ahead and let's see what it looks like when we play it.

03:13.150 --> 03:13.600
OK.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.900
So I can see that we didn't have it completely lined up when he jumps but that's all right.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.680
You get the idea of what a jump is going to look like.

03:20.870 --> 03:25.020
So let's say the space bar triggers the jump every time they hit the spacebar.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.160
This is what's going to happen one time.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.220
All right you guys have just created two different animation cycles.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.750
This is not necessarily easy work to do.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.810
So you should be very proud of yourself.

03:37.690 --> 03:42.670
If you want to keep this mock up I recommend that you save it out as animation too so you can keep both

03:42.670 --> 03:44.560
your mockups.

03:44.590 --> 03:50.140
Now the last animation we're going to do is his standing animation where he's going to sort of hover

03:50.140 --> 03:52.080
there while he stands that way.

03:52.090 --> 03:56.090
His standing pose isn't so motionless.

03:56.090 --> 03:59.330
All right guys remember to ask questions in the Q&amp;A section.

03:59.330 --> 04:02.050
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
