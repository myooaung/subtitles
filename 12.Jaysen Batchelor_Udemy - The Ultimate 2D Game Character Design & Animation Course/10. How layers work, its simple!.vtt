This lecture we're going to be going over the use of layers now a lot of people get pretty confused

00:07.500 --> 00:09.380
about layers but they're pretty simple.

00:09.390 --> 00:14.580
And I'm going to try to explain this to you in the simplest way possible.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.120
So layers are over here in the bottom right hand side of the screen.

00:20.370 --> 00:24.900
What a layer is it is imagine it like stacks of glass.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.780
So you have your bottom layer which is a white sheet of paper.

00:30.160 --> 00:36.400
If we add a second layer to it by coming down to this little icon that looks like a piece of paper with

00:36.400 --> 00:42.310
a folded corner we're going to click that and that will add a second layer and you'll see it stacked

00:42.310 --> 00:45.460
on top of our background layer.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.360
The Slayer.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.010
You can think of it as a sheet of glass.

00:48.010 --> 00:53.720
Like I said what we'll do is we're going to paint on it.

00:54.430 --> 00:58.750
And now what we've done is we've painted on the sheet of glass and not on the piece of paper behind

00:58.750 --> 00:59.420
it.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.740
Now we can add a second layer and on this layer we can paint a different color.

01:04.810 --> 01:12.240
So let's come and select the color red and let's paint a second squiggly line and you'll see us on top

01:12.240 --> 01:13.820
of our green one.

01:13.830 --> 01:21.320
Now the cool thing about layers is now this green layer is completely unaffected by this red layer.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.400
We turn off the red layer.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.900
You'll see the green layer is still there and vice versa.

01:28.920 --> 01:36.090
Now if we click on our bottom green layer and we drag it up above our layer too you'll see that they

01:36.090 --> 01:38.040
switch places.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.170
So when you're working with layers just imagine them like sheets of glass and they're stacked in order

01:43.200 --> 01:47.250
as you see over here on the bottom right hand side of your screen.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.020
Now there's many ways to make layers interact with each other.

01:51.030 --> 01:56.820
And the most common way that we're going to be using is by changing the layer type and the way you do

01:56.820 --> 02:02.220
that is you come up here to this little drop down menu that says normal and we're going to click the

02:02.220 --> 02:03.180
little arrow.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.940
You'll see it comes up with all these different options.

02:06.210 --> 02:13.800
So let's just go ahead and select one and we're going to select linear dodge and you'll see that the

02:13.800 --> 02:19.170
Green has disappeared and whatever has been going over the red spots has turned yellow.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.840
Now I'm not going to go into explanation of how this works exactly.

02:22.860 --> 02:30.710
I just want you to see that when you select different layer type it changes the way they interact with

02:30.710 --> 02:31.420
each other.

02:34.340 --> 02:39.770
So go ahead and create different layers with different things on them and then change the layer types

02:39.770 --> 02:43.760
to see what all the different layer types to do and really experiment with this.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.660
So you can start to grasp an understanding of what you can do with the layers and the last thing I want

02:49.660 --> 02:54.850
to show you with layers is I want to show you how to label your layers because this is going to be very

02:54.850 --> 03:01.810
important so that we can keep our document very organized and remember where everything is.

03:01.810 --> 03:07.110
Once you start adding dozens of layers over here for your project it's going to get very confusing.

03:07.120 --> 03:13.410
If they're all labeled layer one layer 2 Layer 3 you're not going to have any idea what's on that layer.

03:13.420 --> 03:18.590
So the way you label your layer is by double clicking on the word.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.860
And now you see you can select the word and you can type something else in there.

03:22.890 --> 03:26.770
So for the layer with the red squiggle on it we're going to call it red.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.410
And you can enter now you'll see it's labeled red.

03:31.500 --> 03:36.110
Let's do the same for the green.

03:36.190 --> 03:37.230
And now those are labeled.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.110
And we know what's on that layer.

03:39.330 --> 03:44.450
I hope this lecture was really helpful for you and you learned about layers and how to understand them.
