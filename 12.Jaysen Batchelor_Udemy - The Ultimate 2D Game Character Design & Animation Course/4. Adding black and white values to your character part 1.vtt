00:00.730 --> 00:04.790
Now we can start building our actual characters and Photoshop.

00:04.810 --> 00:07.420
Now I'm going to break this up into two parts.

00:07.510 --> 00:13.360
So the first part is going to be with this character whom we're going to create in a more realistic

00:13.690 --> 00:21.160
way with shading and lighting and then we're going to color this guy in a more simplistic way with just

00:21.160 --> 00:23.000
solid colors.

00:23.050 --> 00:27.800
Once you've done that we're going to go ahead and I'm going to show you how to animate this character.

00:28.750 --> 00:29.800
So let's get started.

00:31.420 --> 00:36.850
So the first thing you want to do is we want to block out the values of our character and by values

00:37.120 --> 00:40.250
that means the level between black and white.

00:40.270 --> 00:46.420
So if you take all the color away from this character he'll be left with either shades of gray black

00:46.420 --> 00:48.150
or white.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.850
So for example if his shirt was a dark red and you took all the red out of it it would end up being

00:54.880 --> 00:57.790
a dark gray.

00:57.790 --> 01:03.190
Now before we start blocking these values then I want to go ahead and take our two sketch layers this

01:03.190 --> 01:07.140
layer and this layer and put them into a folder.

01:07.210 --> 01:11.110
And what this means is it just means there are going to be grouped together so we can keep things more

01:11.200 --> 01:12.370
organized.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.040
So I'm just going to select both of them.

01:15.530 --> 01:21.370
I'm going to come down here at the bottom right hand corner of the screen and there's a little folder

01:21.430 --> 01:24.260
icon next to the new layer icon.

01:24.410 --> 01:28.840
So I don't hit that folder and it's going to place both those letters in that folder.

01:28.840 --> 01:35.620
Now you can see when I turn that folder off turns off all the layers within that folder.

01:35.620 --> 01:40.630
Next I'm going to create a new layer.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.890
Now let's go ahead and select the polygon.

01:42.950 --> 01:44.540
Lasso tool.

01:44.720 --> 01:51.200
So the polygon a laso tool if you remember is the one where you can select straight lines.

01:51.230 --> 01:56.150
So what we want to do is we want to go in there and trace out the shapes that make up this character's

01:56.150 --> 01:57.100
body.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.330
We're going to start off with the head.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.360
Now let's go ahead and zoom in.

02:01.520 --> 02:08.780
The way you zoom in is by hitting the Z on your keyboard and you'll see your cursor becomes a magnifying

02:08.780 --> 02:09.680
glass.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.260
Now what you want to do is click and drag in and it'll zoom you in.

02:15.350 --> 02:21.680
Now in order to move around the page you need to hit the spacebar on your keyboard.

02:21.980 --> 02:27.530
Hold that down while you click and drag it and it'll allow you to drag all over the page.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.190
So let's bring it into his face.

02:31.620 --> 02:36.470
And now switching back to our Lasso tool we're going to start tracing now his face.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.400
So start about here.

02:38.400 --> 02:45.350
Underneath his goggles and we're just going to trace around the shape of his face.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.010
Now remember the smaller the curves the closer you need your lines to be.

03:01.010 --> 03:05.440
So you can get more of that curve in there.

03:05.470 --> 03:10.160
We don't need to do all of his hair because his hair is going to be a different color than his skin.

03:11.580 --> 03:17.240
So come back to the beginning of your shape and close it next what we're going to do is we're going

03:17.240 --> 03:25.850
to fill that shape in with a light gray it's going to come over to our color selector and bring it all

03:25.850 --> 03:29.150
the way over to the left side of the color palette.

03:29.540 --> 03:35.000
And then we're going to bring it up to about there

03:38.550 --> 03:41.850
now using our color fill tool which is this tool right here.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.600
It looks like a paint bucket.

03:44.070 --> 03:50.010
You may be selected on the gradient tool if you are just go ahead and hold down on it and bring it to

03:50.010 --> 03:51.300
the paint bucket tool.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.010
So with the pain bucket all you can do with this is fill shapes in.

03:56.030 --> 04:03.810
So if we click on our selection you'll see it fills that shape and next we need to label this Slayer

04:03.840 --> 04:05.710
so we can stay organized.

04:05.730 --> 04:08.520
So we're going to label the layer head

04:11.520 --> 04:14.970
while we're at it let's label our folder too.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.760
So we're going to label this folder scatch.

04:21.860 --> 04:28.250
So now we need to do the same thing with all the shapes we need to make a new layer trace out the shape

04:28.700 --> 04:30.770
and fill it with a value.

04:31.580 --> 04:36.060
Now when you're filling in your values it's important to remember that you want contrasts.

04:36.170 --> 04:40.520
That's the whole reason why we do the values before we do the color is we want to make sure there is

04:40.520 --> 04:47.540
contrast in the image images with our contrasts or with little contrast usually don't look very good

04:47.540 --> 04:49.010
at all.

04:49.010 --> 04:54.260
So what is contrasts exactly contrast is just the difference between two values.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.170
So black and white have a very high contrast.

04:57.170 --> 05:02.960
You can see the difference between them when they're right next to each other mid gray and another mid

05:02.960 --> 05:06.140
great together you can hardly see any contrast between them.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.350
It's almost hard to tell the difference between them.

05:08.690 --> 05:14.360
So you want to make sure that there are big differences between each colors that are touching.

05:14.690 --> 05:21.630
So for example his skin is pretty light but his scarf is going to be touching his skin.

05:21.650 --> 05:24.540
So we want to make that scarf a darker color.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.030
So let's go ahead and add a new layer.

05:28.470 --> 05:32.380
Switch over to the Lasso tool and we'll start tracing that shape.

05:55.590 --> 06:01.110
And now we're going to fill that with a darker color so I'm going to bring the color down to a pretty

06:01.110 --> 06:03.290
dark gray about there.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.120
Then using the fill tool whose hockey is the letter g.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.730
We're going to fill that in.

06:10.760 --> 06:16.130
Now you can see there's a good contrast between his light skin and his dark scarf.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.660
Now I know his scarf is on top of his head.

06:18.980 --> 06:24.930
All we have to do to fix that is click his layer and drag it down beneath the head layer.

06:24.980 --> 06:28.440
And now a scarf is behind the head.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.420
Now let's label that layer scarf

06:32.950 --> 06:33.480
next.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.060
Let's do his hair.

06:36.330 --> 06:43.120
So to do his hair I'm going to turn off his head layer so I can see the sketch underneath this lighter

06:43.120 --> 06:44.170
gray layer.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.080
So I'll hit the button and turn that off.

06:47.450 --> 06:52.290
Now let's create a new layer using the Lasso tool again.

06:52.300 --> 07:37.570
We will trace out that shape.

07:37.700 --> 07:44.180
Now I just want to keep that shape from touching right before the goggles and that way we can still

07:44.180 --> 07:47.390
see his skin and the hair.

07:47.390 --> 07:53.120
Now we're going to fill his hair in with a gradient what a gradient is is it's a transition between

07:53.120 --> 07:54.940
two different colors.

07:55.160 --> 08:00.830
We can come over here to the paint bucket tool and hold it down and it will come up with the option

08:00.830 --> 08:03.660
for the gradient tool select select that.

08:03.890 --> 08:09.350
Now the grading tool is going to create that gradient between these two colors right here are foreground

08:09.350 --> 08:11.980
color or background color.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.290
So let's make sure we have the correct colors in there that we want the gradient to be created in.

08:17.670 --> 08:25.160
So the first color I want is going to be a very light gray almost a white.

08:25.450 --> 08:26.710
OK.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.660
The second color I want is going to be about mid grey.

08:30.660 --> 08:35.680
So about where it is now I'm going to go a little bit higher actually to about there.

08:35.790 --> 08:38.490
And those are the colors I want for his hair.

08:38.490 --> 08:43.850
So now you'll see if we click on our document we get a line.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.720
Now this line is the length and direction of our gradient.

08:47.940 --> 08:53.220
So if I let go of it here it's going to be going in this direction and it's going to have this length

08:53.310 --> 08:59.730
which means from this point to that point it's going to transition between my two colors.

08:59.730 --> 09:03.770
So the longer I make it the longer the transition is going to be.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.920
Let me show you what I mean.

09:04.920 --> 09:12.960
So if I let go of my gradient right here it's going to make a long transition between this dark gray

09:13.230 --> 09:14.520
and this light gray.

09:14.910 --> 09:21.680
But if we undo that and I make that line shorter you can see that transition happens right there and

09:21.690 --> 09:27.600
everything on the other side of those two points is that solid color selection.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.610
So in this case I want a long transition between here and here.

09:32.610 --> 09:35.240
So just the tip of his hair is darker.

09:35.910 --> 09:39.800
Now I don't like the direction it's going and I want it to be coming more from the top.

09:39.810 --> 09:47.000
So I'm going to undo that and I'm going to select from the top and come down to about there.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.630
Perfect.

09:48.660 --> 09:53.690
Now we can go ahead and turn that head layer back on and see what it looks like.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.700
Right it's looking pretty good.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.850
Now let's go ahead and label the hair layer and we'll just call it hair next.

10:03.870 --> 10:10.730
Let's create those goggles so we're going to turn off our hair layer and our head layer so we can see

10:10.730 --> 10:12.360
the goggles on the sketch.

10:13.160 --> 10:20.250
And let's add a new layer and using the Lasso tool once again we're going to trace out that shape.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.080
Now if the shape wasn't perfect on your sketch you can kind of go ahead.

11:11.970 --> 11:19.750
And fill that in with a dark gray almost a black.

11:19.870 --> 11:28.740
Make sure that you're on your paint bucket and not your gradient and fill that in Awesome.

11:28.740 --> 11:32.310
Now let's turn on to other layers.

11:32.750 --> 11:33.120
Right.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.430
It's looking good.
