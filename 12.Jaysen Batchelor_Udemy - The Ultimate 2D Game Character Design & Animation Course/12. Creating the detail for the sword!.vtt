00:01.200 --> 00:05.510
Now lastly we can work on our blade and handle.

00:05.770 --> 00:12.360
So first off what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn off my head layer and my hair layer so that I

00:12.360 --> 00:14.350
can see my blade better.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.440
So I'll scroll up there.

00:19.570 --> 00:20.960
Here's the head.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.790
And there's the hair.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.350
Oh and my goggles layer.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.980
We want to turn that off too.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.450
So now we can see our blade a lot better next we don't want to do.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.640
I want to come down to my blade layer.

00:34.370 --> 00:36.800
I'm going to create a new clipping mask.

00:37.580 --> 00:44.120
We're going to drag that clipping mask above our color layer then using the Lasso tool and making sure

00:44.120 --> 00:49.910
you're on the Polygonum Lasso tool which means you can create straight lines are going to create the

00:49.910 --> 00:51.980
shape of the edge of our blade.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.470
Something like that should work next.

00:59.470 --> 01:06.360
We're going to change our color to the color white and we're going to fill that in next.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.810
Let's change the Slayer type.

01:08.890 --> 01:10.110
So I'll come over here.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.580
Let's change it to overlay.

01:13.630 --> 01:14.460
Awesome.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.130
Now we're going to bring down the opacity on that

01:20.580 --> 01:22.480
think about 50 percent looks good.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.920
In unselect out of the selection.

01:26.510 --> 01:31.900
Now we want to add an edge to this blade over here too since our light source is coming from over here.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.470
We're going to make this side more of a shadow.

01:34.810 --> 01:44.320
So a user Lasso tool again starting from this corner we're going to create our edge and we'll follow

01:44.320 --> 01:46.780
that edge as best as possible.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.040
Then we're going to fill this in with a dark gray

01:52.670 --> 01:53.780
somewhere around there.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.090
OK.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.380
And we're just going to keep this on the same layer

02:03.110 --> 02:11.670
Next what I want to do is I'm going to create a new clipping mask and using my brush tool with a soft

02:11.670 --> 02:14.420
edge.

02:14.540 --> 02:18.010
I'm going to give it a soft edge on the bottom side of this blade.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.810
This is just to help make it look more metallic.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
So increase the size of my brush and paint across like so it's a little bit too dark for me.

02:29.020 --> 02:32.350
So going to bring down the opacity.

02:32.350 --> 02:32.980
Great.

02:33.040 --> 02:42.410
I'm going to switch back over to white then I'll add a new layer and I'm going to add a little bit of

02:42.470 --> 02:45.140
a light reflection right here.

02:45.140 --> 02:49.760
This is just because the light would probably be bouncing off the wood and giving a wider reflection

02:49.760 --> 02:51.230
onto the metal.

02:51.230 --> 02:54.030
Now that's a little bit too bright so I'm going to turn that down.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.780
Looks about good to me.

02:58.360 --> 03:04.180
Lastly I'd like to add some chips to the edge of our blade that I'll just give it some more character.

03:04.180 --> 03:09.540
The way we're going to do this is first we're going to select all of our layers in our blade folder

03:11.400 --> 03:15.470
then we're going to hit Control J on our keyboard or command.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.360
Jay if you're on a Mac.

03:18.030 --> 03:18.940
Well this is done.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.560
It's now copied all of those letters I had selected.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.850
So now I have two versions of them.

03:24.930 --> 03:30.210
I'm doing this because I'm about to merge these layers together and I'm going to lose all of my layers

03:30.210 --> 03:30.980
when I do that.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.170
So I want backup in case something goes wrong.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.800
So now let's put all of these into a folder.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.130
And we'll leave layers

03:45.130 --> 03:47.130
now we can select all of these layers.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.230
And merge them together.

03:50.420 --> 03:53.110
Now we want to turn off our layers folder.

03:53.130 --> 03:57.060
That's because it's creating a second blade on top of our other blade.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.460
So once we start doing things to the bottom blade you're not going to be able to see it because it's

04:01.460 --> 04:03.540
covered up by the second blade.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.170
So let's turn that off now.

04:07.210 --> 04:17.140
Let's use our Lasso tool and we're going to start creating little triangles into our blade.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.380
Then we can hit delete and I'll cut that out.

04:21.650 --> 04:22.870
Let's create a second one.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.250
Want to make this one a little bit more rounded.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.410
And we don't want to do too many

04:35.570 --> 04:36.860
less is always more

04:46.090 --> 04:46.720
awesome.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.810
I think that looks cool.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.370
We can turn his head on and see how they look together.

04:55.320 --> 04:55.850
Awesome.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.330
It's looking good.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.610
Now let's go ahead and label all those layers.

05:00.690 --> 05:01.350
Awesome.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.760
It's looking good.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.950
Now we can go ahead and close that folder.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.850
Now let's move on to the handle so let's create a new clipping mask.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.120
And we'll drag that to the top.

05:17.360 --> 05:23.660
Next we're going to select the brown color on the handle and we're going to create a shadow color for

05:23.660 --> 05:24.060
it.

05:27.350 --> 05:31.910
And using our brush making sure we're on a hard edged brush.

05:32.610 --> 05:43.820
You can start painting in those shadows.

05:43.990 --> 05:47.000
I'm going to add a circle shadow right here.

05:47.220 --> 05:51.380
And that's because I'm eventually going to add a jewel there.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.700
Now let's create a new cooking mask and bring it to the top.

05:56.940 --> 06:05.520
And let's select our handle color and let's create a lighter version of that hit.

06:05.550 --> 06:06.400
OK.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.030
Then we can start painting on our highlight

06:14.660 --> 06:16.120
awesome.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.570
Now lastly let's add in that jewel.

06:18.920 --> 06:24.400
So I like this blue color so I'm going to make my jewel that color so I'll add a new layer.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.490
It doesn't matter if it's a clipping mask or not.

06:27.690 --> 06:33.790
Next we're going to select this shadow blue and using our paintbrush.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.150
Let's go ahead and paint in our jewel.

06:37.340 --> 06:41.090
We want to make sure that the shadow is on this side of the jewel.

06:42.720 --> 06:50.510
Next we'll select this lighter blue then using our paint brush paint in a circle within this circle

06:50.910 --> 06:58.000
like so Next let's brighten this color of blue to about there.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.930
OK.

07:00.400 --> 07:05.430
Now we can add a nice highlight to our jewel awesome.

07:05.430 --> 07:08.080
Now it really looks like a jewel.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.280
This is fantastic.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.090
We made it to the end of creating our character.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.300
Now in the next lecture I'm going to show you how you can make some adjustments and do some cool things

07:16.300 --> 07:17.310
with your characters.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.720
But we're basically done with the design.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.710
Thank you for watching this lecture and I can't wait to see you in the next one.
