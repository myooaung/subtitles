Whenever you're creating and designing something reference is key reference is what's going to make

00:07.600 --> 00:12.900
your work look professional as opposed to amateur work.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.430
So what do I mean by reference.

00:14.530 --> 00:20.920
Well I mean let's say for example that on my character he's going to have feathers now rather than just

00:20.920 --> 00:21.500
a drawing.

00:21.570 --> 00:27.910
I think a feather looks like I'm going to actually look up images of feathers and use those as references

00:28.210 --> 00:30.210
when I'm drawing my character.

00:31.120 --> 00:37.660
I'll also like I said usually do a bunch of drawings of the types of things that will be used in my

00:37.660 --> 00:42.980
design so that I can get use to drawing those types of objects.

00:43.120 --> 00:49.660
So I'll usually do is I'll get some images off line and I'll bring them into Photoshop and then right

00:49.660 --> 00:50.210
next to them.

00:50.230 --> 00:56.380
I'm just going to copy them by drawing them this way I can have really good understanding of what a

00:56.380 --> 00:58.590
feather looks like and how it works.

00:59.780 --> 01:05.500
The way I get an image into Photoshop is by right clicking on the image.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.250
I copy the image.

01:07.520 --> 01:16.000
Then I come back into Photoshop and then go and control V which is paste and on a Mac it's going to

01:16.000 --> 01:17.810
be command the.

01:18.160 --> 01:25.180
Then I'm going to shrink down my image by going control T or command t on a Mac.

01:25.510 --> 01:30.220
And then you're going to grab the corner and shrink him down.

01:30.390 --> 01:34.590
Whoops hold down Shift while you do this.

01:34.630 --> 01:39.070
That way it keeps the image in proportion.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.610
That's good.

01:40.610 --> 01:45.320
Now the reason why I have a raccoon here is because I think I'm going to have some fur on my character

01:45.380 --> 01:46.400
also.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.910
And so I want to study what fur looks like and try drawing it.

01:50.930 --> 01:53.150
So let's start with a feather.

01:53.390 --> 01:55.560
So I'm going to go ahead and zoom in here.

01:56.120 --> 02:03.200
And what I want to do is I just want to copy this feather right here and try to recreate it and maybe

02:03.200 --> 02:04.550
make it look a little bit better.

02:04.700 --> 02:10.610
But I want to recreate that feather so that way when I'm drawing my feathers I know that this is actually

02:10.610 --> 02:11.900
what a feather looks like.

02:12.050 --> 02:18.080
So that way I can distort it or change it and make it look more to my style but it'll still look like

02:18.080 --> 02:22.810
a feather because I know the components that make up a feather.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.900
So I'm just going to grab a brush shrink my brush size down.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.810
Now this doesn't really matter what kind of brush you use.

02:29.810 --> 02:36.720
Also if you don't have a drawing tablet you can definitely do this on with paper and pencil.

02:37.490 --> 02:43.730
So I'm just going to select this little brush right here and I'm just going to go ahead and start drawing

02:43.730 --> 02:44.900
the feather.

02:48.530 --> 02:53.060
So we kind of have to get doesn't have to be perfect.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.700
We're just trying to get those shapes down.

02:57.490 --> 02:59.190
So we have the center piece.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.200
It's kind of like a stick.

03:03.340 --> 03:04.950
Then I might just kind of block it out.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.490
The basic shape of the feather

03:09.780 --> 03:14.340
but you'll notice that there are little pieces that kind of give in.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.140
So I'm going to add those in

03:22.610 --> 03:29.090
sometimes we get these little curly things that come out and then sometimes we get ones that go in like

03:29.090 --> 03:29.570
so

03:33.650 --> 03:36.910
you know notices if we get to the end it gets a little fluffy.

03:36.950 --> 03:42.170
And you'll also notice on other feathers it gets pretty fluffy so I'm going to kind of almost make it

03:42.170 --> 03:44.830
look like further down towards the bottom.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.300
I like that.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.130
All right then I'll finish up this side.

04:03.310 --> 04:11.820
I'm going to bring this piece out a little bit more like so and I don't really like the size of the

04:11.820 --> 04:13.000
fuzziness on the sides.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.530
I'm going to go ahead and erase it

04:18.740 --> 04:20.340
bring that out a little bit more.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.980
OK.

04:25.370 --> 04:31.160
So now if we have a look at the feather you'll also see there's kind of lines going like this because

04:31.160 --> 04:37.670
with a feather each piece of the feather is an individual little strand with other little pieces sticking

04:37.670 --> 04:38.530
off of it.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.240
Make it stick together kind of like Velcro.

04:41.270 --> 04:43.160
And so we want to add that in there.

04:47.770 --> 04:55.350
Now with this I'm just kind of suggesting the lines and where they're going.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.290
Again remember the season have to be perfect this isn't a final piece of artwork.

04:59.490 --> 05:03.480
This is just for you and your knowledge.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.590
All right let's move on to the fur.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.350
So look at the fur.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.140
It's it's pretty simple.

05:09.140 --> 05:18.700
Now it's obviously not just like spiky but it's just kind of a series of lines going off into somewhat

05:18.700 --> 05:20.410
of the same direction.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.310
There's a bit of variation.

05:22.740 --> 05:26.960
So we want to make sure that it's not just a bunch of lines going like that just straight

05:31.270 --> 05:36.350
but from what I can see this is basically what the fur looks like.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.410
And then there might be another level for

05:45.160 --> 05:48.000
now drawing fur isn't like painting fur.

05:48.050 --> 05:50.220
They're kind of two different processes.

05:50.410 --> 05:55.660
But what we're doing here is we're just drawing it because by drawing it we really have to look at it

05:55.750 --> 05:59.690
and study it and understand what it is and how it works.

05:59.770 --> 06:04.390
And that's the importance of using reference is you really need to gain an understanding of what it

06:04.390 --> 06:09.950
is that you're designing and creating this will make your work immensely better.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.920
Thank you for watching this lecture and I really hope it was helpful for you.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.620
Can't wait to see you in the next one.
