00:00.650 --> 00:04.400
Now let's go ahead and create our last frame.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.710
So our last frame is going to be where he's free falling.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.010
So let's have a look at the diagram.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.310
It's going to be this one right here.

00:12.830 --> 00:17.210
So it's going to be very similar to the last frame we created.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.960
He's just going to be a little bit lower.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.960
His arms are going to come up a little bit.

00:22.010 --> 00:29.840
His head will tilt back just the slightest bit and his loin cloth is going to sort of raise up because

00:29.840 --> 00:31.670
of wind resistance.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.450
So let's go ahead and let's do that.

00:35.450 --> 00:41.900
So first what we're going to do is we're going to delete this copy then we're going to select our whole

00:41.900 --> 00:45.920
character then using the move tool.

00:45.930 --> 00:48.460
We'll go ahead and bring him down with the arrow keys.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.660
Now like I said he's just going to barely come down.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.510
You'll hardly even notice it in animation.

00:54.510 --> 00:59.480
It will just give him more of a floating look while he's up in the air next.

00:59.490 --> 01:02.630
Let's go ahead and animate that loin cloth.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.180
So we're going to come into the loincloth folder.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.900
Then let's go ahead and merge our two loincloth layers together.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.490
So now those are one.

01:13.950 --> 01:21.390
Then we can use the Transform Tool and Right-Click then come down to warp and we'll go ahead and warp

01:21.420 --> 01:21.660
that.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.930
So it's kind of flaring up.

01:23.970 --> 01:32.000
Not enough that you can see any of his you know what but enough that you can tell there's wind resistance.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.390
Great.

01:39.570 --> 01:44.870
Enter next what we want to do is we want to animate those arms.

01:45.090 --> 01:52.590
So go ahead and close out the loincloth folder come down to the back arm and the spear then we're going

01:52.590 --> 02:01.400
to use the Transform Tool to raise the arm up just a tiny bit like so I enter.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.350
And now let's do the same for the other arm.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.010
So cut that out.

02:09.260 --> 02:20.490
We'll transform it rotate reposition it enter and using a brush tool.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.710
Just go ahead and paint in that empty space.

02:27.450 --> 02:32.510
Lastly let's go ahead and rotate his head back just a little bit more.

02:32.820 --> 02:40.950
So we'll select the feather and the mask fold or use the Transform Tool bring the pivot point down to

02:40.950 --> 02:41.800
his neck.

02:43.110 --> 02:47.460
And just rotate it just a tiny bit.

02:47.490 --> 02:49.730
Now his head is coming off of his neck.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.200
So we'll go ahead and move that down with the arrow keys.

02:54.300 --> 02:54.950
Great.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.590
You just finished the fourth frame of your character's jump cycle.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.960
So let's go ahead and select all of our folder's

03:06.150 --> 03:14.700
merge then then we'll select their background and we can go ahead and drag those into our Spryte sheet.

03:18.010 --> 03:22.610
Position them and just go ahead and delete that background.

03:23.480 --> 03:28.240
And don't forget to label your frame.

03:28.630 --> 03:35.200
Then before we finish up the sprite sheet for the jump cycle we want to go ahead and save this freemount

03:38.960 --> 03:45.040
and we'll call it frame for.

03:45.570 --> 03:49.510
Now let's come back to our first frame because we need to read.

03:49.650 --> 03:59.070
Select this and drop it into our spreadsheet so we'll grab it and drop it into the spreadsheet like

03:59.100 --> 04:02.850
so position it.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.970
Don't forget to delete the background layer.

04:06.240 --> 04:12.000
And so now those are the same pose but they need to be there because when the animation runs through

04:12.000 --> 04:13.660
it we want them to crouch.

04:13.890 --> 04:16.020
We want them to push off.

04:16.050 --> 04:22.410
Now we want them to be airborne and we want them to freefall then we want him to land and when he lands

04:22.440 --> 04:28.080
we want him to crouch a little bit because that's how people naturally land their knees bend to help

04:28.110 --> 04:30.290
absorb some of the energy.

04:30.300 --> 04:30.820
Great.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.230
Now you've created two different animation cycles.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.310
You should be pretty proud of yourself.

04:36.500 --> 04:42.000
Now in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and create our mockup of our animation to see how our

04:42.000 --> 04:44.380
jump cycle looks in action.
