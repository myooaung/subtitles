WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:04.240
Let's go ahead and move on to our next frame.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.950
Now we're going to leave this document open because we're going to use it later.

00:08.520 --> 00:15.270
But for now let's come up to file open then we're going to come into our staining folder and that's

00:15.270 --> 00:20.850
where our original character design is and we want to use this as a base for next frame.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.470
So we'll go ahead and open that awesome.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.640
Now what we're going to do with this one is we're going to create the passin frame which is where both

00:30.640 --> 00:34.420
the legs pass each other to cross over to the other side.

00:34.690 --> 00:40.110
So let's come back and have a look at our reference so we can see what I'm talking about.

00:40.690 --> 00:46.570
So we just did this one where the legs are across from each other they're spread apart and they're both

00:46.570 --> 00:47.490
touching the ground.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.460
Now this one is where both the legs are going to be crossing so that they can get to the other side.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.000
All right.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.570
So let's go ahead and let's do this.

00:57.570 --> 01:03.300
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer now on this layer we're going

01:03.300 --> 01:05.940
to go ahead and do our sketch.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.800
Someone to select a black.

01:08.370 --> 01:11.860
So go ahead and we'll just start sketching that in now.

01:11.880 --> 01:18.330
Kind of an easy way to draw legs is to use ovals so I use an oval for the top half of the leg and an

01:18.330 --> 01:35.970
oval for the calf of the leg.

01:36.090 --> 01:36.310
All right.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.000
Awesome.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.330
So something about like that should do next where we want to do is we want to add a new layer above

01:43.330 --> 01:45.510
that then using her Lasso tool.

01:45.520 --> 01:50.010
We're going to start with this backlog and we're going to trace it out

02:06.100 --> 02:09.450
now since this leg is going to be behind this one.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.330
It's going to be hard to tell the difference between the two legs.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.660
It's going to become one big shape if they're both the same color.

02:16.900 --> 02:21.850
So what we're going to do to help with that is we're going to select our darker skin tone over here

02:21.880 --> 02:27.610
that we use for this back arm to make it look like it was in shadow and we're going to go ahead and

02:27.610 --> 02:35.910
fill in our backlog with that color grepped next what we want to do is we want to go ahead and delete

02:36.000 --> 02:37.210
our back legs.

02:37.260 --> 02:43.650
So we'll come down to our body layer then using the Lasso tool we'll go ahead and select those legs

02:45.870 --> 02:47.700
then hit delete.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.030
So now those are out of our way.

02:50.830 --> 02:56.040
That's where we want to do is we want to come back up to this leg we just created and we're going to

02:56.040 --> 02:59.600
turn to offer a second so we can see the front leg.

02:59.700 --> 03:03.730
Now the front leg is going to be coming in front of the loincloth.

03:03.870 --> 03:10.890
So we need to create this leg up in the loincloth folder and above the cloth layer.

03:11.130 --> 03:17.400
So we'll come up to loin cloth and then at the very top of all those layers we're going to add a new

03:17.400 --> 03:17.990
layer.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.400
And this is what we're going to create.

03:19.410 --> 03:24.380
This front leg on the will go ahead and start tracing out that shape

03:40.680 --> 03:41.460
perfect.

03:41.460 --> 03:46.700
Now let's go ahead and fill that in with our lighter skin tone.

03:46.730 --> 03:48.250
Great.

03:48.360 --> 03:54.310
Now you'll see there's a little problem here is that we covered up this piece of the drawstring.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.730
So the way we can get that back in front of our Lay is by coming down to the layer that the drawstring

03:59.730 --> 04:05.340
is on and using our Lasso tool we're going to trace out this little section right here that the leg

04:05.340 --> 04:07.250
is covering up.

04:07.470 --> 04:14.030
Then we're going to copy it and then coming back up to our top layer where our leg is on.

04:14.100 --> 04:20.160
We're going to paste it in a little piece on a new layer and above that leg and then we can reposition

04:20.160 --> 04:21.350
it.

04:21.510 --> 04:24.160
So just like that awesome.

04:24.380 --> 04:30.590
Now let's go ahead and come back down to our body layer and we're going to turn our back leg on.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.440
We can also turn off our sketch.

04:33.530 --> 04:34.160
Perfect.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.360
It's looking great.

04:35.750 --> 04:40.240
I'm noticing over here we have a little bit of some unpainted area.

04:40.250 --> 04:46.730
So what I'll do is I'm going to come up to that leg layer pre-select this darker skin tone than just

04:46.730 --> 04:47.790
using my brush tool.

04:47.810 --> 04:49.900
I'll just go ahead and fill that in.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.980
You just finished your second frame.

04:53.120 --> 04:58.550
Now the reason why we're not going to mess with the arms is because in the last frame if you see here

05:00.020 --> 05:06.630
his arms go down then when his legs are going to cross we want his arms come back up to the mid level

05:06.980 --> 05:08.230
and then when his legs crossed.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.920
Opposite of what they are now.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.830
That's when we want his arms to go all the way up.

05:12.950 --> 05:16.770
So that's why we're leaving his arms in the position that they're in right now.

05:17.150 --> 05:23.480
OK let's go ahead and create a copy of this character so that we can bring him into our Spryte sheet.

05:23.570 --> 05:29.720
So will come all the way down to the spear folder and then come all the way up to the mask folder selecting

05:29.720 --> 05:34.740
all of them and then we're just going to copy them control J or command J.

05:35.790 --> 05:39.780
And then we're going to merge those copies great.

05:39.940 --> 05:45.610
Now keeping our copy selected we want to come all the way down to the bottom and select our background

05:45.640 --> 05:52.030
as well by holding down control than selecting our background and that will select both of them.

05:52.030 --> 05:58.080
Now let's grab one of those layers and it will drag both of them over into our Spryte sheet.

05:58.870 --> 06:05.580
And let's go ahead and just drop him in and we're going to position I'm using our grab a move tool.

06:05.580 --> 06:09.750
And if you're snap to is on it should snap right into place.

06:10.690 --> 06:11.320
Awesome.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.010
Now let's go ahead and let's delete that back layer

06:16.750 --> 06:19.490
right now before we go any further.

06:19.510 --> 06:22.140
I want to go ahead and start labeling these.

06:22.300 --> 06:27.490
So we're going to label this first one frame one.

06:27.490 --> 06:34.440
So about what we'll call the next one frame two or two.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.820
Great.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.190
Now we're going to go ahead and put those in a folder.

06:40.230 --> 06:46.300
And we're going to call that folder walk right.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.640
We're calling it walk right because he's walking right.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.940
Once we create all of these sprites what we're going to do is we're going to make a copy of all of them

06:56.030 --> 06:57.230
and we're going to flip them.

06:57.230 --> 07:01.670
So they're going in the opposite direction because when you're playing a game you need your character

07:01.670 --> 07:03.620
to go in both directions.

07:03.620 --> 07:10.550
Now let's not forget to save out our frame just in case we ever need to make changes to it.

07:10.790 --> 07:22.040
So we'll go file save as and let's save it to the walking cycle and we'll save this as frame two or

07:22.340 --> 07:22.720
two

07:26.110 --> 07:27.000
great.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.760
I hope this is really starting to make sense to you.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.930
If it's not that's OK.

07:31.930 --> 07:36.100
Go ahead and ask all the questions you need in the Q and A section of the course.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.200
I'm just here to help you learn.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.690
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
