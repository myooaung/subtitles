00:00.360 --> 00:08.940
Highs and welcome to the artificial intelligence master class I'm so excited to start this course and

00:08.940 --> 00:16.090
start this journey with you because I have never worked on such a powerful AI of my entire life.

00:16.140 --> 00:16.680
Indeed.

00:16.710 --> 00:23.280
Through our previous courses we have built some very powerful ones but they were each time single models

00:23.730 --> 00:31.380
and this time in this course we're going to build for the first time a hybrid intelligence system and

00:31.380 --> 00:33.620
by hybrid intelligence system.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.210
Here is what it means.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.550
A hybrid model is a combination of different Emile's and you can imagine that the hybrid model we're

00:41.550 --> 00:47.370
going to build in this course is going to be a combination of the state of the art Emile's meaning the

00:47.370 --> 00:48.600
most powerful ones.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.850
And we have them in front of us.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.860
These are first to CNN.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.060
No worries if you don't know some terms here.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.870
We will all cover them in the course.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.680
But the hybrid intelligence system that we're going to build in the course is going to be composed of

01:05.130 --> 01:12.380
CNN which is a convolutional neural network then the variational our encoder.

01:12.510 --> 01:20.610
Then an empty and mixed density network then Arnon Recker a neural network and all these models are

01:20.610 --> 01:23.130
going to be combined together.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.790
And then here comes the best part.

01:24.990 --> 01:32.970
This hybrid combination of State of the art Mole's is going to be optimized by deep neuro evolution

01:33.390 --> 01:38.610
and deep neuro evolution as the brand new era of artificial intelligence.

01:38.640 --> 01:46.680
These are some powerful optimizers which will find the best parameters meaning the best weights of the

01:46.690 --> 01:49.230
neural networks inside your AI.

01:49.470 --> 01:56.880
And the best ones that we have today are genetic algorithms and evolutions strategies and of course

01:57.300 --> 02:03.960
the moral that will build in this course and that will play against India and is optimized by the best

02:04.110 --> 02:11.160
technique of deep neuro evolution which is evolution strategy and more specifically it will be what

02:11.160 --> 02:16.390
we call covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.450
Nor is again.

02:17.460 --> 02:21.810
If you don't get any of that term we will cover everything in the course.

02:21.810 --> 02:22.130
All right.

02:22.140 --> 02:28.560
Now that's you know what a hybrid artificial intelligence is which is a good thing because this is what

02:28.560 --> 02:30.510
this course is all about.

02:30.510 --> 02:38.550
Well let's move on to the next step which is to at least become aware of the pros and cons of building

02:38.580 --> 02:40.840
and using hybrid models.

02:40.920 --> 02:47.700
So the pros are first of all you might guess the most obvious one is that a hybrid model is the most

02:47.760 --> 02:55.590
powerful AI model by far in both the deep reinforcement learning branch and the policy training branch

02:55.680 --> 02:57.490
of artificial intelligence.

02:57.690 --> 03:03.180
And then the other prose is that the hybrid intelligence system that will be built in this course is

03:03.180 --> 03:10.770
based on a fascinating and genius idea which is to build an AI that not only can see and remember and

03:10.860 --> 03:16.290
what we had with the previous single Emile's but this time the hybrid intelligence system will be able

03:16.290 --> 03:17.870
to dream.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.150
And that's a genius idea because indeed we humans when we try to solve a problem a difficult problem.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.400
And you know we have so much trouble solving it.

03:27.570 --> 03:30.700
Well sometimes the solution comes in our sleep.

03:30.870 --> 03:35.320
That happened to me many times that I had a challenging problem to solve.

03:35.490 --> 03:39.410
And suddenly I find a solution next morning when I wake up.

03:39.450 --> 03:47.460
So maybe that's how the inventor of this fool will know which is specificity and added value is to dream

03:47.780 --> 03:48.760
figure it out.

03:48.870 --> 03:57.390
But indeed no one would deny that the idea is pretty fascinating and Glassborow is that the hybrid nature

03:57.480 --> 04:04.590
of this hybrid intelligence system offers of course a large room for improvement because indeed we have

04:04.590 --> 04:12.000
so many morals inside this hybrid intelligence system that we therefore have many hyper parameters to

04:12.000 --> 04:18.750
optimize and therefore we have a lot of optimization to do which offers obviously some large room for

04:18.750 --> 04:20.090
improvement.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.180
So that's for the pros.

04:21.180 --> 04:26.070
But then of course comes the cons and the cons of the hyperintelligent systems.

04:26.070 --> 04:29.910
Of course that they are complex to understand.

04:30.150 --> 04:35.730
But no worries we will do our best to explain them the best way so that at least can have the right

04:35.820 --> 04:40.270
intuition and the right basics and a solid foundations to understand them.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.780
Then the second question of course is that they are very hard to implement.

04:44.790 --> 04:49.900
You'll see what I mean when you see the master code that you will be given in the course.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.550
There are almost 2000 lines of code so don't worry.

04:53.550 --> 04:58.650
We've structured everything so that you can understand it well and not get lost.

04:58.920 --> 05:06.190
And of course the third and most important come we have to remember it is that they are highly computer

05:06.190 --> 05:07.530
intensive to train.

05:07.620 --> 05:14.940
Indeed the full world model takes several weeks on a normal computer to train to get some good results.

05:15.020 --> 05:20.480
And that's of course because you have many miles to train inside the hybrid intelligence system you

05:20.480 --> 05:25.750
have as we saw the V8 variational are encouraged to train.

05:25.850 --> 05:32.660
You have the engine Arnon record a neural network to train and of course in order to get the best and

05:32.660 --> 05:37.880
most performance training you're going to try several evolutions strategies techniques which therefore

05:37.880 --> 05:39.440
takes a lot of time.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.220
So here we go.

05:40.230 --> 05:45.200
That's the pros and cons of the hybrid intelligence systems the hybrid amoral.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.670
You have to be aware of them.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.020
And now that's the case.

05:48.110 --> 05:55.060
Let's finally discover the Fool world model which is the following.

05:55.250 --> 06:02.930
As you can see it is a hybrid intelligence system combining a convolutional neural network that allows

06:03.020 --> 06:11.090
AI to see a variational or encoder that allows AI to dream or record a neural network with mixture density

06:11.120 --> 06:15.870
network that allows ai ai to remember you know like it has memory.

06:15.950 --> 06:21.740
Then you have a controller that allows to review the right actions to play in order to maximize that

06:22.040 --> 06:24.350
reward in an AI environment.

06:24.680 --> 06:32.570
And on top of that you have the powerful optimizers of deep neuro evolution among which the most powerful

06:32.570 --> 06:33.710
ones are.

06:33.770 --> 06:36.210
Evolution strategies.

06:36.290 --> 06:43.370
All right and now I'm going to reveal this step by step structure for this course because in the in-order

06:43.460 --> 06:50.780
to approach this full world not the right way we had to make a perfect structure for this adventure.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.150
And so here we go.

06:52.190 --> 06:57.240
Here is the plan of attack or in other words this step by step structure.

06:57.590 --> 07:03.680
So it's going to be a structure in 10 steps with one Eudemus section per step and the steps are going

07:03.680 --> 07:10.460
to follow the path that is highlighted here in the full world model starting with CNN.

07:10.460 --> 07:16.760
However to understand the convolutional neural network CNN you have to understand first the artificial

07:16.760 --> 07:23.630
neural network and that's why the first step of this plan of attack is to study the artificial neural

07:23.630 --> 07:24.320
network.

07:24.620 --> 07:31.070
And then once you understand the artificial neural network you'll be able to move on to Step Two convolutional

07:31.190 --> 07:37.820
neural network and then we continue our journey and we follow the path the next step as we can see on

07:37.970 --> 07:45.260
this graphic representing the full world model is to study the V8 variational our encounter.

07:45.470 --> 07:52.670
But before you understand the variational or encounter you have to understand first the code itself

07:52.970 --> 07:59.720
which is exactly you go into the step three of this plan of attack and then once you understand our

07:59.720 --> 08:05.090
encoder Well then you will be able to understand variational our encoder which therefore will be the

08:05.090 --> 08:07.370
step 4 of this course structure.

08:07.700 --> 08:15.020
And then now that you get intuition and the theory of the very first important element of the Fool world

08:15.020 --> 08:21.950
model Well it will be time for our very first implementation phase which will be the step five here

08:21.950 --> 08:31.130
in this plan of attack where we will implement the C and the that is a variational or a quarter for

08:31.130 --> 08:37.610
which the first layer is in a deep neural network will be of course a convolutional neural network.

08:37.610 --> 08:44.270
And that's why what we're going to implement is not a general view but a C and D.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.780
And we will implement that with both tons of flow and cast.

08:48.950 --> 08:56.300
And then comes the step 6 which is to move on to the next part of this full world model path which is

08:56.300 --> 09:00.110
the one related to the endian Arnon.

09:00.290 --> 09:05.870
But in order to understand that next step in the process well you will have to understand first the

09:05.870 --> 09:12.440
record and neural network because an engine Arnon is nothing else than a record or a neural network

09:12.710 --> 09:18.440
for which the hidden states are sampled by a mixture density network.

09:18.440 --> 09:25.010
And that's how we get this combination of the NTN Arnon that's why the two next steps after our first

09:25.010 --> 09:32.720
implementation phase are step 6 record neural network and then step 7 the mix density network and then

09:32.900 --> 09:36.470
that's when the second implementation phase will come into play.

09:36.620 --> 09:44.390
Because indeed step 8 will be about implementing the NTN Arnon and we will implement it from scratch

09:44.630 --> 09:45.740
on bison.

09:45.980 --> 09:52.610
And then of course to start understanding how to assemble all this and to understand how we can combine

09:52.790 --> 09:59.600
all these models as a team as a powerful team to accomplish the goal which will be to drive as fast

09:59.600 --> 10:04.310
as well that's why input friends here on the left you have a car.

10:04.470 --> 10:11.180
Well you will have to understand how the whole reinforcement learning environment works.

10:11.340 --> 10:17.970
And that's when step 9 we will understand how to combine all this to play better and better actions

10:18.090 --> 10:20.600
in order to drive faster and faster.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.990
And finally stepped in.

10:23.160 --> 10:28.860
That's going to be of course about how to optimize all these models inside the full world model and

10:28.860 --> 10:31.270
also the will model itself.

10:31.440 --> 10:39.210
And as you understood in discours we're entering the era of the hybrid artificial intelligence systems

10:39.630 --> 10:42.870
optimized by deep neuro evolution.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.950
And here we go.

10:43.950 --> 10:52.500
Step 10 is going to be about deep neuro evolution covering the most powerful techniques which are genetic

10:52.560 --> 10:55.470
algorithms and evolution strategies.

10:55.620 --> 11:02.030
And as I said I can already tell you the deep neural evolution optimizer that we'll use for our world

11:02.040 --> 11:02.690
model.

11:02.750 --> 11:10.280
It is going to be the C M E S optimizer the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.460
So here we go after these 10 steps.

11:12.480 --> 11:19.660
Well I can tell you that you will be among the early adopters of this new era the era of hybrid intelligent

11:19.660 --> 11:26.280
systems optimized by deep neural evolution and then of course after smashing these 10 steps Well it

11:26.280 --> 11:34.180
will be time to have fun and we humans are going to play against the artificial intelligence too.

11:34.230 --> 11:40.800
For the first time in our courses play a human intelligence versus artificial intelligence competition.

11:41.100 --> 11:46.890
And so we'll have our car then the artificial intelligence which will be of course the full world model

11:47.130 --> 11:48.660
will also have its car.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.290
It will try to drive as fast as possible for 30 seconds.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.450
The faster it drives and you know the further it gets well the maximums it will get.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.940
And then on our side we'll try to drive as fast as possible as well.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.270
Get further than the AI and therefore beat it at car racing.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.260
And here we go.

12:06.330 --> 12:09.630
That's the final run a versus ha.

12:09.990 --> 12:10.470
All right.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.670
And now I have a surprise for you already in this first tutorial.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.040
I'm actually going to show you right now.

12:17.040 --> 12:23.550
This final run that is the final competition of the artificial intelligence versus the human intelligence

12:23.970 --> 12:29.580
and the artificial intelligence that you're about to see is exactly befooled world not all that will

12:29.580 --> 12:32.360
be built along this course so let's do this.

12:32.520 --> 12:37.740
Let's move on to Python and let me show you what you'll get at the end of the course.

12:37.740 --> 12:41.510
So first of all I'll explain of course how to install this idea.

12:41.520 --> 12:46.120
This is the spider idea which will run and build our implementation.

12:46.170 --> 12:48.420
Right now I am on my desktop.

12:48.480 --> 12:54.660
I made this a masterclass for which you will be given in the course and then this will that you have

12:54.810 --> 13:03.030
to subfolder is the inference subfolder which is only the model with some pre-trained weights or parameters

13:03.120 --> 13:09.630
of an artificial intelligence that was trained for days and days on how to race a car and drive as fast

13:09.630 --> 13:10.460
as possible.

13:10.650 --> 13:16.680
And here you have the full code on how to train this artificial intelligence with therefore all the

13:16.680 --> 13:20.670
deep neuro evolution techniques including evolution strategies.

13:20.670 --> 13:26.640
So right now what I want to show you is of course the inference because that's the inference mode that

13:26.640 --> 13:29.270
we'll be able to raise against our AI.

13:29.490 --> 13:33.620
And so in this inference folder you have four python files.

13:33.720 --> 13:40.560
First the environment which is the car racing environment and which defines as you can see the gameplay

13:40.830 --> 13:47.280
for us to be able to play car racing with our own hands so you will literally drive that car which by

13:47.280 --> 13:54.150
the way is an F1 in the car racing environment so actually you will see me drive it right now.

13:54.180 --> 14:02.190
Then you have of course the V8 eat bison foul which builds the whole immoral then next step remember

14:02.340 --> 14:04.400
is the energy and art and moral.

14:04.440 --> 14:10.530
And so that's the fellow that implemented that built the whole architecture of the engine.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.970
Art in and which we will build together.

14:13.170 --> 14:19.260
And then eventually you have of course the Fool world model which combines everything and which is the

14:19.260 --> 14:24.120
model that is a whole artificial intelligence that will drive the car.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.770
And so now I'm not going to make you wait longer.

14:26.850 --> 14:31.560
Let's start the AI versus HCI competition right away.

14:31.770 --> 14:39.150
And to do this we only have to do is select everything here and press command or control us enter to

14:39.150 --> 14:39.860
run.

14:40.200 --> 14:46.120
And so now you're about to see the environment the chorusing environment in a window.

14:46.230 --> 14:47.190
And here we go.

14:47.250 --> 14:51.610
The first car that you see here racing is the artificial intelligence plane.

14:51.630 --> 14:53.060
I'm not doing anything now.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.110
It is playing for 30 seconds.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.380
And as you can see it is trying to get the maximum scores.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.410
This is the score.

14:59.530 --> 15:03.880
The it gets basically the faster it drives the higher will be the score.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.860
And so this is for 30 seconds so it's going to be my turn soon.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.550
Right.

15:08.550 --> 15:15.120
It's already reaching 700 and it's going to reach about 900 because this is the best trained model for

15:15.180 --> 15:16.140
this current environment.

15:16.140 --> 15:19.380
Here we go 900 in something around 10.

15:19.410 --> 15:24.530
And now my turn and I'm not that good but I'm doing OK.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.400
There was no case start.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.330
So this is me playing right now with the arrows on my keyboard.

15:30.450 --> 15:35.110
And so I'm doing OK but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to beat that.

15:35.190 --> 15:38.150
Because it is pretty pretty strong.

15:38.490 --> 15:43.200
But I'm doing quite okay 600 already up getting in the green that's not a good thing.

15:43.450 --> 15:47.760
And 700 OK and 800.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.010
OK.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.010
I'm doing not too bad but here we go.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.750
That was the end for me.

15:51.990 --> 15:55.810
So what were the final results.

15:55.830 --> 16:03.780
The artificial intelligence result was to reach 910 as a total reward you can see that as meters.

16:03.900 --> 16:11.290
And unfortunately the human intelligence represented by myself reached a score of eight hundred and

16:11.300 --> 16:18.650
five in the same number of steps 900 steps which corresponds approximately to 30 seconds.

16:18.780 --> 16:23.950
So I wasn't able to beat that artificial intelligence at car racing.

16:24.090 --> 16:29.340
Maybe you will be able to do it but I doubt it because it is indeed really really strong.

16:29.490 --> 16:31.960
