Now in this module,

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.140
we talked first about the CDK as the next step in your automation journey.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.140
From infrastructure as code, now your infrastructure is code.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.000
Secondly,

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.480
we talked about the basic CDK terms, such as application,

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.650
construct, and stack and how those components are used to

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.880
provision your infrastructure.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.000
And lastly,

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we talked about how the CDK is actually used by different programming languages through the JavaScript interoperability interface, or JSii.
