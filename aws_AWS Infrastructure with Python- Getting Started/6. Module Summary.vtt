00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.400
So in this module, we've covered how to provision instance‑related constructs,

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.460
including bastion hosts, auto‑scaling groups,

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.020
and IAM roles and profiles.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.450
We also implemented a JSii interface so that we can

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.430
apply an aspect to multiple resources.

6
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.140
Lastly,

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.550
we explored the CDK project and talked about how you can stay

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.360
updated with the project, and even how you can give your own

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.840
comments and suggestions to the CDK team.

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.500
So I hope you enjoyed this course on the CDK with Python, and in the future,

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.000
I hope you continue to keep updated with this new trend in Infrastructure as Code.
