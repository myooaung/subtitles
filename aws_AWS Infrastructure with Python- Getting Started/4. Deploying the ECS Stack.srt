1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,140
Now let's actually deploy this ECS stack,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,900
and the first thing that this is going to do is ask for confirmation,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,200
as usual.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,500
Let's just say yes. Next, what's going to happen is, as you can see,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,700
it's building the Docker image.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,180
We didn't run docker build at all, we didn't trigger any build manually,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,830
all we did was trigger the deployment of the stack and CDK is

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,950
automatically handling building the Docker image for you.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,960
So it's updating the image, it's copying the files

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,040
into the Docker image, and so on.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,040
This is how local assets work.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,240
The CDK will take care of running and building the local asset for you.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,090
Now, it's actually pushing the local asset into ECR, so we

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,310
didn't even need to push it ourselves.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:09,910
CDK actually pushed the local asset to ECR. Now if we look at our ECR service,

16
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,300
you can see we now have a cdk/assets ECR repository.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,040
This is actually where you'll find the container images

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
that were built and pushed by the CDK.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,390
Next,

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,340
if we actually go take a look at the CloudFormation template that was

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,120
deployed, you can see that it's provisioned several resources. It's

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,140
provisioned a VPC, it's provisioned a load balancer.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,570
Now,

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,940
I didn't declare a VPC, I didn't specify network configuration in my CDK file.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,470
This is what I mean by abstractions via the constructs.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,640
So the constructs have abstracted all of these resources from you.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,810
The constructs actually created the VPC, created the

28
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,910
Internet gateway and all of the networking components that

29
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,640
are being used by your ECS cluster.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,210
You didn't need to specify anything about the networking

31
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,340
environment, that was all automatically provisioned.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,870
If I go to Outputs,

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,150
you can see the URL to the Globomantics app, and if I click it,

34
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,320
it brings you to the Globomantics web page.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,460
You can see the Globomantics app here, we have again all of our content, I

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,240
can browse through the different contents of this app.

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,170
This is, again, a fully working Globomantics app that was deployed by the

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,280
CDK. Now to end we can actually call cdk destroy again to remove all of the

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,840
infrastructure that was created by the CDK app.

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,840
So let me run cdk destroy, and it's going to delete all of these resources.

41
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,120
So now you can see that the destruction has completed, it's torn down

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,240
all of the resources. If I go to CloudFormation,

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,140
the resources that we provisioned are no longer there.

44
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,750
However,

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,750
if we go to ECR assets, the local assets that the CDK actually

46
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,530
provisioned have not been deleted, so that's one thing you may

47
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,340
need to do if you're cleaning up.

48
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,590
If you are getting rid of the infrastructure completely,

49
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,970
take note that these local assets which were uploaded to

50
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:52,000
the cloud are not automatically deleted. You need to delete them yourself.
