1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,560
Now in this demo,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,890
you will see how we can use local assets to build a Docker container.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,320
So we'll build the Docker container on the client

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,640
machine before uploading it to ECR.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Secondly, we're actually upload the container to ECR using the CDK app.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,610
So we're not going to do it manually.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,770
We're not even going to use the AWS CLI.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:34,340
We're actually going to use the CDK to upload the container image.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,850
Thirdly, we're going to provision the app using the CDK CLI.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,240
So we're going to deploy the resulting application.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,850
Finally,

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,480
we're going to view the resources on CloudFormation and take note of

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,560
the different characteristics of these resources,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,740
as well as the resources tracked by CDK.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,740
Now as you can see here, I have a globomantics‑container‑app folder.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,880
Now, if we open this app folder, you'll see I have a webapp here,

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,340
as well as a Docker file.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's take a look at the Docker file.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,420
The Docker file originates from the Ubuntu container image.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,310
We're then declaring some environment variables to

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,650
ensure that the update goes well.

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:31,720
We're then updating our repositories and installing the Apache 2 web server.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,100
We'll then copy the content of the web app directory

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,560
into the /var/www/html folder, expose port 80,

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,840
and run our Apache web server.

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,850
Now, if you look at the contents of webapp,

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,240
you can see here that we have all of the assets necessary to run our website.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,740
We have all of the CSS files, images files,

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,240
and HTML files needed for Globomantics landing page.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,540
We can actually visit Globomantics landing page.

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:18,000
You can see here all of the content that Globomantics has, and all of the information about the company.
