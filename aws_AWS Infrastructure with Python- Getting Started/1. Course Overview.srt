Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,760
My name is Zenon Saavedra, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,940
AWS Infrastructure with Python: Getting Started.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,370
I've worked with Cloud for several years,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,280
and I have automated everything from PCI compliant networks

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,640
to multiple environment CI/CD pipelines.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
Infrastructure is code is becoming a more and more popular process

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,740
for provisioning and managing your cloud resources.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,180
With the AWS Cloud Development Kit,

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,560
you can write infrastructure code in your favorite programming languages.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,640
Instead of infrastructure as code your infrastructure, now, is code.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,990
In this course, we'll cover using the CDK in four contexts,

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,920
serverless environments, containerized environments,

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,040
network environments, and virtualized environments.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,460
By the end of this course,

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,740
you'll know the basics of writing a working CDK application

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,740
and how to deploy it using the CDK CLI.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,390
Before beginning the course,

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,840
you should be familiar with the common AWS architectures,

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,740
CloudFormation, and Python objectâ€‘oriented programming and dependency management.

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,560
If you're not comfortable with any of these topics,

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,740
I suggest looking up these courses here on Pluralsight to get you started.

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,040
From here,

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,280
you should feel comfortable diving into the following CDK

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,940
courses available here on Pluralsight.

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:52,000
I hope you'll join me in this course to learn more about bleeding edge cloud automation, here at Pluralsight,
