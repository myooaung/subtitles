00:00:01.758 --> 00:00:05.973
While most AWS services have limits to be concerned with,

2
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.900
S3 static websites have none.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.687
The only limits they have is in relation to normal S3 limits.

4
00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:16.322
CloudFront, however, does have a few limits to be aware of.

5
00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:19.445
Most of them are just soft limits on the number of resources,

6
00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:23.555
but there are some limits on how you configure your distributions.

7
00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:27.976
You can only have a single SSL certificate on a distribution,

8
00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:32.055
so you'll have to expect multiple distributions in your

9
00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:35.336
design if you require multiple certs.

10
00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:39.022
There is no limit on the number of objects that CloudFront can serve,

11
00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:42.431
and only a soft limit on the number of distributions.

12
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:45.826
There are limits with invalidations that I mentioned earlier,

13
00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:49.832
and those are not soft limits, so do be very cautious with that.

14
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:57.000
But other than those few caveats, CloudFront can likely handle whatever you throw at it.
