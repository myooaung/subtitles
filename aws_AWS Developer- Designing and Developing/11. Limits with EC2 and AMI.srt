All services and resources and AWS have limits. It's

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,470
important to be aware of them so that they don't trip you

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,080
up when designing AWS architecture.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
And that's the worst thing about limits.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,820
You end up hitting them at the most inopportune times.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,970
So let's take a look at some of the limits involved with EC2 and AMIs. EC2 has

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,770
a limit on the max number of running instances per region.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,080
This actually gets a little complicated though,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,180
so I'll show you where to view these limits.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,210
Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Console.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,940
On the left‑hand menu, there is a Limits entry and click on it.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,040
You'll see there are a lot of limits here, and they get very specific.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
They're also instance‑type specific,

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,220
so you can really do a lot of damage if you get creative with

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,010
the image types you're using. Scrolling down,

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,660
you can see there are a few other types of limits listed

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,350
here beyond running instance limits.

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,960
One important thing to notice about all of these limits

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,410
though is that you can select any of these limits and use

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,000
the Request Limit Increase button.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,240
This means that these aren't hard limits.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,940
You can ask AWS to raise them if you ever need to.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,930
If you're using AWS with a corporate account or for your company,

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,500
then raising these limits is rarely an issue.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,970
This page largely contains all the EC2 limits.

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,790
As for AMI limits, we've already discussed that AMIs are

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,470
region‑specific, so definitely keep that in mind.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,410
There doesn't appear to be a limit to the number of

29
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,840
AMIs specifically that you can have.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,410
But since each AMI is stored using an EBS snapshot and

31
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,020
there is a limit of 10,000 EBS snapshots,

32
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,940
I would assume the max number of AMIs you can have is 10,000.

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,690
Also,

34
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:59,000
keep in mind that you do have to pay per EBS snapshot, so having 10,000 AMIs is not going to be cheap.
