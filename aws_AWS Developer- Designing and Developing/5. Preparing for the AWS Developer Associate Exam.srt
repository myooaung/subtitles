1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,630
This course is designed to not only teach you how

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,800
to be an amazing AWS developer,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,600
but also to help you complete the AWS Developer Associate exam.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,080
The exam tests your knowledge of AWS and the many different

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,190
services, options, and problems that you encounter in the

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,840
process of developing on the platform.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,360
The content of the exam is updated every few years, so while I can't

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,850
make any assurances that this course will contain everything you'll

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,490
need for the exam whenever you take it,

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,870
I am covering each topic as if you'll be tested on it.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,540
The current AWS Developer Associate exam contains all multiple choice questions.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,900
Typically, each question will focus on a single service and ask about topics,

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,280
service specifics, or service limits.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,270
There are also questions about debugging certain problems and giving

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,040
architecture recommendations based on use cases.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,090
There is no real way to know which services will be on the exam,

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,590
but the core services of AWS like EC2, S3, and DynamoDB

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,900
are almost guaranteed to be on the exam.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,645
I've also seen service is like SQS, Route 53, and

20
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:16,140
Elastic Beanstalk to name a few.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,120
Bottom line,

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,190
the more you work with and learn about AWS, the easier the test will be for you.

23
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,910
I recommend watching all of the courses in the AWS certified developer path

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,460
here on Pluralsight, and then continue building more projects. If there is

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,790
a service you aren't very familiar with, it wouldn't be a bad idea to build

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,140
something just to give it a shot.

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,070
In addition,

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,480
I've created a course called Demystifying the AWS

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,400
Certified Developer: Associate exam, which serves as a great intro to the exam.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
The course covers the exam format,

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,370
how to study, which resources to use, and what the

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,540
day of the exam will look like.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:05,000
I recommend watching it after you've completed the AWS certified developer path to put you on the best footing for the exam.
