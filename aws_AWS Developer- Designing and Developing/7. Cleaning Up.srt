00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:05,499
Throughout this course, you've likely created a lot of resources.

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:08,270
I thought that making a list of what you need to

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,851
clean up after might be helpful,

4
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:14,153
so let's look at what you need to clean up and how to do it.

5
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:19,212
We'll start with the EC2 Dashboard where most of our resources are located.

6
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,887
You'll first want to delete the load balancer,

7
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:25,086
then the Auto Scaling group, then the target group.

8
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:29,438
Once those are gone, you can kill any instances still around.

9
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:31,729
Delete the AMI we created,

10
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:36,169
and then delete both key pairs since there aren't any

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,359
more live instances using them.

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,101
Delete the launch configuration used to make our instances.

13
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:46,026
Delete any EBS snapshots that were created and any

14
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,757
EBS volumes that are still around.

15
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,501
Finally, delete any security groups other than the default one.

16
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:56,931
Next, go to S3 and delete the hamsterâ€‘bucket.

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,114
Then go into RDS and delete the MySQL instance.

18
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:04,088
Don't bother taking a final snapshot of the database, unless you're

19
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:08,632
really nostalgic about the results of the Petco 2000.

20
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:12,452
Now go to DynamoDB and delete both tables.

21
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:17,208
Then go to ElastiCache and delete the Redis cluster we created.

22
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,895
You can go into Route 53 and delete the hosted zone,

23
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,559
although it doesn't incur any cost.

24
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:30,153
Then go into API Gateway and delete the entire hamster API we created.

25
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:34,067
Now go to CloudFront and delete the hamster distribution.

26
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,355
We're almost done.

27
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:40,079
Head into the SQS dashboard and delete the queue we created.

28
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,349
Then go the Kinesis Streams dashboard and delete the stream we made.

29
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,300
We also have that lambda consumer,

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,186
so go into the AWS Lambda console and delete that function.

31
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:54,893
Finally, go to SNS and delete the hamster topic,

32
00:01:54,893 --> 00:02:00,279
and then go to CloudWatch and delete the healthy hosts alarm.

33
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:03,162
There's some resources that are still around in IAM,

34
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:08,390
but they have no cost, so you can delete them at your discretion.

35
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:16,000
And that's it. It's hard to believe we can delete so much work in such a short time.
