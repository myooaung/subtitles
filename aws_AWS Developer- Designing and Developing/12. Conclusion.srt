00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,270
We've taken a good tour of what EC2 has to offer,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,400
so you should have a good understanding of how computing works in AWS.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,440
Let's recap what we covered in this module.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,850
We started by discussing some specifics of EC2 instances,

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,790
instance storage and AMIs. Then we talked about the different

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,710
classes of EC2, like spot instances, reserved instances, and onâ€‘demand instances,

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,840
which is what we're using.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,630
After that,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,500
I walked you through how the signing process happens when making a

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,130
request to the AWS REST API, and luckily we don't need to manually

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,380
do that since we're using the SDK.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,050
Then we started writing code as we created a security group,

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,840
a key pair, and finally an EC2 instance.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,320
Once we had that instance,

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,620
we looked at other SDK functions like listing

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,740
instances and terminating instances.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,430
Then, we took a trip to the AWS Marketplace to pick up an AMI

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:13,000
preloaded with Node. And finally, we created an AMI from an instance that we can use when creating other instances.
