Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:09,417
My name is Ryan Lewis, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:11,850
AWS Developer: Designing and Developing.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,048
I've been architecting and creating applications in AWS for many

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,424
years in my work as a senior software engineer.

6
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:23,592
Amazon Web Services is practically a household name in the software industry,

7
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:28,169
and an investment in the platform is a solid investment in your career.

8
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,276
With AWS being a key factor in the success of Amazon,

9
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:37,642
Netflix, and Dropbox, there seems to be no stopping the growth of this giant.

10
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:38,324
In this course,

11
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:42,992
we are going to learn how to design and develop applications with AWS.

12
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:46,136
We'll mostly be working with the software development kit in this course,

13
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:49,776
so make sure to warm up your coding skills.

14
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:54,453
Some of the major topics that we will cover include creating and managing

15
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:58,205
scalable applications with EC2 and Auto Scaling groups,

16
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:03,320
storing and querying data with Relational Database Service and ElastiCache,

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,928
inter‑service messaging using Simple Queue Service and Kinesis Streams,

18
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:14,274
real‑time communications with Simple Notification Service and CloudWatch alarms.

19
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,737
By the end of this course,

20
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:18,889
you'll have the knowledge and experience required to make the

21
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,845
most of AWS in your application development.

22
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:22,823
Before beginning the course,

23
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:26,251
you should already be familiar with the basics of AWS

24
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,252
and have some experience using it.

25
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:32,842
It will also help to have some experience with Node since we'll be

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,769
using the Node AWS software development kit.

27
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,311
I hope you'll join me on this journey to master Amazon Web

28
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:50,000
Services with the AWS Developer: Designing and Developing course here, at Pluralsight.
