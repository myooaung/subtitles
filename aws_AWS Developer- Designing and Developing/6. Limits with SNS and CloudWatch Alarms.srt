1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,922
There aren't many limits when it comes to SNS or CloudWatch alarms.

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,331
This is mostly due to their simple operations.

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:11,206
CloudWatch does have a few more than SNS,

4
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:15,453
so let's take a look at the limits that do exist.

5
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:18,919
One restriction to be aware of with SNS topics is the

6
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,309
allowable characters in a name.

7
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:26,024
Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

8
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,664
Unfortunately, emojis aren't supported.

9
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:31,210
Amazon really needs to get on it though.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,097
CloudWatch has a limit of five actions that can take place per alarm.

11
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:38,288
This is a hard limit and can't be changed.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,657
If you need more actions,

13
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:43,124
you could create a new CloudWatch alarm with the same metrics,

14
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,528
but that might end up being pretty messy.

15
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:51,215
In addition, a CloudWatch alarm period can only be a maximum of a day.

16
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:56,043
Remember the period is used to decide whether the alarm should fire or not.

17
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:59,506
If you're looking for more lengthier time frames than a day,

18
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:04,581
then CloudWatch is probably not the best solution to make those evaluations.

19
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,267
The last restriction is that even though CloudWatch does have

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,722
a mechanism for creating custom metrics,

21
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:13,705
you are restricted by the metrics that AWS makes available.

22
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:14,423
For instance,

23
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:18,130
if we wanted an alarm created whenever Zepto the hamster

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,471
came in sixth place three times in a row,

25
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:25,148
we'd have to look for another place to figure that out.

26
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:28,308
We all know Zepto is a winner though, and that would never happen,

27
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:31,167
so maybe this is just a moot point.

28
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,668
And that's it for limits and restrictions.

29
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,477
In the next clip,

30
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to give you a guide for cleaning up everything we've created in this course.
