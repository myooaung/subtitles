1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,030
As you might expect, DynamoDB,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,080
RDS, and ElastiCache have some more significant limits than the

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,240
other services. Persistence is a much more touchy subject and

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,090
requires both heightened security and a more strict environment in

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,770
order to achieve high performance.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,840
Let's take a look at some of the limits and restrictions.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,800
Dynamo has several restrictions around secondary indexes. You

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,060
can only create up to five global secondary indexes and five

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,000
local secondary indexes per table.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,650
Those local secondary indexes must be created at the same time

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,960
as the table and cannot be deleted after. Global secondary

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,640
indexes don't have this restriction.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,550
Finally, when creating a table,

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,740
tables with secondary indexes must be created consecutively.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,140
More than one cannot be created at the same time.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,120
RDS has limits around numbers of databases and size of the databases,

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,740
which is in the terabytes, but nothing you wouldn't expect.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,720
There are some restrictions about database and user naming,

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,840
but they differ with each database engine,

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,140
so you need to research those yourself.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,090
ElastiCache, similar to RDS, has a limit around the number of clusters and nodes.

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,930
These are soft limits and can be raised with a request to AWS. The one

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,260
restriction to remember is that you can't directly access ElastiCache

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,000
from outside of the VPC it's created in. Beyond that, there's no other restrictions that need mentioning.
