Before we start working with AWS,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
there are some prerequisites you'll need to ensure you have completed.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800
The first is to have the AWS CLI downloaded,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.680
installed, and configured with a user.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.830
The user should have permissions to do almost anything in AWS.

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.080
If you have to be more restrictive than that,

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.800
I recommend taking a look at the services in this course and

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.660
giving yourself read/write permissions only for those. We'll

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.910
be working a lot with the SDK,

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.480
and they generally require you to have your CLI

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.840
level configuration already set up.

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.270
Next, you should have a good code editor installed.

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.070
I'll be using Atom, which is a free editor from GitHub.

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.760
If you want to use something different,

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.450
my only recommendation is to make sure it has

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.200
syntax highlighting and auto indent.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440
Those are pretty essential for JavaScript development.

18
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.730
You'll also need to have Node and npm installed.

19
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.180
You can download these from the Node website at nodejs.org.

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.340
If you download and install Node, it comes with npm.

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.750
A minimum Node version of 12 is recommended for this course.

22
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
Finally, make sure to download the demo project code.

23
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.150
You can get this code in the exercise files section of this course on

24
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.070
Pluralsight. I'm also making it available on GitHub, if you prefer to get it

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.350
from there. I would say the benefit of using the exercise files is that any

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.830
changes in the course are present in that code.

27
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.170
It can be very beneficial to have that available in case you make a typo

28
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:43.000
during a lesson. And that's all you'll need to get started. Now, let's dive deeper into the world of Amazon Web Services.
