00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,030
Hello there.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,350
My name is Ryan Lewis,

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,300
and I'm happy to welcome you to this course AWS

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,840
Developer: Designing and Developing.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,280
If you've come to learn the ins and outs of AWS, then you're in the right place.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,970
This course has a few objectives,

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,360
but the most important is that your understanding and proficiency with

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,740
developing in AWS will have leveled up by the end.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,920
This course is intended as a follow up to my previous

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,120
course AWS Developer: Getting Started.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,960
I will expect familiarity with many of the most common AWS

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,580
services, so if you haven't watched that course yet,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,040
then I definitely suggest taking the time to work through it.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,360
With that being said,

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,220
this course does cover many services already covered in the previous course.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,520
The main difference is the approach and details that we'll be

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,490
covering. The getting started courses goal was to really get you

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,340
familiar with the multitude of AWS's offerings.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,500
This course takes that familiarity and aims to make you

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,580
moderately proficient at developing in AWS by adding even

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,840
more detail and information.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,780
Additionally,

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,430
the focus for this course will be on the development side of AWS and not

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,940
cover infrastructure related services like VPC or IAM.

25
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,530
For this course, we're going to focus on taking a web application,

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,150
and integrating it into AWS. In the process we'll create and

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,460
modify services using multiple different methods,

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,440
such as the CLI and SDK.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,770
I'll take special care to include specific details about each service

30
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:45,000
we're interacting with that should help you understand how to design your AWS architecture for your own applications.
