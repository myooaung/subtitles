00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.714
Now that we understand what a Kinesis Stream is and a little how it works,

2
00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:08.785
let's create our first stream.

3
00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:15.850
Open the create‑kinesis‑stream.js file in our scripts/module_08 folder.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.508
This will be another simple file.

5
00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:21.608
First update your region on line 4.

6
00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:23.050
Then on line 7,

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.408
we're going to declare a const called kinesis and assign to

8
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:31.305
it a new AWS.Kinesis constructor call.

9
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:38.120
On line 10, we call the createKinesisStream function and pass in a streamName.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.326
Let's implement this function by declaring a params const object on line 14.

11
00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:45.389
The first parameter here will be ShardCount,

12
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.127
which is the number of shards the stream will be created with.

13
00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:53.119
You can modify this value later on if the stream needs more capacity,

14
00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.783
but we'll just enter the value 1 here.

15
00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:57.749
The next property is StreamName,

16
00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.708
and we can give that the value of the streamName function argument.

17
00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:08.870
Now inside the Promise, we'll call the kinesis.createStream function call,

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.995
passing in the params object as the first argument and a callback

19
00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:15.961
function with an err argument as the second.

20
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:20.824
If the err object exists, call reject and pass it in; otherwise,

21
00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:22.008
just call resolve.

22
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:26.338
There isn't anything in the data object, so we'll just ignore it.

23
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:27.592
Now that that's complete,

24
00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:31.520
let's create the stream by switching over to your command line.

25
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.563
Execute the command node create‑kinesis‑stream.js.

26
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.252
When it's complete, the process will stop.

27
00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.134
No real output.

28
00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:47.000
In the next clip, we're going to start sending race results to the Kinesis Stream.
