00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.500
The services in AWS are grouped into domains. In the AWS Console, you can

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.240
see how they've grouped them by the application concern each deals with.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.240
Some examples are compute storage and database.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.650
Because there are quite a few services, it helps to group them

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.540
conceptually and provide some context to each.

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.330
In this clip,

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.930
we're going to talk through each AWS domain to help you

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.640
understand what each one contains.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.040
The first and sort of the most important domain is compute.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.710
This domain is for services that assist in

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.260
executing custom code that you provide.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.280
Some examples are EC2 instances or Lambda. Even though there are

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.680
several different service is in this domain,

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.540
all of them ultimately run on EC2 instances under the hood.

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.180
The main differentiator for each is the level of

16
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.940
abstraction and automation the service provides.

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.420
Storage is another important domain that focuses on storing

18
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.340
different types of data for retrieval at a later time.

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.310
Specifically, this is going to be file system like storage.

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.490
We're not talking about databases or cache here. S3 is the

21
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.960
perfect example service for this domain, which is used to

22
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.790
store just about anything these days.

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.740
The next domain is database, and it's pretty selfâ€‘explanatory.

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.580
This domain includes managed SQL databases with Relational

25
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.410
Database Service and NoSQL data stores with DynamoDB.

26
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.490
ElastiCache is also included in this domain, even though it may be

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.640
debatable whether it can be classified as a true database.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.140
Network and content delivery is a hugely important domain

29
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.690
that is often hidden under the covers.

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.520
The networking concerns of this domain manage how external users

31
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.340
access and interact with your application,

32
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.340
as well as how internal AWS resources interact with each other.

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.300
CloudFront rounds out the content delivery aspect of this domain,

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.960
providing your applications with a high quality CDN end to get your content to

35
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.500
users faster than you may ever need to. The developer tools domain is full of

36
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.630
services dedicated to the development process,

37
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.340
such as source control and continuous integration.

38
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.210
These services aren't for users to interact with,

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.140
but really are focused on the developer experience side of AWS.

40
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.090
Using these are optional though. So don't feel like you need to use

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.240
any of these developer tools services if you're developing on AWS.

42
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.630
Services that focus on the service management side are in the

43
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.780
management and governance domain.

44
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.640
These services focus on the creation and management of other services in AWS.

45
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.060
A lot of these services are used more by DevOps engineers,

46
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.140
but we will be using CloudWatch in this course.

47
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.930
The security,

48
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.810
identity, and compliance domain contains services that deal with

49
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.855
managing secure access to your AWS account and individual services. IAM

50
00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:11.320
is the main service here as it manages and provides the policies that

51
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.540
affect nearly every service in AWS.

52
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.740
The analytics domain focuses on service is that allow you

53
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.820
to consume and process data in different ways from

54
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.060
services like Elastic Map Reduce,

55
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.570
which lets you process big data to the Kinesis service, which

56
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.400
provides streams that facilitate data transfer.

57
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.740
Any service focusing on dealing with internal data can be found here.

58
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.100
The last domain we'll talk about is application integration,

59
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.940
which is for services that provide integrations between

60
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.920
other services in AWS. For instance,

61
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.940
services like Simple Notification Service and Simple Queue

62
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.970
Service provides ways for applications and services to

63
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.540
communicate with each other inside AWS.

64
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.320
Simple workflow and step functions give developers ways to orchestrate

65
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.210
applications inside AWS, and those are all the main AWS domains.

66
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.440
There are a few more,

67
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.700
but their relevance to this course and likely your job are

68
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.540
minor enough that I'm leaving them out here.

69
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.760
Now that you understand the AWS domains,

70
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.180
keep them in mind when you're looking for a solution in

71
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.500
your application. There may be a cool new service in a

72
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.000
domain that you're concerned with, and it might just be the perfect solution for your problem.
