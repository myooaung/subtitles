00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.021
Auto scaling groups are responsible for creating and removing EC2

2
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:09.925
instances from a group according to configured rules.

3
00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:13.462
They use a launch configuration when creating the instance,

4
00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:16.367
and they can be attached to a target group, so each

5
00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:19.041
instance can be used with a load balancer.

6
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.286
Let's create our auto scaling group.

7
00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.991
Open the file create‑autoscaling.js.

8
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.851
First, replace your region on line 4.

9
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:32.425
I've already created our autoScaling object on line 7.

10
00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:33.601
You're welcome.

11
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:39.539
On line 11 we need to enter the target group ARN that was created last clip.

12
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.841
If you followed my directions, you should be able to easily retrieve this.

13
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:47.905
If not, you can also get this from the AWS Console.

14
00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:50.013
Paste the value in the string here.

15
00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:53.847
The next few lines run the code to create our Auto Scaling

16
00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:56.609
group and create a policy for that group.

17
00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.264
We'll create the policy in the next clip.

18
00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:04.394
Let's implement the createAutoScalingGroup function on line 17.

19
00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:08.241
Start by declaring our params const object.

20
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:11.197
The first property is AutoScalingGroupName,

21
00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:15.724
which identifies this Auto Scaling group to us.

22
00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:20.049
Enter the argument asgName as the value here.

23
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.453
Next, add the property AvailabilityZones and set the value as an array.

24
00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:27.983
These are the availability zones where the Auto

25
00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:29.531
Scaling group will launch the instances.

26
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.928
At least two need to be defined.

27
00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:37.697
These availability zones need to match the subnets that we used in the

28
00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:42.109
load balancer so that the Auto Scaling group doesn't create an instance

29
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.179
that can't attach to the load balancer.

30
00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.907
In my case, I'm going to put us‑east‑1a and us‑east‑1b.

31
00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:56.193
The next property will be TargetGroupARNs with the value of an array.

32
00:01:56.193 --> 00:02:01.637
Enter the tgArn variable, which we configured earlier.

33
00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:05.798
This property ties the Auto Scaling group to the target group.

34
00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:07.742
The next property is LaunchConfigurationName,

35
00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:12.041
which will have the value lcName from the function argument.

36
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:16.269
This property ties the Auto Scaling group to the

37
00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.210
launch configuration we created.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.372
Next, add the property MaxSize,

39
00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:24.314
which defines the maximum number of instances to create.

40
00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:25.662
I'll enter 2.

41
00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:29.434
The next property is MinSize and defines the minimum

42
00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:32.305
number of instances to have in the group.

43
00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.058
I'll enter 1 here.

44
00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:36.248
Now, after the params object,

45
00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:40.023
return a new Promise with the resolve and reject

46
00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:42.450
arguments in a callback function argument.

47
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.993
Inside,

48
00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:48.419
we'll use the autoScaling object and call the createAutoScalingGroup function.

49
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.163
The first argument will be params,

50
00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:53.064
and the second argument will be our callback function

51
00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:55.667
with the err and data arguments.

52
00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:59.169
If there's an err object, call reject with the err object,

53
00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.464
and otherwise, call resolve with the data argument.

54
00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:05.936
Now we're done with the Auto Scaling group creation code,

55
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:15.000
but we won't execute this file until we've completed the Auto Scaling policy code, and we'll do that in the next clip.
