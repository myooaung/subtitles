1
00:00:02,088 --> 00:00:05,586
Route 53 has two key concepts to know when setting

2
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:08,034
it up to support a domain name.

3
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,950
The first is the hosted zone.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,643
This is basically the domain name itself without subdomains.

5
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:18,603
For instance, example.com or hbfl.online.

6
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,817
The other concept is the record set.

7
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:24,281
This is basically a DNS rule which configures an AWS

8
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,928
resource as the destination of a request.

9
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,377
Each hosted zone will have many record sets in it.

10
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:32,207
In our case,

11
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:36,038
we're going to create a hosted zone for our demo project and then

12
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:40,368
configure a route set to send requests to our load balancer.

13
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,756
One note before we start.

14
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:45,009
Unless you purchase a domain name from a registrar and add

15
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,418
the name servers from your hosted zone,

16
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:52,490
you won't be able to actually test the changes we'll do in this video.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,227
So if you do want to follow and test it,

18
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:59,527
purchase a domain name, and use that instead of the placeholder here.

19
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:04,691
Now, switch over to your code editor and open the file in scripts/module_06,

20
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:09,069
create‑route53‑hostedzone.js.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,868
This file is simple with just one SDK method needing to

22
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:14,296
be called to create this hosted zone.

23
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:18,042
Let's start by updating your region on line 4.

24
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:22,043
Next, we need to create our route53 SDK object.

25
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,554
On line 7,

26
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:30,604
create a route53 const and assign to it a new AWS.Route53 constructor call.

27
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,026
On line 10,

28
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:36,294
we're actually calling the createHostedZone function that we'll implement.

29
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:40,410
Now on line 14, create a params const object.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,265
The SDK method will only need a couple properties here.

31
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:45,005
The first is the Name property,

32
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:49,287
which you can give the value of the hzName function argument.

33
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:54,522
Above, we're passing this in as hbfl.online.

34
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:59,584
If you wanted to use your own domain name, just update the string on line 8.

35
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,404
The next property is CallerReference.

36
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:07,052
This is a unique value that differentiates calls to create hosted zones.

37
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,867
It's required, must be a string,

38
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:13,051
and the easiest thing to do is to just set it to a timestamp.

39
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,520
So for the value here,

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,146
create a string template with back ticks, then evaluate a call to Date.now

41
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:24,872
by surrounding it in the dollar sign curly brace syntax.

42
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,404
That's all we'll need for properties.

43
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:33,931
So now we can come into the Promise and call route53.createHostedZone.

44
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:36,917
The first argument will be our params object and the second

45
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,801
our callback with err and data arguments.

46
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:44,998
Inside, if there's an err object, then call reject with it.

47
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,522
Otherwise, call resolve and pass in data.

48
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:52,118
Passing in data here is important because we'll need one of the

49
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:55,376
values that are output for our next operation.

50
00:02:55,376 --> 00:03:00,928
Now, save the file, and switch over to your command line,

51
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,238
and navigate to the scripts/module‑06 directory.

52
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:10,568
Execute the command node create‑route53‑hostedzone.js.

53
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:15,056
Once it's complete, you should see the JSON output for the request.

54
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,311
The Id field under HostedZone is what you need to save

55
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:26,000
because we'll use it in our next clip where we'll create a record set for this hosted zone.
