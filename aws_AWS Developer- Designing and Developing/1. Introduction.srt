00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,450
Hello, and welcome back to AWS Developer, Designing, and

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,910
Developing. This is the last module for this course, and we're

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,110
going out with a bang by covering two services that will increase

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,880
the realâ€‘time nature of your applications.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,690
Simple notification service, or SNS, is used to send notifications to users

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:28,350
via SMS, email, HTTP, and many other ways. A usual trigger of SNS is

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,420
CloudWatch Alarms and those can be configured to make sure that your

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,790
application and services stay up and healthy.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,640
Let's take a look at what we'll be covering in this module.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,950
We'll start by creating an SNS topic and subscribing to

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,540
it with your mobile phone or email.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,420
Then we'll modify our demo project to publish race

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,640
results to the topic and give it a whirl.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,010
Next,

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,640
we'll create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor our application health and send

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,230
notifications if something happens. We'll end out the module discussing

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,300
some limits around SNS and CloudWatch alarms.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:12,000
And then we'll have a special clip on what resources to delete as you're cleaning up your AWS account after this course.
