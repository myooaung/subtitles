Static website hosting with S3 is one of AWS' oldest

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.040
solutions, launching shortly after S3 itself.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.080
And while AWS has since released other services that provide

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.500
similar functionality, S3 static hosting still continues to be one

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.240
of the easiest to configure and work with.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.940
Let's take a look at how it works.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.450
First,

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.130
let's look at the difference between a website and

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.290
an S3 bucket. With an S3 bucket, you use keys to get back objects.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.610
Every object must be referenced directly, and only that object is returned.

11
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.340
It's just like getting static assets.

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.750
A website is different because you can reference a path,

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.310
and some HTML will be returned to you.

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.740
You don't have to reference the file where the HTML is explicitly.

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.280
In many ways, that's what S3 static hosting is really providing.

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.160
It's letting you configure some static behavior to occur when a

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
directory is referenced in the URL. With S3 static hosting,

18
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.390
you configure what the name of your index file will be and

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.880
what the name of your error file will be.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.440
The defaults are index.html and error.html.

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.050
Then you can place these files in any directory in your S3 bucket,

22
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.340
and they will be returned when that path is navigated to.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.100
In addition,

24
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.280
S3 static website hosting gives you a unique URL to use to get to the site root.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.430
There isn't too much complexity involved,

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:42.000
but it provides a simple solution when you need a simple site. In the next clip, we're going to get a static site set up using our existing S3 bucket.
