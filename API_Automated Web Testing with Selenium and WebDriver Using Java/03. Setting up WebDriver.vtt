00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.290
Rather than talk about using WebDriver,

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.940
we're going to dive right in and begin using it and explain it as we go.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.070
I've gone ahead and opened up IntelliJ.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.990
That's the IDE that I'm using as we get a lot of corporate requests for that,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.680
but the instructions are almost exactly the same for Eclipse or Spring STS.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm going to click Create New Project.

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.290
I'm going to choose Java 11 for the SDK and Maven for the

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.840
project type that I want to create.

9
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.670
Click Next.

10
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.130
And I'm going to expand our artifact coordinates.

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.440
Change this to com.pluralsight.

12
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.160
And the name, I'm going to call this WebDriverDemo.

13
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.470
So all of our settings should be a GroupId of com.pluralsight,

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.840
ArtifactId of WebDriverDemo, and the version is 1.0‑SNAPSHOT.

15
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.240
If this is a little foreign to you, don't worry about it.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.770
We're not going to get very deep into the nuances of Maven,

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.260
but this will set up our project and get it running for us.

18
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.340
Let's click Finish, and that will bring up our project like this.

19
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.690
There's a couple things I'm going to show you in here really quick.

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.500
I am going to enable auto import of dependencies that we add to our application,

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.160
and I'm going to give us more real estate to look at the XML.

22
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.050
But you already have a basic project structure set up inside of here,

23
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.570
src, main, java, src, test, java, and our POM file,

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.040
and that's everything we need to get started in our application.

25
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.900
There are three changes we want to make to our Maven POM file,

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.910
and I'm going to go below that closing version tag

27
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.540
and before the closing project tag.

28
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.050
And the first thing I'm going to add is a property section

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.540
with a maven.compiler.release property,

30
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.210
and that's going to be set to 1.11 and that's because

31
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.320
that's the JDK I have installed is 1.11.

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.700
If you're using something different,

33
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.240
you'll want to put the appropriate release inside of there.

34
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.630
Let me save that.

35
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.790
Below that properties element, we want to add a dependency section.

36
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.060
And I'm going to just paste this in here because you likely

37
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.440
don't want to watch me type this all in,

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.600
but I'll walk through what the pieces are here.

39
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.530
So we have a dependencies element, and inside of that,

40
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.840
we have a dependency element.

41
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.230
And then the attributes for that are a groupId of org.seleniumhq.selenium,

42
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:43.240
an artifact of selenium‑java, and the version of 4.0.0‑beta‑4.

43
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.440
Now, as of the recording of this course,

44
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.020
4.0.0‑beta‑4 is the current release of this.

45
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.190
All the features we're using have been standardized

46
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.410
for a long time inside of there,

47
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.760
so there's really not any risks associated with that.

48
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.620
I will update the course to a non‑beta when it is published and live.

49
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.090
And then the last piece we want to add is below the dependencies element.

50
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.550
We want to add a build section that contains the plugins and plugin element.

51
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.410
And the particular plugin that we're going to add has a groupId of

52
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.640
org.apache.maven.plugins and an artifact of maven‑compiler‑plugin.

53
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.740
The specific version is 3.8.1,

54
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.400
and that actually takes advantage of that property that we

55
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.100
first added of maven.compiler.release 1.11.

56
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.000
So those two work in conjunction with one another,

57
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.890
and all that does is it says the source code we want to

58
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.960
compile to Java 11 and run as Java 11 both.

59
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.640
And the dependencies we're downloading are the Java

60
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.690
Selenium dependency 4.0.0‑beta‑4.

61
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.640
When we save this, if you enable those auto imports,

62
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.340
it'll go through and automatically download those all for you.

63
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.260
Now that we have all of that done,

64
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.940
let's start writing some Java code, and we do that by right‑clicking on src,

65
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.370
main, java and say New, Java Class.

66
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.200
And for the class name, we're going to say com.pluralsight.WebDriverDemo.

67
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.100
Click Enter, and that'll create this class for us.

68
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:40.440
And to that, let's add a public static void main,

69
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.340
and this will give us the basic structure for our first test.

70
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070
Now I will tell you we're going to set this up,

71
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.190
and it's going to fail the first time we run this,

72
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.290
and we'll fix that.

73
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.470
But it's going to fail the very first time that we run this test.

74
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.400
Inside that main method,

75
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:12.530
let's add a WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver and say driver.get.

76
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:24.940
For the URL, say http://www.pluralsight.com and save this.

77
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.970
And right‑click on this and run that as an application.

78
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.480
So we'll say Run WebDriverDemo.main.

79
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.600
This will pop up and run, and you'll see that it has an error.

80
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.790
It says that the path to the driver executable,

81
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.070
the path to the driver, excuse me,

82
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.640
must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property.

83
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.240
So this is a little error that you're going to get the first time you run this.

84
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.440
We'll show you a couple of different ways to fix this.

85
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.030
If you scroll clear over to the end of the message,

86
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.830
you can see that it tells you to download the latest version of

87
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.750
this driver that it's saying must be installed.

88
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.790
Let's pull up that page now and take a look at it and see what it says.

89
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.710
Clicking on that link in our error log,

90
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.040
it'll bring you to this site for downloading the appropriate driver.

91
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.330
You can check which version of the browser you're using by

92
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.700
going to the About section underneath the File menu to see

93
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.500
which version you're currently running.

94
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.820
I'm running 92, so I'm going to click on that link there,

95
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.140
and it will take me to this download page.

96
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.320
And I'm using a Mac,

97
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.920
so I'm going to grab the mac64.zip version. And I've already downloaded that.

98
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.300
Choose the appropriate one for your machine and grab that.

99
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.340
And then let's unzip that in your project structure.

100
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.970
The easiest way for us to get our test up and running is to

101
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.220
actually download that zip file to the root of the workspace we

102
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.500
just created. So underneath our WebDriverDemo,

103
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.620
right alongside our pom.xml file and our src and target folders,

104
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.560
I'm just going to extract it to right here. And you'll see

105
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.590
that it drops an executable in there.

106
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.970
Now depending on your platform, when we go to run our test again,

107
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.820
you may have to give this permission.

108
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.080
So it's different for every platform. You should be familiar with that.

109
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.190
It's kind of outside of the scope of this course.

110
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.030
You may have to go grant it for this exe to execute. So in your system

111
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.250
preferences and security on a Mac or in your Windows machine,

112
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.780
the dialog will pop up where you grant it permissions,

113
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.780
but you may have to do that.

114
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.840
So keep an eye out for that dialog.

115
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.620
Let's switch back over to our editor.

116
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.280
Now with that zip file at the root of our project,

117
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.740
we can try and run this again.

118
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.900
Now if you don't have that at the root of your project,

119
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.280
it's not going to find it.

120
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.370
So let's try and run it, and it will go through and launch our

121
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.340
application, and it should pull up a browser window for us.

122
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.910
And sure enough, it did.

123
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.020
You should be seeing something very similar to this where it

124
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:17.000
opened up the pluralsight.com website to where we can start writing a test against this.
