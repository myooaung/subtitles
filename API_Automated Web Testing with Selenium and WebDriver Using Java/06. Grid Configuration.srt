1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,790
We can now set up our Selenium Server in grid mode,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,040
and it's going to be very similar to what we've already done.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,040
We'll start off by creating the hub on one PC,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,170
and that will also have a node on it.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,410
I'm going to use a virtual machine, and then I'm going to run the second

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,060
node on that virtual machine. And then we will show you what has to

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,280
change to run another node on that same machine and what breaks. What

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,700
we'll see here is that each one of these noses just going to be a

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,190
separate instance of Selenium Server, and we're just going to specify

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,140
what role is playing.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,290
So for the hub, we're just going to specify that it's

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,300
in hub mode. And then the nodes,

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,590
we're going to specify that they're in node mode.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,740
And then we're going to tell all them where to connect to the hub.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,660
By doing that, we'll have all of these nodes connected to

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,470
the hub, and then we can actually see that these nodes are

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,340
communicating back and forth.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,900
The purpose of doing this is twoâ€‘fold. One,

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,530
it allows you to distribute your tests so that you can run them

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,490
in parallel all through the same coordinator,

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,410
which is the hub. And two, it allows you to run on different platforms or

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,990
different configurations and have the hub be smart enough to figure out

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:18,000
what node is connected and which node to use based on what kind of requirements you have for running your test.
