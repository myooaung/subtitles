If you are new to automation and maybe heard of Selenium and

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.700
possibly heard of WebDriver, you may be wondering what the

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.740
difference is between the two.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.380
Well, a few years ago Selenium and WebDriver were actually

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.080
separate products and separate applications.

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.490
In fact, they were separate companies.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.430
Selenium consumed the WebDriver API and they integrated it into one

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.570
product offering. The Selenium IDE itself, as we just saw, is a

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.650
great way for us to go through and click and record what we're

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.190
testing inside of a browser using the Selenium IDE, and then play

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.940
that back going forward.

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.070
WebDriver is actually the API for us to go through and automate

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.930
the testing of our IDE and browser through Java code or .NET or

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.740
some other programming language.

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.710
They'll provide all the basic bindings for us to go through and

16
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.740
automate that browser from our source code.

17
00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's take a look at what WebDriver examples look like and what that code would look like inside of our IDE now.
