In the real world, you often have to deal with messy malformed HTML.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.450
It's often buried in nested tables. Even though people have been

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.010
phasing out tables for years in favor of CSS constructs, this is just

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.040
a way that a lot of web pages get written.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.070
Oftentimes, you don't have control over web pages so you have to deal

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.940
with this kind of mess of having nested tables and having your

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.150
elements being deeply buried inside of some nested table. That's

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.930
actually not that difficult to deal with.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.150
It's just the same thing that we've been doing so far in order to get,

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.680
let's say, a row out of a nested table. But you just have to be

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.000
a little bit smart about how you go about getting the elements

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.600
and try to not get overwhelmed.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.940
Just take it one step at a time.

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.850
I'm going to show you first the normal way that we've been doing so far

15
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.110
to get elements out of a table, and then we're going to look at using

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.130
XPath. We'll finally have a justification for using some of the more

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.540
complex selectors to find elements on a page, like XPath. I recommend

18
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.900
that you don't use XPath unless you have a sufficiently complex page

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.280
structure because it does add one more layer of technology that some

20
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.340
nests understand.

21
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.980
But in the case of nested tables, a lot of times XPath is

22
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.000
going to be the best and most succinct way to access a row or some data that's inside of a table.
