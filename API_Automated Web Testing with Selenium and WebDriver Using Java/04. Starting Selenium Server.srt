00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,050
To set up Selenium Server,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,460
you just want to open up your browser and navigate to selenium.dev.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,790
And there is the menu item up at the top for downloads.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,610
If we select that, we'll go to the Downloads page,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,440
and you'll see at the top here Selenium Server and in parentheses grid.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,840
Don't be caught off by their naming convention or their numbering metrics.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,620
This is a dot release in the sense that .4 is actually less than .141.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,350
One of the previous releases of this course had us using .34,

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,590
which is a much older version than 3.141.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,470
And so we're going to grab the latest release here.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,820
And when you download this,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,630
you're going to get a warning in here saying that there's things of

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,250
this type of download that could harm your computer,

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,580
and that's because it's a JAR.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,240
It's an executable Java archive.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,750
We do want to keep it, so let's click that Keep button and let it download.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,090
And we'll switch over to where that downloaded it on the file system,

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,680
and you can see I have mine downloaded here under my dev/tools directory.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,010
And you're going to want to remember that path and probably put it in an

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,100
easy path for you to navigate to from the terminal because we are going to

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,840
now go out to the terminal to execute this JAR.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,940
Inside of my command prompt at my terminal,

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,290
I'm going to navigate to that directory where I just downloaded the JAR to.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,540
So for me, I'm going to cd to dev/tools.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,640
And then,

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,500
we're going to execute that JAR, so I want to type in java

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:51,430
‑jar selenium‑server‑standalone‑3.141.59.jar.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,300
Your version maybe different.

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,390
Obviously, do the version that you downloaded, but

30
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,340
this is the current version for me.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,270
I'm going to hit Enter, and we'll see this start up our server. You'll

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,020
notice a couple of things, that it is started up and running on port

33
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:17,000
444, and it's initialized our WebDriver Server. So we are up and running, and our server is ready to go.
