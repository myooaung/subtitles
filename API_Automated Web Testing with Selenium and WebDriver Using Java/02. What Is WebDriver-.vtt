What is WebDriver? We already spoke about WebDriver a little bit

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.370
in the first module, and we saw how it worked.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.620
But let's take a quick recap just to make sure that we understand

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.440
what WebDriver is and how we're going to use it.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.230
WebDriver is basically that API that we're going to use to

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.940
programmatically control a web browser through a test.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.890
We've seen exactly how it worked using HTTP to communicate from a

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.120
language binding to a WebDriver implementation on each one of the

9
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.470
browsers, but now we're actually going to use that.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.820
So basically, you can think of WebDriver as the API, and we're going

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.440
to be programming against that API using Java code.

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.870
We're going to be able to do that through automation using different

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.790
browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox, IE, or even HtmlUnit using a

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.640
WebDriver script that we're going to create.

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:04.000
We're going to essentially be using Java almost like a scripting language in order to script the automation of a browser.
