00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.170
In the last demo, we created two projects,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.760
one called Tests and the other called TestFramework.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.860
The reason for doing this is so that the tests that we create don't rely on

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.540
Selenium and provide a layer of abstraction from our site.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
We want to remove that brittleness that we spoke about before.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.000
The two projects give us that layer of abstraction that we're looking for. Let's begin writing our tests now and build out our framework of abstraction.
