00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.610
In the previous demo,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.060
we had just expanded the ChromeDriver underneath our project,

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.070
and that works.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.180
It works just fine.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.840
There's actually no problems with doing that.

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.970
There's only one caveat to that that I personally don't really care for,

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.600
and that is for every project that we have,

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
we need to expand a copy of that at the root of that

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.240
project so that it's on our path.

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.130
There's a couple of ways you go about adding this to your path.

11
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
You can create a common directory and then go through and modify your path.

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540
Well,

13
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.120
ChromeDriver and Selenium and all of the developers that work with that have

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.380
actually put together some quick installation tools that you can go through and

15
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.030
install ChromeDriver or the GeckoDriver or any of the other tools quite easily

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.240
without you needing to go through and try and edit environment variables and

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.140
get them set up the correct way.

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
So let's first off begin by deleting these out of our project,

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.150
so I'm going to move those to my trash.

20
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.680
And then I'm going to go to my browser really quick and grab the

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.350
correct installation command to execute this from the command

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.840
line that will install it for me.

23
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.550
I have Homebrew installed.

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.590
So based off of their installation instructions here

25
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.100
on the GitHub page for Selenium HQ,

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.100
I can just type in brew install ‑‑cask chromedriver,

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.250
and it will install this for me from the terminal.

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.720
Switching over to my terminal,

29
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.140
I'm just going to paste in that command of brew install ‑‑cask space

30
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.610
chromedriver and hit Enter, and it will go through and download all of these

31
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.100
libraries and install them in the correct location.

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.260
You can see I've already got it installed.

33
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.500
Now we go back to our IDE and execute that, and the test should

34
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.140
run just the same. Running the test again,

35
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.550
I can go ahead and execute it, and it should pull up a browser window for

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.680
me. And there is the browser window. So my test executed. I didn't have to

37
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.520
have a copy of that installed at the root of every project that I have,

38
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.340
and I can clean it up a little bit.

39
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.660
There's instructions there for Mac,

40
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.740
Linux, and Windows installations for you to not have to do that or to set

41
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.900
system properties inside of each Java file as well.

42
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.000
That's another common hack that people will use to get this up and running. So using brew or apt‑get is really easy for us to get up and running this way..
