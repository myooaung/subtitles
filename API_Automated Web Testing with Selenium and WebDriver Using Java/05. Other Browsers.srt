00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,710
Now that we have everything running for Chrome,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,120
let's show you how to do the same thing for Firefox.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,160
I'm going to comment out that current ChromeDriver we have

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,700
and add a new WebDriver for Firefox.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,240
We're going to run into almost the exact same set of problems.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
So if I add that FirefoxDriver and try and execute it,

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,220
it's going to tell us that it's not installed and we need to

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,110
go through and install it the same way.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,750
And it's the exact same process whether you're on a

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,320
Windows box or Linux box or a Mac, just like we did before for the ChromeDriver.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm going to switch over to our terminal and install that Firefox

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,520
driver using Homebrew. And to do that, I'm just going to say brew

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,490
install geckodriver. It'll go through and download the resources that

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,340
it needs to. It'll take it a second that first time you go to do it.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,650
And now this is installed,

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,060
we can switch back over to our IDE and run it. Back

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,040
over in our IDE if we run that,

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,550
it'll go through and fire up the FirefoxDriver, and you should

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,570
get a browser in Firefox that's loaded up and pulled up the

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,240
Pluralsight website. And sure enough, that's what I've got here.

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,420
One interesting thing to note about Firefox is that if you look up at

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,050
the address bar where it says www.pluralsight.com,

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,580
you can see the robot icon that is telling you that this browser was

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,970
launched and is operating under the control of a bot, which is kind of

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,000
an interesting feature, and I like how it kind of cues you in on that.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,630
But our test is now set up to run that way. Let's switch back over to

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,080
the editor and switch it back to Chrome just to keep it consistent with

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,810
the rest of course.

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,400
But you can see how easily you can switch from browser to

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,350
browser with this. Switching it back,

31
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm just going to get rid of those comments.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,340
Delete that line, and I'll clean up my imports while I'm at it and save

33
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,140
that. We're back to running everything with Chrome.

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,770
You can go ahead and test it on your end,

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:15,000
but I know it's working on mine already. So we're good to move on and see about how we can find elements on a page.
