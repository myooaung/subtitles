00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.330
We covered a lot of material in this module.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.860
Companies spend months developing out frameworks,

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.040
but this should give you a nice launching platform to get yours started.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.240
We covered why you'd want to have an abstraction in your framework and

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.950
the page object model and how an object maps to a page.

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.410
We spoke about performance and how it's better over time using your own

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.180
framework and that using WebDriver doesn't mean you shouldn't use the Selenium

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.440
IDE. And in fact, the Selenium IDE is a great combination.

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.120
And then we talked about where and how you want to do threading

10
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.390
inside of your application, and you could look at using something

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.450
like Jenkins to integrate that at that unit test level and fire off

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.240
those individual unit tests.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.290
We've now reached the end of this course, and I want to

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.260
thank you for following along with me.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.000
I hope you found it valuable, and it's helpful in you mastering automated QA practices of your own.
