00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
One thing that we have not covered that we talked about

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.170
quite a bit in the last module was the assert and verify,

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.450
and there's a good reason for that.

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.230
The assert and verify is typically used in a programmatic fashion. It doesn't

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680
mean that it doesn't work with what we're trying to do now,

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.840
but it's usually set up for something like a framework.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.590
So if you wanted to test if you're at a certain location or if your page

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.280
contains something where you're currently at in this scenario,

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.260
you could do this where you say driver.getPageSource and see if it

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.090
contains some text that you want to search for.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.330
And that will allow you to say, oh, I'm not where I think I am

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.040
and stop the execution of your current test.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.680
But we're going to, in the later modules, build the assert and verify into

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.170
the framework that we're going to build upon, and that's why we have to

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.000
teach you the basics of WebDriver first before we can dive deeper into that for building such a framework.
