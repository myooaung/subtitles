1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,340
Similar to our previous examples, let's go ahead and create another HTML page.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,440
So I'm going to right‑click on src, main, webapp and say a New, HTML File.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,740
I'm going to call this SelectItemTest.html.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,870
And inside of here, I'm going to give it a title of SelectItemTest.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,250
And for the body,

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:32,010
I'm going to add in there a form with the select element and

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,390
three options underneath there of Yes, No,

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,120
and Maybe.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,750
I'm going to go ahead and save this,

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,270
and then I'm going to create another WebDriver test just like we

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,820
did with checkboxes and radio buttons by going up to src, main,

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,810
java and, on the com.pluralsight package,

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,640
right‑clicking and saying New, Java Class. We'll call this

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:10,100
WebDriverSelectItem and hit Enter on here. And we can go ahead and copy

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,940
out of one of our other examples that public static void main

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,140
WebDriver. We'll change that address of that file.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,510
We'll go over to our WebDriverSelect and make sure that we add in there

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,870
the closing brace so we don't have unbalanced curly braces. And we need

19
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,130
to get the correct URL in here for this,

20
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,440
which is going to be SelectItemTest and save that.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,240
Remember, if you forgot how to do that, you can right‑click on your file,

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,150
Reveal in Finder, and open that up with your browser, and it will

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,440
give you that correct address for that file.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,680
Now from here, we're going to do something a little

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
differently than what we've done in the past.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,980
Not far off,

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,130
but there's a support or helper class that makes this a

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,740
little bit easier for these select items.

29
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,670
So I'm going to make this full screen for a minute just to give

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,020
you a little bit more real estate. And inside of here, I want

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,640
to say WebElement selectElement.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,590
And we're going to just do a simple driver.findElement, and we're going to do

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:35,320
it By.id. And the id that we want to use is just select1, and that was in the

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,810
HTML that we had just pasted over there. Now underneath here, there is a

35
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,350
helper class under the support package.

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,090
So I want to say Select, and you can see it right here is that first

37
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,490
option that's just the straight word Select, and it's under the

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,870
org.openqa.selenium.support.ui package.

39
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,900
So it's one of their support jars that contains these

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,940
classes for making things a little bit easier.

41
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:12,030
So I'm going to say Select select = to new Select. And you do something

42
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,090
a little interesting here. You pass in the selectElement. And if you're

43
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,090
at all familiar with design patterns, this is a wrapper pattern.

44
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,240
So we're taking and wrapping that select element with a Select object to

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,240
interact with that interface differently and make it a little bit more easy

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,710
than having to do some of the nuanced fine details of navigating through that

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:48,540
element. From here, we can now say select.selectByVisibleText, and we'll say

48
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,370
Maybe. So we want to choose that option for maybe. Now let's go ahead and run

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:03,750
this and see what it did inside of our page for us. So I can just right‑click

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:12,640
on this and say run WebDriverSelectItem, and it'll pull up my browser. And we

51
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,270
can see that it pops up with the option of Maybe selected. Looking at our

52
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,690
drop‑down list, that was the last one in our list.

53
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,410
It could have started with Yes,

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,520
No. It selected Maybe, which is exactly the

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,140
functionality that we are looking for.

56
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,910
So those helper classes make that a lot easier, and we don't

57
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,100
have to navigate through that element and do different

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,000
find‑bys or selectors to get it. We can just use that wrapper class.
