00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,090
Let's dive right in and show you a test with the Selenium IDE.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,650
This is a simple test that's going to do some record and playback for us. To

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,670
do this, I want to go ahead and navigate to our Extensions icon, and we're

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,510
going to talk more about this later, in fact how this gets installed as an

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,740
icon, and choose the Selenium IDE.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,370
You can see that this opens up another dialog where one of the menu

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,810
selections is to Record a new test in a new project.

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,060
We want to go ahead and choose that. And it's going to ask us to

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,440
name our test, so we'll say Test and click OK.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,780
Then it will ask us for the base URL, so we'll enter in

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:56,450
https://www.selenium.dev, and say Start Recording. You'll notice that it

12
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,720
automatically navigated to this page for us, and in the bottom right‑hand

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,450
corner of your screen it says that the Selenium IDE is recording.

14
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,240
This is a new feature with the more current releases of Selenium IDE. So

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,590
navigate down, and in the center of our page we have this Download link for

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,740
the Selenium IDE, and we can click Download. And when we get here, there's

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,490
a couple of things we can do. Just for the sake of this simple test, you'll

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,410
notice that the title of our page in the upper left‑hand corner for me here

19
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,830
is Downloads.

20
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:37,030
If I right‑click on this page and go to Selenium IDE, there is an Assert, Store,

21
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,920
Verify,

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,340
Wait For. We can just choose Assert for our title and see that

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,220
our title matches what we think it should.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:51,880
So, the title of this page is Downloads, our IDE should now assert that

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,340
the title of this page does in fact equal Downloads.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,610
If we switch back to our Selenium IDE, you can see that

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,750
it opened up, went to our base page,

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,600
it actually set the window size because I'm running this as full screen,

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,930
it clicked and chose a CSS identifier for the click that

30
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,000
was our Download link, and it asserted that the title of

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,540
that page was in fact Downloads.

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,040
Now, it may not be readily apparent how powerful that is,

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,960
but if you realize, this just navigated to a page for you and

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,590
verified all of that functionality. And if I come up here and

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,550
choose to run that test again,

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,320
it's going to fire up a browser window very quickly and

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,350
run through that test completely again.

38
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,270
So if I choose that, and we're still recording,

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:57,140
you have to stop that, name it, we'll say Test, and run all tests again,

40
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,350
you can see that it went through and did all of that.

41
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,460
If we go back to our IDE again, you can see that it ran once and it's green.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,000
We have a green Test passed successfully bar in that lower left‑hand corner here.
