We've talked a little bit about how, but why is automated testing so important?

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.360
It helps us to not reintroduce bugs back into our code base.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.010
It's not uncommon now for us to work in a concurrent

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.260
work mode. Speaking of concurrency,

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.130
this image is actually the check‑ins that I had for my

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
own source code just while creating this course. You can

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.010
see multiple check‑in points,

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880
not to mention that I have multiple branches too. You

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.960
can have code and production, testing,

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.120
development, all these different places and then realize

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.970
that you need to fix something that is currently in a

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.440
different state, such as production.

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.510
I can run my tests against each branch and verify that nothing

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.840
is broken or reintroduced into our product.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.480
And another reason why Selenium and WebDriver is such a great solution is

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.740
that it tests like an end user does inside the browser.

17
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.560
Unlike some other testing tools, such as unit tests and integration tests,

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.330
automated tests through the browser are how the end

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.240
user sees and uses the application.

20
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.890
And the last point that I wanted to talk about is that

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.630
automated tests provide us two other benefits.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.370
First, they make us clarify our business requirements.

23
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.440
What I mean by this is that if you can't tell me how we can clearly test this,

24
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.860
then how can we develop it, or more to the point,

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.000
how can I know that we are done developing it? And second, the tests aren't up for interpretation, hey are exact and measured.
