1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,600
I want to point out one more thing about the base URL inside of our application.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,300
And you can see in the News test here that we have

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,230
selected https://www.selenium.dev,

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,550
and our first command is an open command on slash.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,350
And in our Downloads test, and I didn't do this on purpose,

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,450
it actually caught it as I was filming this. The next open

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,220
command is for https://www.selenium.dev.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,310
So even though I have a base URL, I have a hardcoded URL in there.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,620
And I actually want to change that because that can break.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,870
And the reason that that can break is I don't want this to be hardcoded to

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,220
that web page. I'm going to save that so that everything is based off of this,

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,930
and I'm going to go back to our workspace that we have for Selenium and choose

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:06,820
the SeleniumNews.side and replace that so that I don't have multiple copies of

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,040
that same thing out there.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
Now, what does that do for us or why does that matter?

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,210
As we run our tests, we oftentimes want to run them

17
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,890
against different environments. Right now,

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,200
we're just going against this www.selenium.dev.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,460
But what if we had something, and we don't in this example, but what if

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,360
we had like prod for production or we had dev or test?

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,650
I want all of those tests to run against that URL, and that's a

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,780
common thing with a test harness or a test suite.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,540
And so I don't want things hardcoded or absolute path

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,140
hardcoded inside of our commands.

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:56,000
So a good little error that we just produced and we caught, and we want to use those relative paths inside of our application.
