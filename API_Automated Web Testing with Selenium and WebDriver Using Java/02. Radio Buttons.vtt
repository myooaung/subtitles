00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.740
We're going to start off by looking how we can select a radio button.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.680
A radio button is a very common HTML element, and it's a little bit difficult

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.340
to figure out how do I select a particular radio button?

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.170
You can see here is some typical HTML code that you might

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.240
have that would display some radio buttons,

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.360
red, green,

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.940
blue, and we're going to want to be able to select

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.620
one of these individual colors.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.940
Oftentimes, radio buttons don't have an ID, so we can just select

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.440
by name or we could select by the tag itself.

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.550
Usually, going by the name is good because it's going to

12
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.740
give us the correct group of radio buttons.

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.400
We can then, of course, select multiple elements and pick the index,

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.340
and that's the strategy that we're going to use.

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.680
We're also going to show you how to do testing when you don't necessarily

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.070
have a web page that has what you want consistently.

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.660
We're just going to create an HTML page.

18
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.440
We're going to load that up in Selenium,

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.000
even though it's not existing out there on the web. Let's go ahead and do that and see how we can select that radio button.
