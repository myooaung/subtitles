00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.020
So far,

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.440
we haven't created any other test so we really don't have a test suite yet.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.510
Before we do that,

4
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.410
I want to go ahead and clean up this verify at the

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.240
bottom to not be bbbeta anymore,

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.910
and I want to get rid of this verify text that was failing.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.850
So if we run this now, everything should come back green.

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.340
Then we're going to go through when this finishes and create another test.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.640
So everything looks good there. And depending on which menu you're

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.790
selected, right now I'm in the Executing selection.

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.140
I want to go to my tests and select the plus icon to add a new test.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.960
I'm going to call this one Downloads and click Add. Now before I proceed,

13
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.050
I want to point out something here, and that is this base URL at

14
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.170
the top of my test is for that test suite.

15
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.250
So if you try to do a test that goes on another site from a different

16
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.910
base URL, it's going to break your other tests.

17
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.410
That's a mistake I have made before, and I want to

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.640
call out for you to not change that.

19
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.100
So if you need to go to another base URL, you need

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.660
to have a different test suite.

21
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.070
So all of these tests are going to run against selenium.dev. From

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.480
here, with my Downloads test inside of our test suite,

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.460
I can click record, and it's going to fire up a new browser window for us

24
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.120
because it's a different test. And I can click the downloads, and I'm

25
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.300
going to verify that the grid is on this page.

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.800
So I'll say Selenium, Verify, Text, and we've got a verify text

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.220
for that CSS element for Selenium Grid. I can switch back over to

28
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.640
the Selenium IDE, stop recording.

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.890
And if I want to run just this current test, it opens up the browser,

30
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.060
navigates, switches to the Downloads page, and that works.

31
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.440
Or I can run the entire test suite,

32
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
which is I'll test the play button on the left, and that'll go

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.180
through and do the downloads that we just created, as well as the

34
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.310
news for an entire test harness across that entire base URL. And

35
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.880
everything's executing correctly for us.

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.200
Again, we can speed up that so it will finish both of those tests faster.

37
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.000
But you can see that we have a testing suite being built for our base URL of selenium.dev.
