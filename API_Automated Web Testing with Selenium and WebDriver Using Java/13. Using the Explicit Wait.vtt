00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.900
Adding an implicit wait in our code is actually quite easy to do,

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.270
and it's one of those things that you may not think about doing because you

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.700
don't experience it until you've actually had that problem.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.140
You don't preemptively wait for things.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.810
The Google Image search that we did earlier is one of those that sometimes

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.840
plagues people because of network latency or other issues.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.190
Sometimes it is because they're not on a current version of Chrome.

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.440
There's a multitude of reasons as to why it could

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.330
occur for them and not for you.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.140
But let's show you how to add that implicit wait inside of your app.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.130
I'm going to open up our WebDriver demo, the very first demo that we did.

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.830
I'm going to make this full screen for a minute. And I'm going to go below

13
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:53.640
where we sent the enter keys and above where we grabbed that images link and

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.260
give myself a little bit of space. And I'm going to say WebDriverWait wait =

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.490
new WebDriverWait. And I'm going to pass into there driver, and I'm going to

16
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:24.760
say Duration.ofSeconds is 10. And then I want to say wait.until, and then

17
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.040
here we can pass in an ExpectedConditions of .presenceOfElementLocated

18
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.390
By.linkText.

19
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.950
So you can see it's very similar to all the other stuff that we've done

20
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.560
so far. And I'm going to say that I don't want you to try and proceed

21
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.800
until the images link is for sure there,

22
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.220
that that page has downloaded those images and that

23
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.730
link is available for me to click on.

24
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.710
So if you run into a situation where you're trying to select

25
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.440
something and it's not available on the page yet,

26
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.410
this is how you go about doing this. And this says that it'll wait

27
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.070
for a maximum of 10 seconds before it errors out.

28
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.080
But instead of it doing it immediately in like 100 ms or 2 or 300

29
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.750
ms, it says I'll keep checking for every 500 ms to see if that is

30
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.960
there, so give it half a second to see if it's there and then

31
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.630
proceed once it is there.

32
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.600
So let's save this, and you'll notice your test is going to

33
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.540
run very similar to how it did before.

34
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.010
You may not even notice any differences at all,

35
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.230
but it will have verified that that images link is available to click on

36
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.810
before proceeding. So I'm going to exit full screen, right‑click on main, and

37
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.980
say run WebDriverDemo, and it'll pull up my browser. And it completed the

38
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.210
test just as before, but with also verifying that that images link was, in

39
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.360
fact, available before it proceeded on. So it had a chance to get all of that

40
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.370
information on the page.

41
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.960
This is really useful if you're doing things with

42
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.960
JavaScript or you have a single‑page application that's

43
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.940
loading some things behind the scenes.

44
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.000
You've done some preemptive caching. This is a great technique to get around that.
