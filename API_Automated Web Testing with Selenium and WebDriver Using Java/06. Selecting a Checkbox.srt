1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's start off by creating a another HTML page.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,170
We're going to do that by going to src, main,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,140
webapp, right‑clicking and saying New, HTML File.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:18,560
And we'll call this CheckboxTest.html.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:28,470
And inside of here, let's change the title to CheckboxTest.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,000
And for the body,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,230
we're going to add a form with those checkboxes inside of there,

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:44,300
and I've gone ahead and done this with a three‑checkbox form for mayo,

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,300
lettuce, and turkey, just simple selections for building a sandwich.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,840
I actually did this for an application for an online ordering for a client.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,560
So let's save this,

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,570
and now we can go ahead and create our test using

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,550
WebDriver like we did with the radio buttons.

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,160
And to do that,

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,520
we're just going to right‑click on our package, com.pluralsight, and say New,

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:20,160
Java Class. And we'll call this WebDriverCheckboxes and click Enter.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,950
We're going to do the same thing.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,740
We're going to give it a public static void main.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,140
In fact,

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:34,790
I'm going to open up my other example and copy that and paste it

21
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,580
inside of here. And I'm going to add the closing curly brace as well

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,300
so that that's balanced. Then I'm going to change our URL here to

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:55,470
CheckboxTest, and it is going to need the exact URL. So if you're not

24
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,560
sure of what yours is,

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,630
you can do that trick where we went ahead and rebuilt it in Finder and grabbed

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,890
that out of the address bar. But we have it sitting alongside a radio button

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,230
test so I know I can just change that to CheckboxTest and save that. Then we can

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,310
go down below that code and grab the WebElement. So we'll say WebElement

29
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:28,860
checkbox, and that is going to be equal to driver.findElement, and we can do

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,320
this By.id. And since its unique,

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,740
we can grab just that one element, and inside of here, we'll say

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:51,470
lettuceCheckbox. Close that off and say checkbox.click, and it will

33
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,940
toggle that one as being selected for us.

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,320
So let's go ahead and run this and exit full screen so we can make sure there's

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,210
no errors as it's starting up our server. We'll say Run checkbox main, and it'll

36
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,350
open up our browser for us. And we can see that our file was served up, and our

37
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,090
lettuceCheckbox was, in fact, checked.

38
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,980
I want to show you one little more trick with the checkboxes, and that is

39
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,900
click. Let me switch back over to our IDE. Notice there is no toggle. We just

40
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,770
have to say click, and we have to know the state of that. And in doing so, if

41
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,640
we add another checkbox.click down here,

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,660
save it and run it, it's going to actually uncheck it.

43
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,500
So you need to understand the state of what your application is

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,980
in. And we can see that looking at our web page,

45
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,590
it is, in fact, unchecked.

46
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:57,000
So it went through and checked it and unchecked it. There isn't a toggle or some boolean. It just clicks it.
