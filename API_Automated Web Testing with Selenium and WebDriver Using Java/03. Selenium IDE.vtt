When I first heard the term Selenium IDE, I expected to install an IDE

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.060
similar to something like Eclipse or IntelliJ. The Selenium IDE is actually

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.740
just an extension written to work within the browser.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.000
To install the IDE, we need to navigate to the Selenium website and install it as an extension from there.
