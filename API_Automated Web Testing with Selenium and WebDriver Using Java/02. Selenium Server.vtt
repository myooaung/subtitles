00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.560
Selenium Server is a way that we can remote execute our tests.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.290
We can take one of the Selenium tests and execute that

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.740
test in a cloud or remoteâ€‘based scenario.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.410
These tests are either the generated record and playback test from

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.840
Selenium IDE or the WebDriver test that we coded earlier. To do this, we

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.110
direct our test to a server that we have set up.

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.390
Each test can be configured to run on a specific server using a specific driver.

8
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.680
You can have a Linux server using Chrome or a Mac server running Safari.

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.030
This is a test that is sent to the correct driver

10
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.790
configuration, which in turn has the right browser

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.740
configuration enabled if that is an option.

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.070
Think about the tests that we just ran and how they were really only

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.440
testing one scenario, the machine that we were on and the browsers

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.800
that we were using on that machine. It's easier to see where

15
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.390
Selenium Server fits into this picture now. We're going to still run

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.000
these tests locally, but the concepts translate into a remote hosted system environment.
