00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.440
To verify that test that we just wrote, I've gone ahead and set

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.270
our page back to about:blank so that you can see that it

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.040
actually executes from that new window.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.740
And we can go into the Selenium IDE, select that individual test,

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.270
we only have one, but if you had multiple here, you'd built a suite

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.010
up, you could choose the specific one you want to enter and click

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.720
the Run all tests in suite button, and you'll see it very quickly

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.080
flash up that it's preparing to run the test, it runs through it and

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.130
finishes completely.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.390
It goes through it so fast I can't even narrate it fast enough.

11
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.840
You'll see down below that it says that our tests completed successfully.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.270
There is a way to make this go through and run slower.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.910
So if we go up and select this stopwatch icon, change that

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.220
down to Slow, it will navigate through it more like how you

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.820
would probably go through it.

16
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.400
So, change that down to Slow, select it again, and you'll

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.820
see it go through and slowly select it, scroll down the page,

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.440
choose that CSS that's at the bottom of the page for that button,

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.570
select the correct menu item. Once it's clicked that, navigate

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:25.000
to it and verify that the assertion of text on that particular blog post is in fact correct.
