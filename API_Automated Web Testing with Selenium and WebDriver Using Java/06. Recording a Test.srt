00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,370
To record a test inside of Selenium,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,520
you're going to want to open up the Selenium IDE, and I purposely closed mine

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,640
to show you how you can open it back up in case you did.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,640
You're going to click that puzzle piece icon and launch the Selenium IDE,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,260
and you'll notice it comes up in a separate window.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,240
I purposely have set these side by side so that we can see the

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,900
interactions that we have inside of our project while doing them.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll say let's record a new test, and for the project name,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,470
let's call this one Selenium News and hit OK.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,600
It's going to ask for that base URL, and I'm going to put in

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:46,060
https://www.selenium.dev, and click Start Recording. And

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,690
immediately out of the gate it's going to pop up that browser

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,800
window, and it's recording right now.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,510
You can also see that by the flashing Selenium IDE is recording logo

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,510
down in the bottom right‑hand corner of your browser.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,300
Let's begin by selecting this About menu item and the subselect

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,900
item of About in there. Scroll down, and just to make it a

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,080
little bit more interesting we can choose News, and we can grab

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,610
the first news icon here,

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:25,840
right‑click on it, and say Selenium IDE and Assert, Text.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
We've just made a fairly complex little test.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,940
Let's stop this.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,940
We'll name this one News. Click OK.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,440
Let me make this a little bit bigger so you can read it on my screen easier.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,570
You'll see that we opened up the base URL, set the window size, which isn't

26
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,230
super important, but you may be testing on a platform that you want to verify

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,540
that the window size looks and acts correctly.

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,650
Then it did a click and search based off the CSS nav‑item and the

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,590
linkText for about, it clicked on that, and then a linkText for news, it

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,810
clicked on that, and then we asserted that that text equaled Public

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,420
Project Meeting ‑ July 15, 2021. So it went through and navigated just

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:24,000
like you would as an individual and recorded that test exactly how you would interact with it.
