00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.760
To install the Selenium extension or plugin, you need to pull up a browser and

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.590
go to www.selenium.dev, and once you've navigated there, in the center of the

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.540
page there is a Getting Started section where you can choose to download the

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.160
Selenium IDE. Once you've gone here,

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.000
there's some latest release information and that type of stuff, but

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.300
as you navigate down a little bit in the page,

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.260
you'll see an option for the Selenium IDE area. And you can

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.480
choose the browser that you are using, Chrome or Firefox, and

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.200
there's previous releases there as well.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.220
Maybe you're behind a corporate install that only allows you to have a

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.130
specific version of Chrome or Firefox, and you can use that previous link to

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.340
grab one that's compatible with your browser there.

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.330
I'm going to just click on for Chrome, and it will pull

14
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.350
up the button for us to add to Chrome.

15
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.840
So I'll click that and give it permission. Say yes, add extension.

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080
It'll tell me what it wants to do.

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.060
And you'll also get this option to turn on syncing if you have the

18
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
Chrome sync to allow this across all of your browsers.

19
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.160
I'm just going to ignore that and close it, and our extension is now installed,

20
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.140
and we can verify that by clicking on this little puzzle piece icon here and

21
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.540
seeing the Selenium IDE. And if we click on this,

22
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.120
our dialog that pops up is asking us what we want to do with the IDE.

23
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.030
And I'm not going to enter any of this yet because we want to talk about

24
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.510
a couple of these features before we dive into it.

25
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.000
So, this is verified that your plugin is installed and we're ready to go. Let's talk about what we want to do with the IDE now.
