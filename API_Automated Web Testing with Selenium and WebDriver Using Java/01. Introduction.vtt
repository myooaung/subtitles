00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.950
In this final module,

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.530
we're going to be taking everything that we've learned and assembling it

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.020
all into creating a framework for our automated tests.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.550
We've learned about Selenium and web driver,

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.790
and we're going to put all of that knowledge to use. One of the most

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.960
important things that you need to know how to do before you start

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.660
writing automated tests is how to build a good framework because this

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.790
is going to determine whether or not your automation efforts are

9
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.440
going to be successful.

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.500
This module is a compact module of the knowledge that you'll want

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.480
to acquire on building an automation framework.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.610
We could easily spend months building a good framework,

13
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.000
but this is a good bootstrap to get you started and show you some working examples of how to create an automation framework of your own.
