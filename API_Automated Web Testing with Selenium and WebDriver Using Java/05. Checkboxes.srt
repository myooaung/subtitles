00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,640
Checking a checkbox is even simpler than the radio button test that we just did.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,950
We're basically just going to select the element. And in this case,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,820
we're going to select it by ID. Since we have an ID and we're just

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,770
going to click it, that will make it checked.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,470
So let's go ahead and do this now.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,020
We're going to go through the same steps that we just did with

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:29,000
the radio button by creating our own HTML page, adding this HTML for checkboxes, and then writing a test against it.
