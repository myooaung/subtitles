1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,470
To create a consistent code base for us to test against,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,100
let's go ahead and create our own HTML page that we can deploy.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,830
There's a few reasons why you'd want to do this in a real‑world scenario.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,180
You know you're going to have to test some functionality like this,

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,710
but developers maybe haven't deployed that content yet or you're waiting on a

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,940
server or some other various scenarios similar to that.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,130
I've ran into this a lot with agile concurrent

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
development going on on a project.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,290
To do that, I want to go up to src, main,

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,440
and right‑click and say New, HTML File.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,880
And I'm going to put this under a directory called webapp.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,600
So I'll type in webapp/RadioButtonTest.html.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,010
And I'm going to select HTML5 file,

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,080
it doesn't really matter for what we're doing,

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,420
and click Enter.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,370
And your directory structure should look similar to what I

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,530
have on the left of my project here.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,570
So now I've got a src,

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,190
main directory that has a webapp folder underneath it

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,110
containing RadioButtonTest.html.

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm going to change the title of this page to RadioButtonTest.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,040
And inside the body,

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm going to put some HTML here for a form with

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,570
three input types of radio in there.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,640
And you can grab this code out of the exercise files if you

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
want instead of typing it all in here,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,740
or you can type it in really fast if you want.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,360
But we've got our RadioButtonTest.html here inside of our application

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,810
with our form inside of there and our three radio buttons that we can

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,530
go ahead and use inside of our test.

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,180
I'm going to show you a little trick to do this without having to go

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,000
set up anything else inside of your application.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,170
If you right‑click on RadioButtonTest.html and choose Reveal in Finder,

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,120
it will open up a file system window to where you are

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,950
already at the level of that HTML file.

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,940
From here,

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,370
you can right‑click on it and say Open With Chrome or Firefox

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,170
or whatever other browser you're using,

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,930
and this will open up your browser and serve the HTML exactly like

40
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,060
it wouuld if it came off of your web server.

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,750
The nice thing about this is it's consistent so we can grab this

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,690
address out of the address bar and use that inside of our test

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,710
until you have a file deployed somewhere that you can

44
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,360
consistently test against this.

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,640
So this will give us a standard environment that we can run our test against.

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,070
Switching back to our IDE,

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,550
let's go ahead and create a test to now run against our HTML page we created.

48
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,640
So I'm going to right‑click on com.pluralsight and say New,

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,190
Java Class, and we'll call this WebDriverRadioButtons.

50
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,280
Hit Enter.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,140
And inside of the body, let's give this a public static void main.

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,220
So we'll do public static void main and pass in our

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,090
String args signature required by Java.

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,580
And we're going to set this up very similar to what our other WebDriverDemo is.

55
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:39,830
We'll just say WebDriver driver, and we want to use a new ChromeDriver,

56
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,540
so we'll say that's equal to new ChromeDriver.

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,430
And the difference here and why I'm typing this out rather than just

58
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,430
copy and pasting it is I'm going to say driver.get,

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,590
and we're going to put a URL inside of here.

60
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,490
We're going to use the URL that we just grabbed off of

61
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,430
that page that we served up locally.

62
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,340
So let's switch back over to our browser,

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,880
grab that address out of the address bar,

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,690
and go back to our IDE.

65
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,740
And inside of that get,

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:25,200
paste in that file:///Users/me/dev, whatever your address is to yours.

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,240
That's the address to my workspace.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
It's under the user's account,

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,620
me for my operating system, and then my dev workspace.

70
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,230
Your path should look something similar to that, the only difference being

71
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,750
what your file system is. If you're using Windows box,

72
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:46,340
it's going to be C: rather than a / and what your workspace is named.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,450
From here, we can go down and let's create a list,

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:58,660
and the list is going to be of WebElements and select that.

75
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,740
And our elements are going to be radio buttons.

76
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,720
So we'll call this radioButtons, and that's going to

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,440
be equal to driver.findElements.

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,310
And this time we're going to do a By.name, and the name is

79
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,630
color. And that is referring to the radio button group

80
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,520
that we have in our HTML page.

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,230
So that By.name color, if we switch over to our HTML, you can

82
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,120
see that we have that name equals color.

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,640
That's the grouping that we're going to put together here.

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,730
Let's make this a little bit full screen so you can

85
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,340
see it for a minute longer here.

86
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,550
Now we want to go through and say radioButtons.get. Let's just grab

87
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,530
the first one, and actually not the first one in the sense of it

88
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,830
being zero‑based, but number 1, which would be the second one in our

89
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,940
list and say .click and save this.

90
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,740
Now, when we run this, we can right‑click on this and say Run

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,840
WebDriverRadioButton.main, it'll fire up our test and our browser.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
And we can see inside of our browser that it has served up the page

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,640
and selected the second one or, since it's zero‑based, the number

94
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,590
1, which is green.

95
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,190
So originally, red was clicked if you remember the default HTML we

96
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,840
had that red or the zero‑based index was selected.

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,840
And in our code, we said go ahead and grab the item at position 1 and click it,

98
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
which is done. So green is selected here.
