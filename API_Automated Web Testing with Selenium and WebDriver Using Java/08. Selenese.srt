00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,430
Since recording our test in the Selenium IDE, we have now

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,690
generated some steps, or rather some commands.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,170
Before we look at those commands,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,440
let's talk briefly about what that syntax is though.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,270
These commands are called Selenese, and Selenese is just a

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,860
language that is independent to the Selenium tools.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,570
And what I mean by that is it's not C# or Java or Python,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,400
it's not anything,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,210
it's just general syntax, and there are some various implementations of that.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,910
The recorder uses an HTML table to lay out the commands,

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,940
and we'll look at that here in a second.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,810
The basic idea of Selenese is really simple, though.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:42,560
You have a command and then optionally have a target and

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,120
a value associated with that target.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,590
So some commands will just be the commands themselves and some of them

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,040
will take a target and optionally a value as well.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's look at a couple of these commands that were generated by the recording that we just did.
