WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.800
As we just mentioned, that second item was selected,

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.690
let's show you how you can get the value inside

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.640
your test of which one was chosen.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.160
So I want to go ahead and give myself some space at

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.340
the bottom of our list and say for.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.680
And we're going to do a for loop over the WebElement, and we'll say that

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.530
it's a radio button because that's the individual item that we are working

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.580
with. And we're going to do this on radioButtons.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.390
So it's an iteration over radioButtons with the individual element for

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:48.120
radioButton. I'll say if radioButton.isSelected, then we want to just do

11
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.000
a System.out.println on the value itself.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.210
So say radioButton.getAttribute, and this will allow us to go through and

13
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.340
choose the attribute of that HTML element, which is value.

14
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.990
That value is referring to the value of the color of that radio button, so the

15
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
attribute inside that tag that we're currently working with.

16
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
If I run this again, it'll fire up the browser,

17
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.420
but I'll just show you here inside of our console which

18
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.460
one is selected. And you can see right down at the bottom

19
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.210
here, running that test again,

20
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.860
we didn't change anything on the front end, it's the green one that is

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.980
selected, and that's referring to in our HTML that value of green. Not

22
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.000
the actual text associated with the tag, but the value of green in that input element.
