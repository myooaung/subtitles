Hi everyone. My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:14,115
Automated Web Testing with Selenium and WebDriver Using Java.

3
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,994
I'm a director of development at Software Technology Group,

4
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:19,357
as well as a Pluralsight author.

5
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:22,721
Automated testing is now almost mandatory to guarantee

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,047
the stability of an application.

7
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:28,233
Manual click and testing doesn't guarantee regression testing

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,941
won't break previous functionality by itself.

9
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:36,084
In this course, we're going to test web pages using Selenium,

10
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:36,554
WebDriver,

11
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:39,205
and then writing a test framework to build a complete

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,748
testing solution for web applications.

13
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:45,570
Some of the major topics that we will cover include the Selenium framework,

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,859
how to use the Selenium IDE to record and play back tests,

15
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,443
building tests using WebDriver and Java,

16
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,618
and building our own testing framework to separate our app and

17
00:00:56,618 --> 00:00:59,434
tests from the tooling that executes them.

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,258
By the end of this course,

19
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:04,920
you'll know how to test web applications using the Selenium tools and when

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,633
to use record and playback with custom WebDriver tests.

21
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:13,408
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Java and Maven.

22
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,284
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn automated

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:27,000
testing with the Automated Web Testing Using Selenium and WebDriver Using Java course, at Pluralsight.
