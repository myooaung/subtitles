00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello again glorious God.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:13,800
People in this video we're going to lay some groundwork with a talk about transforms bases and matrices

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,750
matrices being the plural of Matrix.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,980
And if right now you're thinking of us Keanu Reeves movies are.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,270
Sorry.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,150
Not a fan.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,810
OK.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's look at why this has to happen.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,830
If I run the game we have so far we have got some basic mouse look working.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,670
It's very shiny and we've got some movement but the movement is based on global positioning.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,380
I'm pressing forward and I'm not changing what that means with the camera right which is going to get

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,270
really disorienting very quickly.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,780
This isn't moving the way I would expect.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,760
What I need is to define movement based on where the camera is and that's going to require some clever

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,900
maths because what exactly is forward from this angle compared to this angle compared to this angle.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,420
To do that we're going to rely on Matrix mathematics and very simply a matrix is a special kind of array.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,940
It's what they call a rectangular array and that array can have any kind of mathematical value as long

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,380
as those values are the same type.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,050
Now I am going to link the documentation for transfer me for transformations and matrices so you can

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,940
look this up but essentially it looks like this.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,290
We have a matrix called a and that is a special kind of array which we're going to use the curly brackets

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,850
for even a looks like a dictionary.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
But it's not.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,980
And on this we might have let's say it's a two dimensional transform or two dimensional matrix or something

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,010
to help ourselves.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:44,820
And it will get a plot X and Y plot X and Y as a rectangular array and this will be x x x y y x and

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,080
y y and we can manipulate these arrays in different ways.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,540
Why would we want to do this.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,480
Well because an array can hold a lot of information in one place and that's going to make things a lot

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,370
easier.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,240
Now we're dealing with three dimensional information and God has a special kind of matrix for that it's

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,530
called a basis and a basis has translate rotate and scale for X Y and Z.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,300
So that's movement.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,950
Translate how much you've rotated and how big or small you are on each axis.

35
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,950
And that's all in one place.

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,700
And to use those.

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,180
We're going to use a transform and a transform is very simply something that can compare the basis to

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,850
the origin and that's going to give us our global local position.

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:37,430
So let's say I have this simple 3-d space and I've got my x axis y axis z axis my origin is the 0 0

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,880
0.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,730
Right we know that that's our global origin or our local origin of figuring it out from a parent for

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,990
parent to child.

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,500
And let's say we have a play a character play a character is here.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,370
The basis is going to give us not just where are they on the z x and y.

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,650
Right so that says 10 that's five and that's one.

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,990
It's also to say how much they rotated on each axis and this is important because we've seen how much

47
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,110
rotating on the wrong axis can mess up and when we started in these together that we get really disoriented

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,380
to transform allows us to figure this out.

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,820
It's also going to handle scale.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,750
So we actually look at what's involved here.

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,170
Let me pick a different colour.

52
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,460
We have rotation on each axis.

53
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,170
That's an arrow.

54
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,840
There we go.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,130
We have scale on each axis which can be nice purple colour so like this and like this and like this

56
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:37,300
and we have and we have translate We have everything in one place and all of that is compared to here

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,180
which means we can start comparing values very quickly.

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,220
It's a whole lot simpler but it takes a little bit to get your head around okay but it could take a

59
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,250
little bit to get your head around.

60
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,510
OK.

61
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,040
So far so theoretical.

62
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,610
How does this apply to us.

63
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,080
We're about to make movement relative to the camera and that's going to cause some complications because

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,530
in some cases I want to move the player where the camera is facing and in some cases I don't.

65
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,150
Here's what I mean by that.

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,960
If I rotate left.

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,830
I want that to be forward.

68
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,380
But if I rotate Let's do this as a local decision.

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,990
If I rotate the camera up I don't want that to be forward because otherwise I'll fly.

70
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,810
I want to separate 2D and 3D movement when I'm using the keys to move.

71
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,110
So w is a d demon jump which I gonna put on that's a space right that's going be locked to the floor.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,260
Again I don't want this to happen.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,970
If I did want this to happen this would be much simpler.

74
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,440
When I jump I want to jump and then apply gravity and these things are going to have to happen separately

75
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:47,110
so I need to separate out the horizontal movement that 2D movement and then add them in later.

76
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,670
And that's going to be what were going to be doing the next video.

77
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,210
Now there's quite a lot going on here but essentially just remember this a matrix is just a special

78
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,010
kind of array.

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,290
Right.

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,200
It's it's a multidimensional array a basis is a God or array that handles these.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,170
T R S Translate rotate and scale.

82
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,170
And in fact if we look at any three dimensional spatial object you can see under spatial.

83
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:19,100
We have transformed and transform is made up of translation rotation and scale right so it's all there

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,850
for us.

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,330
We're going to access in this in code which brings us to the end of this video.

86
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,400
Now this is a little bit more talky or going to go into the actual practical the next video.

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,710
But I thought it was worth separating it out from the actual practice.

88
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,180
So you could refer back to this video for get lost if all this was very very simple for you.

89
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,280
That's fantastic a disease for a fresher.

90
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,180
It is new information.

91
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,860
Dont be afraid to ask questions on Facebook on discord here and usually.

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
Weve looked at the basics of transform matrices and we've identified how they're going to play in our

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,350
game to our placement.

94
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,080
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
