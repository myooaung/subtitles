00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,270
Hello you fantastic gotto people in this video let's make a better looking level we're not gonna use

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,830
these template gotto blocks we've got going let's make something that looks good that fits the aesthetic

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,310
of our game.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,260
Let's do that.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,820
We're going to use a tile map.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,380
Tom map is an awesome node.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm really looking forward to this.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,560
So let's get right into it.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,570
What I want to do is create brand new seemed to create my tile map.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,690
And it's gonna be a 2D scene.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,550
I'm gonna click on that.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,420
It's just a basic node 2D.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,190
I mean rename this to be platform tiles.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,290
Now if we're using this there's a specific hierarchy we want.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,660
Okay.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,090
So we want a Sprite

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,310
that has a static body

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,210
and that static body has to have collision of some kind.

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,640
Okay.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,670
So each tile has to look like this.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,580
And what we going to do is make multiple tiles in one scene

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,400
that all have static body 2D and collisions.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,220
Convert them into a single object is gonna be called a tile map

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,160
and then use that in our game.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,750
So first let's bring in some sprites.

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,290
So I'm going to go over to graphics and we have environment and we have all of these tiles.

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,260
You know I'm going to drag them all in and say What are these.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,350
These are sprites and it's got an added all of them in which is lovely.

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,550
That's exactly what I want.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,380
It actually matter where they are right now.

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,910
I'm going to put them in.

32
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm doing it this way because they've been named correctly.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,750
Right.

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,130
I don't have to bring in a sprite to rename it grout cake ground cake small.

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,090
They have the right name.

36
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,540
Cool.

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:59,120
So we now have a bunch of large and small platforms each themed around a thing.

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm going to organize them in a way that makes sense to me visually.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Again it doesn't actually matter where they are each one of these has to have OK.

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,530
So first thing I said each one needs a static body so it's at a static body 2D and that needs some sort

41
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,130
of collision.

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,690
Now right now I'm working on this large cake piece and let's give a static body to a collision piece

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,710
and I'm not going to use collision shape collision shape is for making regular shapes.

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,870
This is an irregular shape which is a polygon

45
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,470
great.

46
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,980
Now if I wanted to I could be incredibly precise here.

47
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,400
I could press this add point button create.

48
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,520
Point this little green plus and I could get as close as I can to the individual pixels right.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,490
So if I'm making something really precise something like Super Meat Boy I would want to get in as far

50
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,730
as I can but actually I'm not making something like that.

51
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,500
I don't mind if it's a little bit cheeky.

52
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,620
So to do that own work with a grid let's got a view and do show grid and we can configure upgrade with

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,590
these three dots here.

54
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm going to go figure snap.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,400
Right now it's 10 by 10.

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm okay with that and I can pick my ground cake and make sure it's actually on the grid.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Well how do I make sure it's on the grid.

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,800
I think to snap to the grid that's this magnet with the three dots on it.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,710
Okay.

60
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,050
So now it's snapping to the grid

61
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,590
I want to make sure there's much of my cake is possible is on a grid which is a little bit tricky because

62
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,980
not the right size I might actually have to configure the snap.

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:35,780
Yeah let's configure the snap so get configure snap and s I feel like Kenny likes multiples of eight

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,220
some to try a grid of eight.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,160
See how that looks.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,440
Leave that alone.

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm just making sure that as many pieces as possible are actually on grid points.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,140
That looks pretty good.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Okay.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,500
And I'm gonna add some points.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,260
Great point and I'm just going up to a slightly rough and ready because I can fix this in the moment.

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,260
Polygon

73
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,150
you should have finished.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,710
There we go.

75
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,260
Great.

76
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,190
And what I can do is I can move these points with this little blue arrow symbol here I can drag these

77
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,440
points if I don't want that one to delete the one entirely that we got.

78
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,590
Okay so I could drag these out so I can come off the snap right now and just get these as close as I

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,030
can.

80
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,340
And that's looking a lot more precise isn't it.

81
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,540
Let's hide the collision.

82
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,500
We could just see the outline of the polygon that's looking pretty good.

83
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,570
Drag you out if a drag on the line is going to create a new point which is handy.

84
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,650
Okay.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,940
That's pretty solid but I don't just want one I want multiples and really I would like them to be identical.

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,260
Small platforms will get their ankles in shape but the large ones should be identical.

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,710
What we'll do is I'm actually going to create a duplicate of the static body and my press control D

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,460
and I can drag that down to the grass.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,960
Be careful I can't just use it as is and the reason why if I enable this robot I'm looking at this grass

90
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,620
piece which is this one and the collision shape is down here.

91
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,910
Why is it down there.

92
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:19,260
This is the position it was at when I created it and if I look at the transform select a static body

93
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,690
to to look at the transform look the X is minus thirty point eight and the Y is minus 300.

94
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,260
Let's just reset that the position is now 0 0.

95
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,460
All positions are inherited from their parent.

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,890
What is telling me is it's 0 from its parent on the x 0 from part of the Y.

97
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:44,400
So I'm going to duplicate that again and do the same thing with the sand and the same thing with the

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,910
snow.

99
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm going to go to my static body to D3 to transform reset the position there it is and the static body

100
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,230
2D 3 again it should be for you and for just.

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,850
Feel better about myself and to transform and reset it.

102
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,900
So now the collision will be the sprite is.

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,910
Otherwise the collision would be a whole bunch pixels that way a whole bunch of pixels this way.

104
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,930
OK I can now minimize those and I'm going to very quickly make a another static bot enclosure shape

105
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,750
for the start of the small group the small cross piece.

106
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:30,220
For this small cake piece so cake small and you need a static body be and you need a collision polygon

107
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:39,510
that's control a collision polygon do P2P do and let's get back on my grid and make some points.

108
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,780
OK.

109
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,560
Now if you don't have a solid read shape it means that your collision shape is twisty and on itself

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:53,980
a little bit.

111
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,450
You might want to fix that.

112
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,440
It's got to move and just come off grid so I can see what I'm doing.

113
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,990
And get these as close as I can to something nice.

114
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:11,210
You can got here you can go up here and that's looking a little bit better.

115
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,510
You live down there.

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,680
Okay.

117
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,590
Like I say a little rough and ready but I'm happy with that.

118
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,640
And now I'm going to do this duplicate trick again some of the duplicate three things.

119
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,450
One two three.

120
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,100
You live on grass small you live on sand small home days dragging them down.

121
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,160
So you live on snow small and now let's make sure that you're all in the right place.

122
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
So reset the transform for you.

123
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,960
Reset the transform for this one

124
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,100
and reset the transform for this one.

125
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,380
Okay.

126
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,540
We now have a bunch of tiles.

127
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,870
How do I make a tile map.

128
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:00,340
Well I need to do is get a scene convert to tile set or about mesh library that's for 3D tile maps called

129
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,360
grid maps which are amazing but we'll be doing this for a while as do tiles.

130
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,020
Let's put this in levels and let's call this tile set.

131
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,910
Now if I just press safe now say you need an extension.

132
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,790
I need to pick one of these.

133
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,450
On the pic dot two areas should a resource file and that is good to go to say the scene.

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,670
I'm going to save it in levels with the actual levels and go to Level 1.

135
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,530
And how do we use this.

136
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,290
Well let's delete our flaws.

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,610
By flaws.

138
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,320
Okay now Bonnie is just going to fall.

139
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,550
We need to put on a tile map.

140
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:38,580
Let's add a new node called Thailand tile map Node node for 2D 2D tile base maps.

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,950
And now I just need to bring my tile set in here.

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,380
I'm going to go load levels.

143
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:44,920
Tiles.

144
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,550
I could just write it in and look.

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,860
Here are all our tiles.

146
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,300
Now some things you should know.

147
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,310
1 the tile map has a position that position is 0 0.

148
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,680
It's going to create a single object with these tiles.

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,950
All right.

150
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,100
So I press this this this and this and then I move the whole tile map which I to do I got to transform

151
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,110
position 10 on the X.

152
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,440
It moves everything.

153
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,300
This is all one object.

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
Now when I press play

155
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,500
they all have collision.

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:15,840
All right.

157
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,900
I want to zoom out and just make a very basic looking level.

158
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,770
So that's my tile map and this makes more cake.

159
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,810
Boop boop boop boop.

160
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,500
Don't need this one right click on a position and it's good delete it.

161
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,790
Look at this.

162
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,610
I can paint the level but small platform here.

163
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,580
I shouldn't want it here.

164
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,760
It gets small platform here.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,170
This mix is a little challenging and some grass beneath it.

166
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,010
Now when I press play the camera doesn't move right so I have a platform game with a bunny immediately

167
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,880
goes off screen.

168
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,730
No use to me.

169
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,980
Let's get a little time on the camera Judy.

170
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,420
First let's delete this one.

171
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,150
We go into my play a scene and I'll make a new camera 2D here.

172
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,000
Great thing.

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,020
Make it current.

174
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,920
Camera won't work.

175
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,630
Is not current.

176
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,390
That's going to get old Zoom.

177
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,580
I actually wish you zoom out further.

178
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,280
You think 3 3 might be a bit crazy let's find out press 3.

179
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,960
Oh that's quite a lot isn't it.

180
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,060
Maybe it's too much.

181
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,680
Also you'll notice I can move left and right a little bit before anything happens.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,480
Maybe I don't want that if I want that I can go to drag margin right so I can disable drag margin entirely.

183
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,670
And now if I move slightly the camera move maybe I do want it but I want it more or less get a drag

184
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,140
margin and change the amount here.

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,650
I've also got something called smoothing if I enable smoothing the camera doesn't move instantly the

186
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,290
camera will follow me.

187
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,970
See how it's coming along now.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,090
So we were really like this.

189
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,430
Some people don't like it disable it.

190
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,320
It's fine.

191
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,730
I'm on leave mine off now because I want to be able to see where bunny is right away and what's around.

192
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,420
There's a few more things you can do.

193
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,080
Limit.

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,390
Maybe I don't want a camera to go any farther left.

195
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,520
Maybe 0 0 the Global Zero is as far left you can go so let's go zero on the left.

196
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,630
You are now limited.

197
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,370
You cannot go farther left than that.

198
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,400
And now the camera won't go left but it will go right.

199
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,480
Maybe it will put smoothing on.

200
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,230
Oh dear.

201
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,460
I'm already bad in my own game as well smoothing back on see there's an easier

202
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,110
little bit.

203
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,540
Oh boy I'm bad at my game.

204
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,300
I might even zoom out a little bit more.

205
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:29,890
However now I can make a little bit of a level so let's stop here and do some stuff.

206
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,860
I'm going to go.

207
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,430
You know what I mean some snow down here and I feel it should be quite a long level so I'm going to

208
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,240
continue my cakes for a bit and it is a bit challenging think I can jump that high.

209
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,220
Pretty sure I can jump that high just in case.

210
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,650
I'll put you here and a few more bits and pieces and I can extend this level it's very easy to use rack

211
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,520
right click on any tile and it vanishes.

212
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,460
Remember though the position of the tile is where the grid position it.

213
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,470
So if I want get in this one I can't right click here I have to right click that and you see the little

214
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,210
squiggles blue.

215
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,760
Right that means it's a tile that you'll note.

216
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,840
You can only have one tile in each position.

217
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,100
Right.

218
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,460
So if I put this one here and I want to put a small one here I can't

219
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,830
put you back.

220
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,720
One more thing ought to do before go any further I want to make sure that the game knows which bits

221
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,270
which to do this I'm going to use something called Collision if a local player and I got a physics buddy

222
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,530
Judy he got these weird things he got layers and masks.

223
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,740
The basic principle is this I am on this layer I can interact with this mask.

224
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,360
Now later we're gonna be using these quite a lot.

225
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,790
So what I need to do is set these up.

226
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,780
I a project Project settings and scroll down to layer names on 2D physics and I'm gonna name these play

227
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,930
ones in player layer 1 not plan 1 let who's gonna be terrain.

228
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,040
OK so select a player a fact that's gonna play a scene here we go.

229
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,670
So let the player go to collision player is on layer 1 and this is a bit wise layer right.

230
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:12,030
So he can be on multiple layers like Well now one this one of this one that's fine but this is the player

231
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:18,510
and I can interact with terrain let's go back into level one go to tile map and make sure my collision

232
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,340
is selected and I'm sure take it off the player outcome mouse over and see what it is and also the terrain

233
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,110
layer and it can interact with the player cannot interact with terrain this is gonna become important

234
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:35,160
for us play and let's take a look at eye level yeah that's it's coming on quite nicely so this leads

235
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,890
me to the challenge I would like you to use your tile map to make an awesome level and I would challenge

236
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,580
you to share the level you made with the community I've made a very rough and ready one I'm actually

237
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,600
gonna be tweaking this as we go but I challenge you to stop playing the tarmac make something creative

238
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,320
so pulls the video make a tile map and when you come back we can wrap this up

239
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,470
welcome back before we finish a quick reminder on how these layers and masks work collision is gonna

240
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,130
be really important.

241
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,370
Collision Les is the layer I exist on and I can exist on multiple layers so I can use this as a sort

242
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,520
of tagging system so maybe I'm a hazard and I'm part of the terrain and I'm an NPC I don't know why

243
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,600
NPC because of the terrain but maybe you can maybe I'm a player but I'm also something else right.

244
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,160
Collision masks are the layers that I can interact with so I'm a player I can interact with anything

245
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,100
that calls itself on the following layers so the bunny can interact with anything that is terrain but

246
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,760
it can't interact with anything that's a player if I had multiple players and I've seen the bunnies

247
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,220
would go through each other they wouldn't interact at all.

248
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,020
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video how to work with a grid how to create a tile map

249
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,540
how to use collision layers and collision asks we've looked at similar properties of camera 2D we also

250
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,180
looked at how nodes inherit properties from the parents member who made that collision polygon and it's

251
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:59,850
and the transform was in the wrong place we put to zero zero zero zero means zero from your parent not

252
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,920
0 from global so great work I hope you had fun making your levels I look forward to seeing what they

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,070
look like and I will see you in the next video.
