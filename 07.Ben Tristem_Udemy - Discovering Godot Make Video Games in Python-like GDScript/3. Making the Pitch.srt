00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,730
Welcome back Gloria.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,530
Good people.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,150
Let's actually start making parts of Kuda kick about in this video.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,500
We're going to make the pitch and to do that we're going to have to familiarize ourselves the controls

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,130
and some of the concepts will be using in 3-d.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,260
The first thing we need to know is that the 3-d view is very different.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,500
Right we have this nice grid thing in fact the way the grid works is still the.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,340
But there's sort of a nice comforting blank slate of 2D.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,050
We now have these card lines.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,810
These are access.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,490
Now we should talk about how that works in God.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:42,010
Before we touch anything when you think about an axis in 2D in Godso we've got this very familiar idea

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,970
of the X and the Y and the one peculiarity we've got is that is that positive y is down not up.

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,490
So if God were not working like we would in basic geometry or mathematics we're working from the top

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,760
left of the screen.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,630
And I think the rationale is that's where the computer draws from when it draws it scan lines very quickly

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,870
they'll draw from the top left.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,780
But I'm just inferring that I could be wrong if we flip to 3-d then does the Z.

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,680
Why is there a Z the Y becomes a Z.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,830
And that's can seem counterintuitive.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,920
And the reason is this is the top view not the front for you.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,460
If we look at the front view we give something a bit more familiar now and positive y is up positive

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,010
x is to the right.

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,820
Assuming that that's the front to make then a little less abstract to make it a little less abstract.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,400
This is a transform widget.

26
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,140
Yes that's the technical term for a movie thing.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,020
This is the transform widget from godda and I've put the x y and z in their colours or x y and z.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,690
If you like it's up to you in their colours by the respective arrows you're now working environment

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,590
where the direction you're facing is all important in 2D.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,660
That's not really an issue.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,380
Right up is always the top of the screen.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,340
But here we can position ourselves anywhere.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,880
If we go into our scene the first middies hold the right mouse button and look around and fact you know

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,040
what.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,300
I won't go into distraction free mode just holding right mouse button and moving around.

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,560
I am moving the camera.

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:15,380
While holding the right mouse button and I have to hold it down pressing w goes forward and escos back

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,710
and ayenda go left and right.

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,400
Just like you play a first person shooter.

40
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,170
Remember only when holding the right mouse button I let go the rounds my mouse button.

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,020
They don't do that if I want to hover up and down ease up and Q is down right so was just like fly up

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,370
fly down or swim up some down in a standard first person shooter while holding the right mouse button.

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,490
I can change how fast they are moving.

44
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,690
So I'm just scrolling up and down and that's changing a little run speed on the left while holding the

45
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,590
right mouse button.

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,720
I can also hold shift and then move at a sprint speed and that's dependent on how fast I've got the

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,070
movement speed set.

48
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,720
So those are the basics of movement.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,310
It can be a little confusing at first but you get the hang of it very quickly.

50
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,530
All right so here we are and we're going to create a brand new scene.

51
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,120
So we've got this empty scene and we need a root node and nothing you'll notice is that the basic to

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,490
decode is called No 2D.

53
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,410
But the basic 3D node is called spatial.

54
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,730
Also we've got a new colour to deal with this nice terracotta colour.

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,230
Anything in that is a 3D specific node.

56
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,090
Remember anything in blue is to be specific and anything green is control or you I mean there's also

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,510
these white ones and a couple of purple pinky ones.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,310
But right now would you be focussing on these.

59
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:42,090
And I'm going to make a pitch a pitch is going to be a mesh mesh is a 3-d object.

60
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,690
So let's make a brand new node and I type in meche instance there is a simple mash this instance into

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,880
a scene and create that.

62
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,220
And I can't see anything that's because I've got this meche instance but down here in the properties

63
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,510
it's set to now.

64
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,300
Well that's okay we can fix that.

65
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,990
Let's click on plane.

66
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,900
A plane is the simplest mesh.

67
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,530
It only exists really in two dimensions.

68
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,190
If I go down here it doesn't really have a Y.

69
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,290
Now I could have a transform which is where transform translation rotation to green scalers little difference

70
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,860
from 2D.

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,570
Don't worry it will come quite normal and I give a y of 10.

72
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,870
And you notice it's not actually going up.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,600
The reason for this is the these plane crashes are just meant to be seen from one angle.

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,670
They are just there for backgrounds and so on.

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,810
They're also the easiest to texture right because the textures supplies evenly.

76
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,370
So they call the node pitch.

77
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,130
All right so what we have right now is this untaken a square by click on the mesh and then look here

78
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,970
material.

79
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,600
When I click on the spatial material not the shape of material we're not making a shader or making a

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,170
material that exists in space a special material.

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,260
And now we have this nice white matter.

82
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,460
I would click on that.

83
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,670
All right a whole bunch of options.

84
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:11,830
Let's take these very simply must go to run through the top few flags are little details we can tell.

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,930
So this is not late in the season is unshaded right.

86
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,810
Don't worry about shaving it just light it properly transparent this hasn't Alpher texture.

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,790
Not going to worry about the rest.

88
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,940
These For now parameters are some useful suffern for amateurs will look at later.

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,230
But when we need these albedo this is where the texture is applied.

90
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,900
If we go into graphics we've got this table top and you drag that into the texture and suddenly starts

91
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,440
looking like a game set.

92
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,850
I must say this texture.

93
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,850
Fact let's save the scene.

94
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,160
First let's save the scene.

95
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:48,800
So when I make a new folder called scenes I'm going to put the pitch as a scene in there and still on

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,920
the graphics folder because this particular material can be anywhere because I've defined it which isn't

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,170
going to be true later.

98
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,860
But for now it's true.

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,130
In this folder I'm going to save this material.

100
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,260
Somebody got this floppy disk.

101
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,630
And if you don't know what a floppy disk is ask your grandparents why click it and go save.

102
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,140
And I'm saving immaterial and just made that really clear a pitch dot material.

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,800
You see here it's one of a recognized file extensions and that's put it in scenes.

104
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,770
I really want it in scenes or doing graphics.

105
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,270
I wanna move it to graphics and if we want we can make a subfolder Russert finamore put this here.

106
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,750
Okay we now have a basic pitch.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,270
Now the sizes don't work for me so I'm gonna go back up to the pitch it's after the main note and the

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,630
click on the mesh and you see you have got size now.

109
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,920
I made this texture so I'm aware of roughly what the proportions should be and I think they should be

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,820
around 20 on the X by.

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Or should we say 15 or more why looks good to you.

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,290
Looks pretty good to me.

113
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,710
By the way you'll notice I'm dealing in 3D but this only has X and Y because technically a plane is

114
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,220
a two dimensional object is pretending to be 3-d.

115
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,280
Look what happens if I go underneath.

116
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,040
It's not showing.

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,070
Now if you need the texture to show underneath there are things you can do that so I can go to material

118
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,870
and parameters and I can go to coal mode which is where it is right there.

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,080
Right now it's going the back don't draw the back.

120
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,210
Not going to see I could disable that and no one to go underneath it'll show on if I don't really need

121
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,070
that because our cameras give me an a fixed position so mayors won't call the back and just save a little

122
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,230
bit of processing time.

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,330
And that is our pet when I move it up slightly to get rid the grid as a lovely woodgrain to it and work

124
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,320
for some goals here we can make a little bigger if we want but we can tweak that as we go.

125
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,670
But already we have a pitch.

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,150
In fact you now have what you need for this challenge.

127
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:59,360
I'd like you to take all just done and apply it to make a ball cridland you seen call it ball and make

128
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,940
it.

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
And just in case you get confused.

130
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,910
The key is the meche instance is going to create a mesh but it's not going to be a plane.

131
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,250
Figure out which one it is.

132
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,370
Make a ball and when you're happy with your results come back and show you how harder.

133
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,470
And Mark Mac OK.

134
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,950
So I definitely want a new scene because my ball is not part of the pitches can behave separately.

135
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,480
Some making you scene but I'm going to make this a mesh instance which is already selected is the last

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,950
thing we did so great and I'm gonna call it ball because it's a ball.

137
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,990
Under mash I'm going to give it a new sphere.

138
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,240
Look it's almost done.

139
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,090
I'd probably have to re size it a little later but that's okay because he's all innocent sees it's easier

140
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,760
to let's save that for now as ball.

141
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,670
And you know what let's give the material some a click on ammash an on premise of mesh amadu new spatial

142
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,370
material.

143
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,290
And let's see.

144
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,440
I want to put a texture.

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,150
I'm going to give it a nice yellow albino texture and that's looking pretty good.

146
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,550
And now I'm just going to save that some a Save As ball material.

147
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,200
And that's probably put that back in scene hasn't it.

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,380
Let's move that goes in to our graphics.

149
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:26,740
Look at that.

150
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,610
We have a ball and a sphere.

151
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,280
And if we got to see what looks like a pitch I can instance that in and there it is.

152
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,780
It is way bigger than the pictures in it but that's okay.

153
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,890
We can shrink that down so I'm going to go into the ball click on mesh.

154
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,020
And you know the radius is going to be zero point five.

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,840
Have a look.

156
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,380
Oh and height can be a point five to know the height of be one.

157
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,790
There it go because the radius is half the height of course at this and then go back in here a little

158
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,130
bit better I might even go small.

159
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,630
I might go zero point to five by zero point five.

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,960
I don't know why it lets you change the radius and the height.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,700
Technically that's no longer a sphere it's a spheroid But you know whatever and there it is.

162
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
The ball is a pretty good size of this pitch.

163
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Yes I know that the line isn't quite centred.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm sorry I made it by hand but if you want make you want extra go for it's very easy to make.

165
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,680
So on a day out there and move the ball from the pitch bookstand doesn't belong here and save it.

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,390
What I'm not going to do is try and run it one.

167
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,450
This is not the default scene.

168
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,080
And two we don't have a camera set up.

169
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,140
If I try and run it.

170
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,200
There's nothing to look at.

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,680
Right.

172
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,370
So I just set the pitch as the default scene.

173
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:40,820
That's OK.

174
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,290
We know how to change that but we're off to a really good start.

175
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,600
And that brings us to the end of this video.

176
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,800
In this video we have looked at creating a mesh instance creating material and the fundamentals of in

177
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,990
three dimensions.

178
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,610
We've also created a pitch and a ball which let's face it for a kick about game which if you don't or

179
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,010
that means it's just British slang word for an informal football match.

180
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,740
It's pretty important we kind of need those.

181
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,720
And before I send I really want encouraging share which you've got with the community put on the Facebook

182
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,290
the Forum page the discord I'm dying to see what you guys are making.

183
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,640
So what does your ball look like.

184
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,550
Is it a different texture different size.

185
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,290
Have you got someone's face on it.

186
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,920
I reasoned it got a logo.

187
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,280
You know a donkey show what you got because I'm really curious.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,450
It's a great way to encourage yourself to learn.

189
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,450
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
