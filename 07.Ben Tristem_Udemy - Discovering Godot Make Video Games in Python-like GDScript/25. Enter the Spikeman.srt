1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:12,010
Welcome back lovely God people in this video we're going to add an NPC enter the spike man at the end

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,460
of the video.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,950
You to have a spackman OPEC that can hurt money.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,420
What do we need to do.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,470
Well I'm thinking of a very simple non play a character so simple in fact it doesn't really have any

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,870
behaviour is not going to react to by it's just going to move left.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,800
Pause right pause.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,830
Repeat.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,260
Let's get that going.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,050
First thing we're do as you might expect is creating You scene before I do that though.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,800
Let me explain more about something different.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,190
What's going to happen is a put spike man on a platform spike that's going to go this way.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,680
Pause this way pause and repeat.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,930
Spike man is going to be an area hoodie just like these spikes just like the jump.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:00,730
If I animate an area hoodie on this key frame change the position on the x axis to my a 100 it's going

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,460
to think I'm in the global position.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,380
Why.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,560
Because the position is always relative to the parent.

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:14,280
And for some reason if you do it that way round it's going to think that the parent is the root note.

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,230
Right so just go here.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,560
We don't want that.

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,850
But there's a workaround.

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,280
Let me show the work around so new scene and let's get to the 0 0 so I can see where things are going

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,960
to spawn in and create not an area to see but a Node 2 they call that spike.

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,470
And now I'm going to make an area to see as a child of that.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,590
So now the area to me is the bit that's going to move I move left and right and it's going to know that's

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,770
relative to the spike.

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,060
So Spike man as an object as a node is actually going to stay still but it's gonna have a child that

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,000
has a collision shape and an animated Sprite that's going to move left and right.

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,160
OK.

31
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,970
So we have an area to see here.

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,340
It's going to be a collision shape.

33
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,090
And in order for it to have a collision shape we should know what we're colliding with someone a back

34
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,240
up level to spaceman.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,450
And let's add an animated Sprite.

36
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,150
The enemy to Sprite is going to need some frames so new Sprite frames click on Sprite frames.

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,930
I'm going to rename default to idle for no apparent reason but for some reason they want to.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,410
Next into our graphics folder into our enemies.

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,590
And here we have Spiderman.

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,710
By the way if you'd rather do the same thing with a sun that moves left and right you go ahead.

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,170
But I want to you spike the idle animation is just going to be Spiderman standing.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,930
That's all it is that's all we need to see.

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,870
Now let's add a new animation.

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:46,110
I'm going to call this walk and that's going to be Spike medawar one spike men walk two just two francs.

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,520
That's all we need.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,730
Let's see how that looks.

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,630
So go back a level playing.

48
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,910
Well I'll stand still and walk is pretty good.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,860
OK let's go back to Idol now that's put in that coalition ship and I'm going to just make a very simple

50
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,920
collision shaped hoodie.

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,510
I'm not going to spend time making a polygon that perfectly matches the outside.

52
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,290
I'm just going to use a capsule a nice easy capital shape that I'm actually going to have to move to

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,600
the lowest level so let's move it at Sprite above Italy so I can see the collision shape.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,750
God draws things in the order So pretend you're here right where the word node is.

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,010
That's what you can see.

56
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,460
So that's your line of sight remember grab the accidents dont grab the scale handle so drag big drag

57
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,290
drag about there what.

58
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,770
It's that 45.

59
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,990
Awesome.

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,520
And let's look at the height.

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,950
What's the height of this drag drag.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,360
You don't have to sing dragged out drag but you know you can.

63
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,290
Oh that looks pretty good doesn't it now.

64
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,060
I know that there's a gap here but honestly I don't see how Bunny could possibly fit there.

65
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm not making a putt there pixel perfect game this isn't Super Meat Boy so let's see what that would

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,690
be.

67
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,940
That would be 65.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,860
Okay so if you don't want to drag the extent you could just set the radius to 45 pixels in a height

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,310
to 65 all of these numbers are in pixels.

70
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,420
Let's put a script in.

71
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,020
So add new script and I'm going to load in.

72
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,690
There has at script because we really have one that has everything we need.

73
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,820
So his has it's.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,980
And you'll notice it extends area too deep and it's using on body entered which is for every Tudeh.

75
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,540
If I put this on the know to do this script won't work so I'm going to put it on the area today which

76
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,370
is fine because that's where it's going to end.

77
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,950
And just to refresh our memories here's what it does if anything enters if any body rather enters this

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,210
area then trigger the hurt function in game state.

79
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,360
In other words anything that enters here make the player be hurt.

80
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,990
So let's make sure that the only thing that can trigger this is the playlist go over to our collision

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,100
layers make sure that we're on the enemy layer not on the player and that we only interact with the

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,420
player in the mask.

83
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,870
And now I think I can hide my colours in shape and click on move all children so now whenever I click

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,870
on Spike man I will move the entire object not whatever's lowest.

85
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,630
Great.

86
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,120
One more thing I need to do.

87
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,760
I need this to acclimate.

88
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,540
I could do this in script but there's no need.

89
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm just going to the Amish and play it just like before.

90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,220
So animation play.

91
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,690
Let's at some tracks I remember a movie in the area 2d which means that the Sprite action needs to be

92
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,780
a child of area 2D.

93
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,680
I was going to drag it in there.

94
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,610
There it is perfect.

95
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,840
Let's put you slightly higher the colours and shapes of I need to see the clear shape I can.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,170
OK so now when Area 2D moves it's all square with the Sprite.

97
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,230
That was nearly a mistake OK.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,350
A new animation and we got a call this spike man because it's only give me one animation I don't need

99
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,940
to do spackman walks bike man.

100
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,610
It'll all give me one thing.

101
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,760
What's going to happen.

102
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,510
Would take a second to move left by pixels.

103
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm going to wait and then I will move at the same speed this way and wait.

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,700
That's a total of six seconds I think.

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,050
And what do we need to do.

106
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,950
Well we need to get Eric to Dee.

107
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,450
And you know what I could do up here.

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,500
But let's show what I'm doing.

109
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,290
Let's go to to do transformer position and make a key.

110
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,600
And at one second I need the position on the x axis to be minus a hundred.

111
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,680
Make a key and repeat the key at two seconds.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,490
See this line.

113
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,400
That means there are key frames here but the value hasn't changed.

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,890
So walk here and wait a second.

115
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:49,590
At the same speed which means at 3 you're at zero at 4 you're at 100 So it's got four seconds and change

116
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:56,700
the exposition to positive one one key frame and repeat the key frame at five.

117
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,720
Now if I loop the animation like so we play at a go here we wait.

118
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,570
We move at the same speed here here we wait and then we go back to the beginning.

119
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,410
Great okay right now Spike manage just hovering in a weird way.

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,750
Let's actually animate this thing.

121
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,170
So animation player I would like you to make a brand new track in animated Sprite.

122
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:30,060
I'd like you to start with walk and put a key frame up one second which has you to idle two seconds

123
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,430
back to walk out for seconds to idle.

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,840
And at five seconds to walk.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,990
Let's just check that.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,550
Very nice.

127
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,160
Now obviously when he's going to the left spackman as moonwalking So we need one more thing here we

128
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,490
need to put flip H we use as before on Bunny.

129
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,700
Now we know he's on Spiderman So let's make it key for flip H.

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,490
So the first thing I'm doing is moving left so let's switch that on and make a key.

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,540
One second actually doesn't matter because spackman is perfectly symmetrical doesn't need flips at two

132
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,550
seconds.

133
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,530
Let's switch off flip horizontal.

134
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:21,590
But a key frame and a five seconds switch it on and that should be a perfectly animated Spiderman.

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,120
He's taken the area to be in a collision shape with him and it should work just fine.

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,750
One last thing I want to do is make sure that he autoloader this animation wants to load in when Spike

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,070
mount does do that by hitting this auto load button.

138
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,040
Also play onload.

139
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,740
I cannot close this animation and save the scene go to scenes.

140
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,500
This is studying that bit crowded isn't it.

141
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,920
A fix that later in this for the press save.

142
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,510
And here we go.

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
Let's see then.

144
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,850
Whereas them to put a spike a man here just to test them so they make a can.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,350
No 2d to keep things in.

146
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,770
Make things nice and tidy.

147
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:06,000
So no need to keep an eye on all this end pieces unless instance in a spike.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,650
Man.

149
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,680
And despite man put it here.

150
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:20,260
You know this move so I can not worry about dragging the wrong thing and in a pixel right now he's in

151
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,080
front of the spike.

152
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,030
I quite like that.

153
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,160
If he don't want him in front of the spike remember you're standing here.

154
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,170
You're looking that way so you'd have to drag this in pieces folder to a buff spikes or vice versa.

155
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,880
So you could do that if you wanted.

156
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,330
I actually quite like it the other way around.

157
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm going to pull it back right here.

158
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,860
OK.

159
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,400
Let's see if you work.

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,560
Well there's Spike mannone is moving and I'm to do damage because I didn't connect this signal.

161
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,370
Okay.

162
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,660
So let's go back to spike man.

163
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,330
What's it called it's called on body enter and get a copy of that.

164
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,500
Let's make it signals.

165
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,120
Click on Node body and to connect.

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,330
And you're going to called on body and.

167
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,370
Oh and I put that in the right script.

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,600
So on to hoodie on what he entered cannot.

169
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,930
So now he should work Pressplay.

170
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,060
Kellems I can't get out of it.

171
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,140
He killed me works.

172
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,910
All right.

173
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,230
Which brings us to the challenge.

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,720
I would like you to place those spackman ads that Spike meant to your level.

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,950
And remember keep a challenging keep it fair.

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,510
Don't lead the player into a situation where they're going to fall on Spike again and there is nothing

177
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,590
they could have done about it.

178
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,020
The player should at least have a chance to react so pause the video placeless spackman give you a level

179
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,860
a quick play test and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,650
And welcome back.

181
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,570
All right let's play some spike.

182
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,660
I'm going to duplicate you and I'm going to put you as a good place down here.

183
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,620
Don't fall down here this is a bad place.

184
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,490
Let's move on.

185
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,390
How about do.

186
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,070
Here's a nice one let's put you here.

187
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,300
Yep looks good.

188
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,950
Don't do one more.

189
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
I feel like should be up here.

190
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,240
So that's why I'm here because reasons.

191
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,600
Okay let's give that a quick playtest.

192
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:41,170
There already is an awful lot of extra debt at a time like Job I can't just take my time and go around

193
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:50,470
the level if I want to get these coins I need to figure out when Spike amounts to it which I'm really

194
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,210
happy with.

195
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,220
However before we carry on I've noticed that this scene's folder which I mentioned before is starting

196
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,020
to be a little crowded.

197
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,500
Also coiner affects his script so let's move you right click move to scripts.

198
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,820
OK.

199
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,400
What I'd like to do is make a folder specifically for levels.

200
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,150
So that's right click and do a new folder and call it levels and I'm going to move level 1 into it.

201
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,810
What's that.

202
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
There it is.

203
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,630
And that game over into it because that currently Those are two levels.

204
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,960
Now if I try and run this little.

205
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,130
Well first thing I'll do is say I don't know your main level are for press play where is it such you

206
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,070
can find it as a level one.

207
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,750
However if one went on two guys sorry money.

208
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,190
The game's going to crash.

209
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,810
Look at all these debulk areas because it's got a string reference right.

210
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,360
It's pointing to the location of game over.

211
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,080
If I show you the script for game state here we go.

212
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,250
Game over.

213
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,460
Our end game does this.

214
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,270
Let's change that.

215
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,690
Let's go to the global script.

216
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:04,860
So into our scripts follow in to Blue Bell and let's make a couple of scene parts of variable level

217
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,890
1 equals and let's go to all levels right click and do copy path.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,340
Elliman did the same thing again.

219
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,110
Up up up.

220
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,530
Now because I'm pointing to a physical location on the drive it's a little trickier than it would be

221
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,360
if I'm just using these nodes.

222
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,150
Can auto set their names and positions.

223
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,070
Well there any way to do that.

224
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,870
You say this is me.

225
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,150
Positional drives a lot more difficult.

226
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,220
So let's make a note.

227
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,940
So when people look at the script they know why this difference.

228
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,890
I will call this scene.

229
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,610
Locations must be set manually.

230
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,140
We'll call this nodes.

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,020
That's never the nodes set automatically correct.

232
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,140
Say that.

233
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,360
Next thing I need to do is actually use those so instead of that seam path let's go global.

234
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,190
Game over and we'd better open game over some of that double click and game over.

235
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,880
And change that to lowball dot level 1.

236
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,340
And that should fix that.

237
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,510
By money.

238
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,510
Anyone else.

239
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,980
And no debugger is fantastic.

240
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,560
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video.

241
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,590
We've created a simple NPC using animation player.

242
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,170
This is a really great technique for making exciting levels very quickly and simply so before we finish

243
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,810
remember.

244
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,120
Share how your levels going.

245
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,520
I'd love to see your progress.

246
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,840
Put it on the Facebook group put it in discord put it on our forums.

247
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,550
An excellent work and I'll see you on the next video.
