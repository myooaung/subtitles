00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.590
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.610
Fantastic God.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.030
People in this video we're going to start building a tutorial.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.370
Our game is pretty playable.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.680
We have a single level with an exciting gameplay loop but let's make this game better for players because

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.200
just because we know how to play doesn't mean someone else will.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.000
We're never finished a shooter in this video.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.370
Instead we're going to get it started by making a tutorial map and before we make the map.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.750
We should have a very clear idea of what's going to happen in she it off.

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.130
It's very hard to design a map if you don't know what has to be in it.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.300
So how will the tutorial work.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.470
Well the first thing I want is an optional tutorial so we're going to fire this up by a splash screen

13
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.960
with some buttons on it be a start game there'll be a tutorial.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.600
I really dislike it when a game forces me to play the tutorial especially if it does it every time I

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.070
play it.

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.100
Sometimes a game when we could do the tutorial the first time you play and then you never have to do

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.850
it again.

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.630
But then when you reinstall it does anyway so none of that option tutorial.

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.640
It also teach the players the following things 1 how to move.

20
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.910
Yes a D and mouse may not be obvious for this particular player.

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.230
Let's make it easy for them how to interact with objects.

22
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.980
If you use a computer or open a door you have to be within range and click on it with the mouse that

23
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.910
will not be obvious solist each place will do that.

24
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.840
We also want to teach them how to use night vision and why you might want to do so and how to collect

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.460
loot and how and when to use the exit.

26
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.330
So any move interact use night vision collect loot and exit so let's go to God and make a map that allows

27
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.310
us to do this before we go any further.

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
I happen to know that at some point I'm going to want to use vision mode.

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.840
This little note right here.

30
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.890
I'd rather recreate it.

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.080
I want to use this as a scene I can insert someone a right click on it and I'm going to go save branch

32
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.060
as seen and it seems I'm going to check a save vision mode.

33
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.820
Now it's an instant scene and I can open it as it's unci.

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680
That's going to be really useful in a moment because then I can bring the node in.

35
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:09.100
OK let's make any brand new scene and I'm gonna use no tuti as my child note and I won't call it a tutorial.

36
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.640
And before I go any further I'm going to save it in scenes in levels tutorial.

37
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.070
Fantastic.

38
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.320
Okay I want flaws and I want a wall.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.540
And those are both titlemax Maps.

40
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.170
Some of the brignac spent time at any time up node and white which you start with first floors.

41
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.200
We've got tile sets floors and there it is and I can very easily draw some flats in a renamed as all

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.720
floors.

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.350
Back up Sheesh you tauriel and I may do the same thing tile map but this time is going to be the auto

44
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.420
tile walls and that is the beginning of our level.

45
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.970
Observe.

46
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.050
I can go.

47
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.600
Here is a floor.

48
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.180
Doo doo doo.

49
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.870
In fact I'm doing a silly way round.

50
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.390
I could very easily bucketful and back to paint tile and now agh with small sensor.

51
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.590
Click on Sprite.

52
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.580
Great.

53
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.310
So we've got to undo those.

54
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.130
And let's think about what we want to happen.

55
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.620
I want the player to start in a little room like this.

56
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.470
And there's going to be a door and with a say the play Okay you want to move through a hallway and get

57
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.700
a bit more character that will go to a door and you need to open the door.

58
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.590
I guess our first move out of this room that's shooter or someone to open a door that's here.

59
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.470
She tauriel step to correct.

60
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.140
So let's put in the floor.

61
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.370
I'm scared to.

62
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.900
Draw round the outside and then use a bucket fill.

63
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.940
There it is.

64
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:59.240
And I would change the floors for this but get it so when in a door that was an instance a door in scenes.

65
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.120
Door to move it to over here is not to be a locked door just a basic door.

66
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.770
Let's rotate that.

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.400
See.

68
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.580
Door transform.

69
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.990
90 degrees.

70
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.010
Double check that off floors and all walls on the correct collision layers.

71
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.830
They are not players.

72
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.640
They are touraine and they can attract the player do the same thing with older walls which haven't names

73
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.860
hold.

74
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.640
Name that and quickly.

75
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.930
Not a player you are touraine and you can interact with the player.

76
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.640
Awesome.

77
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.440
Alice put the door in a slightly settable place.

78
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.390
OK is looking at the next thing I want to do is the place to have to use night vision mode and do that

79
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.440
will make a little bit of a wiggly corridor so something where you can't see where you're going.

80
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.260
You're going to get stuck allots let's just make something like this.

81
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.840
That feels good.

82
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.820
And then there's going to be a little error with the loot annetts as us make that neater and the little

83
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.370
area with an exit.

84
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.300
OK.

85
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.150
So the players can be told to use night vision here.

86
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.120
They'll be no lights here come through here put some lights in here briefcase exit.

87
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.610
And that's looking fine.

88
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.990
So let's put some floors in.

89
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.910
And at number the beauty of using tiles and auto tiles is we can alter this to a heart's content any

90
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.090
time we like.

91
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.080
So that is very shiny and Pete Boop.

92
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.850
My floors doors and walls are all done.

93
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.520
Let's put the player and some instance in the player who is on the character's player and movie 2 over

94
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.780
here less instance in our vision mode.

95
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.040
It's looking pretty good.

96
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.870
Let's just see how that plays so far.

97
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.270
I go into here.

98
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.950
I can move around and I can be a disguise and vision mode crashes.

99
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.430
Why.

100
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.730
Because I don't have a vision.

101
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.480
No time OK.

102
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.030
That's fine.

103
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.520
Let's go to level 1 and scroll down to play others vision a timer.

104
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.800
OK.

105
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.510
So vision mode timer should actually be a child of the player which I haven't done.

106
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:26.140
So when I do right now is delete vision mode Time and tiley we go into the play a scene at a timer here.

107
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.320
And we call this vision timer

108
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.610
and connect that in let's just see where it was connected do on vision mode timer timeout somewhere.

109
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.880
Copy that connect it as a signal to play.

110
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.870
I've just copy pasted on my time at time out just in case I see nothing on which I actually have to

111
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.180
correct the spelling for any further.

112
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.850
See vision mode time.

113
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.400
There we go.

114
00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.200
I get connect actually pace that and that should still work fine and to double check.

115
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.230
Let's just run the game.

116
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.720
That's great.

117
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.960
OK.

118
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.560
Let's see how the tutorial plates now.

119
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.510
So close the play a scene mix from the right scene.

120
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.900
Awesome.

121
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.620
Great.

122
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.170
OK a couple more things on ADD.

123
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.150
I want to add a briefcase and an exit.

124
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.740
Let's put one briefcase in a briefcase.

125
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.280
It is right here and drag it down to there.

126
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.730
There's briefcase now exit extenso instant scene exit and that's going to live right here.

127
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.270
Yeah.

128
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.690
Which brings me to the challenge.

129
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.620
Unlike you to create your tutorial level Remember we need a door a section for night vision a briefcase

130
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.590
and an exit.

131
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.790
It's pretty simple.

132
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.540
Pause the video make you level and then when you come back I'll wrap up this video.

133
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.140
I'm ok back.

134
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.140
All right.

135
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.750
In this video we've looked at how we plan the requirements for a tutorial and how to set up a new level

136
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.790
with our existing assets so we can bring in vision mode we can bring in walls we can bring in doors

137
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.620
all those things we've saved a scenes.

138
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.430
We can now bring in very easily.

139
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.010
We also troubleshoot a little bit with a vision more time and not being on the player.

140
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.440
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
