00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.800
Hello again you amazing go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070
We're going to add the final piece of gameplay.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.800
We're going to add the exit the player can go through the exit if they're carrying the loot.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.050
Now because I'm making this as a sort of demonstration or tech demo I'm only gonna have one level.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.240
So if you carry the loot to the exit you will just end the game.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.830
That's that.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.100
Let's take a look at what the exit needs suck to make an exit.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.650
I want an exit to be on every level I'm put into the template if I have more than one level to go through.

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.250
There's gonna be some tweaking.

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.680
Now I only want the exits to work on the player so I'm going to use collision layers enemies has no

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
function to check if the player has a no code briefcase.

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.250
So let's get into it.

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970
I'm like a brand new scene.

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.580
So my brand new C and I've a custom note for this one and I'm going to use a color rect as my base.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.200
So first thing that make it's the right size how do you feel about a minimum size of 200 by 150 200

16
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.710
100

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.700
Yeah.

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.470
That's good.

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.880
And pick a nice color.

20
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm thinking a nice turquoise and only semi transparent so about.

21
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.100
Want to 5 on the Alpha.

22
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.870
My cat is clean the poop.

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.720
That's right.

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.850
And I'm going to use a colored rectangle so that I can put a label right in the center let's put a label

25
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.210
in there.

26
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.940
And you know what on the color rectangle on an adult theme so load theme on the interface theme.

27
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.920
There it is.

28
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.460
And let's write the word exit.

29
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.350
Now the benefit of using a color rectangle here is and get a layout and I can go to anchor's full rect

30
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.550
and layout center.

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.090
Perfect.

32
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.960
Okay so now we have something that looks like an exit.

33
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.380
Let's have it behave like one.

34
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.770
To do that.

35
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.070
I'm going to add an area to each my colorectal area Judy.

36
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.070
There it is.

37
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.270
Now right now the activity is centered on the corner.

38
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.140
I need it in the center.

39
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.710
So let's move it.

40
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.020
To transform.

41
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.210
What do we say this was this was a 200 by 100.

42
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.810
Fantastic.

43
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.400
So how fast you hundreds and one hundred and half 400 is 50.

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.530
And there's my area to do right in the center.

45
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.100
It needs a collision shape and that's going to have a rectangle so new Rectangle collision shape.

46
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.640
I click on that and the extents are going to be half of the width.

47
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.300
So one hundred by 50.

48
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.760
Awesome.

49
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.910
Let's rename you exit now before we put the signal.

50
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.110
Let's check our collisions.

51
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.150
So collision less you're not on a ladder.

52
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.600
You lost a plow and you're only going to interact with the with the player so mosque should be on play

53
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.950
a large blank.

54
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.240
Now let's give a script a brand new script awesome.

55
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.640
So here's my exit not G.D..

56
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.450
And what do we want.

57
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.750
Well first thing is I want to connect a signal to it.

58
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.560
So it's got a note and I want this on the physics somebody entered physics body to do so I can take

59
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.640
that to the exit.

60
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.180
Done this before.

61
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.060
Now we know the body has to be the place.

62
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.980
We don't have to check that.

63
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.430
So you go.

64
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.080
If body and now I can use has node and I could see the name of the node.

65
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:31.600
Now we could it briefcase with a capital B and all I want to do is you to get tree dot quit and we're

66
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.300
good.

67
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.210
So that should work.

68
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.910
We'll save that on the levels.

69
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.560
I guess that's a good place to put it.

70
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.630
And I want to make sure that every level has an exit.

71
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.150
So let's go to our levels get our template and I'm an instance that so instance exit

72
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.520
a save that I was going to level one and find out exit and just move it to where we want it.

73
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.860
I'm thinking in here.

74
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.060
Yeah.

75
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.330
That's looking right in the center that we got.

76
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.230
I can't just go against the wall and that should be good to go.

77
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.550
Let's test it see if this works.

78
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:17.060
OK so let's steer through here 973 let's see if I can do this fast without losing the game 9 7 8 3.

79
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.470
Here we go.

80
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.720
Yes.

81
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.910
Don't mind me.

82
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.010
I'm not here.

83
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.530
We have a problem with a stealth gave me a rushing.

84
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.140
There we go.

85
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.410
Might be time to use a box.

86
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.900
When you guys think.

87
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.680
I have three boxes.

88
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.670
Let's use a box doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

89
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.480
The cover up moon got

90
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.870
excuse me.

91
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.470
I'm a box

92
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.240
and my camera Halo camera.

93
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.560
Well my briefcase

94
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.200
and let's run for it.

95
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.600
Now the briefcase I like a briefcase another box right.

96
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.340
Scuse me.

97
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.430
Box coming through.

98
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.670
And if it wants it we quit the game without any kind of crash.

99
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.820
Now we will have a victory screen but that's demonstrating that we now have a working exit.

100
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.950
Look at that we now have a complete gameplay loop.

101
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.470
Now if you added more than one level you can have to tweak the script a little bit to just move on to

102
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.670
the next level.

103
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.850
But I think that's a really good piece of progress.

104
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.490
So excellent work and I'll see you on the next video.
