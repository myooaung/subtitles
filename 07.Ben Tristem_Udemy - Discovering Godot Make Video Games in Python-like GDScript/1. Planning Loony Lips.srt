00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,650
Hi Folks you can hear and welcome in this section.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,660
We're going to start actually making a game.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,050
We restored got oh we've got the right version.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,340
We're ready to go.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,880
So what kind of game are we making and why in this section we're going to be making a word game now.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,530
At first glance this may not seem like a big deal but bear with me because we feel that this is essential

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,960
to get into your grasp as soon as possible.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,510
I know that getting something into your grasp isn't an expression but let's pretend it is in order to

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,300
make really good games and understand an engine.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,300
It's critical that you understand key concepts early right.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,870
So we're going to really focus on jeanie's script at the end of the section.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,320
Ben we'll focus on C sharp and make a game that doesn't focus on things like graphics and level design

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,560
and collision and movement and all the other things like let's just make a game focussing on how the

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
engine works.

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,050
So how we're going to do that.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,850
The game going to be make is called lunar eclipse and it's based on the game Mad Libs.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,910
We're not calling our game ad libs because that is a copy written name that I'm not violating intellectual

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,000
property but it's going to be based on similar ideas.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
If you're not familiar with Mad Libs it works like this.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,280
There's a party and two of us are playing at any given time one of us has a story written here and you

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,200
can't read it so here is my story.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,320
And on my story I have blanks that you have to fill in.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,990
You're not allowed to see the story.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,610
I'm going to ask you to fill the Mets it's say things like Can I have a name.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,670
Can I have a feeling.

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,650
Can I have a place.

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,070
And we'll write them in and then I'll read the story that you've just written.

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,290
Our game is going to do that.

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,180
So before we go any further think about that and ask yourself how do I want the player to feel if you

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,680
followed the boardgame course you'll know that I'm a big fan of the concept of the essential experience

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,890
to me that's the most important thing in a game right.

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,570
How does the player feel and what do I do to make that happen.

33
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,090
So that's my task.

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,510
I would like you to think if we're going to have a word game based on Mad Libs called lynley Lips.

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,810
What's the essential experience I want to have.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,050
Now there isn't a wrong answer here except I didn't think about it so.

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,970
Pause the video.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,030
Come up with how you'd like the players to feel.

39
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,720
And when you come back I'll share mine.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,950
All right.

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,110
Time to dig out the trusty white board so I'm calling it looney lips because I think it's a fun name

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,060
for about tall tales for a while but lonely lips is a better name and I'm going for a very simple experience.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,820
I'm going for a goofy party right.

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,310
I want players to feel like this is silly and frivolous and anything can happen and it's fun.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,680
In fact I'm going to give linae lips a little unofficial logo.

46
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,980
You don't have to have a copy of my logo.

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,960
Here's someone sticking their tongue out looking slightly grumpier than I meant.

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,070
But that's the feeling I'm going for.

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,970
I want a goofy party game something where a bunch of people are going to get together and just make

50
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,880
each other laugh.

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,160
That's some going for I'd love to hear your ideas if you came with something different maybe you're

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,400
coming up something a bit more sinister or something a bit more gritty.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
That's great.

54
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,790
Love to hear them.

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,990
Now let's look at the requirements for the game.

56
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,540
What do we need to make happen for this scheme to work.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,130
Well our game requirements are based on the fact that this is a word game.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,450
So the first thing we need to do is get words from the player and these words have to have a prompt.

59
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,750
So I have to ask you for a noun or a verb.

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,270
Or if you prefer someone's name a thing a place an action.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,580
Right.

62
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,580
I need to ask you for something and take that input.

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,800
I then need to have a story that I can plug those words into.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,250
I want this to be an expandable game I want these stories to be easy to add to so you might start with

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,110
two or three and then write more and more and again should just be able to just take those and expand

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,530
without them to do anything more.

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,040
So that's what we're going to be making at the end of it you're going to have something looks a bit

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
like this.

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,460
And I'm really excited to see how your game turns out.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,240
What kind of stories you come up with and to show you how much fun this energy can be.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,060
So without further ado let's get started in the next video.
