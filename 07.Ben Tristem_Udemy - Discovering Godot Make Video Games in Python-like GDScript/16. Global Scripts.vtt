00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.450
Welcome back you lovely God people in this video we're going to create a global script.

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.630
Why are we doing that.

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.730
Well I want to make it easier to be able to call nodes from other scripts without using pathes.

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.770
Let's go into that in a bit more detail.

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.790
Were going to create a global GDP.

6
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.810
I love the name of it not just because it's a global script but also because well that sounds like an

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.580
evil layer.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.900
Right I've been watching a lot of Eureka recently some like global dynamics kind of fun.

9
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.790
But that's not why we're doing it.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.330
One it's more convenient in a moment we're going to have the link spikes as an object to gain state

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.040
and it's going to be a pain in the butt to have to say okay I need you to find the root level one.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.580
And game state g-day.

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.780
Instead let's create a short cuts I could use a global dot game state.

14
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.590
This is awesome or a bust.

15
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.380
If we remove the string referencing from a note path I can move stuff and I can renamed stuff it doesn't

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.280
really matter what I call the node.

17
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.970
It'll still find it.

18
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.440
The first thing to do is get a script you press file and new and a quick new script without attaching

19
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.630
it to a node.

20
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.840
I know I told you that doesn't work if it makes you feel better.

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.260
God was really creating a secret note in the background that we don't know about.

22
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.560
And I mean to call this global global GDP and I'll make sure I put it in my scrips folder so it's going

23
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560
in here.

24
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.400
Scripps global g-day.

25
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.290
The next thing I want to do is to make sure that this is automatically loaded so in project settings

26
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.280
I press the auto load tab and find that script.

27
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.940
I'm going to add it and you'll see single turn enabled and that's not a singleton is a script that exists

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.930
no matter what scene is loaded so it's going to be our global script.

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.200
Okay so what is going to happen within the script.

30
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.470
Well really I'm just going to declare variables in it.

31
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.700
I'm just going to use the global script to hold information.

32
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.840
Remember each script should do one job.

33
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.700
This is that single responsibility principle.

34
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.980
So there's Miggy variable called Game state and I write the same way I wrote the script name because

35
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.990
it's just more sensible.

36
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.620
Okay so what is this variable.

37
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.760
Where's it going to be defined.

38
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.650
There are different ways you can solve this.

39
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.930
Yes you can export node patheon and drag it into the inspector but every time we change something we're

40
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.570
going have to check that everything is in the right place and it's really easy to create circular links

41
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.950
that way so we're not going to export to the inspector.

42
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.630
Instead we set the value of game state to be the game state script itself right that the node that carries

43
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.580
games state whatever that node is wherever it is set it and take that to happen at the beginning of

44
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.340
the game.

45
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.930
The moment this node is created when it is instantiated.

46
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.520
So on the ready function of this node at the moment you come into being.

47
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.520
What do you do.

48
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.560
Global dot games state.

49
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.900
Look at that auto grating equals self equals this node.

50
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.440
The thing that's issuing this instruction.

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.540
Just check that's working by going print global dot game state.

52
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.740
And there it is the node I.D..

53
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.220
Now I could do a path to I could to get a..

54
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.450
But this is really really easy.

55
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.780
I don't need the print because now wherever this is whatever it's called it will work.

56
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:39.710
Let's put in one more for player so inside global GDP there's the play variable and it's the player

57
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.040
script will create a ready functional go after all of those.

58
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.320
It's going to be a global dot player he calls self.

59
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.100
This is going to be really useful because without doing this changing print would mean I need to connect

60
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.430
a signal but I can't just connect this way because these things are being instance and every time I

61
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.670
make a new instance or delete something I have to do it from scratch.

62
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.740
I have to connect them in code and get the path.

63
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.140
Now I don't need to do that.

64
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.840
I can call in a script I'd like you to change the call.

65
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.680
We changed recently in the player script so that it uses global game state instead of get parent.

66
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.110
So pause the video give it a go and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

67
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.260
And welcome back.

68
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.430
Let's get to the play script.

69
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.420
And what do we need to do.

70
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.920
We need to find this fourth thing said this.

71
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.200
Is where it was ending the game.

72
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.260
Get parent or end game and that will work as long as we don't change the structure right.

73
00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:02.800
So instead let's just do nice and easy global dot games state DOT and the school gang.

74
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.410
So if that works it will now just go to game state wherever that is instead of having to get the note

75
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.860
and call that function.

76
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.000
Let's find out Bunny.

77
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.090
I need you to make the ultimate sacrifice again to the end of the world.

78
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.270
Boom.

79
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.630
Let's check that works.

80
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.470
I am going to rename level one and I'm going to rename it.

81
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.990
Hello world.

82
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.220
As I've remained at it should work fine let's find out.

83
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.870
Note it's been renamed everything loads fine.

84
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.900
Let's undo that renaming Let's rename the script.

85
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.080
What happens if I rename game state g-day Let's rename you too.

86
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.220
Donkey time dot g-day.

87
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.220
We are now able to rename nodes and scripts and nothing will go wrong.

88
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:19.720
So let's change doggie time back because it's a silly name and let's rename level one.

89
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.640
Funny thing I want to do a little bit of feature proofing back to global GDP is I'm going to let's make

90
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.550
this a bit bigger.

91
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.620
I'm going to create a variable for the Gooly because we've got to be using that lot as make a variable

92
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.580
called Go eat save that back out a big screen at an and why did that.

93
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.180
And this is going to need a script isn't it.

94
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.730
So on the gooey object let's make a script for the Gooly and that will be the new script.

95
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.110
You'll be called googie and you won't be in scenes you'll be in scripts because I want to be able to

96
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.190
find you.

97
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.130
And all that needs to happen is unready global docs.

98
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.300
Ego self that can be reused for the next few videos when we start dealing with lives and coins in all

99
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.750
the other fun things that the game needs to do.

100
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.860
So be very easy top state to upstate to up date the gooey.

101
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.000
It's not going upstate.

102
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.820
It's staying in the town it was born in.

103
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.990
It likes the people yeah and that brings us this video in this video we've looked at had a use a singleton

104
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.320
to bypass string referencing we've made our script a lot more robust.

105
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.550
We've solved one of the basic things that can go wrong in God would make Ben much happier because when

106
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.850
he does the C sharp thing it's going to be a lot tighter and we've allowed ourselves a lot more scope

107
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.920
to rename and move stuff as we go on.

108
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.450
I think we're in really good shape we're now ready to start connecting lives and coins and all kinds

109
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.420
of other fun things.

110
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.360
So great work and I'll see on the next video.
