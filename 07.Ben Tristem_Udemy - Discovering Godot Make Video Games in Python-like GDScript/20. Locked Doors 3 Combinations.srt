00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello again you fantastic go to people.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,950
Let's continue with locked doors.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,150
We're going to create a random combination for every group of locked doors.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,790
I'm saying group because later on we might have multiple doors with us in combination with give us the

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,680
option.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,280
First let's talk about how combinations work and heist meisters first.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,600
All combinations are an array.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,260
Now we've covered this in a couple of videos.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,960
But the idea here is that we can have variable lengths.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,610
We can do a lot of stuff with it which means combinations or varying lengths.

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,210
So we need that in our combination.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,080
And we're going to return the combination to another script.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,080
This is because if the player is going to go get a combination by reading a computer know you know hack

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,660
into someone's computer find the combination we need the door connected to that computer to know what

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,950
the combination is.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,670
So we're going to have to have the combinations in a different place.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,300
So what I want to do is I want to create a system whereby there is one thing that makes combinations

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,740
that's just what it does.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,110
I want to follow the principle of single responsibility and we're going to query that and get a combination

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,510
back to do that.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,630
I'm going to use an auto load or a singleton.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,270
So let's take a moment to talk about what a singleton or an auto loan is.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,420
Any single script can be made persistently available.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,940
So this means it exists in the background of our game.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,570
It doesn't matter what scene we have loaded.

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,260
Remember we can change levels and we end loading screens.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,040
It's still loaded in the background is kind of a layer above everything else the Singleton could be

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,830
accessed by any script so any script can query it.

29
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,300
It's always wanting or we can have a scene that's playing background music consistently.

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,930
We need to be very careful with these it might be tempting to put everything in there as it also loaded

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,620
a global variable all our variables or objects in music accessible from everywhere.

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,350
Be very careful because this is how you get spaghetti code.

33
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,170
We want to make sure the only things that need to be accessed in multiple places are access to multiple

34
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,270
places.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,900
Quick Hand on heart here.

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,500
The first time I did this course I put everything in singletons everything and also loads.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,630
This solves a bunch of problems but causes a bunch of others let's keep this very clean if we need information

38
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,140
transferred constantly.

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,170
We can use group calls we can use signals but in a case like this where combination is going to be generated

40
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,240
for every single computer and door in every single level we could probably put this is not allowed.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,110
So let's look at how we do that.

42
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,560
First I'm going to make a brand new script.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,750
I don't really this scene for this I could in theory go to a template level and make a new node called

44
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,480
combination generation do it here.

45
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:43,190
But I'm going to do a new script Sysco script view a file new script and it's gonna be empty.

46
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,530
I'm going to put it just show what I pressed on whereas this path is like click on a little follow button.

47
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:55,240
So it's a little bit fossil element to be let's put it indoors and we're going to name this combination

48
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,700
generator dot G.D..

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,950
Perfect.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,990
When I create that and it's now created and saved and got to go.

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,230
Now this script is accessible everywhere in this video where outlets come out of template level in this

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,380
video would just affect the locked door.

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,320
So this locked door here is going to generate a combination.

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,010
We're gonna print it out to the output down here and have it actually use that lock.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,150
So rather new 0 4 5 1 will generate a new four digit combination.

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,390
OK.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,120
So to do that I'm going to go into this new script I just made it back in the script had the Coalition

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,490
generator.

59
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,360
This is a script with no note.

60
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,860
It's going to auto load in the background but that's how going to do that.

61
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,740
How do we get it to auto load project and project settings at the top here.

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,830
You'll see general input map and input map is where we changed all of our different keys localization

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,490
for languages and auto load.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,610
That's what we want.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,850
Now right now nothing is auto loaded.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,580
You'll see we've got a little list that will populate with a name.

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,010
The path to it and what we are actually loving the Singleton to add to this list we know to this folder

68
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,910
by the path I want to find the combination generator we just made the doors combination generator and

69
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,110
press add you have to press add make sure it's enabled because you could have in the backgrounds and

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,910
disable it which you could do an engine if we had background music and so on but we just make sure it's

71
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,940
running in the background.

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,070
OK.

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,210
So now I have this brand new combination generator script that does absolutely nothing so let's make

74
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:34,960
it do something and we'll give it a single function called generate a combination here and I need to

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,930
know how long this combination will be so let's bring in length.

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,860
So now whatever is calling this function is going to give it this argument here is this integer here.

77
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:53,740
And what we need to do well is create our variable so combination and it's just a blank array and then

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,530
we could do a simple for loop.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,580
So for number in range of length.

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,580
Now remember you look past for now.

81
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,120
Remember this argument here number is being created just for that.

82
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,550
That's nice but length that takes about length this number here is whatever I needed to be this is a

83
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,080
brand new argument so it's going to start at zero and head up until it hits whatever number this is

84
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,280
I could call it I that's traditional I'm going to call it number in length we can call it I don't know.

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,900
Headphones.

86
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,620
That's a stupid name but we could go to we have no problem with that.

87
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,560
Doesn't matter what you call us.

88
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,810
OK.

89
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,450
So for the number in range of length what do we need to do we need to append to that arrays.

90
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,060
That's good combination.

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:46,070
Dot append and what we're putting into putting a random integer modulo by 10 and random integer is a

92
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,440
function is that OK so just to talk through what we're doing we are running this as a loop every time

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,760
this number is in range of length so zero one two three.

94
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:07,840
Then I want combination that should be combination to get this array here to add in a random integer

95
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,640
and we're gonna modulo 10.

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,860
Effectively we're going to say okay go from zero to nine.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,180
What's going to happen is every time we get some number 10 it just goes cycle round again.

98
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,530
So effectively we're saying pick a number between zero and nine.

99
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:27,250
Finally we need to actually have that combination commencements go return combination and that is our

100
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,440
combination generator currently I'll do anything for the moment let's put it in a locked door so in

101
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,100
locked door I'm just going to have a nice ready function.

102
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,880
So let's go to function.

103
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,310
Ready so when you're ready to go here's what I want you to do.

104
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:47,970
I want you to generate a combination now for the moment we're doing this locked door.

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Later we'll be making computers and they'll be sending a signal to the locked door.

106
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,160
But for now just to get something working so we can see it actually running can function and generate

107
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,510
a combination.

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,230
And let's give us a little bit of space to work with.

109
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,890
OK so the first thing to do is I want to actually get this combination for now let's have a length of

110
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,600
four you know what we could put this up here.

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,770
Well now I'm sure to put this in the script for now the computer will be in charge of doing that set

112
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,270
on this the door right now.

113
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,770
But let's say I want to generate a combination to do that.

114
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm going to run combination generator and it's already accessible because we've put it as an auto load

115
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,670
at a singleton.

116
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,440
We can access it not just IT but all of its functions.

117
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,400
So look generate combinations we're good to go.

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,920
Now we need an argument so that's going to be for right that's all length for is kind of a magic number

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,670
I don't really want that there.

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,890
So what I want to do is I must say variable length length is a terrible variable but for now I will

121
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,120
say length equals four.

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,870
So that is just gonna run this.

123
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,510
But look we're not setting these variables when he thinks that this will work.

124
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,500
This will run.

125
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,570
What we're doing is we're saying to go to.

126
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,190
Okay.

127
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,060
Think of a four digit number.

128
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,510
And then we're not asking for it.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
So let's make this a variable.

130
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,920
Of course variable combination equals combination generator generate combination with the length of

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,690
four.

132
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,970
In other words gotto here's a new variable call combination and to get the value of that and would you

133
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,790
go to this script and run this function with this argument.

134
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,020
Think of a four digit number that's we're asking to do.

135
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,410
Now we need to set the combination in our number pad so let's get a number pad you see here we have

136
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,750
combination it is set to 0 for 5 1 we can leave as a default but I'm going to keep this as a blank so

137
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,180
I would say that and get back to my lock door and now we want to set that.

138
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:41,570
So let's make sure in the right scenes that auto completes locked door is the single to me back into

139
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,060
distraction free mode.

140
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,290
Okay.

141
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,330
So now we want to actually change the combination in the number pad so let's go.

142
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,550
No I've had do do do do you not.

143
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,100
Box contain that you're actually the number pad and I can see that by going back over here and there

144
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,280
it is a canvas layer at number pad and another pad has a value it has a value called combination and

145
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,110
that's going to be combination

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,600
OK.

147
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,860
Finally I want to know what that combination is so I can use it.

148
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,970
So for now I'm going to put this on the console and I want to print the combination.

149
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,340
But the combination is an array.

150
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,370
This is not a string print needs a string.

151
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,390
So let's make it a string in a cast that as a string and let's just separated out so I can see it nice

152
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,590
and easy.

153
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,980
Now if I've done this correctly come out of here so I can see the output.

154
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,830
Want to get into the game we have a four digit code 8 6 1 6.

155
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:43,200
If I go to the door open 8 6 1 6 door opens I can sneak past this light.

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,480
And there we go.

157
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,020
So we have a working door.

158
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,550
So now here's my challenge for you.

159
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,950
I would like you to change the script to generate an eight digit combination.

160
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,740
Now this isn't especially difficult but lets you see how familiar you are.

161
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,870
How comfortable are with it supports the video.

162
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,660
Give it a shot.

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,210
When you come back I'll show you my solution

164
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,440
and walk back.

165
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,220
OK well this is quite simple right.

166
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,320
For now we've got everything in this function.

167
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,810
Right now I've got legacies for put like this eight And look I never actually change this so let's put

168
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,910
this length.

169
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,740
So we have now generate combination of eight digits and I come out of here so I can see the output.

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,610
And here we go.

171
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,820
A nice simple eight digit combination.

172
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,810
0 4 8 4 3 7 8 1.

173
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,210
Goodness me that's annoying.

174
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,770
Let's not use too many of those.

175
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,460
But there we have it we have a nice locked door with an eight digit combination.

176
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,800
And that brings the end the video.

177
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,930
So in this video we looked at creating a combination object a script that's going to be auto loaded.

178
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,050
It's gonna be a singleton.

179
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,960
It can exist permanently in the background of a game no matter what seat we have loaded.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,780
We're gonna generate combinations ready for our computers and we've played with more.

181
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,020
So excellent luck and we'll see you in the next video.
