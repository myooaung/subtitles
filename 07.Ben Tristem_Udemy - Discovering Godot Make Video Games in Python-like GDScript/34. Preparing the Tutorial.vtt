00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.810
Hello again, you delightful guy to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.100
We're going to move our game forward a bit by creating a tutorial.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.370
We can make more and more levels, make them bigger and more complicated with longer combinations,

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.870
more gods and all the rest of it.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.380
But one thing we haven't looked at is how to teach the players how to play.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.250
So to do that, we're gonna make a tutorial level is a lot for the player to figure out.

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.060
Let's help them.

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.220
However, before we do that, let's figure out what the tutorial should be.

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.050
Now, the main thing I want with a tutorial is choice.

10
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.960
I want to choose when to use the tutorial.

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.720
I hate when I'm playing a game the second time, the third time I've played it before or I already know

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.290
how to play.

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.000
And it insists on making me walk through this material every time the first time you do it.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.010
That's not so bad.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.420
But if you revisit the game a year later or the scientists start your campaign over or whatever, it

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.900
might be having to go through the tutorial every time.

17
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.240
It's just it's awful.

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.420
It's one of my least favorite things about Skyrim, to be honest.

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.310
If you've played Skyrim, which is a really impressive game.

20
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.170
Like, I love that game.

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.760
If you play Skyrim your first, what, 19 hours, it feels like it's not 19 hours.

22
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.080
It's probably closer to ten minutes.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.500
Is sitting there having dialogue thrown at you in a cart.

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.110
Just let me play.

25
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.230
So we'll have optional tutorials.

26
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.690
This thing, we're going to teach the player how to do stuff.

27
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.030
There's a lot of things we could teach the player how to do.

28
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.410
I'm going to focus on the following movie interacting with things.

29
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.830
The fact you have to be within range of a thing and click on it, that's not going to be obvious.

30
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.560
How to use night vision key gameplay element.

31
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.950
We should teach the player how and when to do it, how to collect loot and why to collect loot.

32
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.780
You can only go through the exit once you have the loot.

33
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.000
So in this video, which is going to make the tutorial, lay things out and prepare the way to make

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.630
all that work.

35
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.900
So let's do that.

36
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.480
Let's get into it and go to new inherited sin and then inherit from our template level tallo template

37
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.780
level.

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.110
Let's call this tutorial.

39
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.490
The capital C. and save it as tutorial.

40
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.210
Awesome.

41
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.270
Now we've got everything we need in here to make a full level.

42
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.570
I'm just gonna make sure my vision mode is nice and dark because we need that.

43
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.450
And let's start making some spaces and we'll start in a big, well lit room.

44
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.160
So let's get ready you and let's draw out a nice big room.

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.850
That's interesting shape.

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.200
Could you do.

47
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.400
And that feel good starting.

48
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.680
I'm going to take my horizontals.

49
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.650
But Tom at Good Bucket Phil BOPE.

50
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.540
And act you paint tile.

51
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.010
I can also use PMG to do that.

52
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.380
OK, so the first thing on the plan to do is be in this nice, dark, nice, bright room surrounded

53
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.010
by darkness.

54
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.780
For that to work, I need a light source.

55
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.240
Can you light a tutorial back at the root a..

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.190
I want to add using control.

57
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.810
A new light 2D.

58
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.740
We've done this before.

59
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.060
And like you, he is going to need some kind of light map now under light maps of what he got open,

60
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.310
we do have the torch.

61
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.130
We could use that.

62
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.590
Let's pop vision my back on so we can see what that looks like and will want shadows enabled.

63
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.370
So it's an able shadow.

64
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.060
And you'll notice straight away the shadows are weird because the light map is being protected from

65
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.630
the center.

66
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.250
So we don't need an offset.

67
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.010
Now, this is a what is that a 600 wise?

68
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.600
I want to offset it by 300.

69
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.520
And now it's in a much better make Shoreman move and move it across the player.

70
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.560
Yeah, I'm pretty happy with that.

71
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.430
You know what?

72
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.290
I'm going to move it to this corner.

73
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.180
I would rotate it a bit.

74
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.350
And let's actually put it right on that corner.

75
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.910
Give that corner recent exist, sure, not inside the wall.

76
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.170
And I'm actually gonna duplicate that and move this one down to here.

77
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.090
And use E to rotate.

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.420
That's looking pretty good.

79
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.950
Now, we could make this big with scale, and that is probably a good idea.

80
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.570
Let's make this a bit bigger with scale.

81
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.760
So transform.

82
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.980
Let's do a scale of one point five in both directions.

83
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.700
Do the same thing with light 2d one to transform.

84
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.250
Scale one point five in each direction.

85
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.940
Why?

86
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.390
Because I want to hit this wall one out here, this wall.

87
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.740
Because that's where the door's going to be.

88
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.980
So we want to teach players, one, how to move around.

89
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.270
So just do the basic controls and then let's just get rid of light vision mode and hide my true light

90
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.780
moment and then we to lead them to this door.

91
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.460
Okay, so back to the tile map.

92
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.160
Let's make a little space of the door.

93
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.630
A little space.

94
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.440
The door.

95
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.150
And then your open up to the next room.

96
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.790
And that tells me we need a door.

97
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.090
Great.

98
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.860
Let's put the door in.

99
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.220
Well, we to have an organizing place for doors.

100
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.160
I'm going to go in to hear an instance in a door.

101
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.400
And let's move you into the right place.

102
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.980
Go transform and just rotated by 90 degrees, and that's looking almost line up, isn't it?

103
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.220
Let's just move you up a little bits.

104
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.490
Yeah, that's pretty good.

105
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.480
I like that.

106
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.710
Okay, let's see how that looks.

107
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.120
And remote with the lights back on, all the lights hitting the door just about.

108
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.410
Don't worry.

109
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.440
If they're not fully hitting the door, we are going to highlight it.

110
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.070
But I will move it slightly closer just so it's a little bit more visible.

111
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.000
We're going to have it slightly closer by having some areas.

112
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.970
A little vision market is going to pop up this coming up.

113
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.600
Future videos for now.

114
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.960
Let's get rid of our vision mode.

115
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.720
I say get rid of I mean, hide and hide both of our light sources, just like you often do.

116
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.070
OK, so moving doors now, night vision to teach the player how to use night vision.

117
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.130
I'm going to have a long, winding, dark Kadal greatness of a long winding Acardo back into Tiel map.

118
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.630
Draw this out in the walls.

119
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.140
Let's say I want to move up this way.

120
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.150
And then down here, you know what?

121
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.810
Let's make you a little more narrow.

122
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.390
Here we go.

123
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.720
How's that look?

124
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.550
This way, go this way.

125
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.990
Yeah, I think that's going to be nice and.

126
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.970
Missile slalom moment there.

127
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.500
And I think that's pretty good.

128
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.370
And here we can move down that way.

129
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.810
Great.

130
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.280
And you know what will fill this area and fill this area in play?

131
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.120
Probably won't see it.

132
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.720
But just for the look of it, that's looking fine.

133
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.980
And that's going to bring us into this room.

134
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:45.340
So let's move into a horizontal floor and move our vertical floors, rather, and put vertical floors

135
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.470
on this side of the door.

136
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.500
Just it looks like a different room.

137
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.000
And then I'm going to have a Tom map and bucket fill up and I filled it.

138
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.060
And now back to tile map and paint fill.

139
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.580
So I don't remove all the walls.

140
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.710
OK, so that's going to be our you have to you should really change vision most into this.

141
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.100
You know what?

142
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.930
Let's just make this even more so.

143
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.470
Great.

144
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.790
Let's see how that works.

145
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:15.530
I'm going to press this button here to run this scene and let's walk through hipping lights, have a

146
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.470
license, put the lights back on and on a press.

147
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.190
This place seen the price of Sextus pressie placing a button.

148
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.680
Okay, so a little bit too much light.

149
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.330
I could turn down the intensity of the light, but we can see the door.

150
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.080
But the door isn't casting shadows, weighing on casting shadows.

151
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.090
I bet I know why.

152
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.430
I'm going to open my door saying it's because I've hidden the lights.

153
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.730
Let's unhide that.

154
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.240
Save it and come again.

155
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.180
And the door now blocks light.

156
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.960
Let's take a look at that again.

157
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.820
Click here.

158
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.200
And the door now blocks light.

159
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.240
Darkness.

160
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.790
And that's looking pretty good.

161
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.050
OK.

162
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.950
If you'd noticed a quick jump in the footage there.

163
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.470
It's because Mike got a crash.

164
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.380
He edited out the crash.

165
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.790
But it's all I can now.

166
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.110
OK, so we've got this area and actually the little room to put my briefcase.

167
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.930
So let's make this a nice big open room with walls to try to do.

168
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.910
And the next room's gonna be the exit.

169
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.530
Now, I want to teach the player.

170
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.440
You should really have the briefcase before you do this.

171
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.930
So to do that, I am going to put the exit before the briefcase.

172
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.310
So the exit will be here.

173
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.330
The briefcase will be there.

174
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.130
And let's just.

175
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.060
Paint, all of that's.

176
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.780
I get a bucket fill.

177
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.420
OK.

178
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.700
There's my exit room.

179
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.790
There's a little doorway there.

180
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:37.870
And you know what?

181
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.180
Let's put a doorway here and here.

182
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.150
And yeah, it's looking pretty good.

183
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.320
All right.

184
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.180
So that's gonna be that area.

185
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.520
Now, let's bring in an exit.

186
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.480
So I'm going to go to my exit over here and I want to move that to, let's say, a year and we need

187
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.060
a briefcase.

188
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.090
So that's when we had the loot.

189
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.370
And I'm an instance in a briefcase.

190
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.790
And let's move that to over here.

191
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.220
And I feel pretty solid about that.

192
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:11.860
OK?

193
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.250
I wouldn't say I might do me a take.

194
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.010
Well, these lights and a controlled deed duplicate it and I move it.

195
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.320
Here, use E to rotate it just to look at the loot.

196
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.710
OK, so let's test this level again.

197
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.560
Did you do to do this through here?

198
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.930
Can't really see them doing and kind of can.

199
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.800
I can make that DOCA.

200
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.850
And yet that's all very nice as an exit.

201
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.990
I can't go through the exit.

202
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.260
I pick up the briefcase and I'm back stopped.

203
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.030
And that is actually Turrill level made out.

204
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.910
We can tweak it.

205
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.710
We can change it.

206
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.010
We could even go in and put some furniture in.

207
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.070
So that's going to furniture.

208
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.470
I would have gotten some potted plants.

209
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.660
That's good.

210
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.620
Maybe a little waiting room here.

211
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.410
You can play with this and make it as fancy as you like.

212
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.850
Give us some more potted plants around like potted plants and.

213
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:09.630
Yeah.

214
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.150
Let's put a little sofa in here so I can rotate with these buttons.

215
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.380
Boop.

216
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.380
And Mira.

217
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.830
So there we go.

218
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.250
There is my beginning tutorial level, and I'm quite happy with it.

219
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.110
So my challenge to you is to make your tutorial level.

220
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.280
Make sure there's a door.

221
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.250
A section for night vision, a briefcase and an exit.

222
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.070
I'm not going to ask you to pause the video because you've seen me do it.

223
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.390
But give that a shot.

224
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.740
And when you're ready, I'll see you in the next video.
