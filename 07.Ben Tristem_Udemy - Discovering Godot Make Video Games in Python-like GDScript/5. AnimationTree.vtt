00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.120
Hello again, you multifaceted go to people in this video, we don't look at the joys of the animation

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.410
tree now animation player in Godchaux is really quite powerful.

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.300
We can animate any property.

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.680
We can make position.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.010
We can animate color.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.940
We can animates this ability.

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.940
We can even bring in things like Kifri.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.920
Is Puzder the animation?

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.240
But what if we want to blend from one animation to another?

10
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.230
What we want to do is animate the p.c when it moves and have the p.c move from one animation to another

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.100
smoothly.

12
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.590
We don't want run, run, run, suddenly.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.010
Stop.

14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.150
We want run.

15
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.600
Run.

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.320
Slow down.

17
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.860
Stop.

18
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.490
Speed up.

19
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.920
Speed up.

20
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.270
Run.

21
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.280
To do that, we set up an animation tree.

22
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.620
So I'm a jumper to go.

23
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.200
I'm going to notice that this little person is sinking into the floor and raise them up.

24
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.210
It snap and just bring your feet up to the floor.

25
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.010
Much better.

26
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.740
OK, let's open the placing within the placing.

27
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.000
We want to go to the armature animation tree has to point to an animation.

28
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.490
Suddenly it's the root of the armature ad with control a animation tree.

29
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.030
I'm not going to use animation tree player because that's deprecated.

30
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.170
That's an older version.

31
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.700
Animation, trees, what we want.

32
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.270
And immediately we can see a couple of issues.

33
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.110
The first is it wants a tree root and the second is it wants an animation player.

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.280
Let's start with the animation player.

35
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.090
We need to assign it to this one.

36
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.330
It now knows what animations it has access to.

37
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.140
Now, the tree root, what kind of animation tree do we want?

38
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.250
There's a few things we do.

39
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260
We just have a simple you can play this animation.

40
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.330
We can have a blend space, which is a little bit complicated if what we're doing.

41
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.450
But it's all kinds of cool.

42
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.930
We can have a blend tree and we can even have a state machine.

43
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.410
We can program in a state machine as a visual node and we'll get here.

44
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.620
That's what we're doing.

45
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.070
We're doing a blend tree.

46
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.330
This is a visual representation of our animations.

47
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.600
Before we go any further, let's make it active.

48
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.590
And you notice that hasn't done anything, that's because he's our output and nothing's happening.

49
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.170
Let's add in an animation and a right click on the space click animation, given her name and another

50
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.920
person still film reel to pick the available animations, all of which are the ones inside the animation

51
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.130
plan.

52
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.050
Let's pick idle animal, drag the node to connect it.

53
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.010
And we have an idle animation.

54
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.960
OK, so so far, that's just an idle animation.

55
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.670
Let's bring in another animation, right clicking And I'm going to call this run and I'm a clip the

56
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.000
film.

57
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.580
I come and pick run.

58
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.160
Now, I can't drag this one in here because it's already something in there.

59
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.340
So instead, I'm gonna drag from output and just break that connection.

60
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.180
That's right.

61
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.860
Click here and add a blend, too, and I'll explain what that is.

62
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.150
The second blush dragon in and blende like.

63
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.530
So I connect that the output and then drag this slider.

64
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.450
So we don't hit.

65
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.700
OK, let's take a moment to talk about what's happening here.

66
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.520
I can right click and add a few different ones.

67
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.730
The ones we care about right now are these blend modes.

68
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.500
You can learn about the others by right.

69
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.840
Clicking and going to open documentation.

70
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.240
All right.

71
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.280
There's all kinds of fun things you can do here.

72
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.510
But for the purposes of our game, let's focus on what needs to happen.

73
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.860
So let's talk about animation, tree blend modes.

74
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.120
We have a blend to blend two takes animation zero and animation one.

75
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.710
From that we can slide between them.

76
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.110
Blend three is a little different.

77
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.890
Blend three has negative one zero and positive one.

78
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.860
And we can slide somewhere between those values.

79
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.290
What we can't do is have a blend between negative one and positive one that doesn't go through zero

80
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.300
or we have a blend four.

81
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.590
This is essentially to blend 2s added together.

82
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.300
Now, what I care about right now is a blend two.

83
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.960
So we have a blend two right here, which will work fine and I'm sure give us a space by pressing here

84
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.480
and move around a bit.

85
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.740
Now, there's some more animations I want to do.

86
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.520
We also want to be able to punch and to pick up.

87
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.650
So on there, bring those animations in over here.

88
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.890
Let's bring in an animation called Punch and Click Here.

89
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.390
It's like punch with my output over.

90
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.620
And another one down here, which is gonna be called pickup.

91
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.710
And that's going to be working.

92
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.790
Now, we are never going to have to punch or fire and pick up the same time, I'm using the punch animation

93
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.840
as a firing animation.

94
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.890
So what I'm going to do is I'm a break this connection and we'll make a blend.

95
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.400
Three.

96
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.610
Remember, I will never be able to pick up and fire at the same time, so I'm going to bring this as

97
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.540
my negative blend.

98
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.810
This is my positive blend and this is my in them.

99
00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.620
And I connect here and I look at the screen again where Karmi an idol, I can move this anywhere in

100
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.540
there and that's what's gonna be going into the node.

101
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.940
Then I can move like that.

102
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.300
And you see how there is a halfway point between these, right.

103
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.980
So we can we can slowly move between them.

104
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.330
That's what we care about.

105
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.870
All of these parameters can be accessed in code.

106
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.250
And to do that, we need to know these parameters.

107
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.110
As we make more BLENDE nodes, they'll come in here and we can see the properties and like a mouse over

108
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.970
them and see parameter blende three BLENDE amount or blend to blend three terrible names.

109
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.730
I want to rename them Move.

110
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.110
And action state.

111
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.760
Yeah, I guess this is kind of a mini state cabinet.

112
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.870
Zoom out a little bit sexy.

113
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.240
I'm doing.

114
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.080
We now have a very simple animation tree that's gonna work well for our game.

115
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.730
All of a possible animation.

116
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:57.530
States are in there and we can speed up, slow down, run along and then move down to pick things up,

117
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.210
shoot and so on.

118
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.760
So all of that's going to work nicely for me.

119
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.320
There's a lot more we can do here.

120
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.020
For instance, we could speed up this fiery animation with a time scale.

121
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.290
And if I just zoom in a bit second here, I'm doing I could bring that into here.

122
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.090
Speed it up by factor to bring it out.

123
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.790
But this is different how we always tweak it later.

124
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.960
So let's save that.

125
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.800
I come out of here and we need all character templates, we go from player to its parent scene over

126
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.930
here.

127
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.290
I've just realized I've left that in the wrong state.

128
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.610
So let's head back in animation tree and just move you to zero and two zero.

129
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.120
Great idol is our Idol animation.

130
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.440
Let's leave the character in Idol, OK?

131
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.170
We have our character here.

132
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.370
I was wrong.

133
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.310
We don't need a character.

134
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.130
When I do, this, NPC is what happens to play.

135
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.500
So here's our player script.

136
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.060
We each control these animations in script.

137
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.600
So let's begin by jumping in here.

138
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.480
I'm going to make a brand new function called Animate and Animate is going to figure out when it needs

139
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.320
to do things.

140
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:10.110
So let's jump all the way down and make a function called animate and give ourselves lots of room.

141
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.630
Awesome.

142
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.810
OK, wiggly running animate every physics.

143
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.410
But there's information I want to hold between frames.

144
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.740
Right.

145
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.480
We need to move from one animation to another.

146
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.560
I need to know where we are.

147
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.850
Which means I want some instance variables, specifically all variables and constants.

148
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.780
I need a brand new variable.

149
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.140
Hello.

150
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.750
Cat is Kathy's coming to join us.

151
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.390
And I'm gonna call this movement state and that's going be set to zero.

152
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.200
So what's this?

153
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.100
This is how far along are we between Idol and Move?

154
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.600
So we still make a quick note.

155
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.370
Idol is zero.

156
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.720
Run is one.

157
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.490
OK.

158
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.510
We also want some some constants.

159
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.680
I'm gonna make a constant in capitals called minimum blende speed, and I'm gonna make this at zero

160
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.790
point one to five.

161
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.310
This is going to be what's our minimum movement speed before we start blending.

162
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:13.330
So minimum movement threshold before we start blending animations.

163
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.660
All right.

164
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.660
Two more things I need.

165
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.490
I need the speed of which we moved to the right animation and the speed at which we move the island

166
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:21.730
nation.

167
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.920
These are constants and it's a blend to run.

168
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.370
I feel like we should speed up pretty slowly.

169
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.840
We can tweak these.

170
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:37.990
But from my experience, I think zero point zero seven five is a good number and we need a constant

171
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.930
for BLENDE to idle.

172
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.210
And let's put that zero points one just to see what it looks like.

173
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.130
Okay, back down to animation.

174
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:48.730
Okay.

175
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.420
First thing to do.

176
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.520
Should we be idle or should we be moving?

177
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.630
So to do this.

178
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.190
For the moment, I'm going to use motion times.

179
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.370
Speed dot link.

180
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.160
Now I have to multiply those by speed because our motion is between zero and one.

181
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.560
Right.

182
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.150
That's just.

183
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.680
Are we moving in these directions?

184
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.140
So multiply my speed is going to give us our actual speed.

185
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.470
So if motion high speed dot length.

186
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.420
So the length of that vector.

187
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:23.650
How far have we travelled in any possible direction in this frame is greater than min blend speed.

188
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:31.480
If so, then movement state is going to add blende to run.

189
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.650
OK, so we'll start at zero and every frame, we're gonna add zero point zero seven five.

190
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.390
Otherwise.

191
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:53.430
The movement state is going to subtract, lend to idle loops, not negative one blend to idle.

192
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.060
Now, clearly, we need to stay between zero one.

193
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.660
We're getting some really odd effect.

194
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.310
So let's say a movement state is equal to the clamped value of movement states.

195
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.660
Between zero and one.

196
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.280
OK.

197
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.430
So far, so good.

198
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.720
Now let's actually use this.

199
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:21.080
So we need a new variable, which is gonna be called animation, and that's going to be our animation

200
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.290
tree.

201
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.630
So let's go get our animation tree.

202
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.010
And now we need to set the animation to do this.

203
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.530
We're gonna call the animation tree like so.

204
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.860
And then we're going to use the parameter, which is going to come many square brackets as if it was

205
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.460
an array.

206
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.260
So let's bring that up and let's open the armature so we can see what we're doing.

207
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.700
And remind ourselves that we want the move one and we're going to use this blend amount.

208
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.290
So we want parameters.

209
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.220
Move.

210
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.990
Blend them out.

211
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.570
Now, unfortunate.

212
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.740
Copy paste that.

213
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.100
But it's going to look back into my script here.

214
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.390
Let's just go.

215
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.060
It's going to look like this.

216
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.880
I need to use it as a string parameters.

217
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.140
Move.

218
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.720
Blend.

219
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.760
Amount.

220
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.950
And that is going to equal the movement state.

221
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.920
Let's just double check, I've got that right to come out of here.

222
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.810
We know we don't need the animation tree.

223
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.640
We don't need any of this windows.

224
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.270
Just bring it down so it's normal size and close it.

225
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:29.690
There we go.

226
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.620
Mouse over it and see that we have this right parameters.

227
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.930
Move the capital m blend amount.

228
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.690
That's looking good.

229
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:38.540
All right.

230
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.690
Now, if you've done this correctly, we can jump into the game.

231
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.810
And look at that.

232
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.340
Now, I have noticed we're facing the wrong direction.

233
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.350
Let's quickly fix that before we go any further.

234
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.720
So face forward.

235
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.000
I've got pie divided by two.

236
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.150
I think I should in pie multiply by two, don't I?

237
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.950
Let's take a quick look.

238
00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.600
This.

239
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.190
You see that very subtle thing.

240
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.030
We can make sure we can notice that by, let's say, footedness, zero point zero one and zero point

241
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.760
fellas put zero point zero zero one.

242
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.590
This is way too low for what we need.

243
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.490
But.

244
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.490
You see how he's very slowly picking up speed.

245
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.770
Clearly way too slow.

246
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.230
What we need.

247
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.020
So let's bring those back to where they were.

248
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.560
Let's put you at zero point zero one to see what that looks like and build some speed.

249
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.160
It's Casca to me, artists.

250
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.470
You see that, so he stops.

251
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.760
He slowly blends down.

252
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.080
Now, that's too slow.

253
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.940
But zero point one feels pretty good.

254
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.380
Or if you prefer, zero point zero five.

255
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.740
You can change these between scenes, but they're constants, which means we're not changing the runtime.

256
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.190
And that is our animation tree.

257
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.020
Now, when we add in more facts and we change how the movement and camera works, we're going to have

258
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.480
to tweak exactly how this function works.

259
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.980
But this is the way.

260
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.790
These are the basics.

261
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.630
This is not the basics.

262
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.890
This is the basic idea.

263
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.000
These are the basics.

264
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.770
And I think that's a really good place to stop.

265
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.180
So excellent work.

266
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.530
And I'll see you in the next video.
