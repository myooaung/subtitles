00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,690
Hello again wonderful God to people on welcome to part three of the locked door in this video going

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,790
to make the door actually open and add some polish to a number pad.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,680
I'm a Polish I mean let's get some sound effects let's make it more.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,300
I don't know.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,320
Realistic not realistic but more exciting.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,520
Let's make it more exciting.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,150
So what are we doing.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,950
Well first thing we'll make in a locked door open if it doesn't open it's not a locked door.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,240
It's a fancy wall.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,810
Second thing putting some folks go.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,920
Start with going into God.

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,330
An opening a lot.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,220
Dorsey right now the combination is being held in the number pad.

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,340
And I kind of want to move it for locked door.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,030
The reason for this is Later the combination is actually not going to be home with the locked courts

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,720
can be randomly generated that random generated code is going to be stored on a computer that the CD

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,160
player can read.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,520
That computer is going to send a signal with that combination to all locked doors connected to it because

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,940
multiple locked doors can open the same room.

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:06,030
Right so if I show a level one if we have a locked door for this area right here one two three four

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,760
five I could feasibly have all of these doors have the same combination which would make sense maybe

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,090
not this one but you get my point for that to happen.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,520
I want the combination to be stored on a computer and transmitted down to all those doors.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,950
It's going to be easier to transmit that signal to the locked door route node than it is to the number

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,850
pad.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,530
Let's go into the script and I'm going to put a variable in here called combination.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,100
And that's an array of four common one common five so the integers for one five as an array is combination.

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,000
Now a number pad are probably only navigation to audio.

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,240
And let's close that script number pad.

30
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,460
Let's set combination is an empty array.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm going to save that.

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,910
Let's also close the outputs so you can have a bit more screen space and let's make a brand new ready

33
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,040
function.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,680
Auto complete is not playing so I just type it properly underscore already and unschool ready is going

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,020
to get the number pad dot combination and set it to this combination.

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,650
Great.

37
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,750
Let's see if that works and if it does one expecting as I go up I'll type in for one five.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,820
The light will turn green and a second later the panel disappear.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,340
We haven't opened a door here.

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,650
So walk up to the security panel or the locked door type in the combination.

41
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,620
Awesome.

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,370
Let's go to open the door.

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,740
Well I'd like to do is put in a brand new signal some back and number pad and let's make this nice and

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,460
big.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,590
And I'm gonna put a signature under the variables signal and I'm going to call this combination.

46
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,970
Correct.

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,420
All right.

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,900
So when we checked the guess if the guess is right the light goes green the timer starts I need to put

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,850
this when the timer stops.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,960
So just before you press hide let's emit the signal combination correct.

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,010
Save that and back into two devian and out a full screen mode.

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,850
Let's connect it so inode you'll see this with the brand new signal just made combination correct us

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,250
connect that to lock.

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,830
Door to a brand new method.

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,310
And this brandnew method in a locked door g-day function on no pad combination correct.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,110
All I do is call open.

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,130
Now I could have just connected it to the open function.

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,420
I don't really want to do that because it's theoretically possible we might want other things to happen.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,570
So instead let's make this one nice and readable and two nice and open for expansion.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,440
I now can see by looking at script when the number pad combinations correct the door open.

61
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,000
You might have noticed by the way I'm doing two different things here on the ready function.

62
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,530
I am changing the variable of a child node directly but I'm not doing the same thing in the direction.

63
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm not running the open function directly from the child node.

64
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,360
Why is that.

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,280
It's kind of a personal preference thing.

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,810
What I'm thinking is I'm okay with accessing a function or a variable of a child node.

67
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,680
It's within the same hierarchy some.

68
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm all right doing that.

69
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm not as okay going in the other direction.

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,580
I don't want child knows to access functions and change variables of apparent code.

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,710
And I certainly don't want nodes being able to do that out elsewhere in the scenery.

72
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,950
So I'm trying to maintain some sort of hierarchy.

73
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,440
Alright so now we should have a door that will open.

74
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm sure that the guard go through because if the guard opens the door it can be hard to tell of where

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,580
opening at.

76
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,450
To the coalition for one five.

77
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,540
And the door opens.

78
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,780
Fantastic.

79
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,230
This is nearly done.

80
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,130
One more thing I would like to do is I'd like to put some sound effects and let's go into the number

81
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,550
pad scene and I'm doing the number of that scene because if I put an audio stream player here that's

82
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,710
going to be in this instance not an all normal pads if I ever want to reuse the number pad.

83
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,640
It should be here.

84
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,540
And let's minimize all of these things.

85
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:34,350
What we have to do is when I add an audio string player not as 2D not a 3D but just a basic audio stream

86
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,330
player as a child for another iPad.

87
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,590
Why audio stream player not 2D 3-d.

88
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,110
Because I don't want positional information.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,080
This is happening in the Gooly not in the world of see what I mean.

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,180
So I don't want it to be loud on the left there on the right depending where we are.

91
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,720
If you're going to sound effects you'll find that we have three tone one and three and two turn one

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,990
and we can play those.

93
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,500
Let's put one in drag three turn one in and I can see what that sounds like.

94
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,060
That sounds like it's correct and two tone one.

95
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,370
That's going be my buttons out clear that for now.

96
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,560
Let's do a couple of things first.

97
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,570
First must let one of these get to import and just make sure loop is off.

98
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,250
So reimport it would loop off and do the same with two tongue one.

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,860
Otherwise the sound will never finish.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,170
Second I need to make sure my audio string player doesn't have playing great from here.

101
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,360
I'd like to hand it over to you.

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,440
I'd like you to add a sound effect for the button being pushed and another for the combination being

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,340
correct.

104
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,440
Now don't worry about putting these in the global g.d. Reps.

105
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,270
And I'm saying that because we're not going to use these sounds anywhere else putting them in the global

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,200
g.d. script is just an extra step.

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,420
And remember we using all year string player not to do your 3-d because we don't want positional sound

108
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,890
to pause the video.

109
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,510
Put those two sound effects in and when you're ready and pause it noshir my solution.

110
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,060
And welcome back.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,930
OK so we have two sound effects and audio string player can only play one so we could make a second

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,340
audio string player right.

113
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,550
I could just duplicate this and give them a different name.

114
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,370
I don't really want to do that mostly because I don't want to have a play at the same time but also

115
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,360
eskies going to make it harder to manage.

116
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,680
If we want to adjust the volume I want to just have just the one for one so that is a way forward.

117
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,500
It's not the one that's calling me the Summerset this script.

118
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,740
So whenever the enter function is called I'm going to make sure that we're playing the right sound effect

119
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,180
by bringing up audio stream player and who got stream.

120
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,190
Maybe you could find that property by just mousing other string.

121
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,740
There is probably stream unless set it.

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm going to set it to two tone one because that's the sound effect.

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,900
I said sounded like but being on a copy that path now this is a string and I can't load a string.

124
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I have to load an object of files on a load and cast the string as a file object.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,590
Now I have to actually play it so let's put that right underneath audio stream player.

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,260
Play awesome.

127
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,710
The second thing to do is I want to get the sound effect of that's the correct combination happening

128
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,280
when it is.

129
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,320
Now I could put it right here on time to start but I was going to have as you know and buttons.

130
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Nothing's going to happen for a second and then it's going to work.

131
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,890
I'd much rather put it right here.

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:35,980
The light turns green so if the combination is correct audio stream player stream equals load and then

133
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,940
this 3 tone one path's us copy that.

134
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,010
And pasted in.

135
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:49,230
I make sure she play the sound of that play and that should be good to get Let's find out.

136
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,020
Let's go in to slightly modes.

137
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,960
Can she see this at the Gulf first guy guard.

138
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,090
Alright.

139
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,320
Awesome.

140
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,670
Now you will notice that what's happening is is going correct.

141
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,530
The moment I type in the last digit I'm okay with that.

142
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,910
If you're not you might want to move this play here too.

143
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,490
When the timer does the time out all put a second time and something like that.

144
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,470
However I quite like that feel.

145
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,010
Which brings us to the end of this video.

146
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,880
In this video we finished lock doors and no pads.

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,870
They are good to go.

148
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,130
We've got some more things to happen with combination's computers but the locked doors no prison cells

149
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,390
are fully functional.

150
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,120
You could if you wanted even add extra buttons for action numbers so you could see a 1 2 2 2 2 3 and

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,390
