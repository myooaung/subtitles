00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.550
Welcome back lovely gotto people in this video.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.940
We're going to improve the functionality of our story.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.900
We've got it at a pretty good stage right.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.680
We can take input from the player insert those into a story and display the story the player and then

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.490
restart the game.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.550
But what we can't do at the moment is have a bunch of stories without some very messy code.

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.070
So in this video we're going to start using a template and to do that we're gonna use dictionaries.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.340
Dictionaries are awesome.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.460
Let's have a quick look at what a dictionary is before we go any further.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.200
So I've talked a bit about what a variable is right.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.380
And I'm going to use Ben's image of a variable as a box that can have any kind of value in it.

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.030
Some a string some afloat some integer some are billions as a whole bunch different these can be.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.970
And we've looked at an array now an array is actually a special kind.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.200
It's supposed to be in a row a special kind of variable.

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.930
And in this case it's helpful to think of it as a shelf it's a shelf on which we can put a whole bunch

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.150
of boxes in each box.

17
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.790
Very good box strikes.

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.930
Each box has a position and we can find them my positions have I changed this to a nice red color.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.000
This is Position ZERO position one this position 2.

20
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.020
And each one those box can be any type of variable we want

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.290
so far so good.

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.900
So a dictionary is very much like an array with a couple of key points in a dictionary.

23
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.810
We have to do.

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.390
A key is a beautiful key plus a value what I mean by that I mean the everything within dictionary is

25
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.620
going to have some kind of key and all keys must be unique.

26
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.270
A colon and then a value the unique key and once again must be unique can be anything.

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.230
It could be a string.

28
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.280
It can be another variable.

29
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.550
It can be all kinds of stuff.

30
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.370
And the value is exactly as it would be in the array.

31
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.800
So whereas we'll be Position ZERO here will do key Mongoose because the key can be anything right we

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:20.170
could call this Mongoose donkey Ben likes donkeys too can and unless these things are actually defined

33
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.110
in the script they'll probably be strings like that.

34
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.290
So I could say to the dictionary go to a donkey which is the key and tell me what's in there.

35
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.950
And here are values note that dictionaries aren't sorted.

36
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.730
So in array I'll say to it go to position three.

37
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.110
The dictionary doesn't keep track of what's in what position.

38
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.580
It only looks at things by key.

39
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.990
Okay.

40
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.260
Now I've told you that's pretty awesome and so far just sounds like extra complexity.

41
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.730
What's a good use case of this.

42
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.330
Well let's imagine that we're making a survival RPG and we have this lovely inventory system right.

43
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.580
It's a nice drag and drop grid based system.

44
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:10.400
And we've told it that this is Position ZERO position one position two and so on with in our inventory

45
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.330
and inside the inventory we have a pickaxe a hatchet a sword.

46
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.060
I mean these are like classic tropes within survival games right.

47
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.580
And what I can do is I can say okay when the player put something in here adds that value to key zero

48
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.840
add this value to key 1 0 the player has press 0.

49
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.370
Tell me what's in key 0 0 it's the pickaxe.

50
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.600
Give the player the pickaxe.

51
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.230
Right.

52
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.730
This is a really good way of dealing with things like inventory management not just inventory management

53
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.770
all kinds of other things you could do but this is a good use case.

54
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.810
I love dictionaries.

55
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.930
They're incredibly fun.

56
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.270
Okay.

57
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.490
But how's it going to help us in our game.

58
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.170
Well I'm very glad you asked that question and if you didn't I'm gonna pretend you asked it.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.610
It's cool.

60
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.440
So we're going to make a variable this test variables called my dictionary and we're going to define

61
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.540
it by putting curly brackets around it.

62
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.790
And if you're coming from a language a C based language like C++ C sharp and you've been going Dude

63
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.900
where are my curly brackets.

64
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.880
It's ok dude they're right here.

65
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.320
We're going to define a dictionary with curly brackets.

66
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.200
Now if we had an array would have value one value too.

67
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.440
If we have a dictionary we're gonna have key value key value.

68
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.530
Awesome.

69
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.520
But this doesn't explain why this is useful to us.

70
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.500
Well what if we don't call it my dictionary what if we call it current story and what if we don't call

71
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.510
it ki and ki.

72
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.470
What if we call it prompt which is going to have an array of strings and story which can have a string.

73
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.890
Because remember I said this value could be any variable.

74
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.780
And remember I said an array is technically a variable.

75
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.840
We can have a dictionary with an array as one of its values.

76
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.400
And that is going to make this really awesome.

77
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.890
Well let's take a look at why and get a script.

78
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.190
So here we are back in Looney lips and I'm going to go into distraction free mode.

79
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.710
And the first thing to do is make a new variable and I call it current story okay so what's current

80
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.010
story.

81
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.380
Let's define it as a dictionary.

82
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.130
And the first key is going to be prompts.

83
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.420
Why am I putting it like this.

84
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.170
Let's just put it give it key.

85
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.550
Why am I putting words in quotation marks.

86
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.300
Because in a moment I'm going to remove this completely and if I don't have this in quotation marks

87
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.620
it's going to look for a variable called prompts and there isn't one.

88
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.070
So

89
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.160
this is clearly not going to be a zero.

90
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.500
It's going to be this array.

91
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm just going to copy this array and I'm going to get rid of one for good by line for.

92
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.610
So right now I have a current story which is a dictionary with a single value in it.

93
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.460
It has a key separated by colon and then the value the value happens to be an array.

94
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.930
One thing I am going to do is I'm going to put this on the next line.

95
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.520
The curly brackets within a dictionary we can do this when the convention in gotto is if we are continuing

96
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.700
a single line of code onto the next line for readability we're going to tap twice by the way.

97
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.430
It's saying here prompts is not declared in the current scope.

98
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.910
Don't worry we're about to fix that.

99
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.050
OK.

100
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.750
I need my next entry in this dictionary so I will put a comma.

101
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.610
Go down the next line and two more tabs.

102
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.220
And this is going to be a story.

103
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.170
No it's going to be story.

104
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.030
There we go.

105
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.930
And I'm going to copy this entire string.

106
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.500
So if I going to cut it and now I can go back up to the top of the line get rid of this variable completely

107
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.920
OK.

108
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.900
So what I've just done is I've just moved both of these variables in to current story.

109
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.060
We no longer need them as variables so they're gone.

110
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.830
And instead I have a string called prompts as a key and a string called story as a case of the beginning

111
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.630
of our template system.

112
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.740
Awesome.

113
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.040
You know what.

114
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.620
Let's make this even more legible and put it like that.

115
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.290
Okay cool.

116
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.890
Now I can take a look at this and see insulate.

117
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.570
These are the prompts.

118
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.010
This is the story.

119
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.400
Well let's fix this.

120
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.030
Thirty nine identify prompts is not declared in the current scope scroll down to thirty nine.

121
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.140
Now luckily three point one is doing this error checking beforehand.

122
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.190
Early versions have gone up didn't you didn't error check until runtime which got a little annoying.

123
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.160
So what's happening here.

124
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.410
Well I've got prompts being called but there is no longer verbal prompts instead.

125
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.160
It's a key within current story so let's call current story dot prompts.

126
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.460
This means look at the key called prompts within current story and specifically look at the key and

127
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.690
count size.

128
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:47.260
Now I've got line 50 and I click on it current story dot story and the next one is right here.

129
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:55.680
So may I have current story dot prompts and that should be all of them.

130
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.490
This is good because it means I don't have to mess around with find and replace I don't have to go through

131
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.720
the manually and check all them.

132
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.610
The Eriko comes here.

133
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.800
I can just click on the read words and it'll jump to that line.

134
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.740
Let's check this works.

135
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.840
Welcome to looney lips we're going to tell a story.

136
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.560
Have a wonderful time.

137
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.700
May I have a name please

138
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.650
name.

139
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.700
May I have a noun mouse.

140
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.130
May I have an adverb squeaky.

141
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.010
There's a mouse finger puppet on my desk.

142
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.130
That's why I'm thinking this.

143
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.380
Don't look at me like that.

144
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.600
I teach kids.

145
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.310
May I have an adjective loud.

146
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.840
Once upon a time someone called Name a mouse flavored sandwich which made him feel squeaky inside.

147
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.280
It was allowed day.

148
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.760
Actually that story kind of works isn't it.

149
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.850
I can press the button and it all works.

150
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.080
So we have the same functionality.

151
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.400
OK so the moment we have a single story and we've just moved both variables to a single place and a

152
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.120
nice and neat.

153
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.830
But I want to make this expandable.

154
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.500
I want a variable called template that I want to rename current story to template.

155
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.650
And let's make a new variable called current story so that it doesn't complain.

156
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.970
You're calling current story it doesn't exist.

157
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.720
Okay now template can't be a single dictionary.

158
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.980
Right.

159
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.340
Because we can't just because each key is going to have to be unique.

160
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.420
I can't have multiple keys call prompts.

161
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.630
So somehow I need a way of having multiple dictionaries in here and I know how to do that because I

162
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.420
can make an array of dictionaries.

163
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.350
So now

164
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.490
I can do this.

165
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:34.680
And between each story I can press comma and add in a new series of keys.

166
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:43.140
Right so I'm going to make a new dictionary right here and in it I'm gonna put prompts and make a new

167
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.310
story with new prompts.

168
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.220
So this is my challenge to you.

169
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:52.650
I'd like you to add at least one you story to the Template post a video at least one more story prompts

170
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.370
and story.

171
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.910
And remember you can do this another ordeal to the story first and then the prompts all the way around.

172
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.780
Doesn't matter.

173
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.270
It's not an ordered list.

174
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.740
It's picked by key pause video.

175
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.410
Give it a shot.

176
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.200
Then when you come back I'll show you my solution

177
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.900
and welcome back.

178
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.220
OK.

179
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.780
So I said we can do this in either order.

180
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.970
I will do the story first because easier.

181
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:18.420
Why can't I write the word story and keep it nice and neat move spaces there.

182
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:35.240
And I'm going to move right there once was loose there once was a noun called name who searched far

183
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:43.430
and wide for the mythical adjective noun of name.

184
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.980
I've been listening to mythos and heroes by Stephen Fry So I mean a Greek myth kind of view.

185
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.210
So let's make a myth and this is going to be prompts.

186
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.480
And let's go through this.

187
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:05.540
There once was a noun so going to copy you and then replace you with percentage s and put an array of

188
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:14.610
strings a noun called and so sort of fast forward this.

189
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.590
Okay that should do it.

190
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:16.430
So let's just double check.

191
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:24.350
I've got everything so I've got a key Cold story that has one two three four strings and I've got prompts

192
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.340
one two three four.

193
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.360
Fantastic.

194
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.830
I've separated the two entries in my fiction with a comma and I've closed off the array.

195
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.220
Awesome.

196
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.600
So now we have two stories.

197
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.200
Well I actually have more than two stories because I've created a bunch of others so I'm going to fast

198
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.190
forward and bring them in.

199
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:51.070
And here we are we have one two three four five six seven eight different stories that's quite a lot

200
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.680
and it takes up a lot of room so what we do is a little down arrow the arrow.

201
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.230
Now there's little down arrow next to template a click that is going to collapse.

202
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.900
See how we get from one to five.

203
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.690
So we get from line five to 39.

204
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.160
Right.

205
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.390
I can expand that again.

206
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.060
We are going to move all these out of the script in later video right.

207
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.270
This is a lot of data that doesn't really need to be in the script later going to separate them.

208
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.350
But at the what for now.

209
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:14.830
OK.

210
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.760
So I have a template but I'm still looking for current story.

211
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.970
What we need to do is pick a random story from the template.

212
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.540
So how do we do that.

213
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.400
Well the first thing we need to do is figure out how to set the current story.

214
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.000
If you know let's make a function to do just that.

215
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:43.450
So let's call this pick current story and I put that right here.

216
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:54.200
So function pick a current story and I'm going to define what current stories are current story equals.

217
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.930
It's gone recently from template right and template is an array with dictionaries inside it.

218
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:06.550
So I need to pick one of those dictionaries while I know how to pick a certain attribute from this.

219
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.980
But I don't know which one to pick.

220
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:15.060
And it turns out I need to use random integer and if I hold control I'm fresh random integer.

221
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.650
We can see the returns a Random 32 integer yada yada yada.

222
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:25.850
OK so what we're gonna do is when we use random integer modulate by and then the number we want to set

223
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.950
is the maximum.

224
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.090
Note by the way we're going to start at zero.

225
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.350
So if I say random integer modulate 20 it's going to go from zero to 19.

226
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.320
If I want between 1 and 20 I have to modulate by 20 plus 1.

227
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.680
Okay so I've got random integer modulate by what am I modulating by the size of the template set template

228
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.370
dot size.

229
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:53.890
Now currently there are how many stories one two three four five six seven eight stories and it's going

230
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.120
to count those but subtract one.

231
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.050
Well that's good because I'm gonna be counting by position.

232
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.040
This is not position one that's a position zero so actually random is going to do exactly what I wanted

233
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.390
to do in this case.

234
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.310
Except it's not actually going to pick anything random.

235
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.880
Why not.

236
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.000
Because of the way computers deal with random numbers you see computers are very bad at random.

237
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.450
Humans are very bad a random too.

238
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.680
But computers are very bad at random because they don't know how to do that.

239
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.700
Well computers normally do is look at what's the current time and date and generate something from that.

240
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:35.170
Now in order to get it to actually randomize or be as close to random as possible we need to use the

241
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:43.270
randomize function randomize is built into gotto and what this does is pick a random number and you

242
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.710
might be thinking well why do I need to do this.

243
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.040
Isn't this like rolling dice kind of just roll them.

244
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.060
And the answer is No it's not actually like rolling dice is like shuffling cards you see when I say

245
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:58.870
random integer what I'm doing is I'm saying pick the top card randomize tells it to shuffle.

246
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.260
Every time I wanted to reshuffle I need to redo randomize.

247
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:08.740
I can also give it to seed and say put the cards in this order but we don't need to do that.

248
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.390
OK.

249
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.620
Before we test this out quick thing pick current story isn't quite right is actually set current story

250
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.430
or pick random story one of the suits call it second story and when I press play I'm going to get an

251
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:21.880
arrow.

252
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.200
What's Arabi guessing.

253
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.900
There's no such thing called prompts.

254
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.100
I know what I've done.

255
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.840
OK I'm going to have my template.

256
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.270
One of my stories has prompts two of my stories as prompts.

257
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.650
I watch them have a prompt because I got silly.

258
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.300
I was going to call these old prompts one more time to let me lips we're going to tell a story.

259
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.960
Have a wonderful time may I have a thing please.

260
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.850
Cow may I have a name.

261
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.170
Bertie a description word an adjective please.

262
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:58.500
Cute thing an earring.

263
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.720
There was a calico called Bertie that lived as cute as an earring.

264
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.780
Look at that.

265
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.560
And now for us again we're going to have a person's name.

266
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.250
This could be banned.

267
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.090
Name a place Ben's house.

268
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.770
A plural of a noun.

269
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.580
Donkeys he likes donkeys as nice but donkeys doesn't matter.

270
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:21.110
An adverb of wondering A why has it tensely.

271
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.540
And now the hippopotamus hippo.

272
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.620
Not spelling hippopotamus did then I hope this letter finds you well.

273
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.610
I've spent the past three weeks in Ben's house reach in the history of donkeys for my new book.

274
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.490
I miss you hesitantly and whenever I see a hippo I think of you.

275
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.180
Look at that.

276
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.490
That's looking amazing.

277
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:43.120
And just to make that it bigger we have a fully scalable game now this template needs to be neater because

278
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.690
that's 30 odd lines of code that really don't need to be in the script.

279
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.390
We're going to make that work later but we have a pretty close to complete game.

280
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.950
Which brings us to the end of this video.

281
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.870
In this video we've looked at the awesome power of dictionaries.

282
00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:03.040
We've looked at how we can nest arrays and dictionaries into each other and how to generate random integers.

283
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.720
So did you come up with any cool stories.

284
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.070
Would you like to share them.

285
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.470
Please do go onto the to the discord onto the forums or the Q and A on the Facebook group and share

286
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.800
any cool story templates you've made.

287
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.540
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
