00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,420
Hello again, you astounding go to people in this video, we're going to start adding some actual functional

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,970
goals.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,440
We have the goals for right now, the ball go in and nothing will happen.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,520
Let's change that.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,460
We're going to do is just set up something very simple over in our goal, seen so close.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,630
All these are open for the previous video and open my two to two as my goals has my goals in the goals

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,090
just opened.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,600
Go one.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:29,890
Okay.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,360
So here is a goal.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,170
Great.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,880
I need to detect if the ball is crossing this line and to do that.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,260
I'm just going to use an area note.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,700
Now we've played with areas before.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,590
There are some similarities, at least on the surface, between an area and a physical body.

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,530
Specifically, they both use collision shapes.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,990
So going to give this a collision shape.

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,020
And this only a simple box shaped, and we can play with that a second.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,670
The central difference is that a physics body needs a collision shape to know how the physics gonna

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,000
work.

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,450
An area needs a physics collision shape to know when a physics body has entered so that it can do something

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,660
right.

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,360
So when to send a signal, I want to rename this area to gold detector.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,090
And before I forget, because I almost got a collision and it can only.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,250
It is not part of the level, but it can only interact with the ball.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,720
Nothing else matters.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,310
And now we have that song stuck in my head.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,620
And this wants to be up a little bit, doesn't it?

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,170
In fact, I'm not gonna my boldness.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,210
Let's move this up like point five.

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,770
I think that's right.

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,310
You know, that's about the central goal, isn't it's a one metre high goal.

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,200
OK, so excellence.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,300
Let's go to my commissionership.

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,890
And my stance on the zeds, the blue line is going to be point one.

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,480
And on the X, it's going to be two, not bad.

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,330
Now the line does go underneath.

38
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,900
That's not the end of the world economy detectable anyway.

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,460
There is a little bit of gap at the top.

40
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,750
Again, not the edge of the world.

41
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,990
Everything else looks good.

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,980
However, I've just noticed if it hits the actual post, that will be a problem.

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,300
You know what?

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,790
It's a one point eight.

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,980
And let's actually bring it down to a point zero five.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,010
So if it hits the post, that's not going to count as a goal.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
But if it crosses that line, it will.

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,510
OK.

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,660
So we now have a simple goal.

50
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,440
This is going to have a signal.

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,340
Now, what about the signal in the levels?

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,550
So both of these are going to connect.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,990
Both go one and go two.

54
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,610
In fact, you know what?

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to make gold one and Edsel as well.

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,110
And what I want to do is put a script for it to connect you.

57
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,130
I'm gonna put it here in the level.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,230
I'm going to remain level to game just so that the game script makes sense.

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,050
Let's save that and add a script to it.

60
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,260
Could be an empty script for now.

61
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,100
It's good to go.

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,340
I'm actually going to remove all of these things and just save it.

63
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,270
All right.

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,720
So we have a gold detectors, one and two, and we need a way of selecting the signal.

65
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,990
So I'm going to give you the challenge before I do.

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,570
I'm going to give you what you might need to get it working.

67
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,520
If I take, let's say, gold one, which is over here, this is going to school and play to happens.

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,190
So my first goal that I'm going to actually make is gold, too, because when the ball crosses here,

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,420
I want the school to object to one.

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,310
So if we create the signal, which in this case is body entered.

71
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,600
And we connect it to our game.

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,220
We can add extra arguments specifically, I'm not an integer.

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,870
And just give the number one, because as a player.

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,640
OK.

75
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,980
So that can go in here and I got to rename extra AAG one to goal, Heidi.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,060
Both of these will use the same the same signal so I can do the same thing on gold detector here.

77
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,970
He entered Connect and this is gold to Ongo detect a body entered.

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,140
They are both connected.

79
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,420
That's going to give a different go, Eddie.

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,660
So here's my challenge to you.

81
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,310
I would like you to use print to show when the player scored in the console.

82
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,070
Pretty simple challenge, but we haven't looked at when to use print for debugging and basic gameplay

83
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,060
elements in a few videos.

84
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,350
So just quick refresher.

85
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,700
I want you to print to show which player has scored.

86
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,110
OK.

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,860
So your console message should say player one or player to have scored a goal or has scored.

88
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,460
Have you put it.

89
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,220
I do want that information in that.

90
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,160
So it pulls the video.

91
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,970
Give it a shot.

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,780
And when you come back, I'll show you my solution.

93
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,720
And welcome back.

94
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,490
OK.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,130
How do we do this?

96
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,460
What?

97
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,350
I'm in his prince.

98
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,420
And this needs a strict, doesn't it, so.

99
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,960
Player.

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,400
And then I want to add in Goldie.

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,450
But Goldie is an integer player or the print command needs a string.

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,230
So let's cast that as a string.

103
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,610
And then add in space has scored a goal.

104
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,680
Jail, not golf.

105
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,610
All right.

106
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,820
So this is very, very bare bones, and if I press play there organism issues with this bit of a move,

107
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,330
play to either way, boop play.

108
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,060
I want to score a goal.

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Want to say those issues.

110
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,500
Well I mean.

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,530
Well, you could in theory just keep doing that.

112
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,820
Right.

113
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,450
You could kick it through.

114
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,860
But that's what.

115
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,720
Let's see if we can get it in the other go.

116
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,390
Jen, we don't know if I can, but let's try.

117
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,490
Game is a little bit tricky.

118
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,380
I might have turned on the speed, to be honest.

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,650
Yes, tell us, Pete.

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,370
OK.

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,060
So play I want us to go play, who's got to go?

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,120
You'll notice when the ball crosses back it's county again.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,130
When I first made a prototype of this game, we had a couple of people playing it for quite a long time.

124
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,840
But interesting fact.

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,320
They started using that rebound, that bug as a new game, play mechanics.

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,090
So sometimes bugs make it fun game play mechanics.

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,550
Also, not sure I like that rotation.

128
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,010
We should fix that in the next video.

129
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,020
But for now, excellent work.

130
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,300
And I'll see you the next video.
