00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.040
Hello again lovely God.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.050
People in this video we gonna finish off heiss meissner's by finishing off the tutorial and what we'll

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.890
do is display objective text to the player and by objective text.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.830
I mean that text describes the objective.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.540
Not text.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.670
There's clearly an objectively text.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.930
Ok so what is actually tauriel text.

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.970
Need to do every stage.

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.820
The tutorial has to have a sound text right so the first is going to be about movement.

10
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.740
So here's how you move the second is going to be about opening a door.

11
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.890
Here's how you open a door.

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.720
And we need to move on to the next stage of that when we get to the ject.

13
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.910
So somehow we need to split the text down into a set into separate sections and be able to call those

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.800
sections.

15
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.000
And we've already done that we solve that with dictionaries and loops.

16
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.150
So we're just going to use dictionaries and I'm going to put my dictionaries inside a Jason File.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.710
You don't have to do that.

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.300
You could just use a dictionary.

19
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.260
But I'm going to use an adjacent file because I think it's good practice if you ever want to localize

20
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.070
your game.

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.300
If I were to release high mice's an English French German Japanese Korean Mandarin minyon whatever then

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.920
Jason's allowed me to do that.

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.700
Before we go into that though I'd like to fix a bug observe if I open up the tutorial something you

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.240
own two scenes levels tutorial press play.

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.310
Everything is normal right.

26
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.880
I move into this area here.

27
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.410
We update the objective level what happens if I move back into it though

28
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.300
every time I enter this area we're moving forward an objective and I don't want that.

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.180
But that's an easy enough fix.

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.430
If I go into a tutorial and I'm in a going to distraction free mode like this and one I do is remove

31
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.580
this line here my line 14 remove child marker.

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.010
Wait a minute yeah.

33
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.110
Why are they doing that.

34
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.300
Well I'll show you one doing that when I go to update position.

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.690
I'm going to pass through a number and that number is going to be the objective stage I'm at.

36
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.660
So let's start with zero and then one two three and four.

37
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.890
I'm not too concerned because I've already put these in order right.

38
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.300
But if you wanted to.

39
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.270
The move is going to be objective 1 2 3 and 4.

40
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.970
I'm using the same format we'd use in an array.

41
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580
So let's take a look at our objective areas or other objective markers and you'll see movies one two

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.370
three four.

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.040
It's not 0 1 2 3 4.

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.160
I didn't off by one error while talking.

45
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.480
Ah OK.

46
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.240
So now I need to do is just change get child 0 to get Child number whatever number this is.

47
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.110
It will work.

48
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.760
Let's double check.

49
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.900
Here we are in game and I can walk right up to this area.

50
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.290
I can open the door through move back and look.

51
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.790
It's actually moving you back to this objective which is great because if the player for some reason

52
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.970
forgets what they want do.

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.880
We can tell them again.

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.760
Awesome piece of nuff except Buck.

55
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.970
Now let's create a gooey.

56
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.870
So I'm to make a brand new scene.

57
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.150
You saw it coming didn't you.

58
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.040
And my basic note is going to be a canvas layer because I don't want the gooey elements to move around

59
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.490
the screen.

60
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.620
I want to stay focussed on the canvas on the viewport and I will call this tutorial golly.

61
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.150
And let's make this nice as simple and a save that a scene.

62
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.400
And an instance in in before I forget so this insist that in too much tauriel Scenes I'm not instance

63
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.830
in an empty canvas.

64
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.840
Well let's fill.

65
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.950
Let's make a child of that and that's going to be a good rule.

66
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.950
Need a pop up because I want things to show.

67
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.660
Not sure.

68
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.080
So a pop up as a child that pop up.

69
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.250
I want a nine patch rectangle.

70
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.170
All right.

71
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.320
Where's my pop up.

72
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.000
It's invisible.

73
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.960
There it is.

74
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.260
My 9 patch.

75
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.600
First let's put something to actually look at some split texture into the night.

76
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.630
That's right.

77
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.020
Going to graphics interface pin.

78
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.130
Gee what a SCROD for those glass panels.

79
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.010
I miss those glass panels we haven't used in a while and I'm feeling normal.

80
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.240
All the corners.

81
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.230
So so going a bit small.

82
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.280
I'm going to move my pop up and not my eye patch rect So let's drag that out to decent size.

83
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.140
I set my nine patch rectangle to four so it'll follow the size I'm dragging.

84
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.830
That's looking pretty good.

85
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.240
This is not why I finally want it but for now let's get the nine patch rectangle looking right.

86
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.510
Let's put in a patch much.

87
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.110
Now these are quite big corners so we reckon 20 pixels.

88
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.830
Others look pretty good so.

89
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.120
20 pixels on each side.

90
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.520
Great and a save that because I'm paranoid OK let's put this in a decent spot.

91
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.480
I'm thinking right down here so let's for any further set the anchor on the anchor to the bottom right

92
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.620
where ever the bottom right it actually I mean bottom centred on this centre bottom.

93
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.020
And let's actually move you to a boat.

94
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.820
Air should be good.

95
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.130
Now remember this isn't going to show.

96
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.990
When we test it so I want to test it.

97
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.150
I need to go into the tutorial open tutorial script and on ready.

98
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.840
I need to show this pop up.

99
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.360
So let's do a tutorial going pop up dot shot as the other looks.

100
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.220
I said that's good.

101
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.930
One nice feature is if I recites the screen it's going to move on for probably after tweaking.

102
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.000
But I'll figure that in a minute.

103
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560
For now I will put my objective in here to do that.

104
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.570
I want to label to Ector to sexy I'm doing as a child of the pop up.

105
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.210
Oh hang on a second.

106
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.480
Look what I did.

107
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.830
I move the rectangle outside of the pop up.

108
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.310
Okay I'm gonna go back to my.

109
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.090
Rect put to positions 0 0 all those times I told you remember your mood.

110
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.220
Making sure the parent not the child.

111
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.620
Look what did I get your mental anchor to the bottom right.

112
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.670
Because I think that means when I move that section of the screen you can update yourself which is what

113
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.270
I want.

114
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.770
But you going to position yourself to the centre bottom let's view us.

115
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.740
And look the anchors moved didn't want that.

116
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.480
So anchor.

117
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.820
Bottom right.

118
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.820
Why did god decide that I wanted to move it.

119
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.350
I don't know.

120
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.230
It just it.

121
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.540
I don't want to flush against the bottom of the screen I want a margin.

122
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.470
So on the pop up let's add a margin let margins going to be 60 from the bottom.

123
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.210
No it's going to be negative six from the bottom.

124
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.240
That's actually a bit much as netlist do negative 40 and from the top.

125
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.070
So I of Tracht 40 from that value and that should look good.

126
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.810
Let's give it a label so as a child of pop up label.

127
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.340
You and going make this a full rectangle So the labels going to cover all of this.

128
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.240
But I want to go right up to the edge.

129
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:59.080
So once again margins I'm thinking 15 yeah looks good lifting from the top 15 from the right.

130
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.770
I think any negative 15 I do mean negative 15 and negative lifting from the bottom.

131
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.690
And let's apply our themes summoning a back up to pop up because that's our top control node and a load

132
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.510
my thing and let's put it some test text to see how this looks.

133
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.630
All right.

134
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.520
I want the text probably around that size a good size.

135
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.290
But look I'm going over the sites.

136
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.520
Yes.

137
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.450
Well we're doing a set auto wrap.

138
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.260
Now I didn't update automatically.

139
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.740
I had to go off-screen off the node and back again.

140
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.440
But there once was a lovely cucumber so much.

141
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.060
I could play around the margins of stuff but that's a good starting point.

142
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.730
Great.

143
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.110
So now we have a basic goalie that's going to show what we do see that.

144
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.290
Now we need to create a Jason File.

145
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.340
Okay.

146
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.220
Jason files one of those things that have a few moving parts.

147
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.330
But first let's write it.

148
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:59.530
I'm an open atom and I've got here a nice empty atom file again if you want to do this as a dictionary

149
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.300
you can do it there Jason.

150
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.080
Jason's going to be as a dictionary.

151
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.870
Now in case you forgot and I will link again the reference to how to read to Jason.

152
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.420
But essentially we need a key and a value making a dictionary.

153
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.260
But the key has to be a string and that's going to be important later.

154
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:24.470
Alright so by key 0 as a string is going to have the string I was going to do it was teach you how to

155
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.090
move.

156
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.900
OK.

157
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.700
So I've typed my first line Wapiti first day of training.

158
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.020
Right now I'm not getting any error correction so one would do is save this as a Jason.

159
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.830
I want to save it in the right folder.

160
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.980
So let's go back and to got to and I'm going to go we should put this in our scenes.

161
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.240
Yeah.

162
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.000
But in the same scene I would put it in all levels.

163
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.330
Next to tutorial one would do as well.

164
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.140
Right click to show a farmhouse ajar.

165
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.440
And because room windows actually a copy this path is going to a little bit different iMac a little

166
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.180
bit different in Linux distro.

167
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.780
Basically make sure you're saving the file to a location that makes sense to you.

168
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.170
OK.

169
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.680
Back to Adam and I'm going to save those.

170
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.540
And I'm going to copy my paste my path right there in here.

171
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.900
I want to call it tutorial messages dot jsow dot gesso N is going to tell Adam.

172
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.810
This is a Jason File.

173
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.690
Please put in that error correction.

174
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.400
All right.

175
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.880
Welcome to you first day of training heiss Meister please move to the next objective marker.

176
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.230
Use the W A S D D to move OK.

177
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.440
That is entry 0.

178
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.130
So my key is zero.

179
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.960
My value is what is this string here.

180
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.040
To add the next key and it's put a comma.

181
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:43.510
I was going down a line and that's going to be one that put the colon there.

182
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.560
It should now know you are a key.

183
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.500
Alright so first move.

184
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.270
Second as door.

185
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.390
And now I'm going to write the text the door and fastforward do that.

186
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.870
And my next one says excellent.

187
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.500
Next will practise interacting with objects.

188
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.680
Open the door ahead of you by clicking on it with the mouse.

189
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.650
Remember that you'll need to be close enough to touch it.

190
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.020
OK so what's next my next.

191
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.520
My night vision tutorials comma an image you repeat the process again.

192
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.690
So I now have three.

193
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.600
The loot is had in their briefcase pick it up by walking over it and four head to the chopper.

194
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.810
Sorry got carried away.

195
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.960
The exit is now unlocked.

196
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.650
Head towards your convenience.

197
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.390
Save that.

198
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.720
And that is now ready to go back into God.

199
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.810
We go alright.

200
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.920
We we've now got a Jason File and we can't see it.

201
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.600
Why.

202
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.530
Because God can't parse Jason automatically we can't drag it into the inspector So it's going to hide

203
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.220
that file.

204
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.960
That's actually a little annoying but I go into shock.

205
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.010
I'm a farm manager.

206
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.480
It is here alright.

207
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.520
Let's grab that script.

208
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.420
We have a couple options.

209
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.720
We could just point to it in script.

210
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.240
I'm going to put it in the global.

211
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.170
I didn't use global last time.

212
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.380
I feel like this is a good time to use it just so remind you that we have one so that's going to our

213
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.070
global script.

214
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.750
Did you do.

215
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.730
And this is seems really an asset link.

216
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.900
It's a scene so I'm going to make a brand new comment.

217
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.430
File.

218
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.310
Links must be changed manually.

219
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:17.480
Great Alright variable tutorial messages equals.

220
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.250
And now I'm going to get that scene to get this file.

221
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.780
I can't have been doing normally right.

222
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.410
I can't go to scenes when I put it to do.

223
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.300
I can't just go to my levels and right click on it.

224
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.090
So instead of going to back up a folder right.

225
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.890
Right click on levels.

226
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.650
Will you copy that path.

227
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.290
And then I have to type in the file name file name it's tutorial mashers not Jason and ALSA I'm worried

228
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.640
about my typos skills so I'm going to go into it as if I'm renaming it in Windows.

229
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.710
Going to site the whole thing.

230
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.290
Copy that back and God.

231
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.060
Oh and just paste what I've copied so now I don't have to worry about any typos because you've seen

232
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.920
me type.

233
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.380
Great back and she torro great.

234
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.330
We now have a Jason File ready to pass so let's make a function called parts Jason.

235
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.440
And you know what I'm going to do it.

236
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.450
Head of.

237
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.510
Update Twitter.

238
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.280
And so it's going to be called gets Jason.

239
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.500
And we are very first option.

240
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.330
Function gets Jess right.

241
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.610
Now what I need here is to use file.

242
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.090
If I had a use that to type it in here hold control and click on it.

243
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.800
Because as an example we can copy almost verbatim one of do actually just use this load.

244
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.520
Copy that and go work around it.

245
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.160
This is what we did in lonely lips but rather than explain every line I'm going to paste it PASI it

246
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.610
has messed up the tab that's a little annoying.

247
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.800
I'm going to put all those back there.

248
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.910
Or at first I need to do.

249
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.730
I need to change the file were opening when not open and use a saved game that we are opening.

250
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.120
Global dots.

251
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.580
Tutorial messages.

252
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.470
I guess that's the far opening and we are reading it so that doesn't need changing.

253
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.190
We then make it brand new variable called content.

254
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.000
And we're getting contact as text.

255
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.470
We're then closing the content and returning it but we need to parse this because as a Jason Farmall

256
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.590
checks faster I'm going to go halves.

257
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.010
J s o n and we are passing that as content.

258
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.990
Notice how it's returning this data and returned this value here.

259
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.390
So back up to get Jason.

260
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.860
What I actually do is make a brand new variable called text and text in ready.

261
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:50.750
Each calls get Jason and the J we're getting is the Jason conversion the Jason reading of content.

262
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.980
The content is the text with in the tutorial messages file.

263
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.470
So we've done this before and luny lips feel free to go back look over that video or to look at the

264
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.560
documentation for any file.

265
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.020
But either way the J12 shred should now be available as a dictionary with loaded the dictionary.

266
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.230
So now will do is within my update pointer position when we play this file.

267
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.370
I'm going to get the tutorial message text which is this label.

268
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.420
Text equals and what is an eagle is going to equal text.

269
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.120
And I want to get the value that's under the key and the key is being passed in.

270
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.300
Right so I don't have to keep writing this function however.

271
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:41.890
Do you remember when I said that the keys in Jason have to be a string and this is not a string.

272
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:47.140
This is an integer so I need to convert that to a string.

273
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.370
Right we're casting as a string.

274
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.330
What was your first day of training heiss meister.

275
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.490
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

276
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.090
Hahaha look at that.

277
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.340
Now we are going a little bit over the text here my files a bit big.

278
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:12.740
I'm actually gonna make that a little bit clearer by going into here which drag you out like this.

279
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.030
No I save you and run this scene again.

280
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.070
Awesome.

281
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.250
Now one thing I do want to do is get rid of these random white bricks.

282
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.110
I put these line breaks in because the bees would read.

283
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.070
They're actually get him away.

284
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.790
So let's go back and my Jason File.

285
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.320
Room out of it.

286
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.690
OK.

287
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.960
So this will now do automatically if I do want to line break because some converter from Jason I can

288
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.740
put one in here so I could put one there and one here.

289
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.360
That paragraph should just play.

290
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.960
Save that and see if that worked.

291
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.550
Do do do do.

292
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.490
Fantastic.

293
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.900
What was that vision mode going on.

294
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:08.750
You're holding that up to the awesome cover is I do want to change before we go any further.

295
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:14.240
I want the gooey elements to vanish we're in night vision mode day because I think that's going to be

296
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.440
a more interesting and compelling thing to happen so let's add tutorial to that group.

297
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:25.190
Well first let's go take a look what that group is so let's open our play a script which is right here

298
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.090
and back into distraction free mode.

299
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:35.300
Let's see interface night vision mode interface dark remote so that's what we care about so I'm going

300
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.700
to copy that as a reference and get back in to my tutorial script.

301
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.000
Awesome.

302
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.870
So I want to add to it.

303
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.760
Let's do that before we do anything else.

304
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:54.500
The very first thing we do is add to the group and I manage a group interface that I typed that right.

305
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.410
I did look at that.

306
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.070
There is.

307
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.950
Now I need a function for dog vision mode.

308
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.320
I can put this right down the bottom

309
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.200
function.

310
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.700
Night vision mode and all I would do is hide the going.

311
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.790
So you do a pop up dot.

312
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:19.620
Right.

313
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:20.600
OK.

314
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.050
The other one is dark vision mode.

315
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.550
Is that right.

316
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.660
Yes I guess so.

317
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.120
Dark vision mode which is when we don't have night vision.

318
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.840
I'm just going to duplicate that and move it down and sort of hide.

319
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.220
You're going to show.

320
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.800
Let's take a look.

321
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.860
Awesome.

322
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.460
Now there is one tiny problem here right.

323
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.150
We've just created a system one a walk through here and open the door.

324
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.190
So we go to night vision modem Nicklaus night vision metaphor I can see a walk down here the objectives

325
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.090
going out come up and I can't see it.

326
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.050
Elissa Wall back then play a has to know to come out.

327
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.040
So I've got a challenge for you and me close.

328
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.320
This shows a gooey when we need it.

329
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.200
I'm like the gooey to come up even if the player is in night vision mode when they get to the night

330
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.370
vision mode objective.

331
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.320
So pause the video give it a shot.

332
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.950
We come back I'll show you my solution.

333
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.060
And welcome back.

334
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:25.890
All right.

335
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.160
So the easiest thing to do to be honest is just I'm going to switch back to this mode.

336
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.120
We already have this code here.

337
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.640
The important bit however is when we do this because these areas are the objective complete state right.

338
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.480
So you've learned to move go here.

339
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.430
If I put it in the briefcase that's pointless I need to put it right here.

340
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:51.620
So on objective night vision body entered update the position and dark vision.

341
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:52.790
And that should do it.

342
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.580
Let's take a look.

343
00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:07.950
The walk over here look at the dog managed node and there and it's awesome very final thing to do this

344
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.650
video.

345
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.060
It's a little bit too easy for the player to see what they're doing.

346
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.500
So let's make this darker.

347
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.010
Let's go into our night vision out.

348
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.130
And I'm going to change the value of night vision.

349
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.170
So look at it right now it's this blue.

350
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.230
Let's go really.

351
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.620
This.

352
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.770
So the plan needs night vision to get through here.

353
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.320
So what's this.

354
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:33.980
This is that value 0 3 0 8 1 see some scanner update that in my night vision notes.

355
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.000
In my dark moate not night vision that would be bad.

356
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:38.910
OK.

357
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.140
Now that's more on the scene.

358
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.050
And that's very dark and moody isn't it.

359
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.700
And now the plan needs not to get through.

360
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:55.340
And there's also going to impact the actual level.

361
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.360
Awesome.

362
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.200
That brings us to the end of this video.

363
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.100
In this video we've looked at how to display Twitter messages when a needed aim of building a dictionary

364
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.720
and Jason's skills from Louis lips.

365
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.670
So awesome work.

366
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.080
And I'll see you in the next video.
