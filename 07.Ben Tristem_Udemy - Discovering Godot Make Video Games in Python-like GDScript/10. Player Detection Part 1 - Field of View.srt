1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,870
Hello again you wonderful God people.

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,140
In this video we're going to start play a detection by the end of this video.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,600
The camera is going to be able to tell if the player is within the field of view.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,390
Now you'll notice this is part one of plate detection.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,230
We're just looking at field of view.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,280
We're not looking at line of sight.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,860
And by line of sight we're not yet going to the test if a player is hiding behind something if the camera

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,340
or other NBC site is blocked by an object so can do this in stages but we are coming to that.

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,480
So we're doing field of view.

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,300
We have to figure out some things.

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,960
First thing we need to know is what is the field of view.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,400
Right.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,960
The feel of you is the angle that you can see.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,640
So the purposes of this video when I say you and probably talking about the NBC if you and NBC How far

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,860
can you see the field of view is going to match the light beam and ice Meister's.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,660
This is to give the player really clear feedback about what is and what isn't dangerous.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,200
The field of view has to rotate with the non play a character.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,010
If you turn by 13 degrees to your right your field of view has to turn to.

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,920
And when he did check of the players in the field of view when we're doing that we should give some

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,120
feedback to the player.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,700
It's all very well saying the light beam is dangerous.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,760
The players are able to see instantly you are in a light beam.

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,630
So this sounds like quite a lot.

24
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,200
And when you first approach this subject it's very easy to get bogged down especially if like me you're

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,400
not that familiar with linear algebra and Vector mathematics.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,740
So if you're somebody who hears the words vector mathematics and that type little shiver of fear happens

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,820
inside you don't worry.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,770
It's nowhere near as bad as you might be thinking when it's nice and simple.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,160
Let's break this down into really simple steps.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,810
When we have a difficult problem like are you in my field of view let's break it down to concrete things

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,620
we can tell the computer first thing what direction of fixing this sounds silly but actually it's key.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,510
If you've turned 13 degrees to the right you are now facing that direction to the field of you is going

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,350
to change to a second.

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,570
What direction is the play in.

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,580
Never mind can I see you which way my facing and what direction are you in.

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,670
Because once we have those two we can see those two things within tolerance.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,710
By that I mean they don't have to perfectly align right we're not making a one pixel line that you touch

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,130
and that I see you would have a field of use are you inside that field.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,640
And that's everything the MP needs sooner.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,410
So there's more things we need to talk about but let's not make this one big lecture slides.

41
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,960
Let's actually do something in the engine.

42
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,920
So I want to go into the security camera and I'm going to make a scene on camera body now.

43
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,620
Quick reminder camera body has to be a kinematic body too deep for what I'm about to do to work.

44
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,430
I'm going to give it a script that inherits from character.

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,430
Character is a script that extends kinematic body to deep.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,030
So if I look at a play a script player extends character and character extends a note.

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,420
It's getting all of the functions and methods and everything else it can do from what is in the note

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,180
about what it can do.

49
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,970
That means if I put a script here and this note is not a kinematic what to me is something an area truly

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,610
We're going to have a massive problem and it won't let us do it.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,540
So let's put in a new script.

52
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,120
And I'm going to first name them in the right place.

53
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,300
I don't want to be in scenes.

54
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,090
I have some weird scenes to get rid of there.

55
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,110
This is from my beta testing scripts.

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,260
I will call this player detection.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,970
Now you might be thinking why aren't you calling it camera.

58
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,530
I could call a camera but camera is not really what the script does is not transmitting the image anywhere.

59
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,370
It's not saying here's what I see.

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,540
All it's doing is trying to protect the player and later going to make a soldier who's going to inherit

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,050
that scene.

62
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,260
So for now let's call this player detection in the right place.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,930
Hit save.

64
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,590
But before we further going to inherit a character.

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,560
So I just clicked this little folder here and it change from kinematic bullet you need to where the

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,030
caps ripped us and we are good to go.

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,910
Let me get rid of these little fake scripts that I made because you don't need those first things first

68
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:23,820
we need to define a concept we need f Ovee tolerance o the tolerance not f Ovee ever the field of view

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,250
is the angle that you can see.

70
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,500
But that's not really what it gonna be using this for.

71
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,510
I'm not telling you this is the thing you can see in checking is something within that angle.

72
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,400
This is going to be 45.

73
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,880
Why is it 45.

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,420
It's 45 because that's the sublets the angle in the image I gave you that like map image.

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,820
It's a 45 degree thing.

76
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,020
Actually it's 44 and a half but I'm going to call it 45 for now.

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,260
Next up let's grab the player and make a global script right now.

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,420
When do we go on ready.

79
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,710
Variable player.

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,950
So we need to find the play out let's do get note not make a global script right now.

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,730
We can do that little bit later for now which is get this work.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,400
What is this.

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,070
This is going to be what has to be a string because that's how get known works.

84
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:21,060
And we need to go to the root level one player let's make a quick note here this is make this level

85
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,240
neutral.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,380
What I mean by that I mean at the moment this will only work in level 1 and when we want to add multiple

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,390
levels we probably will do later.

88
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,240
That's really not good.

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,960
So we'll have to fix this later so there's a note to tell us that it that file our player.

90
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,770
We're good to go.

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,150
So we're going to check every frame.

92
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,110
So we're going to go.

93
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,800
Function process.

94
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,630
And what do we want to do.

95
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:52,550
We want to see if player is in F the top.

96
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,310
And I'm using the same capitalization So it's very easy to read.

97
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,220
So that's my next function.

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,020
Go get rid of these extra spacing because well it's neater and also Ben doesn't like it so let's give

99
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,270
it a function.

100
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,240
Play is in F over torrents.

101
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,020
What do we need to do here.

102
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,150
Well we need to figure out a couple of things.

103
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,340
Let's go back to the slides.

104
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,690
If we look at a list.

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,640
Number one is what direction of my facing.

106
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,880
So to figure that out what I'm going to do is set a default direction.

107
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,490
If we're rotating the ABC we should know what an unprotected NPC is to do that we're going to give it

108
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,930
a property of vector to the vector two is going to be one common zero.

109
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,370
So that's one pixel to the right and zero up and down.

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,500
That is everything we need.

111
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:49,700
Because when we then use dot rotated we can rotate it by our global rotation and we can easily figure

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,400
out what that value is.

113
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,550
I'll show you what to me.

114
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,560
Let's make a variable.

115
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,190
And this variable is going to be NPC

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:10,850
facing direction NPC facing direction is going to be a vector too and it's going to be one common zero

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,580
got rotated and what have been rotated by now I need to be a little careful here.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm going to have to use global rotation.

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,940
And the reason I'm having to use global rotation is the way I've organized the folders I've put security

120
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,380
cameras as a child of security cameras folder.

121
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,810
There's no to.

122
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,180
If I say what's your rotation.

123
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,560
It's going to calculate my rotation in relation to security cameras.

124
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,870
That's an inherent bug.

125
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,520
If for some reason something happens to this node.

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,100
I don't know I rotate the whole thing and then I go back and move the cameras I have now mess this up.

127
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:57,080
So let's put everything back and instead rely on global rotation.

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,970
We now know which way the NPC is facing.

129
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,640
What else are we to know about the flights willing to know what direction the player is in.

130
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,820
And this is the bit with the mafeking feel a little overwhelming.

131
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,660
Bear with me.

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
It's not that bad.

133
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,500
Let's imagine that we have a player this dude here and a soldier.

134
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,060
This dude here and we've placed them on an ex-wife it just like the coordinate system and because this

135
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,800
has got the x y grid is going the other way that I would normally think.

136
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,500
Remember positive wires down.

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,550
I cannot stress this enough because I cannot stop making this mistake.

138
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,800
Let's give them arbitrary positions so I'm going to say the soldier is a one come to and the player

139
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,240
is it to come or what I now know.

140
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
Both of their positions.

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,990
What I don't know is where the other one is to do that.

142
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,880
I could measure it and it turns out the difference here is one comment one right.

143
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,430
If I take the player position and subtract off the guard position I get that direction.

144
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,570
This isn't a coincidence.

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,350
Those values could be anything and it will still work out.

146
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:06,970
So we have variable direction to player cook and what's that going to be.

147
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:14,260
That's going to be clear dot position minus global dot position and there shouldn't be a capital G.

148
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,220
There should be a small G.

149
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,340
We're going to normalize this and if you're a little confused as to what that means.

150
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't worry I will link you to the vector maths page on the goddard documentation so look it up.

151
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,390
Basically we're going to make this a lot simpler to do by using normalized.

152
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,780
It's a really helpful thing that vector 2 has a property or.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,170
We now have everything we need all we need to do now is figure out what the angle to is.

154
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,700
Ordinarily we'd have to use a dot product which is a branch of mathematics that I just struggle with.

155
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,850
I find it very difficult but we don't need to do that.

156
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,300
Instead we can use a function or jeanerette function called angle to an angle to is awesome.

157
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,080
It goes like this.

158
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,640
But you make it.

159
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,520
If conditions are.

160
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:02,210
If direction 2 player dot angle to

161
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,570
NPC facing direction so what does this mean.

162
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,630
It means the angle from the player to to the embassy facing direction which is exactly what we need

163
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,930
is for less than EFO the tolerance.

164
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,690
Let's talk really quickly about why I'm using ever the Torrance rather than Torrance.

165
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,960
And in fact why I am about to change this concept.

166
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,180
Imagine if you will that this is our field of view.

167
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,590
Right now say that's the 44 and a half degrees or 45 degrees whatever it is I can't use this and say

168
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,870
it's 45 degrees because if the player is whether would f of V is going to be fine.

169
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,570
But if I say plus 45 degrees it won't get anything anti clockwise or counterclockwise.

170
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,400
That's because the facing direction is where we're taking this from positive values will be to the clockwise

171
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,840
direction to down and the negative values in the other direction.

172
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,330
We were divided by two and then willing to change the result to an absolute and absolute means were

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,480
going to get rid of any negative positive affirmation of tree of a's as positive.

174
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,650
In that case anything that's on this side or on this side up to that tolerance will work.

175
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,590
So let's make that work first ever bittorrent's is not 45.

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,310
It's actually twenty two point five but that's a stupid number on a nickel at 22.

177
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,730
We're going to go absolutely.

178
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,700
And that's going a rather negative positive thing will do.

179
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,540
We need to be careful with ffe tolerance because here we are getting.

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,850
Lowball rotation.

181
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,690
And this is in degrees level rotation is not in degrees.

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,710
It's in radion.

183
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,840
I could do global rotation degrees or I could cast f of tolerance from degrees to radion which will

184
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,120
apply this degree to radion.

185
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,740
Look how simple it is to see if this works as do it.

186
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,060
Frente.

187
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,200
Hello.

188
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,010
And just to make this even easier for ourselves to go to to view and I'm going to for the moment take

189
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,520
the animation player off auto load and move this camera.

190
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,460
To a Ford position just searches for debugging perhaps so save that.

191
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
Give that a shot.

192
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,640
Oh there's a small bug I put global dot position.

193
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,660
I mean global underscored position one more time.

194
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,370
OK.

195
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,470
So we're getting lots of Helo's.

196
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,810
Let me move out of the way and press clear and we're not getting any.

197
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,170
And then we move back should be just here.

198
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,740
Look at that.

199
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:50,230
Right on that line I got here in this corner and hit clear.

200
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,510
Great.

201
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,610
Now helo isn't that useful so as close to that.

202
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:05,010
And one of the do is sell the chap I'd like you to have the SPCS torch change colour if the player is

203
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,600
in the field of you remember that we need the Cada change back afterwards.

204
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,700
Otherwise the player won't know unless say so.

205
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,060
Pause the video give them a shot and remember if you don't know where a property is you can go in to

206
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:24,050
the torture scene and under colour mouseover and you can see property colour.

207
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,800
So that's the variable you be changing to pause the video give it a shot.

208
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,110
When you come back I'll show you my solution.

209
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,600
Welcome back.

210
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,530
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to set up some more Constance somewhat of a constant red

211
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,840
equals unlist set that to colour.

212
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,160
It has American spelling so that rather you colour and I'm honoured to read.

213
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,160
Now this is going to be a red green blue thing that I'll show if I go one comma.

214
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,850
You can see it goes float are float G float b float.

215
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,240
In other words goes there float for the red float for the green float for the blue.

216
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,930
And optionally you Captain the Alpher.

217
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:21,300
So do is put four red quarter green quarter blue and I don't want any Alpher and ballast your white.

218
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,280
And that's going to be full red full green full blue because that's how a missive light works.

219
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,820
If you're not sure how red green blue values work there's plenty of resources out there.

220
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,200
But essentially one is full zero is off which would make sense.

221
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,280
Great.

222
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,710
Now I'm going to do something a little bit fancy.

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,410
I'm going to put in my player is an ever torrance's get the bigger return.

224
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,120
True and no one else can go return fops.

225
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,390
Why am I doing that.

226
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,710
Because I can now go to process and go.

227
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,310
If player is of tolerance look at that.

228
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,970
Now what we need to do.

229
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,950
I'm going to say torch.

230
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,740
And if you're not getting autocomplete here it's because you're in the wrong sense.

231
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:23,210
That's close the torching and that should work better torch dot colour equals red.

232
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,900
Else.

233
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,950
Torch dot column.

234
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,170
He pulls white or mystical.

235
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,560
How's this doing.

236
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,840
And we now have.

237
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,810
Play a little action.

238
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,460
Look at that.

239
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,090
Okay.

240
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,660
There's been quite a lot going on.

241
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,020
I am.

242
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm just enjoying this moody lighting look at this this is awesome.

243
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,760
There's one more thing I need to do.

244
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,500
And let's put the animations back on so let's do that animations auto load.

245
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,180
And when we look at it now.

246
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,180
Ah yes.

247
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,130
In fact that 22 is a bit wrong isn't it let's change that camera body.

248
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,810
Let's call you 20.

249
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,120
Phenomenal.

250
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,940
Now we are going to put a range in this later so that if you're over here you won't be seeing.

251
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,980
But that is a really cool start to what we do in this video.

252
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,000
We've learned how to use angle to determine that is in the field of you.

253
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,570
We've also put in call an atmospheric feedback to let the player know if they're spotted.

254
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,200
This is a major step towards making our game functional so.

255
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,350
Excellent work.

256
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,390
See my next video.
