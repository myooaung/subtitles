00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,040
Hello you wonderful people.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,440
Let's finish off lunar lips.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,510
We're going to learn how to export so nice and easy.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,230
I mean I go back in here and before I get started I'm actually gonna make a decision.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,230
I've now got two competing scripts going on right so I've got my Jason solution and I got my storybook

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,040
and they're both live.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,450
So I'm going to get rid of one of these.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,810
I'm going to delete my Jason completely I've made the decision.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,790
I want a node based solution.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,180
If you didn't then you would delete the other stuff.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,070
So going to do to do uncommon these I don't need this template one and I don't need this.

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,050
Get from Jason function at all.

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,930
All right let's just double check that I haven't broken he thinks I may go in here see if the game runs.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,980
Can I have a name.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,540
Bob.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,450
And now pencil an adverb bubbly and an adjective Bob like once upon a time some call Bob a pencil flavored

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,270
sandwich which made you feel bubbly inside.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,550
It was a bob like day.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,160
Great.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,610
Now I've also noticed that I haven't actually got all eight of my stories.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,210
That's okay for now I'm going to have my three here.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,490
So the downside of using my note based system is it takes longer to get the stuff in here.

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,590
But the advantages it's all in one place and I can see it on with him to do and to go into this Resources

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,640
folder and open farm manager because I don't actually need storybook Jason so I could delete it.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,450
So I'm just gonna cut mine and put it on my desktop so I can find it again if I need it for some reason

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,750
and later video.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,050
Also Okay so how do we export our project.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,720
Well what it is going to project and hit export and you'll see here there's nothing selected I haven't

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,850
downloaded anything.

30
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,940
So what I need is to add a preset for an add a preset I can export for Android.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,340
IOW each team Al Mac OS universe a Windows desktop and Linux I'm running this on a Windows desktop my

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,030
laptop is Linux but I want a Windows executable so I won't hit windows.

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,900
You'll see here I don't have one I can't get it.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,940
So I can press this little link here manage export templates and it'll automatically link to what I

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,200
need.

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm currently using three point one beta 5 throughput one isn't life at the time and recording this

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,720
so I can hit download hit download and it'll select a mirror where I want to get it from here from here

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,350
and then I can just wait for to download.

39
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,830
So probably just fast for the spit seed I have to watch it.

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,750
Okay so it took about five minutes maybe less and now it's there I could just close this window it's

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,210
ready to go.

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,170
Now I got a project and we export again and now Windows executable is here.

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,610
I've got a bunch of options I could use I could put a path on it but it sure would be good to go.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,930
So all I need to do at this point is just go export project.

45
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,420
Okay.

46
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,830
So because they were on a call it on call it looney lips EMC I'm going to put it in the looney lips

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,670
folder.

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,540
Save it

49
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,250
and that was it is export it's exported.

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,880
Has it exports.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,630
Let's find out has it exported.

52
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,080
Let's find out.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,540
Go back to my file manager and here I've got loony lips stopped EMC and I can double click that and

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,400
there's my game.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,500
May I have a thing please.

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:14,640
Happy Yan a name Yan in caps an adjective Yan for a thing Yan's excitement once there was a happy Yan

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,310
called Yan that lived as Yan full as Yang's excitement.

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,900
Actually that story works quite well.

59
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,120
OK.

60
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,150
So we've now managed to export to the game isn't the sexy and all you have to do is take the EFC and

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,890
this package file that should be in the same folder and put them somewhere I can put them on my desktop

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,150
folder paste it there and I can run it here and the same thing will happen right.

63
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,350
It'll run just fine.

64
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,560
So when you're exporting it as a Windows file remember that the package file has to be with the XY.

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,860
Apart from that that's that bit dumb.

66
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,650
So what do we love from lonely lips.

67
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,170
Just a handful of things we've learned variables functions arrays dictionaries gooey elements signals

68
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,390
randomization and counting and getting child knows we've also talked about some other stuff in the most

69
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,100
essential things we've looked at are variables functions and conditions right with these three things

70
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,060
you can accomplish pretty much anything.

71
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,530
There are more efficient ways of doing things more elegant ways of doing things.

72
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,080
But that's the basics of modern programming.

73
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,850
So excellent work.

74
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,390
I hope you've really enjoyed the section I've really enjoyed teaching it and I'm looking forward to

75
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,820
the next one so I'll see you in the next section.
