00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.560
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.390
Delightful God.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.590
People in this video we're going to set up our simple door.

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.900
There's going to unlock doors and locked doors.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.420
And this one is going to an unlocked door.

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.070
Later on to make a locked door that's going inherit from the scene.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400
So this is going to be our basic template for a door.

8
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's talk about how we want doors to behave in and.

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.180
I'm thinking that the player has to actually use a door.

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
It's not going be an automatic door like you get a at a supermarket for example yet close enough.

11
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.840
And it just opens.

12
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.650
You actually have to use it and to use it you're going to left click on the mouse.

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.820
Now we need to make sure that you're within range right.

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.160
So you have to have entered a clickable area otherwise you have to click on any door on the screen and

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.970
it will just open.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.230
So we need some way of checking is the player within the clickable area.

17
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.280
Are you in range of the door.

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.140
Can you reach it which means we also need to track.

19
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.950
Have you left that area which is fine because we can do that with signals so we know the player is going

20
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.390
to be in range of the door.

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.360
But n.p. Cesar can open a door just by getting close.

22
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.750
The computer isn't going to click doors so the guards a guard walks up to a door the door will just

23
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.140
open.

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.990
We don't need to track if they in the area or not.

25
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.060
Finally our doors have to block light and our doors have to close automatically go.

26
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.310
I think too complicated here but worth bearing in mind.

27
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.750
So let's get to it.

28
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.150
First thing we do as you might expect we're going to open a scene so we can instance a door.

29
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.820
So let's make a new scene.

30
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.060
And I'm going to make an area to hoodie and call my area to dig door.

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.430
An area today.

32
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.040
Well that'll become clear in a moment.

33
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.630
But essentially it's because the parent of the door.

34
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.280
The bit that isn't going to move is going to be the area that the player has to enter in order to click.

35
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.520
It's going to be the bit that you're in range of.

36
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.780
So before we put in this collision shape let's put in a sub node for Sprite.

37
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.560
And on graphics tiles and the PLG rather not tiles then other tiles down the bottom.

38
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.950
We see tile 473 that's our door so that goes here.

39
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.790
That's our door.

40
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.110
OK.

41
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.540
This door part is going to have a static body and that's going to have a collision.

42
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.940
Now notice door still doesn't have a collision shapes as an area Judy you this doesn't work here.

43
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.050
But before we do that let's give our actual Sprite the actual wooden part of the door the bit the players

44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.100
to think of the door.

45
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.530
Let's give that a new rectangle shape.

46
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.730
And just like every other time expense not scale.

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.420
So that looks pretty awesome.

48
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.190
Well one thing we do before we forget.

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.570
I'm going to give this light occlusions So let's give this occlusion light occluding hoodie and this

50
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.160
is a new occlude a polygon.

51
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.380
And you know I'm on a snap to grid because I can it's not only 64 where 60 fall at sea that's great.

52
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.500
It's going to be what 16 by 32 maybe.

53
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.780
Let's find out.

54
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.060
On the x You're only 32.

55
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.030
And on the Y maybe 16.

56
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.070
OK that's pretty good isn't it.

57
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.610
OK.

58
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.000
And the Y has to be it.

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.840
And I just accidentally clicked snap relative.

60
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.920
I don't want that.

61
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.420
OK.

62
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.460
Let's put in our reclusion.

63
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.130
You got here here here here and here.

64
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.890
My cat is making noises.

65
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.720
We now have an occlusion polygon.

66
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.150
No lights.

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.520
Give me an error versus double check.

68
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.230
One more thing I want to do I want to make it so that you actually see the doors a set to clockwise.

69
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.730
So the occlusion switch off closed and put it to clockwise.

70
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.670
OK.

71
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.150
That should set up everything we need.

72
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.650
All right let's switch off the grid.

73
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.980
So hide guy hide the grid take off snap.

74
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.500
There's our occlusion.

75
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.640
It's looking good.

76
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.690
One more thing I need to do is on the static body let's make sure that we're actually colliding with

77
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.850
the right layer sucked.

78
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.110
You are not a player.

79
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.820
You are to rain and you can interact with players and security cameras and guards.

80
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.300
Why security cameras.

81
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.360
Line of sight is relying on a collision mask.

82
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.460
If we don't put security cameras here security cameras are going to be able to see the player through

83
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.030
the door.

84
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.980
Okay so far so good.

85
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.550
Couple more things.

86
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.160
One set up.

87
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.340
First let's make the actual area.

88
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.050
This is the part where the player has to be in range of in order for clicking on the door to work.

89
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.770
So this is going to be a collision.

90
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.870
Whoops.

91
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.530
Collision shape.

92
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.960
2d.

93
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.730
There it is.

94
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.990
And it's be a simple rectangle shape.

95
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.760
And it's gonna have to be at least as wide as the door.

96
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.070
And quite a lot bigger so let's see that look about right.

97
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.960
Yeah looks good.

98
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.190
Let's see.

99
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.890
I've got this at 32 sounds like a good number and let's call it 42.

100
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.480
Looks good.

101
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.690
Let's save this scene.

102
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.760
You're a door.

103
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.820
Fantastic.

104
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.820
Let's just check.

105
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.500
That's going to look right before we put any functionality in.

106
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.300
Let's put it where we can see what's happening.

107
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.360
So I'm going to instance in a door.

108
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.000
They are.

109
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.340
And let's move you to here and rotate you by 90 degrees.

110
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.930
Transform.

111
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.730
The door.

112
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.330
Let us transform are positions fine rotation.

113
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.590
The reason why this night is okay one doing this one open.

114
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.410
The guards have to be trapped.

115
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.000
I will make sure that we can actually see the door.

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.050
So let's take a look.

117
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.640
Okay so a couple more things we need for the door.

118
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.990
We need a way of opening this door so we're going to need an animation player.

119
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.980
And I'm just gonna drag it directly into the door just recipes.

120
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.130
We've also got an audio player because what sound effects a little later.

121
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.870
So let's put that in now.

122
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.790
Audio stream play.

123
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.980
Trudy Let's make this positional So where it is on screen is going to matter.

124
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.400
Looking good so let's give this an animation I call this animation new animation that's going be called

125
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.700
Open.

126
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.720
All right.

127
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.380
It's going to move this Sprite if it moves the Sprite it's going to move all the sprite's children.

128
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.540
It's not as move.

129
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.150
The collision shape here so it's easy to see it's not going to move.

130
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.820
The detection area.

131
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.480
So all that's going to move is this Sprite and all of its children.

132
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.770
So let's put in a brand new location key and let's see how long it's like I say it's going to let us

133
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.230
take a second to open.

134
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.790
It's going to stay open for three seconds and then close over a second so this can be a 4 second clip.

135
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.920
And it's two steps of one second.

136
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.900
It is nice and easy for us Miles.

137
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.660
OK.

138
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.880
So we have a key here and we need one at one second so let's move this spy.

139
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.720
What is that.

140
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.680
That's going to be a 64 is not perfect as big a key there and it can stay there for three seconds and

141
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.090
then is going back to the zero position.

142
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.070
The key here.

143
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.870
Let's see how that works.

144
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.270
Slides open.

145
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.320
Slides closed.

146
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.800
Awesome.

147
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.100
It's not going to auto load and it's not going to repeat.

148
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.580
It's not a looping animation this is just going play once.

149
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.340
Now we could have set this up to rotate but mimic sliding doors just because a little bit simpler.

150
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:49.200
However if we wanted to rotate what I would do is I would use a position too deep to be the parent of

151
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.700
the Sprite and I would rotate that position to do so would work as a hinge.

152
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.840
The player won't see the position to day but give me an easy thing to animate with everything beneath

153
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.310
it.

154
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.530
That way when I'm rotating the Sprite it won't rotate from the centre.

155
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.070
It'll rotate from the hinge.

156
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.000
However I want a sliding door sliding doors what I've got.

157
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.780
Let's say that I make a script we can put script right up here at the root of door and I will put it

158
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.880
in my script folder and when I call it door.

159
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.290
First thing we're going to need is a boolean.

160
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.030
On the call this can click.

161
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.660
What does this do.

162
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.460
It measures.

163
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.640
Are you in range of the door.

164
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.530
Is the player able to touch you.

165
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.020
And this is just not as false.

166
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.300
If you don't like can click you can use is in player range or player in range or whatever.

167
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.050
I mean to call it can click.

168
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.890
I have mixed feelings about how good that is but I'm using it for now.

169
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.290
We probably need a signal and that signals going to come from this collision shape which is the one

170
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.030
for the door.

171
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.110
Not one for the sprite in.

172
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:55.880
I should probably rename that some call this player detection area just to make this really clear.

173
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:56.930
So error.

174
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.550
Oh wait.

175
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.770
Not Eric entered body entered because the player has a body.

176
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.660
The player is not an area suck on body entered.

177
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.640
Connect that I am going to connect it to door on door.

178
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.500
Body entered.

179
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.670
Fantastic.

180
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.960
And let's put in an exit one as well.

181
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.690
Because otherwise the it'll register on a player X enters here in the moment the players come in range

182
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.510
of a door.

183
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.710
They'll be able to magically open that door from anywhere that they can see so they have the power of

184
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.150
opening doors of their mind.

185
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.620
I don't want that I want the player to only ever be able to enter the door.

186
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.960
If they're in this area someone track when they enter and when they exit.

187
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.380
So body exit and won't connect that as well.

188
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.410
What do we want to do.

189
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.850
Well the first thing want to do is say Are you an NPC.

190
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.160
If not a body.

191
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.270
So if you are not the player.

192
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:40.700
Equals.

193
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.810
Equals global dot player.

194
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.630
If this is not the player and this is important because the only other thing that can enter this area

195
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.650
is going to be an NPC.

196
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.910
Cameras can't enter this area anyway so I don't care about that.

197
00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:02.470
So just if a god has entered this area if you are not the player and the animation is not already running

198
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:10.180
I don't want the door to slam and open again so and not not pound dollar.

199
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.350
No you are wrong currency animation player.

200
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.670
What is playing.

201
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.840
Well when I do it we're going to run a function called Open which we haven't defined yet so we should

202
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.970
probably do that in a second.

203
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.000
However if you are a player you can allow the player to click on you.

204
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.860
Else can click.

205
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.220
It's going to be set to true.

206
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.560
Let's open very quickly so function open.

207
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.440
And what's going to do it's going go animation player dot play.

208
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:49.300
This is going to play open animation as well we called it isn't it let's double check that.

209
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.150
Yes we did.

210
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.580
So let's see if you've set this up correctly.

211
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.470
The door the place that guard should now open when the guard comes to it.

212
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.150
And the garment through the door.

213
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.570
OK.

214
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.240
So we now know that it can detect if it's on the plan.

215
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.710
We can now set can click it's true.

216
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:19.670
Now what I want to do is if the player exits this area set can click to follow so if body equals equals

217
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.520
global dot player.

218
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.550
So if the body that's just left has areas the player can click.

219
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.210
It's false.

220
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.870
But then space them then I see legible.

221
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.520
Okay.

222
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.120
The next thing I need to do is when he says a test if a player is clicking on a door.

223
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:45.350
Okay so this is going to be a function input event but I'm not going to do input I'm allowed to input

224
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.350
event.

225
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.210
Why.

226
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.470
Because I'm not checking has the player pressed the button.

227
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.340
I'm saying has the player pressed this again.

228
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.180
So if input.

229
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.380
Is mouse bloodland press an assist button.

230
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.340
Or left.

231
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.140
Which should all be in caps and can call.

232
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.410
I don't need to pull can quick.

233
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.910
It is true because if a f can click is the same as if can click is true.

234
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.290
So if that happens open.

235
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.920
Dog got through the door.

236
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.480
Lovely.

237
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.380
Is that all I can click on.

238
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.930
I walk through.

239
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.800
The door closes.

240
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.120
I can't click on it from here.

241
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.110
I get close enough and I can open the door.

242
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.500
We now have locking doors.

243
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.070
Awesome lets tiny this up a little bit.

244
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.180
So I'm gonna make a brand new.

245
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:54.080
No tuti call it doors and put this door as a child of that and move this door to a bothell WALL So let's

246
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.020
put it just beneath floors.

247
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.720
Alex.

248
00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:03.290
So now when this opens it should slide into the wall as opposed to hovering over it.

249
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.970
There it is.

250
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.490
Outstanding.

251
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.280
OK.

252
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:17.200
One more thing I'd like to do I want to add some sound effects one sound effect when the door opens

253
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:24.250
and one when it closes and I can do this in a script I can go into the script audio stream player dot

254
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.080
stream and stream in here.

255
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.200
However timing that's going to be a little annoying.

256
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.650
So instead I'm a set up in the animation player.

257
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.850
First let's get out a script for you x not using script and let's go look at our sound effects and our

258
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.210
sound effects are right here.

259
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.260
I've given you some options.

260
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.510
I've got four different door close sounds and two to four door opens.

261
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.240
I'm sure these door close one door open one.

262
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.380
But feel free to use whichever you want.

263
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.680
And I'm going to create some keys for the audio stream player in animation play.

264
00:13:54.730 --> 00:14:00.050
If we go to the audio stream player today you'll see there's a stream and a stream can be loaded and

265
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.010
I will load in my first sound effect and that's going to be.

266
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:11.050
Door open door open one of g.g. and then I'm on to create a key for that and I'm going to reset this

267
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:18.040
key at the two second mark somewhere loading a different sound effect to simply door close one and pull

268
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.890
a key here.

269
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.780
Then I'm going to put in a plane.

270
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:29.450
So let's go back to the beginning of the animation and tell it you're playing a key that month's this

271
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:34.670
animation runs it all run playing as a key as well as the street so it knows.

272
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.130
Play this sound.

273
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.540
It's got to stop playing at the one second Mark.

274
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.410
I can tweak that vaniman just put a key there put another key in three seconds.

275
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.580
Put playing key on and switch it off at 4 seconds.

276
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.400
I might have to tweak these because of these sound effects A short of a second they might loop.

277
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.730
Let's find out.

278
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.690
That's pretty good right.

279
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.510
So if there's anything wrong there you can move these around you can change your steps to zero point

280
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:11.300
five and just drag the player or stop Keys where you need them.

281
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.960
But look I've got door opens.

282
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:22.940
Door closes and if I wanted to change the times if any of these I could so the door closed much faster.

283
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.190
Great.

284
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:34.590
One more thing we should do all we hear is we should check that both of our collision masts are right.

285
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:41.490
Right now I've got the doors Sprite collision mask working great so I've got it on to rain and it's

286
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.470
interacting with players security cameras and guards.

287
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.210
But this detection area should only be interact with the player.

288
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.850
It is not a player it is not part of the touraine.

289
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:57.760
I don't want it to interact with a train and it can only interact with the player or the guards.

290
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.270
The guards have to be able to enter this area.

291
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.810
So let's see how that works.

292
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.790
I hear a door.

293
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.670
Outstanding.

294
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.300
Okay.

295
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.050
And that brings us to the end of this video.

296
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:21.990
In this video we'll looked at how to use input event to detect mouse clicks as opposed to input which

297
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.530
will just detect has the mouse been pressed.

298
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.370
We looked at changing the door behaviour depending on who uses it and we looked at how to change audio

299
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.320
sources in animation player.

300
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.640
Fantastic work and I'll see you in the next video.
