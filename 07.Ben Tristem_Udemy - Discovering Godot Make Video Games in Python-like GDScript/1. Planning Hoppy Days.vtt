Hello wonderful God people and here I am in this video we're going to start working on our next game.

2
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.700
So what we need to do is plan Hoppy those.

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.540
So what's holliday's Hobby days is going to be a cute 2D platformer involving a cute little rabbit.

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.100
I have a little brevet finger puppet here to help me along.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.250
It was inspired by a song called I think I'm a bunny which I invite you to look up on YouTube and what's

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.970
going to happen is we're going to guide this cute little pink rabbit across the land to safety.

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.900
So before we start any coding Let's design the concept of the going what do we want to happen in hollidays.

8
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.860
I'd like to start with the essential experience.

9
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460
For me this is the most important part of the game.

10
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.670
Basically it's how what do I want the player to feel.

11
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.160
Every other game a decision has to come back down to that for me.

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.800
So my gameplay experience is this where a cute bunny who uses speed and agility to get through a dangerous

13
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.520
world to the carrot at the end of the game whatever it might be.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.080
Right.

15
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.910
OK.

16
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.690
Key words.

17
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.410
Cute.

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.540
Speed agility and dangerous world.

19
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.840
So if I want to isolate my social experience that's what it is.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.980
So how is that going to translate to gameplay.

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.540
Well if we're cute I don't want to be able to attack enemies.

22
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
To me that's the antithesis of cute realize you can have cute and violent but that's not what I'm doing

23
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.300
here right.

24
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.010
I don't want the bunny to be able to jump Mario style on top of an NPC and defeat it.

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.680
I want you to have to avoid it.

26
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.620
Let's use your amazing bunny powers of speed and agility.

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.350
I want unlimited lives so you can touch something hazardous whether it's something in the train or an

28
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.920
NPC and lose a life but you don't necessarily lose the game for that to work.

29
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.370
I want fast movement and high jumps from the agility and the speed has to be key.

30
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.810
Right.

31
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.300
So this is all about being a bunny moving at high speed through this amazingly dangerous world that's

32
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.610
trying to kill you but just being too fast and jumpy and cute.

33
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.940
For that to be a problem I also like the idea of these coins.

34
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.440
This is you know the old staple which I believe harkens back to sonic maybe not the game to it before

35
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.620
but for me to always be sonic.

36
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.910
If you get enough coins you can earn another life right so there's reason to tempt the players to make

37
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.740
more dangerous choices than just going through the level at the most optimal path.

38
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.390
As you can see with this very stylized look all of these assets once again from Kenny and I'll link

39
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.130
you to the repository that we get it from a we will be refining it cut down version of this and Kenny

40
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.690
as it always does does fantastic work with Creative Commons 0 licences which means you can use it without

41
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.940
attribution.

42
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.590
You can use it commercially and use it for education you can do whatever you want with it right.

43
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.990
They're yours to use.

44
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.910
So thank you Kenny fantastic work.

45
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.740
So with all that said let's get to it.

46
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.680
I'll see you in the next video.

47
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.390
Start building this game together.
