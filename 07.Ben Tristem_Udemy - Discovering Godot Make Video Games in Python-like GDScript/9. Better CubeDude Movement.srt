00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,780
Halloween fantastic people in this video we're going make CUPE do move more naturally as a few things

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,430
want to do and here's why.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,530
Here's my cube dude.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,240
When we get moving around.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,470
Right now he just kind of slides around the place Ray doesn't face the direction he wants he is an animator

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,030
he looks like one of those old football table toys.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,130
I suppose the kid that had like magnets on the edge of a stick and move the stick and the kaggwa just

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,080
move like this.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,710
Also you'll notice when I move diagonally a lot faster than when I go in the cardinal directions.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,900
So here's what we're doing.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,020
We're going to animate cube dude.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,370
When cube dude moves.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,270
Q Did she actually move.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,660
Were going to face forward Mabel Q Do is always facing the direction that he's moving in and will then

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,660
be consistent when ever we're moving in any direction so I'm moving up.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,480
That should be the same speed is if I move up and right.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,880
So let's start with the simple thing.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,600
If you look at our kudu scene you'll notice that it automatically came in with an animation player right.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,190
It has two animations that are actually the same animation as a problem.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,590
The file doesn't actually matter which when you use a good press play and he animates.

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,180
And if we wanted to we could loop the animation so this loop and press play.

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,870
And Q Did a little walk.

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,790
So all I need to do is go into a cube dude go into the script and let's make this nice big.

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,110
I need to see all the rest stuff and I'm not going to put this in physics process because this is not

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,010
a physics calculation writes It's gonna happen on each tech.

26
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,220
So amadou's and make a process function.

27
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,970
And that's going to be called an impact and effect.

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,950
I have an early challenge fees of realigns the end of the script as make some room and right here function

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:05,350
eliminate my challenge to you is to make cube dude animated when moving again.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,650
So see if you can figure out how to make you do animator using the animation player.

31
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,170
Actually it should be pretty easy but only when he's moving.

32
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,240
Possibly to give that a shot and when you're ready come back and I'll show you my solution.

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,940
Mark Mack.

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,200
So first let's actually just test the animations of a pick animation player.

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,810
Play.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,160
And that one.

37
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,510
Now animation player is a node within the player right so we already have access to that press save.

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,200
And now we're expecting his cube dude should be running.

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,360
Except he's not running.

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,270
Why is he not running.

41
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,210
So where do is an added condition.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:54,050
If animation player is playing or it will actually want to do the opposite to that.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,860
So if not animation play is playing.

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,660
Then play the walk.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,690
See how that works.

46
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,880
Cute dude is jogging on the spot.

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,310
I've also got the pitch a little bit low.

48
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,030
Or is collisions a little bit high and hovering above the ground a little bit.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,470
But we're after a good start.

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,320
I only want this to happen when he's moving.

51
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,600
Well let's make this nice some big.

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,000
We have motion here with motion and motion y that's a vector right.

53
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,860
In fact we don't have one we have set because of 3.

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,560
I can find the length of that right so it's a vector and if I can remember the Despicable Me movie vector

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,910
is a motion with magnitude right so it's a direction and magnitude.

56
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,300
Well what I can do is if I can go.

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,420
If motion dot or line.

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,690
Right so if there is a length that is greater than zero.

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,700
Do that while telling it is whatever size motion is if that size is greater than zero move.

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,870
Now I should not be using greater than zero.

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,000
I shall be using Epsilon.

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,580
Epsilon is a mathematical term for the smallest value above zero.

63
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,140
However Epsilon doesn't exist in God.

64
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,250
Some have to define this so for now I'm just going to go.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,810
Constant.

66
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,210
So on.

67
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,260
He calls zero point zero zero as a as reserves are one.

68
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,250
Why am I doing this.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,220
Because we might have a situation where we're not quite zero or almost zero.

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,030
We have flickering so let's see if that works.

71
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,450
It's not moving moving.

72
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,900
He's not stopping now.

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,620
So I need to do is go down to here and say else.

74
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,870
So if the motion length is Epsilon or smaller.

75
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,770
Animation player dot stop.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,210
Let's give that a shot.

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,150
Is my cube dude.

78
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,660
He moves.

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,940
He stops.

80
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,220
OK.

81
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,140
Looking good.

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,760
Blair moonwalking.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,280
You know what.

84
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,700
I might actually change the collision shape so that it's right by his feet.

85
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,540
Back to kudu in 3D.

86
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,970
And let's zoom down by your feet actually.

87
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,810
Collision shape isn't too bad is Atlas.

88
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:18,350
It might be our pichler signal that the Petsch over to pitch because our collision shape.

89
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,580
There it is.

90
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,110
See it.

91
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,540
Okay.

92
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,200
So our collision shape is zero point one metre so 10 centimetres.

93
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,200
But our plane doesn't have a depth so if it's not right at the top it's going to weigh it.

94
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,980
And it just keeps moving and I think we should move the meche instance.

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:45,070
Up to in fact I know this don't I need to make it up to zero point to noticer point one light because

96
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,450
that's the height of the collision shape.

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,880
OK.

98
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,760
This press play.

99
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,660
And the shadow actually comes to the feet and the character is not hovering.

100
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,120
Awesome.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,470
And look the ball's in the right place.

102
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,390
Everything is looking much much shinier.

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,930
Groovier whatever it's not.

104
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,410
I mean is it shiny.

105
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,310
Okay.

106
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,790
So that's Section 1 with with moved cube dude right we've animated him.

107
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,220
Now let's take you dude facing in the right direction for you that let's make sure that the camera could

108
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,970
see everything because I'd like to see the edges of the pitch.

109
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,380
I almost had stage and I why I'm thinking in terms of stages right now I think because we just talked

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,720
about lighting plays in this lighting camera I guess.

111
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:32,150
And look my transform I want to rotate the camera only to rotate it on the x axis by a negative 10 maybe.

112
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,070
And let's move it back so I will move you to a height of Fiver's looking nice and high.

113
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,170
Actually rotate them.

114
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:46,790
Negative 15 on the X and maybe move it back a bit on the z axis that's moving back to 15.

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,610
Might work listicle.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,940
A bit too far.

117
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,420
You know it's small so it moves closer.

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,300
It's moving to a set of 12.

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,000
How's that.

120
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,990
Well I'm trying to do is see just enough of the corner and I don't lose Cupid.

121
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,790
But right now I am losing Q dude.

122
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,800
Yeah he's lost so that's too far too close for other strife.

123
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,070
14 maybe.

124
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,930
Better.

125
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,740
I could see him.

127
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,560
It's analysis analysis kudu to face the direction he's moving on.

128
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,450
Let's go into the script and what we do is in the process make a face forward as a brand new animation

129
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,860
copy that not animation it's a function and under function an inmate which is an animation and when

130
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,180
a go function face forward.

131
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,670
OK.

132
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,290
So what does this do.

133
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,450
This rotates the character we're going to look at to do this and this is going to be important if we're

134
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,190
changing direction.

135
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,350
So rather than use if motion length is greater than epsilon one of the do say if not motion.

136
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,530
X is zero.

137
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,200
Right.

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,710
So if the change in horizontal in our left right movement or left right movement is zero or not.

139
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,140
Motion dot Z is zero.

140
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,540
So if one is changing all the other it's changing.

141
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,270
And what about do we want to look at.

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,490
Space more space here that we can look at which is a lot of function.

143
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,020
Now look in 3-d Slightly different we have to worry about what Up is.

144
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,580
And the reason is we could rotate when we're looking we don't want to do that one fixed in one direction.

145
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,760
What are we looking at we're not looking in an object we're looking at a direction we're looking at

146
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,400
a vector right so vector 3.

147
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,220
We need motion dot X on the x x is zero on the y axis.

148
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,950
I'm not looking up or down at all to tilt motion dot the set.

149
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,450
Motion is part of move and slide and that's being reported.

150
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,660
The frame behind where we are now.

151
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,050
I don't want to look the direction we are we have come from.

152
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,220
I want to look away from it.

153
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,100
Why should I use negative waves.

154
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,000
Negative motion Z and negative motion X not going negative 0 on the Y because that's pointless.

155
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,420
And then I need to put popin I could put vector 3.

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,200
But if we defined as a constant It's right here.

157
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,960
OK now if I've done that correctly the Pressplay cube dude should now face the correct direction.

158
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,210
I recently had a rotating never look looking good.

159
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,340
Now there's one more thing.

160
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,800
He's moving faster and diagonals.

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,510
Why is he moving faster and dying.

162
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,840
Well because.

163
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,210
Well because Pythagoras's really is.

164
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,030
Here's what's happening.

165
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,600
I have here an X and a z value.

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,880
Right so this one here is forward.

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,670
It is not a top down view.

168
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,010
So if I press up are moving up by speed.

169
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,000
If I move right.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Moving right by speed.

171
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,650
If I press both what we're doing is we're moving both up and then moving twice speed.

172
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,700
Now if I was to draw an intersection here what you'd see is that this is clearly not the same length

173
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,470
I would expect to stop here.

174
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,080
The mathematics work is something like one point for what we need to do is normalize this and we can

175
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,490
do that pretty easily.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,590
We are going to go in to move and slide is motion dot normalized.

177
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,300
What does that mean.

178
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,680
It means bring this back down to 1 OK so that makes sense but now I press play.

179
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,140
I have normalized the wrong value.

180
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,050
I just change the actual movement to 1 so we can do a little work around.

181
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,920
What I do is replace every instance of speed here with the number 1 and then put in motion to normalize

182
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,460
tines speed and put this in brackets.

183
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,320
So in those That's one calculation.

184
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,720
And let's see what that does.

185
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
Another diagonal up.

186
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,000
Works the same speed as everything else.

187
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,720
But now you've got a messed up the face form so let's go face Ford is now doing motion and it's multiply

188
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,470
that by speed.

189
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,120
So right here no not right here at the outside of this same speed.

190
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,940
You don't multiply zero times speakers.

191
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,720
That's weird.

192
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,970
That's Pressplay.

193
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,420
And now keep dood.

194
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,740
Look at the direction is travelling in not Adamic when he's not moving and only look the direction it's

195
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,400
travelling in.

196
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,690
The angles are the same speeds everything else and we have the start of a refund.

197
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,320
Now we could change the speed freezes and export variable.

198
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,520
We could change the camera angle but were already off to a great start.

199
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,850
One might do is make the ball a little lighter Let's do that real quick before we sign out.

200
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,810
I feel like doing that.

201
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,710
Let's go to the ball and scroll up here.

202
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,670
The mass is one.

203
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,490
No it's not zero point five.

204
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,810
Let's add some bounciness to it.

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
It's has at the zero point five bounciness.

206
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:45,500
Knowing how much better another ball zooms along I zoom along we have a fast frantic game with a bouncy

207
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,740
ball can even bounce.

208
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,730
If we wanted different to go crazy let's go crazy let's make the full bounciness.

209
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,940
Awesome.

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
And that brings us to the end of this video.

211
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,330
In this video we've had a very quick sort of sajan around Pythagoras's because I'm not really great

212
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,830
at John mitre over looked at how to normalize affecter how to make a character face the direction it's

213
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,720
moving in.

214
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,310
And you know how to use animation player in 3D.

215
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,840
And the answer is exactly as you were in 2D.

216
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,370
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
