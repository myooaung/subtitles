00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.030
Welcome back lovely God people in this video in a finished building the pitch and to do that we need

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.280
to figure out what we need.

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.700
We're going to be playing kick about football soccer whatever we want to call it some sports thing.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.710
Our picture's going to need some goals right.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.360
We need something to kick the ball into to score a point.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.440
But we also need boundary walls.

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.600
We want to make sure that the ball doesn't fall outside the pitch.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.600
We also need to make the pitch a lot more beautiful but we're not going to do that and viscerally I

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.250
wouldn't do that the next one which are build the pitch beautification comes later.

10
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.900
First thing I do is I'm going to go to my models and open goal.

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.320
And here we have Golden DHT and openness as a new inherited scene.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.910
You'll notice here that I've forgotten to rename it from scene roots.

13
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.460
I'm going to call this gold.

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.960
And you also notice that we already have materials applied there are two materials going some that save

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.520
this as a scene as you call it gold.

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.400
Before we open these materials you notice that the green of the gold is shine quite clearly whereas

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.250
the white of the net isn't.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.410
Let's take a look at why.

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.300
If I open the gold material and scroll down you'll see that I've got this option called emission turned

20
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.770
on.

21
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.780
Well that's doing is emitting light emitting light in the colour of emission here at full energy.

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.110
So even when it's dark this is going to go green.

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.930
I could protect you here as well and not doing it.

24
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.350
Now the reason I've done this is later in the game when the player scores a goal the lights are going

25
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770
to dim and I want the goals to still be visible.

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.910
If we wanted to we could also do the net material so I could go in to emission enable it turned a little

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.230
white and say what's a good energy zero point five.

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.490
And that will show quite clearly.

29
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.160
So if you wanted to show go ahead and leave the mission off now now what we have here is we have a Rutan

30
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.020
code which is this which is just a space within which we have these two meshes.

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.010
I would like this to be a static body.

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.280
So I'm going to change the type to static body.

33
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.790
And now we have an issue right.

34
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.010
The issue is we need collision but I can't just put a simple box in because I want the ball to pass

35
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.020
through the archway and stop at the nets.

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.950
His women do select the golf mesh itself not the static body and repress mash and then I have these

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.190
options.

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
Now I want this to be a sibling because I want it to be at the same level as the goal I don't want it

39
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.430
to be one level down because the top layer the root node is ours is the parent.

40
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.720
That's what needs the static body.

41
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.980
I've got two options here but trimmer mesh and compex.

42
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.590
Let's talk very quickly about what a convex polygon is.

43
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.890
OK so let's say we have a simple shape right.

44
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.200
And I want to draw a line through it.

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.360
The idea is if I draw a simple line I can always pass through two points in the middle where I draw

46
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.870
this line.

47
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
I will always pass two points.

48
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.900
That is what we call a convex polygon a Trimix polygon doesn't follow those rules.

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.600
So for example I might only get two but I might get more than that right so here I have four.

50
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.190
So convex is great for simple balkhi polygon shapes right maybe a pyramid maybe a cube but when I've

51
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.910
got lots and lots of intricate details.

52
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.820
I'm only using trite Nash.

53
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.120
So with that in mind I think it's pretty clear what we need.

54
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.950
We need a trimmest polygon.

55
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.220
So I'm going to just hit create trainer SH collision sibling and there it is there a collision.

56
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.500
Also do the same thing for the net gain.

57
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.570
So I'm going to click on some mesh and here it doesn't really matter of as a child or a sibling so let's

58
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.820
just do differently less do the child.

59
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.110
And again this is a be Trimix.

60
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.870
Now you'll notice when I look at it I can't actually see it clearly.

61
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.720
Try is quite intricate and complicated in its final shape.

62
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.760
So as a result it can be quite hard to see it against the goal but I've never has collision in it.

63
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.190
Why do you want to do is make sure from that collision layers such the side what we are.

64
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.150
We are part of the pitch.

65
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.140
That's fine.

66
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.130
We want to stop the ball and probably the players.

67
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.140
I don't think I want the players going through the goal.

68
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.880
I should do the same with the Net and on the ball going through the net.

69
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.630
The reason is I don't want the ball to come in from the side here.

70
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.990
And still score a goal.

71
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.640
So let's go to the static body under the net and just do the same thing.

72
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.550
You want your part of the pitch.

73
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.700
You stop the ball and the players don't interact with pitch animous save that cup and now we can bring

74
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.580
in our goals.

75
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.250
I want to go to the root node and make a brand new node body and call this goals and as a child of this

76
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.240
instance and the goal scenes got there and it's some show that move that for now just nice and rough

77
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.980
and ready.

78
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.170
Great.

79
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.970
OK.

80
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.300
So I want this goal to be in line with these lies you will notice by the way because here's a hand drawn

81
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.970
text that I made it's not perfectly centred.

82
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.130
I know I'm sorry.

83
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.040
So let's get this a bit better.

84
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.790
I want to move to there.

85
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.040
And that's looking pretty good.

86
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.840
I also think I might need to resize the picture before and after the second go.

87
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.090
I'm going to rename it a gold one.

88
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.170
I want to duplicate it.

89
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.630
And we now have got to move this one over here and rotated against a transform rotation degrees 90 and

90
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.690
go one isn't actually perfectly on it.

91
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.190
Let's take a look at the transform on the y axis 90 degree rotation.

92
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.010
Much better.

93
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.750
And let's move to behind these lines for now.

94
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.790
I think the pitch is actually a okay size okay.

95
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.680
What I do here.

96
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.790
Oh yeah man minus 90 not 90.

97
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.300
There it is.

98
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.840
So then that actually comes slight you.

99
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.680
Some it the pitcher bit bigger.

100
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.510
So I go into my kitchen and let's see into them meshing instance itself.

101
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.220
I'm not could you just scale up the pitch because if I do that it's going to start applying scale to

102
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.810
collision shape.

103
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.870
And that's where you start going we had collision bucks so let's go to emersion since click on a mash

104
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.170
and our current size is 20 by 15.

105
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.540
So I think maybe 22 by 16.

106
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.420
Save that.

107
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.790
I have to save it or it won't apply as they go looking again.

108
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.820
Looking a bit better some of the goal of it here.

109
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.400
And gold too.

110
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.580
Over here.

111
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.520
Great.

112
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.200
Now go back into the pitch and take a look at the collision the collision doesn't go to the end so if

113
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.850
a player walks to the edge of the pitch that probably in a fall off the ball certainly will feel as

114
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.730
good a collision shape.

115
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.720
And I'm just going to make that a bit bigger.

116
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.780
So it is now what has that 11 by 9 8.

117
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.690
Obviously 16 to Allah 2 is not 9.

118
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.710
I can MAF one more thing also do we now have these two goals and the same colour.

119
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.770
Now we are going to be changing one of the players either player 1 player 2 to blue.

120
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.660
I'm going to put player 1 in blues and take this gold here and I want to change the material.

121
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.490
First thing is to do is make a material work.

122
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.430
Let's rename gold material to go green

123
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.080
and now want to duplicate it.

124
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.850
And the new material is going to be called to do goldbloom.

125
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.780
It's open go blue actually make it blue.

126
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.320
Summer pick a nice deep but still quite bright blue skies.

127
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.990
And you know what let's copy the raw.

128
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.200
So copy the hex code for it and I can save it.

129
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.340
But if you look carefully there's a sort of green glow around the outside because it's emitting green

130
00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:01.030
so that sort of paste that hex code I just took in and now it's going to emit blue when I save it you

131
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.880
probably can't see on my screen but my new yours it'll now niblo gets a gold one.

132
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.520
I need to apply this material.

133
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.400
I only want to apply it to this instance.

134
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.700
I don't want to change all instances of gold to green sort of thing do we go to editable children.

135
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.600
I'm going to find the gold mesh itself and on material I'm just going to drag it in blue.

136
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.960
Save that and let's press play just to make sure.

137
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.810
Have a blue gold and a gringo look.

138
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.530
They're glowing.

139
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:36.340
We have an unlit clear background at a player who can't hit the goal.

140
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.890
The boeken out into the goal and will stop them.

141
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.270
But we still fall off the edge.

142
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.000
Which brings me to the challenge.

143
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.300
I'd like you to enclose the pitch.

144
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.520
I want you to find a way of stopping the ball and the players falling off the pitch has a few different

145
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.720
ways you could do this.

146
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.640
So pause the video make sure that the ball and the players can't fall off the pitch and when you're

147
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.850
satisfied come back and I'll show you my solution.

148
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.320
And welcome back.

149
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.140
OK.

150
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.190
So there's a few different ways we can do this but what I'm gonna do is I'm a creep.

151
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.490
Boundary walls.

152
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:19.530
Now if I make a note here and call this boundary's because that seems like a good name for it I can

153
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.460
just add a collision and it'll work fine.

154
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.900
I can give that a box and move that over.

155
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.910
The problem is when I have several of these they can be quite hard to see sallus extant than out and

156
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.310
just duplicate it and put another one here.

157
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.760
Now there is a time later we were actually in a do this and that's going make it very different as you

158
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:50.340
were doing so instead of that it leads to instead of that what I'm to do is create a match and make

159
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.030
this a cube.

160
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.720
But when I move the cube over to the edge of the map and let's scale the mesh itself.

161
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.090
So on the X I want 22 I think we said on a Y.

162
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.870
That's the height and I put this as a key execs as good.

163
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.540
You can see three right now because it's actually balogun Lift in a minute and on the Zeds you can leave

164
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.770
that as to why mylene is too.

165
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.100
Because if the closure is nice some big it'll pick up the ball.

166
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.050
Now we don't yet have a clear shape which cannot bring that back a little bit.

167
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:33.920
In fact I should do that by positioning it was going to transform is going to be minus 9 minus 9.

168
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.740
Much better.

169
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.220
Let's bring it up slightly to bring this up by 3.

170
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:38.870
I look good.

171
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.890
Yeah now the ball could go higher than this so what do we say we're going to go higher and make this

172
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.600
height of 10 not have sex so the y axis 10 high.

173
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.410
Great.

174
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.950
And here's a boundary wall.

175
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.930
Now I'm gonna rename this to back

176
00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.950
and to make it nice and simple.

177
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:07.620
I'm going to mash create convex static body and I'm going to give up and to minimize that and duplicate

178
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.760
my back wall call this one front wall and just move that.

179
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.850
Going to transform not minus 9 your 9.

180
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.230
Now the next one I don't want to duplicate because if I change the propolis for any of these it'll change

181
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.770
for all of them.

182
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.340
So instead let's just make one go back to boundary's get a mesh bag.

183
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:37.540
A box la la movie of here for now and let's see our Mash is going to be exis too.

184
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.080
Why is 10 and z should be 16 I believe.

185
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.350
Is that good.

186
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.980
No not covering the corners that could be a problem later I think.

187
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.100
Probably fine.

188
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.270
And let's see.

189
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.340
Translation So any minus 12.

190
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.220
And we need we've got a height of 10.

191
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.810
We're halfway through this winter lifted by 5 and that should be pretty good.

192
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:06.780
So that's our left wall and we generate a convex static body for that to duplicate that make a right

193
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.070
wall and just move that over here.

194
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.930
And I should probably just type in X.

195
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:15.530
OK.

196
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.300
So now we have these walls we can't see anything.

197
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.730
All I do is hide them.

198
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:24.990
But the collision should still be there to check that Pressplay play so I can move the player around.

199
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.420
He kind of needs some polish will do that soon.

200
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.960
And the ball bounces a little difficult as you are doing.

201
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.920
I might actually give the ball an emissions.

202
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.900
Let's go in to with our ball.

203
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.470
There is so his ball going to click on a mesh instance.

204
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.990
Let's click on MASH and open the material.

205
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.890
Let's give it some mission.

206
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.990
So what's the colour of got here.

207
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.510
Copy that and into a mission enable it.

208
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:55.020
PACE the colour in that seems quite bright So let's put that at zero point five and get back in the

209
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.120
game again.

210
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.190
And now we could see the ball.

211
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.610
Now we might switch that off later.

212
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.110
But we now have a ball that can go in there.

213
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.150
Now the ball is getting stuck in a net.

214
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.220
But don't worry later on we the ADD detection here really is an area which liken it to even more area.

215
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.720
And I'll go there.

216
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.230
One thing that can happen and to show this any to pull my camera back just back a bit was back here

217
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.000
it is Pressplay.

218
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.760
I can get the ball into the corner and get it stuck right.

219
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.460
And that's going me a little annoying.

220
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.170
So what I do want to do is add more boundaries.

221
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.990
So I'm going to duplicate all of these walls and take back to show backwell too.

222
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.340
And I'm going to move that one.

223
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.700
Do do do.

224
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.800
Here they are right up to this line and I can see the line right there and do the same with front wall

225
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.240
too.

226
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.860
So I don't need back to front wall to their lives.

227
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.730
And that goes there.

228
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.120
And let's do the same with left wall to show you.

229
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.280
You're going to go.

230
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.760
Not all the way up the line this time because I do want the ball to cross.

231
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.350
And the same with one or two.

232
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:21.420
So just like so OK now I've just added more walls that the player can't go through.

233
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.150
And I don't want that.

234
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.000
I want to stop the ball and not the player.

235
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.200
So we need to actually change a clearness units get into there and get a static body for each.

236
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:36.460
So one to do is pick all of my twos I can running them in about four hours empties as a whole control

237
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.700
as I select all the static.

238
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.040
Well he's got a collision.

239
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.530
OK.

240
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.090
You are part of the pitch.

241
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.250
You don't stop the pitch.

242
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.190
You stop the ball but not the players.

243
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.450
In fact would probably take you off pitch entirely because then the ball.

244
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.370
Play won't interact with that and just double check your in the ball not players.

245
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:58.380
Now it's the same with all the ones that are designed to stop the player so I'm there to minimise all

246
00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.630
that are need.

247
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:08.430
Lou Lou I'm going to open up right wall left wall front wall back wall select the static bodies hoddy

248
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.280
control.

249
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.940
Let's get a collision.

250
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.710
You're not the pitch.

251
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.920
And we could see this was pitch and you missed the player.

252
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.410
And just in case a softball to get hide all of these.

253
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:32.350
And now we press play the ball will stop against the line and the player once I can always get into

254
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:37.300
the corner if the ball gets there too slowly and get the ball out and we're off to a really good start

255
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.480
now it's still a little bit of work to done we need to find a good camera position.

256
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.130
We need to make this look better when have our second player but we have got the basics of our game

257
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.490
looking good which brings us to the end of the video.

258
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.420
In this video we've looked at how to generate an automatic collision measure we've made both try Nash

259
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:58.030
and concave measures gleaming concave convex travelling one of those two and we've looked at duplicate

260
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.300
customize materials.

261
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.730
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
