00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello again lovely God to be born in this video we're going to get some better information blending

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,090
in at the moment.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,440
We're using animation tree player to blend between Idol and move them as we move them move closer to

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,130
the move animation to we're fully there.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,560
And when we stop and move slowly to the idol well not slowly but gradually.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,270
However those aren't the only animations we want.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,080
I also want something for search or in fact not search but reload and punch or not so much punch as

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,910
throw food.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,550
Now we have the animations but I want to blend them in.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,990
So we're going to use a blend three note.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,970
Let's take a look at that.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,880
I we get into godda and open my placing and all you do is inside the armature in the animation tree.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,390
I mean look at the animations we've got now currently is going to move these around a little bit.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,980
We've got our idol animation and our run animation and I want to more.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,760
So I want to bring in two more animations and let's rename them so this one is going to be reloaded

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:13,350
and I'm going to live down here and this one is going to be thrown at him and it's going to live up

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,720
here.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,930
Now clearly we can't just drag these into the blench too.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,980
So I would do is bring in a blend three before I go any further.

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,540
A quick reminder if you want to look this up its pretty easy going a Scripps press classes and type

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,620
in animation tree player which is right there it is.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,630
I we have it up in the background and you can find all the documentation.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,630
However that's not what I'm doing right now.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,900
What I want to do is to intercept this move state before it gets that out on a right click on out.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:56,010
Do you disconnect and drag the move to a position then three will work.

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,340
Very much like a blend.

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:04,730
But instead of going from zero to one it'll go from negative one to positive one negative one.

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,850
Is this B minus state positive one is this B plus state.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,700
And you will notice as we mentioned before you cannot run B minus and B plus at the same time.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,510
Before going any further let's put the actual animations in so.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,420
Punch is easing with the throw and working is on using for reload.

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,500
And I have to connect this to the output.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,570
Otherwise it's good luck.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,650
Why has nothing to do anything at all.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:37,590
Okay animation tree is valid unslung save that for now and listicle I can blend two wards reload if

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,340
I can grab it connec up and towards punch and whatever I'm doing with movement.

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,500
Assuming I'm not fully at negative 1 or positive one will also come through is a little fiddly grabbing

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,230
this control thing but that's okay.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,910
So those are our states.

41
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,110
What's going to rename this blend three months running this to action.

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,310
So we have a very simple state machine.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,140
We have a move which is figuring out how fast between idle and run we are and we have action which is

44
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,360
figure out how far between punch or rather throw move and reload.

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,900
We and all of these will translate into this output.

46
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,240
So this is what's going to be play rate.

47
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,610
So now I can close.

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,120
May not leave it up in the background of keys in case I need to look anything up but I'm going to open

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,350
the player script into scripts.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,350
And in distraction free mode.

51
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,080
All right.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,130
Very first thing I need.

53
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,950
I want a new animation variable.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,050
Now we have a movie State.

55
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,200
I want an animation state and I don't know what actions state has what they need.

56
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,230
Nation state is the wrong word.

57
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,370
A set that is zero.

58
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,510
The default is Europe lets comments it the same way we get up here.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,690
Negative One is throw.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,340
Zero is move.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,130
Slash fiedel is really idle slash move isn't it.

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,500
Just keep this consistent idle slash move and a positive one is reload.

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:20,070
I'm also in need some blend rates so let's make a new one for reload planned out for now let's keep

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,070
it the same as the run so zero point one.

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,350
We'll come back here in a little while and I also want to draw attention to can refill will be using

66
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,600
that in a bit.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,580
However right now it's jumped out to the animation function and rather than scroll through them all.

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,980
I'm just going to click on an.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,470
Over here let's refresh ourselves on how this works so we were defining what anime is and it's just

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,790
the animation tree player which is within armature.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,910
Now we are going to bring in a different armature depending on which character we are using later on.

72
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,240
But the script should still work for both so that's good.

73
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,020
Now we're checking how much he's moving.

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,040
If you're moving more than the minimum move towards then move state.

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,370
If not move towards the idle state and then we're clamping that between 0 and 1 so you can never go

76
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,550
below zero because that's what There's plenty and it's OK.

77
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,680
So first thing what to do is I want to bring in a reload animation and we have this very handy if I

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,480
can refill.

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,980
And what does that mean.

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,640
It means if you're within a reload area and you don't have full ammunition which is exactly what I want

81
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,200
so action state is going to move towards.

82
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,920
What do we call this we call this reload blunt about why plus because positive one is going to be the

83
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
reload animation.

84
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:43,880
However just like before I need to klamath this action state he calls clamp and we are closing the action

85
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,790
value.

86
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,760
Now unlike move the minimum is going to be negative one right because negative one is our punch animation

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,860
and our maximum value is positive one which is just going to be one and only to write positive one.

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,100
Also like move I don't have this L state in here.

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,790
Instead I'm going to use a Lerp.

90
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,050
So what can happen is every frame I'm going to try in move towards zero.

91
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,470
So I'm going to go action state.

92
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,240
He calls Lerp lady interpret.

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,800
And what are we learning.

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,380
Well we're loving the action rate action state rather not rate.

95
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,990
And we are trying to move toward zero.

96
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,220
So every frame if you can move towards zero and how much you to move by one need a new constant hit

97
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,590
on time and then call this action reset.

98
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,040
Copy that and move right back to the top is in control.

99
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,760
And it's going to live here.

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,410
Constant action reset rate.

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,830
And this should be something quite small and I want to call it zero point to five.

102
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,890
Now we might have to tweak that.

103
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,530
Again that's all looking good.

104
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,700
Let's go back to meat.

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,330
Now will this actually change that state.

106
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,380
Right so we need to go to an inmate.

107
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,060
And instead of using blend to node set amount and use the blend three node set out which is exactly

108
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,080
the same.

109
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,880
Let's take a quick look at what I called it.

110
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,340
So where's my animation tree player called it action.

111
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,670
Awesome.

112
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,570
So the string is action and we are blending it towards action state.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,760
And now when I press play assuming I have done everything correctly.

114
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,210
Okay now this love is way too high.

115
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,190
It is changing the animation so one to do is I'm going to reset that lab to a lower amount.

116
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,150
So I actually say reset is going to be zero points.

117
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,380
You know what should probably be lower than the fundamental unit.

118
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,660
That's problem my problem.

119
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,900
Probably my problem.

120
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,420
One zero point zero five.

121
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,960
Let's see how that works.

122
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm going like I'm out of there.

123
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,650
And he stands up.

124
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,270
And again I can tweak all these values and I've got that weird stuttering leg thing every now and again.

125
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,690
So let's tweak that as well so my Minimed blender out about it's going to be zero point one.

126
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,270
But that is looking pretty solid now when I don't have at the moment is an animation playing on a fire.

127
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,910
So that's my challenge to you.

128
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,760
I'd like you to have the play a character play the punch animation when the player presses fire.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,410
So pause the video give that a shot.

130
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,940
When you're ready come on back and I'll show you my solution.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,500
And welcome back.

132
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,050
So I think the simplest thing to do is to go to try to fire a siegert function for it because we have

133
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,560
this thing it can fire and much greater than zero.

134
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,190
And all I need to do is set the actual state to negative one.

135
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,600
Right.

136
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,820
It could just snap there.

137
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,370
Let's see how that looks.

138
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,360
And I'll go into full screen so we can actually see what we're doing and pick up some ammunition.

139
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,170
Press fire look at that.

140
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,150
He's actually throwing the phone down.

141
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,650
So before we go a couple of troubleshooting tips because I have actually had to record this video three

142
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,900
times because little things keep going wrong.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,850
And the most common thing to go wrong if I go to the animation tree player is double check these connections

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,170
because this is a visual note lay out right.

145
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:30,290
It is quite easy to do stuff like this and then not notice that things are connected or if we go to

146
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,600
the armature and open the animation we here.

147
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,040
This is different.

148
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,040
What I had done originally is I changed it all in here and hadn't noticed that had made this unique.

149
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,890
I shouldn't have made this unique.

150
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,360
However I have.

151
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,040
So I'm going to live with it for now.

152
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,160
In this video we've looked at layering multiple blends within a single animation.

153
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,000
Every player we can start building on this in more complicated games have all kinds of fun three dimensional
