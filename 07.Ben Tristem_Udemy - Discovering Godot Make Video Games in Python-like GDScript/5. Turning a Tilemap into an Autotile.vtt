00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.320
Welcome back glorious God.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.210
People in this video we're going to take the concept of a tile map which is that thing we see there's

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.450
platforms and Hoppy days and make them more awesome.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.640
Instead of picking which time we want to use God will pick it for us.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.620
Now there's a pro in a con situation going on here.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.980
Tile maps or auto tiles rather are awesome for a number of reasons.

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.150
Once they're set up they make making the levels much faster and much simpler.

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.960
On top of that you could put collision occlusion and navigation all in one place.

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.150
On the downside the initial set up is fiddly and time consuming and the initial set up is fiddly and

10
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.170
time consuming.

11
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.150
And look I know I've written the same thing three times but it's a big point.

12
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.380
I thought it was worth making properly.

13
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.380
That said auto tiles are really quite fun.

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
So let's make one do that we need a new scene.

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930
The beginning of the process is going to be just like setting up a time lapse the first thing I need

16
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.140
is a Node 2 D My root node.

17
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.500
I can't put a sprite.

18
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.870
It has to be a note hoodie running this on a nameless walls.

19
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.680
Now let's the child know that's going to be a Sprite and if you look under the graphics defects you'll

20
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.040
find spec sheet and tile sheet.

21
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.610
We care about touch it.

22
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.930
There's actually two versions here.

23
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.370
There's a double sized one and a single one I'm asking is the single one but if you have some crazy

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.250
screen resolution where everything tiny.

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.170
By all means use the double sized one.

26
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.190
So I'm going to drag that picture that pian G into the texture.

27
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.120
OK.

28
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.780
Nice any Let's save this scene so save and that goes and scenes and can be called walls.

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.340
Right now what's going to happen is I'm going to need an auto tile for some of these walls.

30
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.450
I'm going to use these orange ones here.

31
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.820
You could if you preferred these big concrete blocks or these little concrete walls or these wooden

32
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.480
wars.

33
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.350
If you want a tile map with four separate Orta tiles for all these you wouldn't need to duplicate the

34
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.990
sprites.

35
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.020
Each Sprite can be its own town map.

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.960
However I only want one.

37
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.400
So I'm just doing one.

38
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.830
You notice there's a single P G with all of the tiles from this asset back including the ones I haven't

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.030
put in.

40
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.770
This is a really great way of saving space right.

41
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.810
You don't need to put hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages and Jay pegs in your game.

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.880
You can use a single Sprite sheet wincing or touch it.

43
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.840
OK.

44
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.110
Let's actually make this a touchy so I'm going to scene convert to tile set and I'm going to make a

45
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.180
new folder I call a tile sets militarism I wrote follow it it's going to call this auto tile walls dot

46
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.520
t r e s.

47
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.550
I have to do dot T Yes.

48
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.550
If I don't do that it'll tell me need an extension.

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.390
So dot texture.

50
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.520
Ressource.

51
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140
OK.

52
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.310
Save that.

53
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.500
Close it.

54
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.020
How do we actually bring this in again.

55
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.360
Well in level 1 let's add a new note and this is going to be a tile map just like you did with hollidays.

56
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.090
I'm going to rename Tom up walls now let's put in the actual taso two ways I can do this.

57
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.900
I can go back to my tile sets folder.

58
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.190
Let me in and drag it that way.

59
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.080
Or if you prefer drop down arrow load file it that way and there it is.

60
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.430
At the moment this is not an auto type.

61
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.550
This is the time and a pretty bad time that right.

62
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.790
That's not what we want.

63
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.400
Let's convert this into an auto type.

64
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.230
If we click on the name of the tart's you'll see that each time we've included which in this case is

65
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.130
one we've only included a single tile which what's called 0 has its own information.

66
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.090
If we click on is auto tile.

67
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.340
Things start changing.

68
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.790
Now let's click on where it says Orta tiles down here and set this up.

69
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.320
First thing this sprite in the corner is just for the person using the auto tile so it's not for the

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.090
players for us so we can see which to tie we doing.

71
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.900
We can set an icon for that the icon for the wall set.

72
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.540
Going to be using.

73
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.200
If you want to old wooden ones you could do that.

74
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.410
I would do this.

75
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.140
Next thing you notice is we have some options here starting at the bottom tile size 64 pixels by 6 or

76
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.740
pixels.

77
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.210
That happens to be the size of each one of these tiles so that's perfect.

78
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.990
I'm not changing that spacing zero.

79
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.720
They're connected.

80
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.160
There is no space between them so I don't need to add any spacing bit mask mode.

81
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.850
Now this is important.

82
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.220
Let's talk about bit mask real quick.

83
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.470
The way Order tiling works is it splits each tile into a small section so we could sink a single tile

84
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.330
like the square here and split into two by two grid or into a three by three grid.

85
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.580
And then what's going to happen is as we draw it it's going to look for where the connecting tiles are

86
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.090
and try and pick the best one based on their shape.

87
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.580
3 by 3 gives us more precision and I'm going to be using that to demonstrate that here.

88
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.840
If I click on if I use the two by two bit mask.

89
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.880
Here's how much of actual control I have.

90
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.200
Not a great deal.

91
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.380
Now we could use this.

92
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.170
But I'm losing quite a lot of detail so I'm going to use this nice broomed thing to clean up and switch

93
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.080
it back to a three by three.

94
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.730
I want to scroll a bit.

95
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.080
My scrollbars missing.

96
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.370
That's fortunate because I have to tell you how to fix that bug.

97
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.200
If you zoom in and out again or out and in again the scroll ball come back.

98
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.680
So let's zoom in.

99
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.990
I only want to look at the bits I want to look at.

100
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.610
By the way we don't need all of these right.

101
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.860
So if you looked down here these ones down here won't be used These are half tiles.

102
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.100
Each of my tiles is the full length so I'm not going to worry about these ones.

103
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.490
I'm also not aware about all of these pillars because they'll all have the same bit mask information.

104
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.690
I'm just left clicking there to put these in and if I do that it'll also between them which isn't really

105
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.170
what I want.

106
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.510
If I use these round ones I'm going to have to set up circular collision which is a bit of a pain so

107
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.470
I'm not gonna use those any of these to square ones.

108
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.690
This one will look more like pillers but the college might be a little off.

109
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.380
But you know what I might use anyway.

110
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:37.200
OK so we need to set up the bit masking what I want to do is I'm going to use left click to draw everywhere

111
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.740
that this wall is now there is actually a wall texture here.

112
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.460
This grey is very close to this blue but everywhere there's grey is where there's bit masking.

113
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.530
It's not where there's collision.

114
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.250
It's just so God can calculate what the connecting tiles what shape.

115
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.060
Part of what should I look like.

116
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.690
So I'm just going to fill all these in and speed up the video while I do it.

117
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.320
Q And that should be all of them now.

118
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
If you make a mistake let see Miss up the square here.

119
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.520
It's going to lead to some errors don't work if it does just go back in.

120
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.490
Fix it safe your scene and then when you go back in it should update automatically.

121
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.790
In fact let's put words error errors in so I can show what that looks like.

122
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.930
So as an error you see there's this little grey bit missing.

123
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.080
If I click on my walls I can draw.

124
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.930
And I've managed to pick an area that one should show up so let's pick a different error.

125
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.660
How are you look at error.

126
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:51.140
OK so when I'm drawing I'm going to get strange effects like this one right.

127
00:07:53.810 --> 00:08:00.370
And what's happening is it's cycling between solid walls that look one way and another to fix that.

128
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.400
I see to go back into auto tile.

129
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.240
Find that error.

130
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.630
And then just edit those tiles and they should all come back nice and easy.

131
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.270
OK so that's our room.

132
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.410
Go start with a real room let's start with a nice simple.

133
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.890
Rectangular a room with some details in it.

134
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:36.230
Perfect creeper in and close that I'll get one hit play.

135
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.840
Couple of things you notice.

136
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.680
One can actually see where the walls are right because this background colour happens to be the same

137
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.710
colour as the wall too.

138
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.750
There's no collision yet.

139
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.950
Let's fix the first problem first.

140
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.270
Also let's put the war work as you see it there.

141
00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:03.700
We're going to project the settings somewhere in here figuring where it is and the environment default

142
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.280
click colour and switch to black just so I can see it.

143
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.320
Now these walls actually pop so I press play.

144
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.410
Much better.

145
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.430
Second thing I need to put some collection in.

146
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.740
Well actually I've messed up that I can let's change that I can.

147
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.110
What a title.

148
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.050
I can't.

149
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.670
Is that correct.

150
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.460
OK.

151
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.500
How do we talk religion.

152
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.310
This is the fiddly bit.

153
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:37.640
So if I press the coalition tab you'll see we have some more options.

154
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.440
The bad news is I can't just paint like I did with this mask on.

155
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.620
Hon the button down and nothing's happening.

156
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.570
I need to set the collision for each tile individually.

157
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.060
There is no way of automating that out of the box that you have to write a tool to do that for you.

158
00:09:53.340 --> 00:10:01.140
However because every single time I'm using is going to have the same collision I can take some shortcuts

159
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.680
if I press this grid button here I'm going to change the grid looks like I can change my steps to 64

160
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.660
by 64.

161
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:15.250
I don't need my collision to be smaller than that because each tile is going to have full collision.

162
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.960
Let's zoom in and show how this works.

163
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.240
If I press the polygon button I can draw this.

164
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:30.630
This is that cyan turquoise where I can draw this line because I've set it to be the same size of the

165
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.100
square.

166
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.510
I have to go close to the corner and click.

167
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.380
And all of these four things on the corner.

168
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.850
If I set the type.

169
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.260
Step two three two by three two it puts in guidelines or click on the next tile and you can see here

170
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.690
it's letting me make different collision.

171
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.530
I made a mistake.

172
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.800
I don't want that collision someone to press this little business trash thing is going back to 64 by

173
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.670
64.

174
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.630
And I'm going to put collision in for everything that has a mask anything that doesn't have a bit masked

175
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.330
isn't going to be you.

176
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.770
So these ones don't count.

177
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.670
But the rest of them do.

178
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:14.070
So take a second so I'll speed up the video and you can watch me do it in fast motion is like slow motion

179
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.520
the difference.

180
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.460
And last one.

181
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.690
Okay.

182
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.460
If I hit save It's now done.

183
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.410
It's not difficult.

184
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:46.520
It's just fiddling and time consuming but that's all in now and everything's looking good.

185
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.670
So save that.

186
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:54.910
And now I just go into the auto tile and scan hit this little save button as well just to be sure.

187
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.150
Now if I press play.

188
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.460
You'll notice we now have collision.

189
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.790
OK so there was quite a lot of initial set up.

190
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.560
But let's take a look at why that's amazing.

191
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.540
Let's remove some of this Valis remove all of it.

192
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.130
And put a couple of pillars there as well.

193
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.790
Sped up a bit so you didn't have to watch me pull around too much.

194
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.200
There we go.

195
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.630
And I won't put a camera on the place we can follow around sir.

196
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:39.480
Camera tuley member said it is current or it's useless and I want to press play.

197
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.650
We actually have a working level has collision in all of these corners built in.

198
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:52.300
Now if we wanted to spend a little extra time and not do such a blocky game there are ways we could

199
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.440
do that but because we're doing quite up a block based top down stealth game this is already awesome.

200
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.670
Later on in the course quite soon in fact we're going to look at lights and how to put lights and shadows

201
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.990
in occlusion.

202
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.320
And we're going to have to put the occlusion in just like we did the collisions can be a little time

203
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.700
consuming.

204
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.880
What was the set up.

205
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.670
Everything will then be completely scalable we can make dozens of levels of we want to very quickly

206
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:21.090
with lots of tweak them very quickly if you needed to you could give the player the ability to add and

207
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.920
remove things in games so you could use auto tiling to do a digging system or a crafting system any

208
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.930
kind of building system.

209
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.440
Really cool stuff.

210
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.020
So that brings me the challenge.

211
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.160
I'd like you to use auto tiling to make a small test area.

212
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.300
Try playing with some rooms and corridors.

213
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.550
Don't forget you can add a camera to your player if you need to just remember to set as count.

214
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.130
And then when you've done that Shea a test level of luck to see the kinds of the signs you're making.

215
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.580
If you're doing several types of auto thailin one tile map remember each one is going to have to have

216
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.100
its own separate Sprite.

217
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.570
If you try and put all the different ones with in one Sprite within one tile it's going to alternate

218
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.410
between the different walls you have so you have concrete and wooden walls mixed randomly together it's

219
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.750
going to look very odd.

220
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.490
So pause the video make yourself a quick little level share it.

221
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.520
And when you come back we'll close this video.

222
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.570
Welcome back.

223
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.400
We covered quite a lot in this video.

224
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.640
We've taken the concept of titlemax from Hobby days and made a much more versatile auto title.

225
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.460
And there really is quite what you could do here.

226
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.580
We've looked at how you used to buy two or three by three bit masks.

227
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:36.910
And when we'd want to use which one and we've looked at setting up collision in Alter tile quite a lot

228
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.010
of work some of it's quite fiddly but really great stuff.

229
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.330
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
