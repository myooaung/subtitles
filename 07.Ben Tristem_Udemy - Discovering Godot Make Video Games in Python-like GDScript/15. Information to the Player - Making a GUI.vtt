00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.020
Hello again you wonderful go to people in this video let's actually start displaying some information

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.620
to the player.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.330
We're going to make a graphic user interface which I'm going to pronounce gooey.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.130
Some people don't like to pronounce it gooey.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.250
I like to pronounce it gooey.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.280
That's how I'm pronouncing it.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.200
OK.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.490
Enough about pronunciation.

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.210
What are we going to do.

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.550
Well we're going to add a gooey.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.060
And we're going to update lives when Bunny is hot.

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.430
Nice a symbol for someone who is getting got out and I got to figure out where to put this.

13
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.480
Now I want to right click on player and do eligible children.

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.530
Just what we talk about this.

15
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.470
I could put the goofy as a child off camera but I'm tempted just to have it as part of the level itself.

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.930
So I don't need this to be editable.

17
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.100
That was really just there to show you what that would look like.

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.670
So let's get rid of that again.

19
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.310
Well children.

20
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840
Yes that's fine.

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.730
And I'm going to make a brand new note and this is going to be a canvas layer.

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.200
Now we looked at canvas low made the parallax background but a canvas layer is a node that is always

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.580
in the same place on the screen.

24
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.170
It doesn't matter what's moving.

25
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.790
It's just a layer on top of.

26
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.620
Or if you like it behind the action.

27
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.020
This is great for goofy because as bunnies hopping around the place the the elements of the go we're

28
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.310
going to stay in one spot so cavalier and I'm this gooey.

29
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.200
Great.

30
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.750
Now the gooey should probably be a scene.

31
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.970
So let's save it as a scene.

32
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.530
Right click on it and to save branch scene.

33
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
Admittedly I could have just made a new scene and then imported it but I wanted to show you how you

34
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.400
could export a branch of a tree as a scene.

35
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.650
So right click and save punch a scene and let's make a new folder create folder.

36
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.490
And it's gonna be called Gilly.

37
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.500
And there goes.

38
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.280
Fantastic.

39
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.800
So let's open the gooey scene Al gooey is going to have a control node that's going to be there to keep

40
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.060
everything where we need it to be.

41
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.140
So let's give this a full rectangles.

42
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.670
That's the amount of space like.

43
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.270
And you know what let's take a look at our helpers so show helpers.

44
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.180
These green dots show you the anchors.

45
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.050
So we are anchored at the full screen.

46
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.620
That means however we resize the display.

47
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.990
It will always try and put things in the right place.

48
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.880
OK.

49
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.830
So child of that and I want a texture rectangle and a graphics.

50
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.380
You'll see there's a heads up display Hut.

51
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.660
Let's start with a banner hanging PMG and drag that texture.

52
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.980
And there it goes.

53
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.830
So what I'm going to do zoom in a bit.

54
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.530
La la la la.

55
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.430
I will put this on the top right of the screen and then have the visual elements inside this banner.

56
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.170
Right.

57
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.170
So let's move you so get a layout and you're going to go to the top right.

58
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.510
Awesome.

59
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.260
And that is looking pretty solid.

60
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.160
Let's see how that works.

61
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.710
Let's say that and start the game

62
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.710
resize it move things around me now.

63
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.940
Yep that's looking pretty good.

64
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.170
OK.

65
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.180
Now I do want a little bit of space there so let's give it a margin from the top of a team and the rights

66
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.340
of the negative 18.

67
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.610
It doesn't want to do that and that's because the left one is overriding it.

68
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.040
So what we do instead reset that zero minus two six eight minus 18.

69
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.030
So you can put maths in here which is quite nice.

70
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.520
Means I don't have to worry about what that looks like and when I press play it's nice that the gap

71
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.940
around there.

72
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.290
Awesome.

73
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.910
Now I want to organize the elements in here.

74
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.940
So what we do is we have coins which do in a feature video lives and numbers to put each of them.

75
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.740
I think the life should be on the right hand side and the coins been the left and we put the elements

76
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.190
for those in now which can put the actual coins in the functionality of the coins in later.

77
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.050
So clearly I want a way of organizing horizontally.

78
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.910
So let's add a child of texture X and I'm going to put in a box container.

79
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.060
Now you notice box container is a child of container but it's great out this isn't actually an element

80
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.630
we can use.

81
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.090
It's just that organize.

82
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.380
We have three kinds color picker which is that to you know let the play Pick color not really sure why

83
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.670
that counts as a box container.

84
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.150
But never mind with an H box container and a v box container.

85
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.890
Important note I have in the past confuse these with split containers split containers are slightly

86
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.370
different.

87
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.480
That gives you an element that a player can drag to resize things.

88
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.240
I don't want that.

89
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.900
So let's go with our box container and I want a horizontal box container.

90
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.150
Now I want this to take up the entire image which is why I've met a child of texture act.

91
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.490
If I go full rectangle here that's the full rect of the texture rectangle.

92
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.360
However I only want to be inside these white lines so maybe that's give a bit more margin.

93
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.210
So how about from the right minus 24.

94
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.720
These completely random numbers 26 or so plus minus 30.

95
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.240
Yes.

96
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.760
Okay.

97
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.640
From the left 15 too much.

98
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.830
Twelve.

99
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.750
Close enough on the top minus 12.

100
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.980
0 2 right now.

101
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.360
Admittedly I could have just dragged it by like typing in the numbers minus twelve.

102
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.280
Oh look at that.

103
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.960
And that fits perfectly.

104
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.350
All right.

105
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.770
Next thing is I want to put in a couple of textures.

106
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:14.780
So it's you know the X rectangle and this one is going to be coins and I'm going to need this coin

107
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.050
icon.

108
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:27.090
There's duplicate coin icon and put in the bunny for this one and rename this life icon.

109
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.010
And now let's put these icons in the center.

110
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.550
So each box container alignment.

111
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.430
And that can be in the center.

112
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.190
Great.

113
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.170
Now these are a little bit bigger than they need to be.

114
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.080
So I want to do is I'm actually going to drag them up like so and it's gonna be me wanting the chalk

115
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.700
container to get that position and size 10 by the parent let's find this exact level.

116
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.510
Let's take a look.

117
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.850
I have moved you up by minus 18.

118
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.460
That looks good.

119
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.100
Let's do the same with the coins.

120
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.030
So rect you'll go up position.

121
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.530
Where are you.

122
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.700
Position position position.

123
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.350
You'll get up by minus 18.

124
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.900
That's actually too high isn't it.

125
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.630
At minus twelve that's about right.

126
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.440
OK.

127
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.320
So I quite like these icons being bigger.

128
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.670
Yeah.

129
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.380
It's looking pretty good.

130
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.100
OK.

131
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.690
Let's add some text on each box container and press control eight add a node and type a label.

132
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.010
And this one is going to go to the left of the coin item.

133
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.830
OK let's give it zero succeed I'm doing and that is clearly not the font we want.

134
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.790
So custom fonts I want to make a new dynamic font.

135
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.780
Click on that go to font.

136
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.320
We've done this before.

137
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.920
I'm going to load under fonts.

138
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.480
I've given you candles CTF right.

139
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.460
That is too small so it's got the settings and how's 48 look.

140
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.800
Not bad actually.

141
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.030
Maybe a little bit more not 48.

142
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.540
I like to use a filter because if I zoom in here you'll see it's all blurry.

143
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.690
Use filter and it's looking good.

144
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.620
Now that's gonna be a little bit hard to see isn't as white with some cream there.

145
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.280
So let's give an outline.

146
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.490
Let's give an outline in black for now.

147
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.240
A terrible choice but whatever and I'll make this a full pixel outline too much maybe too much.

148
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.910
Now if we wanted to get a custom colors and we could give it a new color and if this was my own asset

149
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.130
and I knew what the heck's code here was I probably would buy don't.

150
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.700
And honestly this is a lot of fiddling.

151
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.980
Just for a weird image it's going to clash.

152
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.590
So I believe the fun colors of this but you can change it.

153
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.830
I've got white font with a black outline which is full pixels which is pretty big.

154
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:39.230
It's gonna look very cartoony so let's rename this coin counts and I want a duplicate coin count and

155
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.630
call this life counts and that is going to live in between.

156
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.030
So we should drag it down.

157
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.740
Now I do kind of watch resize this a bit so I'm going to select both the life count and the coin count

158
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.390
your whole control get both of these.

159
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.550
I'm gonna go down to size flags here it is and on horizontal it's click expand and you know what.

160
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.520
When I line these to the right.

161
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.150
OK so now they grouped together.

162
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.210
And when we get double digits they'll expand.

163
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.000
Let's see how that looks

164
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.900
not bad.

165
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.510
I do feel like this whole H box containing wants to be a little bit higher so let's do that.

166
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.100
Where are your margin.

167
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.510
The top let's actually put you back at zero time.

168
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.850
Yes says look professional.

169
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.540
OK.

170
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.560
So I have this nice little element here.

171
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.820
We could put a different puzzle screen but I like it here.

172
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.520
Now let's make it work.

173
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.570
Take a look at level 1.

174
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.530
Here's our structure right.

175
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.990
We have level 1 level 1 has a player all levels will have a player have a top map it'll have some hazards

176
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.880
some jump pads back music and the gooey goo is receptor from the whole thing.

177
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.100
Now what I need is a way of connecting the gooey to have one I could do this as a signal but I think

178
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.380
when I add gooey to its own group so I mean go back to the gooey scene get a note and this time is not

179
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.560
do it in script let's just give it a graphic user interface group.

180
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.200
So if we needed to we have multiple gooey elements we'd have different kinds of goodies that respond

181
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.330
to different ways but as long as they have this group name they will respond when they're called Save

182
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.980
that measure propagates and I look over here I can see it's in a group.

183
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.210
That's what this icon here is.

184
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.810
That's a signal that's a group.

185
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:23.970
So now let's give you a script back in the goofy scene at a script and just give it a nice empty script

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.200
and save that and I need to actually update this information.

187
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.430
So let's say very first thing we do is we're going to go function ready.

188
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.240
There is and we're gonna set our life count to three.

189
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:45.440
So to do that I need to get the life count node so dollar life counts.

190
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:52.080
There goes dot text equals three has to be a string a composite integer.

191
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.750
Okay so I wanna press play I have three lives also.

192
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.010
OK so now let's actually make these numbers update.

193
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.090
Right let's have do that actually works.

194
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.430
Function hearts now with a few different ways we could do this and I'd like to challenge you to pick

195
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.010
the one you like.

196
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.220
So what I'd like you to do is have the gooey update the amount of lives when the bunny is hot.

197
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.000
So every somebody is hurt we should see the amount of lives left.

198
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.520
Suppose the video give that a shot.

199
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.900
When you're happy with the results come back and I'll show you my solution

200
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.770
and welcome back.

201
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.150
All right.

202
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.880
Now what I'm going to do is I'm actually on a call.

203
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.860
I'm going to use the group call that we've set up in game state.

204
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:43.430
So in game state under Hart which is right here I'm just going to go get tree dot call group

205
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.160
and as a string of call the heart the gooey group not the hurt group if that's not a group.

206
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.700
The Hutt method the function.

207
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.720
And you know what I'm going to pass through an argument I'm gonna pass through lives this way the gooey

208
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.740
doesn't care how many lives it has it just cares what the number is to make that work really go back

209
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:11.520
into gooey and on a pass lives left as an argument now you might be thinking wait the organ was called

210
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.670
lives not lives left G.D. script is based on Python the Python doesn't actually care what its value

211
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.760
is called elsewhere.

212
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.990
As far as is concerned this value only exists in this function which means we can give it a name that

213
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.250
makes sense in this function.

214
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.080
And all I need to do now is just duplicate this line.

215
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:35.600
So Control B and then ult and down average bring it down and instead of three it's going to be lives

216
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.920
left except lives left is an integer.

217
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.130
This is a text box.

218
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.170
It has to be a string so let's cast it as a string right.

219
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.970
Let's see how that works.

220
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.520
Press play.

221
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.170
And that's what to a spike that

222
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.150
perfect.

223
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.990
For some reason it didn't update with the spike every time I've got resumed after yield but classes

224
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.670
is gone.

225
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.000
I've track that down a little later it's not really relevant right now.

226
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.000
However what happens if later on we decide that money doesn't start with three lives but it's of the

227
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.950
5 or 1 or whatever

228
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.970
Gilly set up a three.

229
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.400
Well that doesn't work does it.

230
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.050
So what can we do instead.

231
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.400
Well before we go any further this function is actually not hurt as it is a bad names let's call it

232
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.370
update lives as a much better name.

233
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.390
OK.

234
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:34.350
And the reason I'm doing that is we've got a game state I can change this to update lives

235
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:45.690
and if you know what let's just cut you control X and that's above and game because I feel like I should

236
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.290
be lost.

237
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:53.940
Function Update Gary I was at a pace that they're so now on ready.

238
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.170
I'm going to go up there Gary

239
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.240
and on hurt amnio update Gary

240
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.550
and national were great.

241
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.110
So let's see if we have five lives.

242
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.960
We have five lives left.

243
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.680
What happens if we have 50 lives we have 50 lives.

244
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.560
It scales

245
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.320
awesome.

246
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.150
I don't want 50 lives.

247
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.110
I would forget to three awesome.

248
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.170
OK so that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

249
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.980
We've made a gooey.

250
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.870
We've learned how these use an H box container.

251
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.040
And we've updated the gooey.

252
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.010
And just in case you're not quite sure how an exposed container works.

253
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.530
Each box container and V box containers just take the order in the same tree to make it the order in

254
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.960
the screen.

255
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.350
So how's it going.

256
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.390
Did you come up with completely different solution.

257
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.680
Are you using to custom assets for your gooey.

258
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.470
Have you added all kinds of other fun things.

259
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.910
Let me know.

260
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.510
I'm really curious to see how your game is going.

261
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.190
Meanwhile great stuff.

262
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.360
And I'll see you in the next video.
