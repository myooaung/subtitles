00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,270
Hello again you marvelous to people.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,370
Let's continue our work on come on computers and combinations.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,820
We're going to have the combination on the computer and while the combination to the locked door.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,460
That's all connected and ready to go.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,410
What do our computers need to do.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,240
Well first thing is they're going to need a combination.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,990
They can have to request a combination from the combination generator.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,070
That combination needs to be on screen when the player uses the computer.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,270
But we also need the combination transmitted to the locked doors that locked doors are going to get

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,040
that combination from the computer the computer's going to get the combination from the combination

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,930
generator.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,180
OK.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,220
Let's get right into it.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,460
So back into it and let's open the computer scene so into my computer scene I go and we can open script

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,610
for you I think that's a good place to go.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,600
OK.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,180
So here's our script so far.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,180
One thing I do want to do.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,230
Actually before I get a script you get back into 2D didn't need to do that.

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,310
Just make a little light.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,340
Where the collision ship here when the play is using the computer let's put a little light in I think

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,080
it'll be fun.

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,740
So I don't make a brand new light notes I go into the top eight and a. and a light 2D like 2D.

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,900
Wants a texture.

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,010
So let's go down into our graphics and into our tile sheet not tile sheet sorry into our Pinky and then

26
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,720
the tiles.

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,610
That's what I meant to say if we score all the way down.

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,940
We've got this nice little fluorescent effect here it's how five nights I want to put that in it's a

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,620
little hard to see against the black background but if I switch this on you can see here I want to rotate

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,600
this by 90 degrees on rotation degrees.

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,840
It's going to rotate it and I want to shuffle it over.

32
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,170
Now I know this is 64 by 64 so our position on the x axis is going to be 32.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,960
So there is all light.

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,370
Okay.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,970
And it's actually pretty good to go.

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,150
One thing I do want to do those switch on and off.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,500
So let's start with it disabled.

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,040
And let's go into the script and what I want to do is put it on here.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,990
So when we click on it rather than print click let's switch the lights on so that light 2D dot enabled

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,120
and I can tell that by clicking on it and looking at the mouse over it tells me the properties called

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,490
enabled and that's going to be true

42
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,940
okay.

43
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,230
And when we exit the body we can disable that light.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:25,630
So let's do that light to the DOT enabled equals false.

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,650
Now in the vast majority of times we're not going to spot this because the screen will be in the way

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,210
but on the occasions when we're off the side of the screen this will look good.

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,640
And I'm going to need to generate the combination.

48
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,550
This will be done already.

49
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,170
So first let's make a ready function so function ready loop.

50
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,970
Let's just give us a little more space here and go right past to get errors and go into full screen

51
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,240
mode.

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,740
OK.

53
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,210
So on ready I did a few things first.

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:57,510
I need to make sure that I'm generating the combination to generate a combination which is a brand new

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,430
function does exists something like copy that and let's go and put it right here.

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,110
Function generate combination column pass this function here that's going to generate combination which

57
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:16,410
you probably store that says have a variable called combination and now we can generate the combinations

58
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:25,240
do that only a combination equals combination generator don't and then there's a function in here right.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,920
Generate combination.

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,890
Now generate combination.

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,170
If I look at this requires a an argument it's already giving the error and if I open up the combination

62
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,920
generator which is right here it is the length how many digits do I need.

63
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,450
So for now I'm for a length of four.

64
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,200
But I want that to be customizable when we're making the level to do that when we can export variables

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,760
that make export variable combination length

66
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,710
equals four.

67
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,470
And now I could change this for for combination length and all that's going to do is X expose this to

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,350
the inspector.

69
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,630
So by default this before and when I click on the computer here you can see combination length which

70
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:18,440
means if I save this and go into the level clicking on the computer which is right here will allow me

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,960
to change the combination length not bad.

72
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,870
So let's get back into that and open that script again back into distraction free mode.

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,490
OK.

74
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,530
That's looking pretty good.

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,000
Now I'm gonna need to use this to change the texture computer right now the key pieces test.

76
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,580
That's no good.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,580
So let's go to the computer pop up.

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,070
I'm going to open that scene.

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:45,080
So let's put in a brand new script on computer pop up it's a brand new script boop and I need a function

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,550
called set text with combination

81
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,680
OK.

82
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,790
So to do this I want to change the text on the label so I'm going to get the label which is right here.

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,770
Dot text equals.

84
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,030
So it's got open brackets.

85
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,900
That's going to full screen loser over brackets and only go down a line and there's two tabs so that

86
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:17,070
I can see it's all part of the same line and let's say Will you stop forgetting your access code.

87
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,120
I've set it to a little space there.

88
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,310
And now we need to add the combinations.

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,720
Plus I only use cool string array which we saw we made the number pad and I need the combination and

90
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:39,240
all to join all those numbers into string with DOT join and I only use a blank string says no gap between

91
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,260
them plus let's get down line again.

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,140
But this is the very last time okay.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,570
So what's gonna happen is when it receives this fuck this calls for the function.

94
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,090
So when it receives the instruction set the text with this combination it will change the word test

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,000
on the monitor too will you stop forgetting your access code.

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,030
I have set it to blah blah blah blah.

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Depending on the length of the combination.

98
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,340
But this is the very last time this number can be any length from one to very large.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,760
So it doesn't have to be four digits.

100
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,710
You can have varying sizes so that it's going to come in really handy.

101
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:19,930
Okay.

102
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,390
Let's go back to the computer scene so let's save that.

103
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,520
Save that and put this back onto invisible mode back computer see just check that everything's looking

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,880
good.

105
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,530
No it's still visible that way.

106
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,430
Good.

107
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,780
OK.

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,100
So script for you.

109
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,420
La la la la la.

110
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,120
Sort of hopping around a lot today.

111
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,900
And now I want to set to that pop up text so under generate combination to make a new function called

112
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
to set pop up text

113
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:56,450
OK it's now complaining we don't have a function called set pop up text so it should make that and we

114
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:05,330
need the computer pop up so it's from the computer pop up computer pop up LA that dot sets text there

115
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,590
it is and then we just need to put into the combination.

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,190
All right.

117
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,840
So if I've done everything correct which I hope I have when I press space here the new combination is

118
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,380
it's going to big mode.

119
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,960
The new combination will be here.

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,170
But look we're going off screen.

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,780
Let's fix that real quick.

122
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,080
I didn't mean to do that so we'll go back into computer pop up.

123
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,280
Let's open the label.

124
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,940
The properties and switch auto wrap on one more time over here.

125
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,810
Will you stop forgetting your access code.

126
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,620
I've set 2 2 9 8 2 6 but this is the very last time.

127
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,970
Now if you wanted to as a little extra challenge you could do this with a rich text labels and on top

128
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,580
of notes so I could just add in a rich text label which works exactly like a normal label except you

129
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,240
can enable VB code so I can get to be the code enable it and write it here.

130
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,150
Not only do that in this video but if you wanted to you could do that look up Bebe code stuff to change

131
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,770
colors make things balance on.

132
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,490
I'm happy with that as it is and I don't need this rich text labels.

133
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Get rid of that save and I'm back in the computer script.

134
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,070
OK.

135
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,420
We have a computer script now and I want to do is connect the computer to the correct door.

136
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,610
So let's go here.

137
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,600
I want to make a brand new signal I want make a signal that doesn't exist so let's create a signal in

138
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,510
code and to do that we use this signal keyword right combination.

139
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,980
That's now a signal that this node can do to show that you're out of here and into my level and go to

140
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,980
nodes and you can see we can now connect this to another objects I want to connect this and I finally

141
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,720
locked door.

142
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:49,770
So has my locked door and locked door as a script now has on complete function on computer combination.

143
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,250
Now matching up past two pieces information through here I'm going to pass the combination I'm equipped

144
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,220
lock groups so lock group why am I adding that.

145
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,730
Well would probably have more than one locked door and more than one computer.

146
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,890
Not every door is gonna have the same combination.

147
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,240
I need the player to know which computer is talking about which door.

148
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,460
So I'm going to add that as a new piece information.

149
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,580
Let's say that and go into our computer scripts are practically descriptive.

150
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,010
Okay.

151
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,450
So once we've generated the combination when you get into emits the signal says emit the signal combination

152
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,800
and send the combination through and something called Lock group which doesn't yet exist but lock group

153
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:38,550
in there and you're going to make it as a brand new export variable export block group.

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,060
And that is going to be simply this is unset for now is a string say that go back and see the level

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,140
Ed and I could see this lock group here and that's got let me know what group I'm playing with.

156
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,530
Right so I can see that this is part of group 1 for example that's part of group 1 2 let's just call

157
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:04,790
this from moment 1 Remember I'm changing this in the inspector the default value on the script is still

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,270
unset.

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,750
So when I bring in a new locked door it'll use these default values.

160
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,950
Okay.

161
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,580
Let's go back into a locked door and actually make this work.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,000
I've now realized accommodation is confusing some input numbers you'll receive some numbers you want

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,390
to do something with them let's go back and to this pass and you written that and I want to change the

164
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:32,250
number pad combinations I want to use num pad and we have a property in there a variable called combination

165
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,190
call that numbers.

166
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,380
So let's give that a quick go press play

167
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,480
the exit code is 3 4 7 8 so see if that works

168
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,820
mock and lie.

169
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,350
That felt pretty good.

170
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,820
Now if I restart this

171
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,980
I should get a completely different nomination.

172
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,810
5 6 5 7 5 6 5 7.

173
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,440
Excellent.

174
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,830
Okay now one more thing on day before we finish this video I will show the player what block group things

175
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,610
are part of.

176
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,650
So when I go to the computer as to the mode I'm going to add a quick label here.

177
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,760
So I'm going to get to the root itself.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,140
So add which is control a type and label and this needs to be the same thing doesn't it.

179
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,340
So let's load the theme in theme is right here.

180
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:38,890
We're going to go load theme and our theme is under you I believe which is interface as my theme.

181
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,240
And let's just write the word test right now so we can see it and I'm just gonna move that 2 up.

182
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,750
He right here is great so I mean let's analyze the right.

183
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,990
Mean it's a rect to make sure it's in the right place.

184
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,970
Let's put you on the same level on the Y minus 100 on the x.

185
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,790
That looks pretty good.

186
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,300
Okay.

187
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,900
So I want to add the same thing to the locked doors.

188
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,980
As for save me guess the main scene and just find a locked door and open the scene that Adelaide will

189
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,470
hit.

190
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,580
So let's go control.

191
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,270
I am contacting the label again la la la.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,210
There's my label and a material test and I need to add this to the theme so it's go to this lost six

193
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,950
flags theme load interface theme.

194
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,230
There it is and I'm gonna write tests as all good and let's just move you to the same place so make

195
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,960
sure it moves letters not drag it to over here get wrecked.

196
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,650
It's minus one hundreds groups minus one hundred zero.

197
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,680
You know what that needs to be a little farther left.

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
I mean 1 120 because it does bit wider.

199
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,200
Great.

200
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,010
Okay.

201
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,420
I want this to be able to rotate the right direction I'll show you why if I press play right now.

202
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,620
The labels are 1 1 the labels behind the walls.

203
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,490
That's not great.

204
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,620
And 2 they're not angled correctly so let's rotate that.

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,650
I won't go into the computer and I'm going to do this on ready.

206
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:12,190
So after the bit of the signal let's grab the label and what I want to do our set is rotation.

207
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,620
Well let's take a look at label and mouse over the rotation in rect which is wrecked on the school rotation.

208
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:26,010
Okay rect underscore rotation and I want to make sure this is always facing the right direction.

209
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,460
To do that I'm going to take the rotation of this computer and subtract it.

210
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,910
So negative rotation degrees.

211
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,310
I want to press play now.

212
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,970
The computer's test words are now in the right axis came in the wrong place.

213
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,560
They're in right axis.

214
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay.

215
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,450
We can move that just to be a little bit closer.

216
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,330
So let's just go over here and drag you and you now live there.

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,360
See how that looks.

218
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,890
Better.

219
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,690
Ok so now let's do the same thing with the door.

220
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,540
Now going to move you to right here.

221
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,810
Okay let's get a locked door and we actually have some information we don't need don't we.

222
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,250
We don't need to be generating accommodation in the in the ready function so get rid of that and let's

223
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,440
get rid of this entire function here that is now handled elsewhere.

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,740
Okay.

225
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,220
So let's do the same thing so label dot wrecked on the score rotation

226
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,510
equals negative rotation on the school degrees.

227
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,440
OK so now in a press play

228
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,820
it has it right there can change the offsets and so on with the mess with at the moment.

229
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,860
But now I have a little challenge for you.

230
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
So here is my challenge for you.

231
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,790
I'd like you to have both the computer and the door display their lock group I.D. their door number

232
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,240
in the label of the computer and door nodes.

233
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,750
Suppose a video give that a shot and then you come back I'll show you my solution.

234
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,950
I'm OK Mac.

235
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,660
OK.

236
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,320
So back into Gaza we go.

237
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,660
And how many they just change this display.

238
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,700
Well we're sending this information through.

239
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm doing the locked door first right here on lock group.

240
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,840
So let's just go label Dot.

241
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,500
Text equals and this is a string so we don't need to convert it.

242
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,910
I should go lock group.

243
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,050
We'll do the same thing with a computer.

244
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,060
So back into my computer scene open computer G.D. label

245
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,180
dot text equals and I just need to put lock groups or lock group

246
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:47,000
OK so if everything is right this press play that's a big one here about the computer a one here by

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,390
the door.

248
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,270
We now have a system we could put lots of locked doors in pressing computer 0 5 9 4.

249
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's go test it 0 5 9 4.

250
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,120
Door opens and we get to go look at that.

251
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,640
I think that's excellent progress.

252
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,850
So in this video we've looked at returning the value for another function.

253
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,070
In other words we've we've set a variable as being the results of another function.

254
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,300
We've also got all our computers locked we've got locked doors going.

255
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,150
We've got the we've got the fundamentals of our game play down.

256
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,380
So excellent work.

257
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,580
And I'll see you in the next video.
