00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.040
Hello again you wonderful God people in this video were going to start working towards having locked

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.690
doors.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.870
We've got basic doors now we want advance doors that have a lock on them.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.560
But before we start putting these locked doors in let's work on the lock.

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.240
And specifically I want the lock to be beautiful.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.060
I'm thinking about creating a number pad.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.690
And there's no pad is going to control how the door is unlocked.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.020
And I want this to be beautiful by using something called a thing.

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.600
The purpose of this video is to show you how awesome the themes are and why you should use them.

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.080
So we're talking about lock doors couple of things to bear in mind.

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.130
First off Locked doors are going to extend doors.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.780
There are type of door so we can extend the scene and the script when you click on the locked door rather

13
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.180
than opening it's going to bring up this number pad.

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.020
This new behaviour the players a type in a number code to unlock the door.

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.040
So let's get to it.

16
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.610
First thing to do is make a brand new scene and our route code is going to be a pop up pop up is a type

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.510
of control mode controllers all going to be using frog specifically pop ups are used for pop up they're

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.530
using dialogues.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.230
In other words they start hidden and then when you activate them in code they appear.

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.600
This is important because once we've made this it's not going to show up on screen if we just run the

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.120
see you can see this with this warning If a mouse over it it'll tell you it's hidden by default unless

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.720
you use any of the pop up functions will look at the pop up functions in a future video.

23
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.910
For now let's just create this invention.

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.340
So we have the base node and I need a texture in the background.

25
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.100
Now I have a bunch of called textures to use.

26
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.550
If you go over to graphics and interface and PRNG you've got a lot of really cool interface elements

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.460
from a any pack.

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.940
And specifically I want to use this metal panel how this metal panel they're bringing us a Sprite is

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.000
covering size the very size it to be the right size it gets all blurry.

30
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.960
So instead we're going to use a really cool node called a nine patch wrecked my patch rectangle a 9

31
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.760
patch rectangle is a node that splits a texture into a three by three grid and then gives you some control

32
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.320
over it.

33
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.430
Show me where drag metal panel over to texture.

34
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.060
So far it's just what it is to show why no patch rectangle is great.

35
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.610
Let's resize the pop up so the pop up is going to be a good size of say 300 by 400 is our go over to

36
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.590
rect which means rectangle properties and minimum size so when we say we set 300 by 400 pixels.

37
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.410
OK.

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.720
Now we make the nine patch rectangle for Rex So it's going to fill it and look everything everything's

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.030
distorted and blurring.

40
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.830
However let's go over the patch margin the patch margin is how much of this curve are we preserving.

41
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.870
So if I change this to let's pick a random number about 12 12 on the left 12 on the top 12 on the right

42
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.480
and 12 at the bottom.

43
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.150
And it's preserve the curve.

44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.030
Now this is a bit much but you can tweak these values sir close the outputs.

45
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.170
So what we're doing you could tweak these values so maybe I won't I don't know six.

46
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.950
And what they're doing is saying preserve 6 pixels from the left six pixels on the top.

47
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.300
And I actually do want to get these bolts in.

48
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.520
I want them to look like they're actual bolts and I want them more blurry so maybe eight maybe 10 10

49
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.820
looks good so let's go tan.

50
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.220
I didn't measure this texture at the beginning.

51
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.940
So we now have a margin of 10 pixels that God is going to try and preserve especially around the corners.

52
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.630
That makes for really great recycling.

53
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.410
So we now have an awesome background while I read it.

54
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.500
Let's rename pop up.

55
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.290
This is actually going to be number pad.

56
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.440
There's no patch rectangles our background.

57
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.960
I'm going to rename it backgrounders so I know not to mess with anymore.

58
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.870
And it's done.

59
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.250
All right.

60
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.230
Next thing I need is a way of splitting things in the middle and I need a split container.

61
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.660
And I want to make the least bit container fit with in the number pad.

62
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.440
However I don't want any element going beyond these bolts.

63
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.940
So let's start off by going for rect and I go snap to grid and take a look at my grid settings.

64
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.300
Which is over here.

65
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.260
It a snap.

66
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.500
Let's go with a 10 by 10 pixel because I've set up not 256 that's wrong.

67
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.920
I've set the margin to be 10 pixel So I now know if I drag that in it'll go right to weather preserved

68
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.560
9 patch marginals.

69
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.980
That's going to be my v split container within this I manage to put things quick heads up until there's

70
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.280
more than one child of the split container.

71
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.790
It's going to keep recycling itself these split container organizes and three sizes elements within

72
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.490
it in the order they're in the sync tree.

73
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.370
Let's you and me.

74
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.040
I mean placenta container.

75
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.540
And this is going to be my display container someone call it display container.

76
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.740
And underneath I'm going to put one of these panels as you turn nine patch rectangle.

77
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.840
And let's call this display glass just so I'm very clear what's happening.

78
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.940
Going to drag in this glass panel.

79
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.480
OK.

80
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.970
Our glass panel is going to go to a full rectangle and now going to resize it later but for now that's

81
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.150
our full size.

82
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.080
Let's put the patch march in and for this.

83
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm going to put in this one we think for pixels that sounds good.

84
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.360
So for the left foot on the right.

85
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720
Great.

86
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.630
And just see you see what I'm doing.

87
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.350
Let's go back in here and make it full size.

88
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.180
So it's preserving this corner.

89
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.090
We're not getting these weird pixellated effect it's looking pretty good.

90
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.270
However what I've created right now is an iPad.

91
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.170
I don't want to like that.

92
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.380
We'll fix that in a bit.

93
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.290
First rechecks contain rich text like not content.

94
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.700
I'm going to rename the rich text they want to call that display because that can be called in Scripps

95
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.320
I need a good clear name for it.

96
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.660
And this display container is now done before I can start making things look like they're going to I

97
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.980
need something else a lot of these black containers so I constantly have things recycling every time

98
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.000
I change anything.

99
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.620
So let's put it another child.

100
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.130
This is going to another Santa's container and I'm going to call this butter container.

101
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.790
Now look what's happening.

102
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.000
Button container is underneath display container.

103
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.880
And if I give display container a minimum size so it's a good size for a display container.

104
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:54.740
How about so let's see a rectangle Let's make you minimum size of two hundred on the X..

105
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.890
That's way to become at 100.

106
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.050
Yeah that's pretty good.

107
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.260
I mean give that a million slice of 100.

108
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:09.490
And the display glass I'm going to make full rectangle for now and the display I'm going to have not

109
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.440
be the entire size of this display.

110
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.700
So instead of being the entire size Let's go a little smaller.

111
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.490
I'm going to make the text 200 wide by 50 high.

112
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.230
And let's set this one last time so display glass.

113
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.800
Get back to rest.

114
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.320
And let's give the minimum size now because it's starting to get a little bit fiddly So we give it 200

115
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.480
by 100.

116
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.620
That's on minimum size.

117
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.820
You know what let's make it a bit bigger I make it to 50 percent of it 25 pixels on either side the

118
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.710
display and every text in there.

119
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.550
Right now it's a little smaller so it's gonna have a border but it's looking pretty.

120
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.700
Let's put some text in there just to see it will enable baby text text and write test.

121
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.770
Right.

122
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.920
Right now we have white on blue so it's quite hard to see.

123
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.060
But we will fix that.

124
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.880
That's what this is for.

125
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.550
This is so we can see what's this going to look like later.

126
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.400
For now let's call display content done.

127
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.240
We now have a button container within which I'm going to put a child node.

128
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.750
And this is going to be a grid container grid.

129
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.330
Containers are really awesome.

130
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.240
Let's make that full rectangle for now.

131
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.570
What this does is it organizes all child nodes in order you give them in a grid.

132
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.620
So first let's make a three column.

133
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.790
And what this means is when I enter things one will be on the left centre right.

134
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.970
And then one it's got a third column.

135
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.860
It'll start a new row and it'll just keep doing that for every child.

136
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.230
Here let's call this button grid.

137
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.920
Until this has something inside it it's going to keep re sizing unless I force a minimum size which

138
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.310
I really shouldn't be doing.

139
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.970
So let's give it a button.

140
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.700
And here is a button and you'll see the grid container has recycled itself.

141
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.000
Of course this button one and just to see how it feels.

142
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.020
I'm going to get you to put the other button.

143
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.360
I'd like you to make some more buttons.

144
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.540
We've got button one.

145
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.120
So I'd like it to make buntu through zero and an okay button.

146
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.580
Don't worry about putting a label on them just yet.

147
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.900
Just make another 10 buttons.

148
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.570
So going to 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.

149
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.130
And okay put them in the grid contents line everything up.

150
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:27.530
If you want extra credit See if you can find a separation and this separation within grid container

151
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.160
they're in one of the categories and give a space between buttons.

152
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.880
If you want a good value I like.

153
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.590
Pixels between them but play around until you've got a grid you're happy with.

154
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.440
Pause the video makes some more buttons and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

155
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.340
And work Mac.

156
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.780
Well this is actually pretty simple.

157
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:54.690
When I do not take buttons one select it and duplicate duplicate duplicate duplicate duplicate.

158
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.820
I that that nice and easy.

159
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.620
Right now these buttons don't look great however.

160
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:09.940
We're going to fix that limit when the AMA do a rename buttons tend to zero and button 11 2 okay button.

161
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.580
Okay it's probably better I think because that's one of the first in script.

162
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.430
If I want to give them a label I could put a rich text label as a child but want to do that instead.

163
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.510
Let's use the text value of the button.

164
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:31.560
Now we didn't do this before not making lany Lips and this last one is going to be okay later on I'm

165
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.970
going to show you how you can send this text value this string as a signal into a script.

166
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.750
So eventually the play is going to press a button and God is going to send one or five or nine as a

167
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.130
saying before you go any further and we will make this look beautiful in a moment.

168
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.000
This isn't quite a grid because I want one more thing I want a texture.

169
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.770
So let's go back to putting grid and add a new texture.

170
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.970
And this is going to be a texture rectangle.

171
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.800
Not going to bother with a nine patch texture because I don't need it.

172
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.500
Re size isn't going to be the same size each time I would put this dot red in there when the player

173
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.680
enters the right colour.

174
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.190
It will be green.

175
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.290
Normally I wouldn't use red and green for critical information.

176
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.420
The reason is the most common form of colourblindness is the one confuses red and green So it's not

177
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.550
a great practice.

178
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.940
However this is a nice to have feature rather critical game information.

179
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.120
I also don't want the light here.

180
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.400
I want to zero in the centre.

181
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.270
Camera right in the light there so all I would do is move the light over here because the position in

182
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.570
the scenery is where it is in the grid.

183
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.050
OK so the grid has recycled itself and now I want to make this more awesome.

184
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.540
To do this I need to make a theme.

185
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.830
I don't need to make a theme right.

186
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.850
I could go in here.

187
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.850
I could remove all the buttons I've just made.

188
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.410
Change the look of this button and then duplicate them.

189
00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.930
But if I use a theme I can load that theme in too any no one wants to use the same thing.

190
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.810
Let me show an image.

191
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.330
Let's go to the paranoid.

192
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.790
If we make the theme in the parent node all children will inherit that theme unless we tell it otherwise.

193
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.340
And I'm going to scroll down to it this theme.

194
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.750
I put a new theme.

195
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.000
And we click on theme and you'll see right here the theme comes up.

196
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.860
And at the moment the only thing is let only change the default.

197
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.960
Let's change that let's get a new dynamic font click on dynamic font and you'll see everything is already

198
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.830
vanished.

199
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.770
And under font going to load a font in giving you a couple of fonts.

200
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:39.270
So a graphics interface fonts you'll see Ken vector future and Convector future thin vector future is

201
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.050
going to be my default font and thing is going to be for things like buttons.

202
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.790
So if that's my default font let's load it in my default size I'm saying default a lot because I can

203
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.900
always override this in an individual node.

204
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.700
It's going to be 30 and already see all the child knows have changed their font.

205
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.210
We can now save this thing.

206
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:06.210
So if I click on this floppy disk I save I was going to call it seemed to urias at the moment.

207
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.980
We have a font that changes with thing.

208
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.210
Let's now change the display and the display is a take look at it.

209
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.020
Rich Text label.

210
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.310
OK.

211
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:25.800
So back into the thing and I want to edit the thing and I can either add an item or add a class item.

212
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.380
Here's the difference.

213
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.820
If I add an item it'll say what you want to change.

214
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.380
I want to change the rich text Where's that.

215
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.030
There it is.

216
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.680
And what do you want to change with it.

217
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.690
The icon style font the colour.

218
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.220
Great.

219
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.670
However if I add a class item rich text labels the last thing I selected so it's there.

220
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.960
It'll automatically add in everything which text labels can do.

221
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.610
So let's start with the default font rich text labels are going to have a default font of black.

222
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.980
This might not update automatically.

223
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.750
Don't worry when something changes it will demonstrate that I'm going to display an image change test

224
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.630
all capitals to tests like this.

225
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.000
Look it's update itself at the moment.

226
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.520
This isn't centred we're going to use beeby code later in the course to centre this depending on what's

227
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.000
being typed.

228
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.360
It's a.

229
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.510
Don't worry about the font not being centred yet.

230
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.610
Alright these buttons.

231
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.890
I want to add a new class item for the buttons in the themes.

232
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.330
It's good to thin at it class add class item and which can find buttons.

233
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.350
Which will probably be under B because I'm in my 40s and know my alphabet.

234
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.610
Okay buttons are going to have quite a few changes.

235
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.030
Let's start with the fonts.

236
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.790
So um.

237
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:42.310
Add in a new dynamic font and under font I'm going to load vector thin and I once change the setting

238
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.510
so being 30 is going to be 20 so the buttons are going to look smaller and look they've already changed

239
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:52.940
colour back upper level and other colours my font colour is going to be black.

240
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.580
Now I'm not gonna see the font straight away because I know what black or grey but that's okay because

241
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.460
the next thing I do is change what the buttons look like.

242
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.020
Let's go down to style.

243
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.370
You'll see here that we have nothing for disabled focus.

244
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.900
Hover normal and press the different states for the button can be in the only ones I may use right now

245
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.460
a normal hover and pressed.

246
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.430
Normal is what's the button look like hover as what does it look like on the mausers over it and pressed.

247
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.580
What was it look up when you're actually pressing it.

248
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.910
If we scroll down you'll see these coloured metal panels so under normal.

249
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.640
I'm going to go new text text Starbucks extra.

250
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.750
Click on it and look.

251
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.070
All the buttons have vanished.

252
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.970
So let's put in a text.

253
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.050
I mean use the blue one for normal.

254
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.450
Let's head back.

255
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.420
It won't show straightaway until something changes but don't worry the next thing I do is pressed when

256
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.370
it's pressed I want to go and read so new style box texture and look at the buttons have come back.

257
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.790
Let's go into the texture and I'm going to change the texture for a press button to read.

258
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.420
We're going to use green for hover.

259
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.580
Let's do that again for hover.

260
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.390
Again I'm using red and green.

261
00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.190
Not great practice but it's nice to have not a critical piece of information so I can live with it for

262
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.880
now.

263
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.800
If you'd rather use yellow.

264
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.810
By the way use yellow.

265
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.460
That's cool.

266
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.930
And there is my hover button.

267
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.040
Next thing to do is I want to standardize the size.

268
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.860
I don't want these buttons changing size so inside the button.

269
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.860
I want to do.

270
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:24.390
Is going to rest and go to a minimum size and the most abundant 20 40 by 40.

271
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.340
Now you'll notice that I've got this funding foot by foot in the US of change.

272
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:34.200
So I want these parameters to copy the easiest thing to do is to press this little spanner screwdriver

273
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.340
or wrench a screwdriver.

274
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.410
He don't know what a spanner is and click it.

275
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:43.620
Get a copy parameters and then he's going to select all of these buttons but not the light and pace

276
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.330
the practice.

277
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.040
Now it has also pace the numbers that was silly of me.

278
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.770
I go back and change those numbers.

279
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.220
These buttons are now the right size.

280
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:05.880
Let's also change this texture rectangles called White and under rectangle going to give that same minimum

281
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.000
size.

282
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.380
Now you notice the note is change size.

283
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.190
It hasn't.

284
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.450
OK so let's go over to expand and nele Change size.

285
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.410
Great and here is our pop up.

286
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.640
Couple more things I want to do.

287
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.510
I mentioned the extra credit things that she had to do that.

288
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:30.400
Let's go to the button grid and scroll down to this custom constants and I will have the separation

289
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:35.800
and separation would put this operation to 8 and 8 separation to it and that's just going make everything

290
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.960
a little wider now.

291
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:43.360
It might not be perfectly centred right now but when got home runs this season it will CENTERA it which

292
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.260
is amazing.

293
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.170
In fact I think that might actually be pretty well set.

294
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.580
One more thing I wanna do is this.

295
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:56.110
Okay button which is the sum I want to change the texture just for this button so it's using the theme

296
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.610
unless I overwrite something.

297
00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.530
Let's look at that.

298
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:05.360
Get a custom styles and custom normal steinbock texture.

299
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.850
Back into the right folder and I must stick with the same colours.

300
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:15.980
But I'm gonna use this corner so corner blue for normal.

301
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.360
Scroll back down think of things to hover.

302
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.250
That's going to be believe hovels green wasn't it and pressed is going to be red.

303
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.650
And if I got those wrong I can always change them later.

304
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.440
So pressed new style wax texture.

305
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.010
And red.

306
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.080
And the important thing here is that this works just like inheritance.

307
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.150
In fact this was happening inheriting the theme.

308
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:47.000
But this button has extra properties and we have a really cool looking pop up.

309
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:55.410
One more thing I want to put up with themes is that right now our theme is a file so that save the changes

310
00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:01.470
I've made so far I've got themed aureus just like any other property.

311
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:07.800
This can be called in script not only in script in animator's So if you wanted to you could make a different

312
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.650
theme for different parts of who you are.

313
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.710
Maybe you want to make it customizable seagoing of the player charts of different skins they can use.

314
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.060
Maybe during night vision mode you want a completely different thing maybe different levels have different

315
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.530
themes.

316
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.810
Maybe when you use different abilities you more things will come up.

317
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:28.170
You have a lot of flexibility here and I can now load this theme into any element I can build on this

318
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:33.850
theme by adding more class items and it will always refresh everything that's using that thing.

319
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.030
Some themes are awesome.

320
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.490
I encourage you use them and that brings us to the end of this video.

321
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.740
In this video we have looked at how to use grid containers to automatically organize gooey elements

322
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.450
which is a really great way of keeping things like inventory's or button panels really well organized.

323
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.780
We've set up a pop up node and we have been introduced to the wonderful world of things.
