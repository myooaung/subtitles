1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,970
Hello again, you.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,750
Gigantic.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,350
Got to people.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,810
I don't actually know if they're gigantic or not, but I couldn't think of an adjective in time in this

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,110
video.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,400
We'll look at ending the game.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,040
We're not ending section, but we're going to give the game over a chance.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,080
Game over happen.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,350
And my cat is going to yell at me and distract me while trying finish sentences.

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,320
So what I wanna do is talk about how the game can be won.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,260
We need a target score, right.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,670
So we need an expert variable or just constant where if either player gets the score, the end game

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,120
is triggered.

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,560
And we clearly need to check that we need a game over ugly.

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,640
When the game is over, what happens?

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,310
We also need to stop that time off from respawn in the bowl.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,400
The game or freeze the gooing come off and then we need a way of restarting the game.

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,040
Not too complicated, but let's jump into it.

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,500
So first thing, we'll be working in the gluey.

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,580
So it's Drummonds, that scene.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,940
Hello, Gary.

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,670
And I want to add a brand new pop up.

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,790
Let's see.

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,050
So here's my pop up.

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,510
OK, let's add in a nine patch, Recht, and that's looking good.

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,710
And of here on the interface we have panel wood looks good.

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,530
Let's resize the entire pop up.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:25,300
So I want you to Recht and I think 500 on the X is a midsize and maybe two hundreds on that one.

29
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,100
Create a nine patch rectangle.

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,620
And I'm just gonna give it a full recht and.

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,670
And the pop up is going to be anchored to center and positioned in the center.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,450
Great.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,650
Let's make this look a little prettier.

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,560
Patch margins on a stick with the 20s.

35
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,120
They worked well.

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,370
But on the banner.

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,550
And, yeah, it looks nice.

38
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,070
OK.

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,650
We need ourselves a label and that can be a child of the pop up itself.

40
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,280
As you know what?

41
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,850
We need to split the text only so we can have one line than the other.

42
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:05,930
So I'm going to make a V box container and it's a size that probably is a full rectangle and margins

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,730
because I don't want Tex to go over the edge.

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,450
Let's say 20 pixels again.

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,710
Very nice.

46
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,800
And as a child of that, let's have a label.

47
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,250
And.

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,620
We're not currently in the style away now.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,290
We could use the same theme, except I want a different font color here because I think white on that

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,300
colorism very helps read.

51
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,580
So instead unlabelled going to give a custom font.

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,330
New dynamic font I need to load that ends font low.

53
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,550
Doo doo doo doo doo.

54
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,910
And we could stick with the same size.

55
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,660
I think it's 30 points, but let's give it a color, not an outline color, an actual color.

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,370
The custom color font color, black, and I can't read it, couldn't say anything, so.

57
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,730
Player zero wins.

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,430
You know what?

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,290
I think maybe even a little big on that.

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,900
Let's let's go the custom side of 40, 40 looks.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,420
And I want to make sure this stays in the center.

62
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,450
So aligned to center.

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,570
I've written players zero just so I can see what it is.

64
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,590
It's gonna be one or two, hopefully.

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,330
When is that?

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,010
Now just rosenblad to put a button and the button is going to theme.

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,050
So you know what, I'm actually going to take this thing.

68
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:41,160
Say, that's that's cool, but I'm going to go yeah, go with God thing, gooey dot theme.

69
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,310
And now I can load that in here.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,230
And the reason I've done that is while these this fund is going to stay the same, because we've overridden

71
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,840
the defaults.

72
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,900
If we got rid of the override it now look like the the white tax because that's going to now be the

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,380
same.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,390
I can now use that font in the buttons.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,260
So let's make a button.

76
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,410
And I'm on the right to play again.

77
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,560
And this is important because now I can change the way the button behaves and the things that's open

78
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,250
the thing and I might add class item.

79
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,630
Dot, dot, dot.

80
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,440
And I want button cricked.

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,350
Okay, button.

82
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,730
Let's take a look at your stuff as your style's first normal style could be a new start.

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,280
Starbucks flat.

84
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,370
And I'd say white.

85
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,210
And we could change the button.

86
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,990
Text to black.

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,710
How's that sound?

88
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,910
I think it sounds nice.

89
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,270
We'll do that.

90
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,630
So you're white and you and the button is going to have a custom font.

91
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,530
And we'll have the same font as before.

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,120
And in file.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,320
But now the color, the font color will be black.

94
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,090
I'll do that for all of them.

95
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,190
Oh, he's got the settings, don't I?

96
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,210
So that's a 40.

97
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,830
Oh, look at that.

98
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,510
Okay, that's done.

99
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,140
Now take this style and copy it and paste it on hover.

100
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,890
And that should do it.

101
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,810
So now as oppressed as well.

102
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,220
Focus and put in paste.

103
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,120
And now it's it'll work as a button when we put the signal in, but it won't actually change color.

104
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,010
Now I do wanna put a border on that.

105
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,110
So what we do is we go back to my custom styles.

106
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,960
So I went back to the theme, to the theme.

107
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,010
And anyway, these styles, they're all the same one.

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
So should really matter.

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,010
I want a corner detail.

110
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,920
Let's give the border in black the border width of the two.

111
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,010
Now, on that six, that's pretty good.

112
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,280
That might she too much as a three and each.

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,990
My bottom one is that she bugs.

114
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,760
That is three.

115
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,700
Doesn't look like it.

116
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,170
And you know what?

117
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,720
I think it needs more of a corner detail right now.

118
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,430
That's not gonna work a corner radius.

119
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's say full pixels in the radius.

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,410
And I think the button text might be a little bit smaller, so so the button text a little bit smaller.

121
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,910
OK, let's go back to the font, make a little bit smaller and maybe 30.

122
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,200
You know what?

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
That looks pretty good.

124
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm quite happy with that.

125
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,380
Finally on the edge box container.

126
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,670
I wanna make sure this isn't the center of this panel.

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,260
And there is pop up.

128
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,430
There's a little bit experimental, so tweaking as I go.

129
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,870
But I'm quite happy with how that looks.

130
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,810
It's got almost a school gym, feel like an American school gym.

131
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,060
Now we see to make this thing work.

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,010
First off, I need that button to be it ends.

133
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,830
So let's add a signal and let's connect to the gooey.

134
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,320
Well, this is a restart button, right?

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,130
So let's actually do that.

136
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,310
Get tree dot, reset, reload currency.

137
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,980
That's going to restart the game.

138
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,530
We only have one scene that's being played.

139
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,820
That will work nicely.

140
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,200
All right.

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
So analysis, you make that show up.

142
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,370
And so, you know, that's a level and it's my game script.

143
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,810
Great script.

144
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,690
Let's call it level dot.

145
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,620
Jeannie and I need a brand new function and I need a function that checks if we've reached the maximum

146
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,860
scope.

147
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,650
Well, first, let's bring in a variable for that final score.

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,820
So export variable doesn't have to be an expert variable, but it feels good to do it.

149
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,410
What's this called?

150
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,070
Target score.

151
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,840
And let's start with three.

152
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,620
That's nice and easy.

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,280
Say that.

154
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,790
Take a look at.

155
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,550
Doesn't target school.

156
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,220
Nice.

157
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,420
OK.

158
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,880
Brand new function.

159
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,740
Check.

160
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,390
Game over.

161
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,710
It's good.

162
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,740
Now I'm going to have to bring through which player has won the game.

163
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,060
That's gonna show and I'll get these.

164
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,310
I need the player and I need the current school.

165
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,090
Let's make some room.

166
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,070
Okay.

167
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,140
And let's see if the score is equal to the target score.

168
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,680
Firstly, one, does it make one, make sure that timer doesn't get to the end?

169
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,010
If a timer keeps going, it's just in response the ball and we can keep moving.

170
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
We don't have to interrupt the game.

171
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,550
Also, it's not high spot target.

172
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,300
So if the score is the same target score, then I want to get the timer and I want to remove it from

173
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,570
the game.

174
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,640
It can't finish if it doesn't exist.

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,220
Finally, let's go to our gooey.

176
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,570
I'm going to call a new function and put it there called Game Over.

177
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,370
And which player one.

178
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,850
OK.

179
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,640
So we have on U.

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,580
Check.

181
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,270
Game over.

182
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,990
Not check.

183
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,500
Game over.

184
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,650
So was I going go.

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,600
Well, we have a date school.

186
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,450
It feels like that's a good place to put it.

187
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,290
So check.

188
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,730
Game over.

189
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,770
And it needs breakthrough.

190
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,680
The player and I need to bring through the new school.

191
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,650
Finally, just to make this all work.

192
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,660
We need to actually put that little bit in here.

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,980
So a function called Game Over.

194
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,190
And let's go take the player.

195
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,380
Asking to check this what was called game over with the player.

196
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,910
Perfect.

197
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,050
What do we do?

198
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,690
Well, first, we need to change the details, the label.

199
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:26,990
Right.

200
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,600
So right here we have this label.

201
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,950
It says Player Zero wins.

202
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,250
It said this is a player.

203
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,170
The player number wins.

204
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,370
Easy enough.

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,300
We've done it a few times now.

206
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,410
So let's say.

207
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,150
The label, let's grab the label first.

208
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,740
Is the label that's in the V box container label, dot text.

209
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,400
Equals.

210
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,360
And this could be player space plus.

211
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,690
And Rainbow Eater turns into a string.

212
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,730
Player.

213
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,970
Plus, space wins.

214
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,770
Finally, we need the public to actually show so pop up.

215
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,080
And it needs to show the sense of the screens that pop up centered.

216
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,260
OK, if we've done this right.

217
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,960
And it's possible I've missed something.

218
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,970
After three goals, we should get the game over screen.

219
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,300
So let's just do the traditional thing.

220
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:25,940
That one.

221
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,000
To make that time a little shorter, as she knows, it'll look better when we get the details in and

222
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,280
three and time doesn't happen.

223
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,200
We have this button.

224
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,130
We press the button.

225
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,210
The game restarts.

226
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,020
Scores are back.

227
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,160
Everything's back to normal.

228
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,080
We have a fully functional game.

229
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,870
Everything from here on in is adding detail in Polish.

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,520
Look at that.

231
00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:01,220
We have a local multiplayer fouche game about trying to put this unwieldy wooden bowl into a goal.

232
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,670
Really happy with that.

233
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,470
So far, so great stuff.

234
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,940
And I shall see you in the next video.
