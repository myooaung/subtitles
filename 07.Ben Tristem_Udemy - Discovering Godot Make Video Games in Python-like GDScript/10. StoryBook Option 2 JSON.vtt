00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.170
A marvelous gotto people in this video we had to look at another option for a storybook.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.860
We're going to look at how to do a Jason File.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.500
Now this is kind of repeating the same effect a different way and I'm really just showing it as a as

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
a way of showing that there's multiple ways you could solve this problem and as an introduction to how

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.000
to open files within gotta so before any further.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.950
Let's define Jason.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm going to link you to this page.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.510
This is from the Jason documentation.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.020
It says For javascript object notation is a way of bringing in a bunch of data to various programs and

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
various operating systems in a very clear way.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.490
But if we just want the basics they work like this javascript object notation is a list of things we

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.910
can have.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.450
There are two types of lists right there's an array which has value 1 and value 2 and keeps going.

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.270
It value can be a string.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.130
It can be an integer a boolean whatever else we want right.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.540
Our standard variable types is defined by using square brackets.

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.790
And it has a comma between each one and we can keep putting as many as we like in there.

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.450
All we can have objects which are defined by having a key which is always a string a colon and then

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.220
a value which can be any type.

21
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.740
And so the key colon value comma key to common value and solid solids and so on.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.220
And what's really cool about this is this looks very familiar.

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.700
Right.

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.880
This is how G.D. script handles arrays and dictionaries with one key difference and I'm using the word

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010
key here is an unintentional pun.

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.320
Our keys have to be strings for this to work in Jason.

27
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.730
We need to create a Jason File and then we need to figure out how to open the file and as well as opening

28
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.850
it.

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.330
We need to get going to read it posits that means understand it and then close the file.

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.810
Technically we don't have to close the file we can keep it up in a memory but that's bad practice.

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.200
So let's get into got an investment using a right click on on the resource folder and I'm going to open

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.780
it in file manager by clicking open and file manager now for this next bit.

33
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.640
We're going to need some sort of edits you can do this in a standard notepad.

34
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.350
It will work just fine a text but realistically we need a third party source.

35
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.110
I'm going to be using atom it's free and open source idea which you could use Visual Studio code you

36
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.600
could use whatever you'd like to use to make these files.

37
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.660
So I'll provide a link to atom but find the one that you like and if I open atom I can save this.

38
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.000
So let's save as and I just need to get to that folder to reopen this folder.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.490
Copy the link the to find it and go here and I'm gonna call this as stories dot GSO In fact I'm gonna

40
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.360
call it story book just to be really clear story book dot GSO.

41
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.400
Awesome.

42
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.190
Now we're back into got it of my script and remember this whole thing that I commented out so I could

43
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.370
show for now I'm going to uncommon at and cut it.

44
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.550
So it's just not in there anymore.

45
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.230
Back into atom and I'm going to paste it in what I don't want is this variable templates let's get rid

46
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.860
of you and what we have here is an array of dictionaries key things I need to make sure that every story

47
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.790
has a comma between them.

48
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.300
Okay so we have a dictionary with prompts and story Okies must be strings.

49
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.490
OK.

50
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.910
So if you don't have any strings this will not work.

51
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.210
So we have to put this some strings by the way.

52
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.370
You'll notice some of my stories have backslash and in them that's how you put a line break in my string

53
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.940
without breaking it.

54
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.920
So right now we have all these stories.

55
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.570
Good to go so I'm going to save this.

56
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.410
Here's my story book Jason saved.

57
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.490
I can close that and get back into it.

58
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.710
You'll notice it doesn't show up in the file manager.

59
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.610
Does that mean it's not that.

60
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.250
Well let's go check.

61
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.060
When I click on it I may open a file manager and I can see story book dot Jason.

62
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.460
So why can I see here and also file manager.

63
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.710
And the reason is daughter can't read Jason files directly I can't edit them which means they won't

64
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.430
show up here which is one of the potential downsides of using a Jason as love advantages.

65
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.610
But this is not one of them.

66
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.730
OK.

67
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.670
So let us scroll down a bit and I won't make a branding function.

68
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:25.360
I need to find a way of getting a file from Jason's going to a function get from Jason.

69
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.510
OK before I figure out what that is.

70
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.150
Let's make sure we're getting this right.

71
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.780
So I need to comment out all of this.

72
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.790
Instead let's set a new variable for stories.

73
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.150
And this is going to be get from Jason.

74
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.160
Well we might want to use multiple Jason files right so to do that.

75
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.890
I'm going to give it a file name and that's going to be my story book dot GSO and I'm pretty sure that's

76
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.660
written correctly.

77
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.180
But what I could also do is go back into this folder here go to rename this and just copy this whole

78
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.380
names on a copy that I would normally use keyboard shortcuts but when I out and paste it there and here

79
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:21.430
and it's past an argument and so let's call this file name great so we're going to get the stories we

80
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.010
get from Jason.

81
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.090
You know that could be before randomize and press ult and a power to move it up there.

82
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.970
Okay.

83
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.350
So what I need now I need to set my current story so let's do current story equals and this is going

84
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.000
to be part of the stories array.

85
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.030
So I'm going to need to put an array.

86
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.440
I'm going to get my random integer.

87
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.260
So pick a random object in here.

88
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.900
And what's your maximum size is going to be stories dot size right.

89
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.920
Exactly as we did it before.

90
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.150
OK.

91
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.820
So clearly what we need now is get from Jason.

92
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.150
So the first thing I need to do is I need to use this file command and if I left click and press control

93
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.950
you can see we've got a whole bunch of commands we can use.

94
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.340
But essentially what this does is handles file reading and writing operations.

95
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.650
Great.

96
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.980
So what do I need to do.

97
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.920
Let's create a new variable variable file with a small f and that equals file dot new.

98
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.250
This new function tells it with we've now got a brand new file capital F a file object so I could call

99
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.130
this Jason files I wanted to just make it very clear what's happening but you will often see this in

100
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.430
programming right capitalization is key.

101
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.920
Small F is not the same as a big F.

102
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.390
OK.

103
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.980
So what's that going to do.

104
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.100
Well we need to open this file right since he filed it open and that's gonna take some arguments.

105
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.380
The first is what is our file name.

106
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.260
So it's going to be file name.

107
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.520
And what do we need to do with it.

108
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.690
File dot read by the way if you want to know why I'm magically typing stuff here I'm going to go to

109
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.610
file and scroll down this is almost identical to this load function.

110
00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.830
Okay.

111
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.400
So we're open the file.

112
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.450
Tell me what file to do it then read it but we're not doing exactly the same thing that I want to save

113
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.840
game.

114
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.950
I would hope that Jason and get the value from within the Jason.

115
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.020
Okay.

116
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:18.720
So we need the text from this file so variable text equals file dot and there's a function to use here.

117
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.500
Get as text.

118
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.070
Right.

119
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.060
So it's telling it.

120
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.440
This is a text file.

121
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.060
Don't try and read it like a picture or a sound or anything else just read it as text.

122
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.890
Okay.

123
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.040
So I've read the file.

124
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.520
I've told it.

125
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.620
This is text but now I need to understand it.

126
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.500
I need to pass it.

127
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.020
So let's call data because what I'm getting right I'm getting the data out of this and that's going

128
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.420
to be pass.

129
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:52.620
Jason what am I passing the text right now I need to close the file so file dot close it will work fine

130
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.910
without it but why have it a memory when I don't need it.

131
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.700
And now finally I need to return and what am I returning I'm returning the data right.

132
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.940
This bit here.

133
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.670
Okay.

134
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.870
This can seem a little magical so let's just go over what we've just done we've looked up the file and

135
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.150
taking a look at some of the key concepts we can do.

136
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:16.050
Specifically we want to open a file close a file we need to it as Jason.

137
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.970
So I'm just using a lot of this with a few extra special sources coming in and to follow through the

138
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.230
logic of what's happening.

139
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.630
We've declared a variable could file which I've told it is a file object that we're that we're making

140
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.230
you what is it.

141
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.620
It's.

142
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.320
And we're going to open the file name whatever we're passing in which in this case is storybook.

143
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.420
Jason.

144
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.810
And we're reading it.

145
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.860
We're not writing to it.

146
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.120
We're opening it as read only OK.

147
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.180
Now there's something called text which is the contents of the file as text.

148
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.470
So I open it up don't try and read it as a picture or sound effect.

149
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.000
It's just text but we don't just read the text what the meaning from the text right.

150
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.290
We need it to understand what this is.

151
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.290
We need to pass it.

152
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.230
So is a variable called data which is what's in the text passed as Jason.

153
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.070
Finally we're closing the file we don't need it and we're returning the data to here.

154
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.300
So stories is that right.

155
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:13.130
It's the data passes Jason the current story is all of the stories and the machine a pick within the

156
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.570
array a random size before any further I've actually done this bit wrong here.

157
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.090
This should be r e.

158
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.510
Because this is the area.

159
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.680
That's what I'm looking for this all to complete.

160
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.290
How do I know you're going to file and do a search for read.

161
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.350
Let's find the next one.

162
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.670
Doo doo doo doo doo

163
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.600
here we go.

164
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.010
These are flags right.

165
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.200
So read all in capitals is one way of saying that final a small f isn't the same as follows the big

166
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.130
F.

167
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.590
Well this is not the same as this.

168
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.540
That's what I want.

169
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:45.800
Okay.

170
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.620
Let's see if this works my press play.

171
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.600
Welcome to looney lips a little story of a wonderful time may I have a name.

172
00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:00.830
Tuttle may I have a thing cuddly toy may I have a feeling hungry I'm a little bit hungry.

173
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:07.930
Another feeling I have another feeling let's have Flutie some things mice.

174
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.480
Once upon a time at Tuttle eight a cuddly twin felt very hungry.

175
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.080
It was a floaty day for good mice.

176
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.330
Again we have a noun it's a different thing.

177
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.960
Pig.

178
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.830
May I have a name.

179
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.670
Mr. Squiggle an adjective Gray.

180
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.030
Another name

181
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.130
Baron von giggles.

182
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.160
Once upon a time I Paco Mrs. squiggle there was a pickle Mrs. squiggle who searched far and wide for

183
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.640
the mythical Gray noun of Baron von Gilford that noun is wrong.

184
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.600
That's fine.

185
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.990
Welcome.

186
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.310
Look it's gonna get us different each time.

187
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:47.710
Okay.

188
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.010
Quite a lot to take in here.

189
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.240
So before we any further let's talk about why would you bother with Jason.

190
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.360
In general Jason is a really good format right.

191
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.040
Its operating system agnostic so it'll work really easy to know no matter what device I'm using.

192
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.740
If I can handle modern programming languages and work on Windows at work on Linux at a local MAC et

193
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.310
cetera et cetera et cetera we could also add an extra large.

194
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.050
Those arrays we can have one in English one American English one in French one in Canadian French one

195
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:21.890
in Japanese cling on whatever else we want and if we put this file in I use a file as opposed to on

196
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.850
our resource file which is something we can look at later in the course we could make this multiple

197
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.860
we can let the player create their own stories but there are some downsides.

198
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:37.010
One we have to edit the file outside of Jason Gordo can't edit Jason files directly which adds an extra

199
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.690
layer of complexity for exactly the same result.

200
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:45.140
So really we have to step outside Gordo to get the same result in here so which solution was better

201
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.110
for you.

202
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.320
Personally I'm more inclined to keep things within the engine and unless as a good reason to put them

203
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.090
outside.

204
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.270
But if you want the extra modding and all the rest of it maybe Jason is right.

205
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.330
In this video we've looked at the awesome power of Jason.

206
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.660
It's very flexible and it's very similar to the way we do arrays and dictionaries and G.D. script.

207
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.010
We've looked at how to read files and got up and with finished looney lips.

208
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.690
That's it we're done.

209
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.520
We're almost ready to move on to the next section.

210
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.270
How did it work out.

211
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.250
How's your game looking.

212
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:19.160
Don't forget to put anything core you found or made on the forums on discord on the Facebook group.

213
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.580
I'd love to see what you guys are making.

214
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.050
Meanwhile great stuff and we'll see you on the next video.
