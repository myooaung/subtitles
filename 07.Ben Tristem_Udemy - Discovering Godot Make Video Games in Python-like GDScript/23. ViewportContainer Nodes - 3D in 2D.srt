00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,740
Hello again you delightful God people in this video are going to make a game over and victory screen

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,860
were about to put in the logic for game over we should have somewhere to go.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,520
But I want to do things a little bit differently in this video going to look at viewport contain a note

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,730
that's a way of putting 3-d as a small element in a 2D scene.

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,420
Now we've seen hands put to do in 3-d Quite easily right.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,940
If I just drop a 2D element of 3D it'll just render the 2d separately and I can have for example a nice

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,190
menu that pops up right so I press Escape.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,130
Here is a 2D degree in my three different fighting.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,110
But what if I want to do something differently.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,750
Let's talk about the game over spring.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,280
We know how to do this right.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,510
This is a simple study seen with a simple graphic user interface.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,370
A couple of buttons some text maybe a picture or two.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,950
But what if I want to put an animated robot in it out like a 3D robot and put it in a small area of

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,870
the screen as its own thing.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:04,580
We could do this for example for a security camera in a 3D game or an inventory system in a 3D up role

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,160
playing game right we have the character rotating in three dimensions.

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,070
I'm going to use a viewport container and before we get to that fun stuff.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,090
Let's quickly design what the game of the screen screens going to look like.

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm picturing a simple block of probably dark grey something like that.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,360
And in the middle is something like game over in the middle.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:32,060
I'm going to put an animated robot doing a thumbs up and underneath some text saying something like

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,080
start over with a little button and quit with a little bit nice and simple.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,410
Later on we'll add some music to it.

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,150
I will do that later on in this section.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,250
So for now that's our design and this area right here is the key.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,310
This is going to be 3-d in 2D.

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:49,860
OK.

29
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,770
Let's see how that works.

30
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,470
We get back in and got out and make a brand new scene.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,740
And my root node is going to be a control node.

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:56,960
Right.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,690
It's just a gooey.

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,750
Nothing else.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,430
They call it game over and let's save that some save.

36
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,940
But in scenes are not going to put it in gooey creative folder and I won't call this game over just

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,090
so it's very logical need it find and there's my game overseeing right now there's nothing to it so

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,200
let's give it an anchor for rect anger and not anger it's not angry it's very calm and happy and the

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,590
lay out to be full rectangle guzzo now I have a control node but it's invisible this does nothing.

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,530
So let's give it a colour rectangle as a background.

41
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:40,050
And again I going to do the full react and let's change that cut to a nice grey.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm feeling that colour.

43
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,260
Okay.

44
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,560
So far so good.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,520
Now I want everything in the centre of the screen so I'm going to need a centre container and I got

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,710
to put as a child of game over.

47
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,570
So far it should be pretty familiar and let's just make this nice and easy for retting or so whatever

48
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,620
it is it'll stain the sentencing.

49
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,990
Now my elements are split vertically so that's going to be a V box container.

50
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,500
So here's a V box container.

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,030
As a child of centre container and this will resize itself depending on what's in there so let's start

52
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,570
with a label.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,440
You know I should add a theme.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,030
So let's go right back up so the game over screen and add theme in here so that every single element

55
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,010
will have the same thing.

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,310
So load I put in in scenes for some reason so there we go.

57
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,290
And now my label I can write

58
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,240
you have been defeated.

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,000
The next thing I want is this robot.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
So let's talk about viewport.

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,790
Real quick I'm going to open up the help so into scraps into classes and type viewport creates a sub

62
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,650
view into the screen viewport is essentially what is being rendered on screen.

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,180
Now throughout the course I've been telling you that you can only have one camera per scene and that

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,940
wasn't entirely true.

65
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,550
It was true enough for them.

66
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,700
But here's the more advance truth ready.

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,440
Here we go.

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,150
You can have one camera per viewport.

69
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,280
Most of the time this is essentially the same thing so it doesn't really matter.

70
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:17,160
However it is possible to have multiple reports on screen using a the airport container.

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,550
Note the container allows you to put in another viewport in your screen.

72
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,820
So let's close these things that we don't need I don't need that back in too.

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,030
I actually don't need any of these scripts do I.

74
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,130
Inside the reebok's container is a child of contentless put in a viewport contain a note and this is

75
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,590
just a container.

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,580
Right right now this doesn't do anything.

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,820
So instead let's put a viewport.

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,260
As a child of you pull container and we've got some things we can do here we can load in a world we

79
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,430
can do this in a script so that if we were doing split screen multiplayer they would all be pointing

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,620
to the same world with a different camera.

81
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,750
We don't need to do that.

82
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,590
Instead let's instance in a robot so the scenes of the characters and a robot.

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,770
There's my robot see.

84
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,690
See him.

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,110
Why can't I see him.

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,070
Because you know he's in 3D and we're in 2D So let's give the camera.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,940
Now let's move the camera to where we can see what we're doing.

88
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,440
And we hit preview you know what that's a little bit high.

89
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,490
But now I can actually just tweak it in the transform So I'm going to play with this a moment one point

90
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,770
five.

91
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,320
Now I think one point to five let's have the robot looming over us.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,620
And the distance of three point five now is too far away.

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,810
Maybe three.

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,310
Yeah that looks good.

95
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,360
I do also want to add a little bit of light and switch the camera preset off.

96
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,510
I also want to add a light.

97
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,680
So as a child viewport let's add in our light.

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,600
So there's our on the light it's sometimes known as a point light but hear it and light find.

99
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,310
And let's put this in a good place.

100
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm thinking sort of below in front to give that spooky robot look maybe a bit more.

101
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,920
Like that.

102
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,860
That looks good.

103
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,020
Let's preview that the camera.

104
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,850
Now you notice we have this background here.

105
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,300
Right.

106
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,240
So let's go back to a view container.

107
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,510
OK.

108
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,180
So right now we don't see anything.

109
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,670
So the first thing to do is get a viewport And check this size out let's say or what's my width right

110
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:30,030
now my with right now is 405 will strike three hundred three hundred wide and three hundred tall.

111
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,710
Now right now nothing's updated let me leave the scene and come back and you'll see it's update itself.

112
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,810
Now this grey box is the world and it's not actually showing us the camera but if I just run this scene

113
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,030
and this scene only.

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,300
Here is my robot.

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,830
Right.

116
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,010
So sometimes God doesn't update the rendering which is a little irritating but let's find spooky spooky.

117
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,570
Hi folks.

118
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,320
Future Yahn here because I realized I was editing that I forgot a basic step and certainly not God's

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,070
fault that the rebels showing up.

120
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,130
It's mine.

121
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,210
I forgot a basic thing.

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,390
Get a camera pressed current come back.

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,830
It should show up.

124
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,770
So if it's not showing up at this point close.

125
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,450
Come back in and it should be fine because it automatically makes Kalachakra current.

126
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,480
Just goes to show you could always forget the very basics.

127
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,250
Ok back to real time yeah.

128
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,540
Woohoo.

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,740
You also noticed that it showed the background and I don't want that background or need do is go to

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,400
my viewport and a click transparent background.

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,780
Now we're on the scene.

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,010
The robot is just showing against whatever we put here.

133
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:39,000
If I put a standard I don't know PRNG or picture of my face or of my cats I like that the robot would

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,680
be on top of that so that's looking good.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,870
I also have noticed the robot side here and I really want that somebody who take this view pill container

136
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,330
and the size is going to be 300 x 300 Y.

137
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,540
Just like the viewport board and the do is in the V box container.

138
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,410
I'm going to make a centre container.

139
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,750
And the viewport is going to be child of that.

140
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,180
Now on to run the scene.

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,050
March more like it.

142
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,790
Look at this.

143
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,980
OK now let's fix this animation and then click on a robot and then remove the script.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
We don't need any script for robot in this scene.

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,520
Now this will only happen with this instance of the robots of the robot.

146
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,210
Level 1.

147
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,580
So if I save this we'll still animates of a play the game.

148
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,560
Robots still make great.

149
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,100
Back to my game over seeing and I want to go to the armature and end those children as well because

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
that is going to have my animation player.

151
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,860
And let's see.

152
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:44,360
I want a robot running to not overload in this instance only Instead I want robot thumbs up.

153
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,650
Let's take a look what that looks like.

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,430
Perfect.

155
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,810
It's going to make that auto load.

156
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm going to loop it.

157
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,470
I could loop it.

158
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,170
Let's see how this looks.

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,350
Not bad and I could tweak the lighting a little bit make this a little better.

160
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,400
I do that very quickly.

161
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:10,170
Let's add in another light maybe directional like.

162
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,730
There we go.

163
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,050
And let's quickly put that somewhere handy.

164
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,020
I'm thinking up here.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,470
I'm going to go to local rotation.

166
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,200
And let's give us a different colour.

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,490
Let's make this more like a movie and we use the old orange and teal effect which is a little overused

168
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,480
but that's fine.

169
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,260
So you can be team.

170
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,650
And the onlly lights can be a nice warm orange.

171
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,780
And I make this much brighter green energy of three.

172
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,450
Let's put you up here and my directional lights.

173
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,230
Can have an idea you have to see how that looks.

174
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,700
A little better.

175
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,720
Also getting that little bit of back light if I wanted to.

176
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,390
But you know what that's looking pretty good for now.

177
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,910
OK.

178
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,370
So this pupal container is done let's add some buttons.

179
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,920
So back to my reebok's container that's add a great container.

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,500
So my columns are to put labels on the left and buttons on the right.

181
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,440
So let's start with a label

182
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,770
next.

183
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,980
Try again.

184
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,450
And back to send a container.

185
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,040
Here's a button.

186
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,240
These buttons aren't in the theme right now so I could fix that very quickly.

187
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,460
I'll go to thien for theme.

188
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,720
An ad class item.

189
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,520
Button up.

190
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,870
There is.

191
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,290
Let's go to our button thing and click on Stiles.

192
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,800
So that's going to be a new texture new style box texture 3-d.

193
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,800
Click on that allergan to look bringing that texture.

194
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,570
So scenes gooey graphics.

195
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,460
There we go.

196
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,280
There's blue button.

197
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,420
Perfect.

198
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,520
Let's give it an actual size.

199
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,930
So a size 30 by 30.

200
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,570
Good looks great.

201
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,150
Cool.

202
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,720
Cases.

203
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,890
At another level

204
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,350
and this one was it quit.

205
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,860
And another button.

206
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,560
So but and do.

207
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,270
And they should still have the same theme.

208
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,560
My rectangle not going give a minimum size on both these for 30 by 30.

209
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,350
Perfect.

210
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,520
And let's give you an insight to just to be nice and clear.

211
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,100
Awesome.

212
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,890
I get this grid container not centred so we'll do OK go back up to my view box container and add another

213
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,020
one to contain.

214
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,350
Let's just drag the container into that.

215
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,390
And that's pretty good.

216
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,200
Let's run this scene see how it looks.

217
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:51,370
Cool.

218
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,310
Now these buttons right now only have the one texture on I should probably fix that.

219
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,860
But that's looking pretty solid isn't it.

220
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,750
Oh alright.

221
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,260
Couple more things.

222
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,800
What do I need to add a script here.

223
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,290
So let's put a script from a game over scene and put the actual script in my scripts.

224
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,750
And let's connect these buttons again button.

225
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,460
You can be renamed.

226
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,410
You are.

227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Restart button and you are quick to button.

228
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,250
When I connect restart button as a signal on pressed to game over and do the same thing for quick button

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,650
and these are nice easy somersault with quick there's the simplest get tree.

230
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,310
Quite simple.

231
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,720
So let's see how that works.

232
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,360
Run the scene.

233
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,000
Quit the game.

234
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,870
Awesome.

235
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,540
And this one is going to be get tree dots.

236
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,630
Change a scene.

237
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,150
Let's go find that scene.

238
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,980
So for now level one can just go here.

239
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,630
Perfect.

240
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,640
See how that works.

241
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,730
Try again as Level 1.

242
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,680
Do remember we're going to load into this scene but we won't have the mouse which means we won't have

243
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,520
to press these buttons so let's make it ready function.

244
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,880
And in that I'm going to have to bring the mouse back and I'm just going to quickly go in to my scripts

245
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,390
folder and let's go to pause menu and here's where I need.

246
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,370
I need input.

247
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:37,140
Set mouse mode brackets input mouse mode visible to send a copy that go to my game of the screen and

248
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,930
paste it.

249
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Okay so the moment we go into this scene whether the mouse is there or not which can tell it put the

250
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,480
mouse back before we call the scene done.

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,390
Let's quickly finish this theme off as no point leaving it half done.

252
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,060
So back to Game Over.

253
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,500
Go to my default thien should be in button I've got a normal hour.

254
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,450
I want a Prest and they hover.

255
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,820
So let's just go back to my scenes.

256
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,700
Goofy graphics.

257
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,530
Here we are.

258
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,410
I'm actually not feeling this that should be a check button so let's go into the normal button.

259
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,580
I'm going to switch this out.

260
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,640
So right here I've got this blue button 0 7.

261
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,670
There's going be my send a button and let's take a look at hover.

262
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,290
So this can be a new style box and this texture is going to be the same one with a big shadow so it's

263
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,060
like my hand is over it and then pressed is a new style box texture.

264
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,960
And that's going to be this depressed one right here.

265
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,880
How's that looking.

266
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,400
Save that and run the scene one more time.

267
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,870
Awesome.

268
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,410
And I could press quit and is looking good.

269
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,680
We will put music in this later and I can fancy this off of it so maybe try again.

270
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,680
Is going to be.

271
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,670
I demand a rematch.

272
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,090
I may be quit is going to be.

273
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,350
Or can it say I surrender.

274
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,710
Awesome.

275
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,370
Sing as much or as little character in this as you want.

276
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,720
Maybe these buttons are too small.

277
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,990
You can make them bigger or smaller.

278
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,880
But that's looking pretty solid.

279
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,590
And that brings me to the challenge.

280
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,950
I would like you to make a victory scene it's can be very simple what we've done and I want you to include

281
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,810
at least one view contain a note.

282
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,420
I'm going to put a robot in mine but you don't have to.

283
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,430
You could pull word whatever you want.

284
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,920
Remember to include the same buttons we just had.

285
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,910
They could say different things but you want people to be able to either quit or start again.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,410
So pause a video give us a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

287
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,410
Mark Mack.

288
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,090
All right so what I would do is make this very simple for myself.

289
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,360
I only use this as a basic building block so I'm going to go see a scene as I go back up to my goey

290
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,740
scene make a new folder and call this victory will save us as victory docs.

291
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
Yes.

292
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,170
Why.

293
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,040
Because most of this is going to be the same.

294
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,400
But I don't actually need to inherit newses.

295
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,030
So first off let's call this victory.

296
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,570
It's green.

297
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,790
Perfect.

298
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,700
Next let's go into the view container.

299
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,890
Open the robot.

300
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,300
Go to the animation within the armature And as you change what the define nation is so it's not going

301
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,270
to be autoloader a thumbs up it's going to do robot dance.

302
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,940
It can take a look what that looks like.

303
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,490
So let's play the dance.

304
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,260
That's pretty awesome dance.

305
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,900
I could lose that.

306
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,870
Do I really want to.

307
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,780
But we could.

308
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,990
Is about pressing the loop button.

309
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,770
Be fine.

310
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,920
Okay.

311
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,460
Now all I need to do is rename these buttons right something.

312
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Click on this here and get rid of the animation screen.

313
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,710
And instead of I demand a rematch say once more.

314
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,830
And instead of surrender it can say victory is mine.

315
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,980
I'm out of here and I've now made quite a large gap here.

316
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,280
So when I go back up to this label and align it to the right and click on this label and line that to

317
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,500
the centre and that is looking pretty good.

318
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,060
And I can run this scene.

319
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,830
What's more get me out of here.

320
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,170
Oh it's not actually running the animation.

321
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,280
Why are you not running in the mission.

322
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,200
Run the animation.

323
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,330
Because I didn't auto load or time.

324
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,270
Dance robot darts.

325
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,050
Absolutely.

326
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,900
Now if I wanted to I could change this background.

327
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,330
I'll be honest I kind of like this colour.

328
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,050
I'm not going to but I could if I wanted.

329
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,010
And that brings us to the end of this video.

330
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,370
In this video we've learned about view ports and viewport containing notes.

331
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Please do share your screens with me there.

332
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,100
The game over in the victory screen.

333
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,670
What did you do.

334
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,960
How does it look on yours.

335
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,490
Did you pick the robots that you said.

336
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,350
Completely different.

337
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,470
Share it with the community.

338
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,570
I'd love to see what you're getting up to.

339
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,040
Meanwhile we're almost done with this game of I only got a few things to do that some polish and some

340
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,850
music.

341
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,260
And it's looking great so far.

342
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,130
So excellent work.

343
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,720
And I will see you in the next video.
