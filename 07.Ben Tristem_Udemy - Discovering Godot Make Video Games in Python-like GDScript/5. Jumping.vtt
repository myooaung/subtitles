00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.620
Welcome back wonderful people.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.480
Let's make bunny jump in this video.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.650
We're going to add gravity and jumping to our going by the end this video bunny will be able to fall

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.680
and jump naturally and be able to tweak these values to get exactly the kind of behaviour you want to

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.520
do that there's various things we need to do.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.010
The first is we need to have a scene to jump in.

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.700
We can't just run everything off the player so we can look a little bit about how players scenes and

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.370
instancing works.

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.950
We need something to jump on.

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.620
We can't have an empty scene.

11
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.600
We need an actual platform so we can make a temporary platform for now and duplicate that a couple of

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.390
times.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.330
We need to have some gravity because we're using a kinematic body member kinematic body to do.

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.490
It doesn't have gravity built in so we're going to put that in at a jump speed.

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.250
We need to tell it when I press jump.

16
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.110
What does that mean.

17
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.180
How far do I go.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.350
So let's get to it.

19
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.690
First thing they do is create a brand new scene and make this a key route node is going be a Node 2.

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.400
And let's call this level 1.

21
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.960
I'm not going to put a space in it.

22
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.710
And because we using God naming conventions the node is going to have a capital L capital L Level 1.

23
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.500
No spaces.

24
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.830
What goes in here.

25
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.950
Well I want to bring the player in if you want to save this for now.

26
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.840
The one is in a scenes folder.

27
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.850
Great.

28
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.200
I want to bring the player in.

29
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.440
How do I do that.

30
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.400
Next the ADD note is this little chain link icon.

31
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.990
That's an instance scenes.

32
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.850
I'm going to incense the player and he can see here this film clack thing that's a scene button.

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.830
If I press this I'll open that scene and the editor to make that very obvious I'm going to move the

34
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.720
player in the pliocene back to zero.

35
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.410
Zero.

36
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.710
Right so zerox are all white.

37
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.210
Now on the top left corner.

38
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.020
And back in scene.

39
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.760
It hasn't moved.

40
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:57.280
In other words I can work on the pliocene independently and instance it into the level scene instancing

41
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.320
scenes is one of the key features of gallows.

42
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.210
It's a bit like a prefab in unity but not quite.

43
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.990
Scenes can be anything from locations to players to sound effects to anything else you might want to

44
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.800
bring in.

45
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.810
Let's widen the view of this blue view as you might remember is what the camera can see.

46
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.540
I need a bit bigger so I'm going to make this.

47
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.970
1920 by 10.

48
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.320
80.

49
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.930
Because that's the resolution I'm using.

50
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.100
Schmick Tenet.

51
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.250
Not 180.

52
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.870
And much bigger get caught.

53
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.650
I will bring the put the player down a bit okay.

54
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.450
Make a very simple static body so under a level one that's make a static body.

55
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.550
Remember static body 2D not 3D.

56
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.130
And I'm on call this platform.

57
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.110
We will make different platforms later in the in the in this section.

58
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.870
But for now a temporary platform to test with now.

59
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.870
Once a collision but not another size collision I need to give a sprite So let's give it a Sprite and

60
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.760
under graphics G effects in environment as a whole bunch of things we can use.

61
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.330
I'm going to use this nice ground on scorched grass court collision.

62
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.190
Not this time.

63
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:25.290
Let's give it a different college and that's play with collision polygons zoom in and use this add polygon.

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.930
Let's skip this.

65
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.930
Let's take a look at the grid.

66
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.010
Sure that looks good.

67
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.410
Snap to grid animous start here.

68
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.640
OK is a very rough and ready but that's just so we can practice our platform.

69
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.990
I'm going to hide my collision shape and a quick reminder.

70
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.450
Know what let's stop napping degrade and get on the grid.

71
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.770
Quick reminder make sure you've got this.

72
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.490
I can hear I don't want to move the children of this of the platform.

73
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.910
The platform is here.

74
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.250
The Sprite is here.

75
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.640
That's no use to me right I need.

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.690
Just checking in right place.

77
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.110
I need to move the entire platform sir it's zoom out a bit.

78
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.720
Can I move this platform down here.

79
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.410
And I'm going to duplicate it a bit I can right click here and press duplicate or use the keyboard shortcut.

80
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.070
I'm on Windows so for me the people shall cut us control devious duplicate that a couple times one here

81
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.930
and one over here.

82
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.250
Awesome.

83
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.650
So right now we have three platforms with collision mashers.

84
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.380
What's going to happen if I press play.

85
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.700
Well nothing.

86
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.750
We still don't have gravity.

87
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.240
I haven't altered the script.

88
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.090
Oh you know what.

89
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.220
I also haven't told it what the means seniors.

90
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.450
That was a blessing.

91
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.160
There's got to project settings.

92
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.440
An under confident under run.

93
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.080
There it is.

94
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.260
Let's change the main seat player not player.

95
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.720
That was the thing I didn't want to do at level one much more like it.

96
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.720
And that's a bit better now because of a polygon him using moumin slide when I move into this when you

97
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.370
actually see it slide down so that's exciting but there's no gravity.

98
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.450
So let's go to our script and start making this a little neater as a neater.

99
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.670
What I mean is I don't want all of this code under physics process.

100
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.840
It's gonna get very crowded.

101
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.800
So stop putting gravity in here and falling and jumping and everything else it's going to be a mess

102
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.030
suck all of this is going to be a new function.

103
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.880
That function is going to call runs so let's make function run.

104
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.740
Add that skill and stuff in it.

105
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.520
In fact like you just say run immediately because when I want to do and let's move move and slide up

106
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.630
there because moving slide is going to happen at the end of all this.

107
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.480
Now I say that because there's two things to happen here I want falling to happen and I want jumping

108
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.130
to happen.

109
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.450
So what's going to happen.

110
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.260
Every frame is going to run if it can it's going to run the fall which we haven't made yet and jump

111
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.580
which Major let's put a jump.

112
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.240
No less but fall above run.

113
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:22.480
Just because that's going to happen whether or not you are running new function function call forward.

114
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.520
I practice my typing I promise.

115
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.510
OK.

116
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.600
What needs to happen.

117
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.750
Well every frame I want you to move down.

118
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.590
How do I do that.

119
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.300
Motion dot.

120
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.970
Why rembert motion is a vector too.

121
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.220
He looked at Motion X that means the first value of this vector to motion dot Y is a second value.

122
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.850
So what's going to happen.

123
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.440
Every frame.

124
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.200
I needed to move by gravity so plus equal gravity.

125
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.140
Plus equal.

126
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.620
Add the value of gravity you've seen this before.

127
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.270
I haven't defined gravity.

128
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.930
Gravity is going to be a constant.

129
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.750
I kind of glossed over this before.

130
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.780
A constant is a variable that we're not expecting to change in a script right.

131
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.250
Going to send it once and then it stays where it is.

132
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.630
I'm going to put all my constants in capitals to remind me when I'm using them and my gravity is going

133
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.570
to be what's a good value for gravity.

134
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.930
Let's make it 1000.

135
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.780
Now I want to make sure that no matter what the frame rate is I'm going to fall at the same pace some

136
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.700
leaves Delta.

137
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.260
Delta is the amount of time since the last frame.

138
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:38.140
So I've got a pass that in here as well as a function bracket's Delta equals motion dot y gravity tines

139
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.950
Delta.

140
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.300
Now you'll notice that we're already calling Delta and moving slide so we can work around that.

141
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.710
But before Pressplay let's take out jump because we're not actually using it which in a comment that

142
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.340
out for now.

143
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.940
OK.

144
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.430
Let's hit play and find out.

145
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.090
And the bunny felt to have jumped yet and it seems to work quite well.

146
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.150
Collisions a little higher can tweak down a minute.

147
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.770
But something worth noticing that fall was much faster than the first one.

148
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.970
Why is that.

149
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.680
Well the reason is we are adding to motion not why every frame.

150
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.010
You don't accelerate down even if you're standing on something.

151
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.620
So we need to make sure this only happens if you're not on the floor.

152
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.470
How can we figure out from the floor.

153
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.860
Well luckily we are using move and slide and move and slide.

154
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.200
Has that built in if we look at move and slide.

155
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.090
We have the first argument when we are using what you're moving by the linear velocity.

156
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:43.480
The second one is the floor normal floor normal is the up direction used to determine what is a wall

157
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.720
and what is a floor or a ceiling.

158
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.080
That's exactly what we want.

159
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.390
So let's set our constant form up.

160
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.930
I needed to tell what I know and only do it tell when it's a KNOW WHAT UP IS SO Lecter too.

161
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.280
Zero minus one.

162
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.630
OK.

163
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.890
Why minus one chauffeur moving up is a positive.

164
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.610
Well no we should talk about what these coordinance mean in God sir.

165
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.630
Let me bring up my screen sketch too.

166
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.060
In normal geometry we would calculate something like this.

167
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.240
So I want to find out how high you are.

168
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.880
I want to figure out what up is.

169
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.830
I would want to go this way that God doesn't work like that.

170
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.350
Gotta calculate from the top left so it'll look a lot more like this.

171
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.390
Now this is key.

172
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.380
You can't mistake I make all the time.

173
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:55.780
If I want to go up that is a negative y value right so negative 1 in the Y means go up by 1 pixel positive

174
00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.820
y needs go down by 1 pixel is one of those things that's really easy to forget so just keep an eye on

175
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.080
them.

176
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:08.920
All right so let's use up value as in move and slide move by linear velocity so move by motion and up

177
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.340
is the second argument so we'll put that in there.

178
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.300
So if you're on the floor.

179
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.570
If is on the floor.

180
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.280
What do we need to do.

181
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.970
We need to set a motion dot y as 0.

182
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.400
Otherwise else.

183
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.500
Motion not why she grabs you time stops.

184
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.990
See what happens.

185
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.290
Okay I must stay on the floor for ages and now when I fall I'll fall.

186
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.440
It seems to be this before.

187
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:44.280
Great so will accelerate down until we hit the ground and then we get a reset and that's exactly what

188
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.420
we want.

189
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.270
Next up let's make a jump function because that's a platform game.

190
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.850
If you can't jump especially if you're running would jump in the same order we have it here so jump

191
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.280
is going to be underneath run.

192
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.990
Let's put in a few more things so we could see what.

193
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.770
There we go.

194
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.010
OK.

195
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.420
Here we go.

196
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.310
Function.

197
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.180
Jump.

198
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.360
If I press jump that's input.

199
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.870
What is action pressed you are high up.

200
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.190
So if I press jump.

201
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.690
What needs to happen.

202
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:27.120
Motion dot Y is going to equal jump underscores speed.

203
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.890
Well we haven't defined it yet so let's define that now.

204
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.090
Constant jump speed how fast you're jumping.

205
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:43.230
Let's set that to a core value what's it going to be that's going to be in this be good value so set

206
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.420
to a thousand.

207
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.410
It doesn't need to be a thousand that's down if negative a thousand remember.

208
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.870
OK so if I press space jump.

209
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.700
Look at that.

210
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:05.030
You know Matt gravity's a bit floaty isn't it let's give it some real gravity let's double that much

211
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.940
more than tripplett.

212
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.150
Let's let's look at crazy number 3 6 0 0.

213
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.290
I like the falling speed.

214
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.040
Let's make the jump a little higher Let's make jumping closer to 2000.

215
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.150
Too crazy.

216
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.180
That is too crazy.

217
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:27.550
OK.

218
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.170
Little s.

219
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.690
1750.

220
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.980
Now that is a bunny game.

221
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.670
But what am I going so high.

222
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:45.860
Ah I tell you I'm going to die because while I'm pressing it I'm going to keep jumping the long way

223
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.820
down the hirmand to go.

224
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.840
So that brings me to the challenge.

225
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.200
We don't want Bunny to be able to fly.

226
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.630
We want money to have a job.

227
00:12:53.830 --> 00:13:00.370
So I'd like you to remove that air jump make sure that jump only works when you're on the floor.

228
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.200
Pause the video give it a go.

229
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.030
And then when you come back I'll show you my solution.

230
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.920
Welcome back.

231
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.240
How will I do that.

232
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.660
Well first off let's close the game back into the script.

233
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.540
What will I do.

234
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.690
I put it right here.

235
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.720
If you are on the floor.

236
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.370
And we pressed jump do that.

237
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:26.920
And that's it.

238
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.550
That's all we need to do now.

239
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.450
Let's jump for work.

240
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.520
Exactly there.

241
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.090
Now you can tweet these values to make exactly what you need.

242
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.560
And we zoom out the camera things later but that looks pretty good to me.

243
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.970
Look at that.

244
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.900
And that brings us to the end of this video.

245
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.860
In this video we've looked at instancing scenes so bringing smaller scenes into bigger scenes which

246
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.750
we can do as many times we like we've looked at changing what the default scene is what the main scene

247
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.970
in our game what happens where you press play.

248
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.390
We've looked at how x and y coordinates work godso and we've explored the is on floor function.

249
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.520
So great work.

250
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.720
And also the next video.
