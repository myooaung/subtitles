00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.160
Hello.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
And you also got two people in this video this ad our first NPC.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.180
Enter Spike man.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.990
If right now you've got a Metallica song stuck in your head.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.490
You're welcome.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.310
So we're gonna have a very simple NPC and it's gonna be so simple that it's not just gonna react to

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.530
seeing money there's gonna be no A.I. component.

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.110
This is really going to be a moving hazard.

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.090
Spike man is going to move left.

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.770
Pause.

11
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.330
Move right and Bunny is gonna try not to get hit by it.

12
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay so let's get back into gotto.

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.700
I am going to create a brand new scene and it's gonna be a 2D scene which we're going to call Spider-Man.

14
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.880
So I want to rename my noted to spike man.

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.720
Let's move so we can see 0 0 because that's where Spike is going to show.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.190
All right Spike man is actually going to be an area 2D.

17
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.780
So let's put an area 2D in and we need to see what this area is.

18
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.910
So that's at a child which can be an animated sprite.

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.340
Okay so we have an animated sprite but we don't have any frames for it easy enough on the frames where

20
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.160
it is empty.

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.690
When I click on it and your new Sprite frames we've done this before with money so it should be quite

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.530
familiar.

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.460
Click on sprite frames and I'm going to rename the default one to stand we go into the graphics folder

24
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.420
you'll see in the enemies we've got Spike man.

25
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.340
So I'm not gonna use spike man jump for this one I'm still standing here.

26
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.990
Good.

27
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.950
So that is going to give us the beginnings of our Spike man.

28
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.940
Now let's put in simple collision shape.

29
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.020
So under area 2D at a new child that's going to be a collision shape not going away about collision

30
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.180
polygon can be collision shape 2D.

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.420
And let's give that a simple capsule shape and I'm going to use the extents to get this roughly the

32
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.340
right size.

33
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.690
Not gonna worry too much about being pixel perfect.

34
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.670
This isn't super meat boy that should be fine if I hide that there one more thing we want is an animation

35
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.220
place on the charity.

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.540
I'm going to add an animation player.

37
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.170
And the reason we want this is we want to change the animation right so right now we have the stand

38
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.840
animation let's put a new one in.

39
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.170
So on the animated sprite new animation I want to call this walk I was going to hold control and click

40
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.830
on a walk one and walk to and then drag them over.

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.590
That's not going to show straightaway so it's changed now to come back and that should be there.

42
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.810
Well it's not doing things.

43
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.330
So it's playing.

44
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.920
There he goes.

45
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.180
Okay.

46
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.480
So that actually is pretty good.

47
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.810
The speed is good and I can switch back to stand.

48
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.650
Yeah okay.

49
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.460
So we need to make sure that this is playing.

50
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.910
Otherwise guy guys have set it playing in script but looking pretty good.

51
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.970
Okay so how is this gonna work.

52
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.560
Well let's go to animation player and make a new animation.

53
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.390
I'm going to call this spike man.

54
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.060
First is going to happen is this animation is going to auto play.

55
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.770
So this little arrow down here and it's going to loop which is this looping icon and this animation

56
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.360
is not only one second I think six seconds is good.

57
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.740
So what I want to do is I want to go left for one second.

58
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.800
Wait for one second.

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.230
Go right for two seconds.

60
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.620
Why.

61
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.060
Because I have to go back to the zero position and the same is that way and then wait.

62
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.070
So that's at a track.

63
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.320
So we could add the track end by pressing our track but I'm going to go to Area 2D all these keys in

64
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.300
our position because we've we've got the animation up transform and let's set a key right here.

65
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.660
Do you want to create new track.

66
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.240
Yes I do.

67
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.370
Okay.

68
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.080
So one second in you know what let's set up snaps to one second minimize any kind of problems and

69
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.210
is that good let's press play.

70
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.790
I think that's looking pretty good.

71
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.020
We can change the values later.

72
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.970
OK.

73
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.950
So you'll notice it is very slowly drifting.

74
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.440
Why.

75
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.070
Because we're looping so the six seconds it has to be the same thing as zero.

76
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.450
Well that's no good.

77
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.200
So let's go back to the two second mark and set this to minus 100.

78
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.510
And so the key here this line here tells us the value is the same.

79
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.050
So go there.

80
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.420
Wait.

81
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.440
Slowly move over.

82
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.090
OK.

83
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.040
So here we should be zero here.

84
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.860
We should be at positive 100.

85
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.900
Well let's put that in 100 and one second later should be 100 again OK.

86
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.570
That should give us a perfect waiting time

87
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.090
looking pretty smooth.

88
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.990
Well we don't have is the animated sprite.

89
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.740
Easy enough.

90
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.830
We're going to add that to the key.

91
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.070
So animated sprite you're going to do walk and I need to add you to the frame.

92
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.300
OK.

93
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:53.720
So let's add the track property track animated Sprite and I want animation.

94
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.740
That's the one I want.

95
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.240
Great.

96
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.870
So insert key and you should be on book here.

97
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.070
The one second Mark.

98
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.630
I'm going to insert another key click on it and to stand.

99
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.940
Now the two second mark I'm going to select this key here.

100
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.730
The one that tells it to walk and I'm going to right click on it to duplicate key.

101
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.150
And here we now have a walk key and then four seconds do the exact same thing.

102
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.280
I'm gonna select this key here.

103
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.850
It's a stand I want to do duplicate and it'll duplicate it where the play Mark is so final one at five

104
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.480
seconds.

105
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.770
I want to duplicate the work key so it's going to go back to my will key.

106
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.020
Select it and then right click on it to do duplicate.

107
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.960
I'll get it see how that looks

108
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.580
almost perfect nice say almost perfect because Spike man is moonwalking here and I want Spike man walking.

109
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.380
So one more track I'm going to add.

110
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.010
So let's get to I mean a sprite easy flip H right.

111
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.000
So when that's on we'll be walking the right way.

112
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.100
So is enough animation player at track properly track animated sprite that's good.

113
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.700
And I won't flip H.

114
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.540
Great.

115
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.320
And so this will meet nicer symbols so let's just check.

116
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.250
At this point I want to make sure your flip Solis insert a key here and set it to true.

117
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.530
So press play and then when we get to two seconds we need to set it to false so insert new key.

118
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.520
Make sure we get the correct one selected.

119
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.250
So click on two seconds and let's set that false

120
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.020
looking good and the final thing we need to make sure that five seconds we have this key duplicated

121
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.740
so click on it to duplicate the key and that's good.

122
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.190
Okay.

123
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.830
So now let's see how it looks.

124
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.210
That is looking pretty good.

125
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.060
Now I happen to know that a hundred pixels is gonna fit nicely on this large platform so I'm happy with

126
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.470
that.

127
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.970
I'm going to save the scene and let's make a brand new folder.

128
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.370
Nicholas end pieces and Spike man not TSM.

129
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.220
Great.

130
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.190
Now Spike man is gonna need a script and what I'm actually going to do is use doo doo doo doo has his

131
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.970
dot.

132
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.120
However if I open has a slot G.D. this extends area to me that means it is gonna have to be on an area

133
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.200
to denote that's not a problem on area 2D.

134
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.290
I'm just gonna go down to script at the bottom is down our press load and then go fight hazards.

135
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.540
I don't have to do it this way.

136
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.210
I could have just added a new script and do the load menu but this is a different way can do before

137
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.390
we play Spike man.

138
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.810
One more thing we need to do we need to make sure the collisions are correct.

139
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.630
The mosque is going to have to be player and nothing else because the hazard script that we're using

140
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.310
right now is going to detect anybody that can enter it.

141
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.090
The only body that can enter it should be the player.

142
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.140
That's not so bad.

143
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.420
So let's make sure the landing is correct.

144
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.560
So first off mask you're on plant only fantastic layer.

145
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.430
We don't put NBC on hazards and pieces are actually hazards so that works nicely.

146
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.710
So you're a hazard you can interact with players.

147
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.970
Great.

148
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.030
Let's check this works.

149
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.910
Brand new note does a simple note at the top kill you.

150
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.850
NBC is an instance in Spike man.

151
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.890
Spike man.

152
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.510
There you go.

153
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.580
Put myself on move and let's move you up the top here.

154
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.250
Zoom in.

155
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.690
Okay.

156
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.610
Now here's the center.

157
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.670
We've actually placed you here.

158
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.110
Why.

159
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.470
Well it's going to spike man.

160
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.590
Go into the animation player look more of a play marker.

161
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.150
I need to play market to be at zero.

162
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.680
It is not a zero say that it's going to look weird.

163
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.900
Now I can see where the actual Spike meant it.

164
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.860
Surplus place you right here.

165
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.770
So let's see if this works.

166
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.130
Press play and oh it's not going to.

167
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.870
I've just realized why.

168
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.310
That's fine.

169
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.060
Let's test it.

170
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.160
Is moving left and right.

171
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.570
It's great.

172
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.010
But when I touch him nothing's gonna happen.

173
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.660
Why I didn't connect the signal.

174
00:08:51.770 --> 00:09:00.670
See what I've done is I've put the script on so go over here on Spike top body entered the copy on Spike

175
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.210
top body entered.

176
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.200
Copy that.

177
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.960
And now let's connect you so area to be on body entered.

178
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.800
Connect to your self and right here is his method in node.

179
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.680
I'm just gonna paste over that.

180
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.950
Okay.

181
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.250
So now it should actually be a hazard.

182
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.860
Look at that we have a dangerous spike right.

183
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.790
Which brings me to the challenge now.

184
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.020
Quite an easy challenge this time.

185
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.030
I'd like you to add some spike meant to your level.

186
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.110
Do remember keep it challenging but keep it fair.

187
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.360
Right.

188
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.690
It should be playable but difficult is fine.

189
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.150
So I pulled the video put some spike metal on the level when you're happy.

190
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.490
Come on back and I'll do the same

191
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.070
and welcome back.

192
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.770
Okay let's play some spike man.

193
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.870
So 2D.

194
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.890
Great.

195
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:01.200
And I'm gonna do some duplicating make sure I've got my mov mode selected and let's duplicate control

196
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.520
D.

197
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:03.840
I'll put you here.

198
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.010
I think that's a sneaky place to put one because he's not going to interact with a jump pad.

199
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.020
He isn't gonna interact with money and I feel like one more maybe over here.

200
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.470
What are you thinking along.

201
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600
Yeah let's do that.

202
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.230
What about right here.

203
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.410
Looking good.

204
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:29.760
I don't have any coins over here I can fix it on time but let's press play and see how that plays whoops.

205
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.370
I'm already so bad at my game.

206
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.640
Let's get some more coins.

207
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.170
Oh well that didn't work did it.

208
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.780
But look at that.

209
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.960
We have some our first Ed pieces.

210
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:49.950
So in this video we've created a simple NPC and we've used animation player to control that NPC.

211
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.770
We've looked at how these animation plans to do things like change animation sprites change true false

212
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.100
values and flip H and generally move the character around to be awesome.

213
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.920
So how's your level looking.

214
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.810
Do you want to share what you've got so far using lots of different pieces.

215
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.390
Are you using custom assets.

216
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:05.840
Don't forget.

217
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.890
Make this game your own.

218
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.340
I really want to see what guys can come up with.

219
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.940
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
