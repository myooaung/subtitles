00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.290
Welcome back you lovely God.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.630
People in this video want to start making our locked doors.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.600
Now this is just the first part of it all going to do is have a locked door.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.430
That's a variant of a door that's going to bring up the pop up.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.760
But first we have a bug to fix.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.190
I'm sure this bug if I start the game.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.950
Listen carefully for what happens.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.810
Have that door opened a door open the moment the game started on make it a little easier to spot on

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.070
a duplicate these doors.

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.460
Let's put a couple of doors right up here we can see them.

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.750
So one here and one here these are the winners of the most pointless door award.

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.160
But let's see what happens.

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.010
See that they're already start.

14
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.530
So here's our book at the beginning of the level.

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.660
Something is triggering these doors.

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.640
Let's look at an easy way we can debug this in order to debug.

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.940
It's really helpful to start by stating the problem.

18
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.350
The doors are opening when the level starts where we know how doors work.

19
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.210
Because we made them.

20
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.680
Right.

21
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.740
They work by having an area to see.

22
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.640
And when the right kind of body enters that area to.

23
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.640
Not when it's in there but when it enters that area it triggers an opiate emission and lessens the player

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.040
which is the player has to go through an extra step.

25
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.390
Something is entering the doors the tension area and triggering the script.

26
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.720
We know it's not the player one the players out of range and to the play would have to click on it.

27
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.900
Now we're going to use print to try and figure out where this is going wrong.

28
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.450
So let's open up the door script and I'm not too concerned about which one because they're all using

29
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.010
door dot g-day so great we can just use dot Judy.

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.460
And what we do is right here where it says if not body equals Eagles player and the omission is not

31
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.310
play in other words when something enters and it's not the player.

32
00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.670
And you're not already opening open and print when you are a print within a print What The thing is

33
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.580
open that's triggering this animation with a body name is a first step.

34
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.480
It's Pressplay.

35
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.270
And we can see here that three doors have opened and they've all been triggered by static body to deep

36
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.860
already.

37
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.170
That tells me what the problem is because I happen to remember that we've only use static body tedi

38
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.410
once but let's say you didn't happen to remember this or you know.

39
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.220
Spoiler alert look between videos which is what I really did.

40
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.180
What else can we do.

41
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.170
Well a static body is part of a node right it's a sub note.

42
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.050
So let's go up a loveless go get parent dot name.

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.270
So whatever the body is get its parent and get its name.

44
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.610
Let's see if that'll give us the name of what's happening.

45
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.210
And it's a sprite.

46
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.320
We're getting closer.

47
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.900
Just do it again.

48
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.850
Get parrot.

49
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.290
And we'll run that.

50
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.290
Elise we would do that put the dot in place.

51
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.540
Let's try that again.

52
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.810
Door.

53
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.510
Door to door three.

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.380
Somehow the door is getting in some way.

55
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.060
Well up on the scene the only static body we are using is this one is a child of Sprite which is a child

56
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.970
of door.

57
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.100
So this static body is triggering the script.

58
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.420
Well we've set up the collision of the salick body correctly.

59
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.320
Look it's part of the train and it interacts with players not itself.

60
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.920
Security cameras and guards but we have to.

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.890
This isn't the area detection.

62
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.310
This is the actual door.

63
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.250
Right.

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.010
What we need is the collision layer for than for the root node.

65
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.440
The door itself.

66
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.960
And that thinks it's a player that so that train and it can only interact with players and guards only

67
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.050
players and gas going into it.

68
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.490
Now we pressed play.

69
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.720
The doors don't open unless the guard comes through with the parent.

70
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.030
The power of the guard is level 1 or we enter.

71
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.180
So that solves our buck.

72
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.030
Let's go in and remove this print statement.

73
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.590
And we now have doors that don't open.

74
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.370
The moment the level starts but only open when someone is using them got to recycle these doors it's

75
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.250
put them somewhere useful.

76
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.950
But that's great that you can use print to try to figure out where is the logic breaking down.

77
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.420
That's a really important skill when you're making a game any kind of coding or programming when it's

78
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.230
going on track down exactly where the error is.

79
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.260
And print is an ideal way of doing that.

80
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.120
So OK right now we have three doors.

81
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.220
So one of the ideas we get a scene and we've done this before.

82
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.260
Just refresh your memory.

83
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.970
New inherited scene and going to go up a level because we're not inheriting level we're inheriting from

84
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.740
door.

85
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.260
This is our bases or opening that.

86
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.630
And this is our new scene.

87
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.780
Couple of ways you can be sure one under the name it's unsaved.

88
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.670
We haven't say the name of this two.

89
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.700
Everything here is greyed out.

90
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.420
That's because they're inherited and they haven't changed.

91
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.910
Andre when we when we change them let's call this a locked door.

92
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.300
First thing I a do is I want to change what the lock door looks like so I go down to sprite.

93
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.260
I want this to be immediately apparent to the player.

94
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.590
That's a normal door.

95
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.760
This door is a little different.

96
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.970
We've going to graphics under PRNG and other tiles scrolled down.

97
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.530
And you'll see here tile for six three.

98
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.330
That to me looks like a big steel door.

99
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.270
And we use that it's a weird colour though.

100
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.810
And the reason is with colour is I modulated that the original doors to make the doors stand out against

101
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.540
the background.

102
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.680
I didn't want them to be the same colour as the floor.

103
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.410
I gave them a slight pink tent.

104
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.720
Well we don't want that for the steel doors that makes them look like we had passed or pink doors which

105
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.860
I don't know what that is.

106
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.240
So let's modulate to white and I'm a save that as a locked door.

107
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.980
And here we have a lovely little steel door and I put one in the level.

108
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:06.960
You know what door three which one's door three when I move you to a good place of a hill any now can

109
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.690
always redo that later.

110
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.570
Let's put a steel door here.

111
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.250
Give us a brand new organizing note.

112
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.310
No too deep that I'm going to call locked doors.

113
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.880
Go to reorganize that later in the course.

114
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.380
But for now it looks solid and I got to put it right next to these doors so that they interact with

115
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.050
walls and floors the same way.

116
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.060
OK.

117
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.520
So let's.

118
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.770
Instance in new locked door.

119
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.340
Move that to what we need and zoom out a bit.

120
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.020
There you are.

121
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.450
And let's transform you by 90 degrees Whoops now ha.

122
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.430
See I just transformed the no to D that's organizing them all.

123
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.220
Not the actual notes so let's try that again.

124
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.360
Click on the locked door itself.

125
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.420
Down to transform.

126
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.760
And 90 degrees right correct.

127
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.590
There is a locked door.

128
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.270
Currently it's actually just the door if I open the script for it.

129
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.560
This the door script.

130
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.500
This needs its own script.

131
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.710
We're extending the scene but we need to inherit the script separately so let's remove the script from

132
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.810
a locked door and add a brand new script.

133
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.010
And just like every other time I would put this in the script holler and call it locked door and it's

134
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.070
going to inherit from door which is there.

135
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.680
Extends scripts dawdy.

136
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.450
G'day.

137
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.270
Fantastic.

138
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.590
So now this will behave exactly like a door but I need to give it some extra properties.

139
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.870
What I want to happen is when the player is in range the player walks up into the detection area and

140
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.030
clicks on the door.

141
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.940
It's going to bring up that lot no power to do that.

142
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.680
The first thing I need to do is instance in this not about let's instance in number pad.

143
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.330
I have to make sure I've selected the root note so select locked door an instance in number pad there

144
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.700
it is.

145
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.150
OK.

146
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.240
Open the doors script and let's go to big screen modocs exhumed doing.

147
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.090
And here's what I want.

148
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.220
When you click on the door what happens.

149
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:12.360
Let's just copy this function function input event if input is mouse button pressed button left and

150
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.990
you can click on it open.

151
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.250
But I don't want to open I would you do something else.

152
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:23.400
If I pace this in here this is now the new function input event for a locked door so it's overwriting

153
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.200
the thing in a script it's inheriting from instead of open.

154
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.240
I want to do something you want to do.

155
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:38.190
Well I want to go grab the number pad and use one of the pop up commands for it.

156
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.130
Let's take a look at the pop up commands.

157
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:48.570
First let's grab the number pad so is not a perfect ricked grabbed the number pad and I'm going to use

158
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.880
one of the pop up commands.

159
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.050
Let's take a look at them.

160
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.730
Somebody had a classes and type in a pop up as a pop up node.

161
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.030
All right.

162
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.660
Here are the methods we have pop up pop up centred pop up centred.

163
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.060
Minimum size and pop upsetted ratio.

164
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.350
I don't want the ratio the minimum size because in this particular game I'm not reciting the number

165
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.050
that I always wanted to be the same size.

166
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.620
If you want it to resize you should use medium size or ratio.

167
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.520
However I want pop up centred.

168
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.720
I want this to pop up in the centre of the screen.

169
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.490
It's not gonna do that initially but I'll show you why in a second.

170
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.400
So back into the script and I'll pop up underscore centred.

171
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.440
Okay right now this isn't going to have any functionality it's just going to show up.

172
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.680
Going down to my locked door.

173
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.020
Scuse me gonna want to get that first and I click on it but that's not centred right.

174
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.560
Why is it not centred because I've centred on the node not on screen.

175
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.610
I need some way of centreing it in the right place.

176
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.330
How would I do that.

177
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.350
Well the easiest way is to make no pad be a child of a canvas layer.

178
00:09:53.420 --> 00:10:02.910
Like a canvas layer which isn't a type of node a canvas layer is a basic duport node so it's a node

179
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.380
that deals with the viewport and it's there specifically for gooey objects.

180
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.110
It doesn't inherit any position information.

181
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.810
When I make no pad a child of canvas layer and now when it's centred it's going to centre to the screen

182
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.890
not to the object that called.

183
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:25.830
However I need to make sure that no pad is now the right object because no pad is not the correct string.

184
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.170
So let's go.

185
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.720
Number Pad.

186
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:37.860
So it's cambuslang up a pair dot pop up centred pop up underscore centre that we are right this should

187
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.930
now work a little better.

188
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.250
Right.

189
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.470
Big screen.

190
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.020
Click on it and then it's perfect.

191
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.570
One thing I have noticed my font is the wrong colour on hover.

192
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.890
That's interesting I have to change that a minute.

193
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.310
In fact let's change that now.

194
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.170
So while we've spotted this quick bug Let's go to our number pad.

195
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.200
They're easy to fix.

196
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.940
I just need to get to the theme and I want the is my button.

197
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.680
Yes I am.

198
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.360
Okay.

199
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.350
Font colour is black.

200
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.280
I need font colour highlight and font colour press to also be black which can set those very quickly.

201
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.060
Save my theme.

202
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.980
And now when I walk up to the door.

203
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.770
Forget that the Guard and click on it.

204
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.590
Excellent.

205
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.620
Look at that beautiful number pad.

206
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.490
However when I walk away from it the number pedestal here I can click off screen and all vanish.

207
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.090
But I would like the number pad to vanish when the player walks away from the door.

208
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.830
And that's my challenge for you.

209
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:46.340
I'd like you to make the number pad pop up hide when the player leaves the door area tip because we

210
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.260
haven't actually talked about what function to use.

211
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:54.950
If I'm using pop up or pop up centred to show the pop up use hide as a function to hide it when you

212
00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.410
need to leave some poor Lydia seething at the number pad to vanish when the player moves away from the

213
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.830
door.

214
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.080
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

215
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.120
And well Mac.

216
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:15.980
First thing I do is go into the door script which is right here and grab on body it on door body exert

217
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.450
it so copy that and go into a locked door.

218
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.960
I'm now going to override this function.

219
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.570
And what's he going to do as well as can he calls false.

220
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.220
I'm going to bring up the number pad.

221
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.690
It's not auto completing because I'm not actually in the right scenes that doesn't know what to look.

222
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.690
So let's get a lockdown.

223
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.220
There we go.

224
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.820
I got the number pad which is cavalier number pad.

225
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.410
Hide save that and see how that works.

226
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.250
Running for the dog.

227
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.910
There's my neighbour Pat.

228
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.070
Looks beautiful and I move away from the door and it vanishes.

229
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.770
Awesome.

230
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.820
So we now have a number pad that shows up when we need it and if we need to run from the door it gets

231
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.620
out of our way.

232
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.580
That's key because I really don't want the player to feel like oh goodness why is there have been going

233
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.680
on when I'm trying to escape from a guard.

234
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.030
So a quick refresher on how pop up notes work.

235
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.040
These things were designed principally for things like dialogue boxes menus inventory screens but they're

236
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.140
also useful for things like no pads they're hidden when the game starts so we can look at the main engine

237
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.890
to edit them.

238
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.500
But the moment the game starts the player can't see them.

239
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.810
We need to use one of the pop up functions to reveal them and we get high them again with hide and that

240
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.340
brings us to the end of this video.

241
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.500
In this video we've covered simple debugging steps and why print is really helpful and how to show and

242
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:31.980
hide.

243
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.890
A pop up note.

244
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.030
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
