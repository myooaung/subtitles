00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,290
Hello again, you terrific go to people in this video.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,370
We've already got a game that works, is fully functional, but now going to start making it awesome.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,170
This is about enhancing the player experience with design decisions, not necessarily gameplay decisions.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,890
I think the game place.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,290
But how do I want the player to feel when they look at the game, when they hear the game and when stuff

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,800
happens?

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,210
Like what kind of feedback wanna give them?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,910
And in this video, what kind of setting in.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,320
So let's jump right into it.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,740
And I'm going to quickly take a look at some of the assets are included.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,350
So if you look over models, we've got a few things first.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,360
We've got this advert.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,410
Open that.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
And this is a very simple little.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,530
Much right now, right now.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,290
This isn't coloring.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,190
Let's take a look at the MASH real quick and open that we've got a single surface.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,160
So what we could do is bringing offices.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,980
I got a logo here and I think I might have two to do a Gotto advert albedo.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,810
So what I might do is change this material.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,480
When we go to the albino and just drag this in.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,350
And at the moment, it's very hard to see, that's probably because it's so much like, let's tell them

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,440
it's all the way down.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,280
There we go.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,860
And there's some stuff we can play with here.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,120
Now, what we could do is go to.

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,990
It's not quite the right place if I go to every detail here.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,380
I probably movie X, not the Z.

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,660
Up.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,460
Out there.

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,660
That's what you want it weirdly.

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,480
It's not scaled correctly.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,750
So let's change the scale with little experimentation.

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,220
That's probably the best it's going to look.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,080
I'm so quickly look what I just did that went through materials which just closed.

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,170
I've got scale on the X has point sixty five.

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,360
And the offset is twenty five.

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,530
Now ordinarily the sets would be built with these in mind.

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,860
Right.

40
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,520
But we haven't done what we've got is a simple mesh that like he's made and I'm putting a texture on

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,140
top of it to make it work.

42
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,400
It's not usually matte.

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,800
It's just making it work.

44
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,230
So maybe it only uses maybe two.

45
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,500
But if you do want to use this, which is going to take this mesh, we don't care about the rest.

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,650
So in this case, I am going to.

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:13,720
Right.

48
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,240
Click on this as a safe branch of seen.

49
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,550
And I feel like this is part of the level and a subfolder called Dekel.

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,040
So put that in.

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,370
OK.

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,050
So there's one thing we can look at.

53
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,240
Let's see what other assets we have.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Real quick models because we got an advert we've got keep doing the goals, you know, about them.

55
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,550
Leave the particles for now and set us a toys.

56
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,020
This lovely bear.

57
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,050
This one is from our good friend, Mark.

58
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,880
Hello, Jelly and Lessel Jeleva.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,580
We've got these beautiful blocks.

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,760
I mean, they might not be beautiful is a single block made using a can block texture and you could

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,340
make as many of these you like, you could even spout simple words.

62
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,540
And we've got this lovely wagon, lovely wagon.

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,380
Now, this lovely wagon has multiple measures as part of it.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,140
So you'd have to find a way of exporting all these, probably by doing the simple save as.

65
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,540
So you've seen as models, toys, wagons, bandwagon.

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,000
Great.

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,450
And from here, you could change it.

68
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,730
Right.

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,720
We also don't need the animation player in that.

70
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,690
The advantage to this, you can make different materials for each of these.

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
So what you do is go into Matu, go into the mesh itself, sorry.

72
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,810
And this material here would be a new spatial material.

73
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,840
And then I could make this.

74
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,450
I could make this a nice red wagon, for example, like metallic or whatever, and just play around

75
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,780
with that.

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,170
We've also got a few textures that we could use.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,410
So I'm going to close these without saving them, as you might say.

78
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,490
OK, and let's take a look.

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,010
Texas.

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,070
I've got this floor, which I better put a plane here and I've got this hip's the background of the

81
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,710
backwell and a picture I could put on.

82
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,500
So there's a few things we could do.

83
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm going to show you how to build a floor.

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,490
And then I'm going to let you loose and see what you create.

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,660
OK, so really make it your own.

86
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,750
One more thing you can do before I go any further is you could add in a mesh inserts, you could build

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,040
a mesh instance from scratch.

88
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,200
And over here, this is what kind of mesh?

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,120
Let's say I want a cube.

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,120
And move it to a place where I like it to turn little door properly with move and then I click on it.

91
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,460
I can change the sides on the X, Y and Z.

92
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,630
You don't even have to change scale.

93
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,910
You could say that this is, I don't know, 20 on the X and or 60 on the X and use it as a skirting

94
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,020
board, which I might do.

95
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,480
So what we gonna be doing is just just be making a simple mesh.

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,150
We don't care about physics bodies.

97
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,660
We're not making any effort to interact to the world.

98
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,230
It's just a mesh that exists with the texture.

99
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,740
So let's start off by making a brand new blank note, taking my computer off caps lock and I'm going

100
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,620
to call this scenery or Dekel.

101
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,630
Let's keep it consistent.

102
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,470
Dekel.

103
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,730
Within that, I don't make a brand new mission since.

104
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,360
And this is gonna be a plane.

105
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,550
Now, we already have a plane that made the pitch with, but this doesn't have to have any kind of static

106
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,090
body with it.

107
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,500
So let's call this off for.

108
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,000
And I'm going to move this down.

109
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,220
Transform.

110
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,020
Translation.

111
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,270
Why negative.

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,920
Point two.

113
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,060
So just below on this.

114
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,660
Make it big.

115
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
So what's a good size for this?

116
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,630
You know what?

117
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,170
Let's go crazy.

118
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,430
It's a 100 by 100.

119
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,390
OK.

120
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,090
That's one hundred.

121
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,280
One hundred and clearly quite ugly to look at.

122
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,750
So let's give it a new material.

123
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,600
So new special.

124
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,930
What, you're not shy.

125
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,420
Go.

126
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,310
And I'm going to use this floor texture.

127
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,250
I got a dozen crashes that took ages.

128
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,470
Ready?

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,270
We have a world that makes a little more sense.

130
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,360
We have some blood spots there, but let's just see the difference that makes walking.

131
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,120
See that now we are moving in space.

132
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,540
Still, maybe the camera's beautiful position because now culturally a lot in the back.

133
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,860
But that's looking good.

134
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,300
So here's what I'd like to do.

135
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,660
I'd like you to add background details of your version of Kutty Kick about using assets that build more

136
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,200
in blender.

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,290
Find more on on other sites and bring them in.

138
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,750
Really customize this and make it your own.

139
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,980
So pulls a video.

140
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,260
And when you come back, I'll show you what I've made.

141
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,120
And welcome back, folks.

142
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,400
OK.

143
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,640
So as you can see, I've gone and built some things first.

144
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm going to quickly look at it through the camera previews here, looking wild.

145
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,410
I'm actually pretty happy with that.

146
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,920
Now, tweak the lighting in the shadows, change the angles.

147
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,870
But I cheat to talk you through each of these assets I've placed in and the kinds of decisions I've

148
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,130
made and the techniques I've used.

149
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,860
So first, the flow I've seen that is just a single plane with a single texture.

150
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,990
This all needs to be the back wall is the same deal.

151
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,760
Now, I've made this a different size.

152
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,450
I don't really need it to clip onto the floor.

153
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,860
Right.

154
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,810
So I've made it bigger than we need and I've kept it roughly proportional to the Texan.

155
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,520
Looks pretty good.

156
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,870
The skirting board is a single cube as a measure instance, and just putting out a nice flat red material

157
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,070
on it.

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,690
It does come through the back of the wall a bit.

159
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,180
But it gives a bit more dimensionality to the game.

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,300
OK, so this painting, this painting is exact, the same deal is this picture, PMG, that I drew.

161
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,490
And it's on a mission sense and I've put it at an angle because I want it to feel a little bit less.

162
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,380
So it was the bottom of symmetrical, right?

163
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm a little bit of chaos.

164
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,580
I want to feel very playful.

165
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,150
The advert we looked at to sort of put it here, it works really well.

166
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,080
The bear, I just placed it here.

167
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,090
I actually think I might make the bear bit bigger.

168
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,640
So his only do I click on a bear transform and I only need to move the bear.

169
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,010
Now, if I look at the scene, instances open that you'll see this is a spatial with four measures.

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,140
I've got rid of everything else by changing the scale here.

171
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,320
It's a three times bigger.

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
It changes all the children of it.

173
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,080
So now the cubes can keep Doo's can look a lot smaller and everything's in in the same kind of proportion.

174
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,670
How do we make sure from doing that?

175
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,320
That I do too.

176
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,230
Don't go through the floor and I might just check how that looks through my camera just to make sure

177
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,540
that I'm not shadows a bit much, isn't it?

178
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,130
Maybe maybe three is too big.

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,320
How do you feel about.

180
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,280
Yeah, that's pretty good.

181
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,310
Now he's come out of preview to move the bed back down.

182
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,600
About that.

183
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,130
OK.

184
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,990
So I did the same process with the wagon.

185
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,990
What I've done here is I've created a simple material that is open the scene.

186
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,060
So I exported or saved as rather this specialist.

187
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,100
That's just keeping the spatial.

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,010
It's a nice, easy way of moving everything at once.

189
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,130
This hand wagon here, I just added the material.

190
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,730
It's a simple I'll be the texture and I've just turned the roughness down.

191
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,420
So it gives it nice.

192
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,380
Not quite reflexion, but nice flat feeling, very plastiki the wheels.

193
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,690
I've done a very similar thing here.

194
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,760
I've given more metallic and tan the roughness down.

195
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,050
Just a great texture.

196
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,010
It looks like a Plastiki fake metal, which is what I'm going for.

197
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,830
And I've applied them material to all of these just by taking this, copying it and pasting it to the

198
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,130
others.

199
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,560
Which means if I go into any of these and change them.

200
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,920
It'll change all instances of that material.

201
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,090
It's all one material.

202
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,470
What else we have in these building blocks?

203
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,780
I have three building blocks and I'm just place them and rotates them so they smell love.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,660
I mean, I might even tweak these.

205
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,530
I'm fine with that.

206
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,620
Let's see how this plays.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,680
That's the really important thing.

208
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,180
So again.

209
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,650
Team error messages got D.A. files open it on holiday with them, and suddenly this game feels very

210
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:41,980
different.

211
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,280
I have noticed that the characters are floating slightly above the ground.

212
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,460
So you wrote my collision that I fixed up.

213
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,820
But look at that.

214
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,340
That feels much more polished right now.

215
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,880
Have a space.

216
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,470
Now, if we wanted to, we could make this a lot more complex by having, like, little figures here,

217
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,610
maybe animate them fireworks that come up, whatever you want.

218
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,070
But by placing these scenic elements that fit with the game right there, the same kind of color palette.

219
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,450
They're all very playful.

220
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,210
They do the right kind of scale.

221
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,680
It really gives us a reinforced player experience.

222
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,090
It really makes the thing feel a lot more fun.

223
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,420
Might even with this painting Dell'Abate, let's move the painting down.

224
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm also in a close these days because it's confusing everything.

225
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,940
Close, close, close.

226
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,220
Great.

227
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,690
So I'm going to move that painting.

228
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,170
Painting.

229
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,470
All right.

230
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:30,980
They are.

231
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,060
Let's just move you.

232
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,020
It's like one quick thing about the potential to say the transform.

233
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,020
On the Z access, the back was forced.

234
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,260
I have this negative nine point nine, seven, five, not ten.

235
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,950
If I put it as nothing negative, ten will be the same place as the wall.

236
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,370
And you'll get this.

237
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,780
This is a pretty common error in a lot of games where you've got two different objects in exactly the

238
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,280
same place with different textures.

239
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,790
And what's happening is the game engine doesn't know which one to render.

240
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,920
So it's just taking a guess and it's guessing inconsistently.

241
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,760
So to fix that, you just want to have them.

242
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,960
JERMEY Negative nine point nine seven five.

243
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,090
You just want to have a tiny, tiny difference in where they are.

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,390
Right.

245
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,330
So the nominators at which point is very clear to the engine.

246
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,830
This is in front of that.

247
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,940
So render it accordingly.

248
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,950
And that feels pretty good.

249
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:30,270
So in this video, he in this video, we've enhanced the player experience with background details.

250
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,410
We'll just add a bunch of measures with no collisions.

251
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,370
They don't do anything.

252
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,250
They just look better.

253
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,270
But we've added a bunch of awesome so great stuff.

254
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,460
And I'll see you in the next video.
