00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.520
Hello again you delightful God to be born in this video.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.560
We're going to talk about labels locks and night vision.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.710
What do you mean by that.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.140
Well let's take a look at the game right now.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
I have a computer right here that holds the combination for these two locked doors.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.620
I have this computer as Hollin combination for a completely separate locked door.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.000
I know which is which because I put them there but right now it's not really clear to the player.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.380
Admittedly at this point there's only one way through the level but there might not be there might be

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.590
several ways through.

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.370
So I want to add information specifically which computer relates to which door later on I'm going to

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.720
hide some information.

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.870
I'm going make it so the players can only see this information in night vision mode.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.070
Let's give them a reason to keep switching modes Let's add a layer of tactics or strategy.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.060
One of those two and go from there.

15
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660
So bagging game and this time I'm not starting a new scene which is I don't know.

16
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.440
Feels weird.

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.520
We've been starting some new scenes I feel like doesn't matter.

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.150
It's going to lock dosing and I'm an adult.

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.500
Well not a rechecks label.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.770
I don't need it to be rechecks just a standard label and I'm going to put it right where you think here.

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.650
Yeah that looks good.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.920
Let's put it right here.

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.320
And in it I mean write the words test the word test it's not words.

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.380
It's one word.

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.260
Now this is the wrong font.

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.790
So let's go into a theme and a plight load thing.

27
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.880
Okay.

28
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.960
That's much bigger than I was hoping.

29
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.530
So instead let's make that small.

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860
In fact that's the origin point right there is no.

31
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.290
So let's click on a theme at it thin add class item.

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.400
And what are we adding we are adding a label where in the rules for a label so we going to override

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.870
settings.

34
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.830
If you're a label and the settings will override a fonts can a load a new dynamic font has that.

35
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.490
And it's going to be in graphics e.g. no not big graphics interface fonts.

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.890
There we go.

37
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.570
We're going to use vector feature thin and it's not showing because the setting has reset to zero.

38
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.890
Let's try 20.

39
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.820
Looks pretty good.

40
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.370
Save the scene and take a look at it in-game.

41
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.670
Great.

42
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.940
We now have some labels.

43
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.490
However these are all sideways.

44
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.500
I don't want them sideways.

45
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.900
I want them to always be the right way up is enough.

46
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.710
Let's go to a locked door an open locked door script and all that to do is pick a nice function.

47
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.330
I say we're right here when it gets the combinations.

48
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910
Let's grab the label.

49
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.360
Make sure you use the capital L and WILLIS Do we want to rotate it so let's get that.

50
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.850
If we click on the label underreact you'll find a rotation mouse over it to get the property rect underscore

51
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.350
rotation.

52
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.120
So let's do rect underscore rotation.

53
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.430
He calls and all I want to do is take whatever the rotation of the locked door is and do the opposite

54
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.870
of that.

55
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300
Signs can do negative rotation underscore degrees.

56
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.110
So I'm literally just taking whatever your rotation is and undoing it so it's always going to be the

57
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.280
right way up.

58
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.500
Let's see how that works.

59
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.330
And there it is.

60
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.170
Awesome.

61
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.600
We can tweak the exact positioning of it but for now that's pretty good.

62
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.440
In fact I will move that over.

63
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.870
We think here.

64
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.730
Yes let's get.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.640
Okay.

66
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.160
Next up do the same thing with the computer.

67
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.590
Someone open the computer an to put a label into it then someone put the label behind the computer.

68
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140
It doesn't feel right that's in front.

69
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.920
I don't know why.

70
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.480
It just doesn't feel right front.

71
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.130
Go ahead.

72
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.390
Adding a label applying the theme we don't have to change the thing this time because we've already

73
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.850
you know put the information in the theme and that was the whole point.

74
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.830
And let's write the word test.

75
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.400
Going to put the same logic into the script.

76
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.310
So I'm just going to go into my locked door script and copy the line we just put in so this label recto

77
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.390
rotation minus rotation degrees.

78
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.050
Let's put this one in.

79
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.620
Ready.

80
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.150
Now you might be saying or.

81
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.610
Why didn't you put it in ready in lock door obviously locked door doesn't have a ready function and

82
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.300
I didn't really want to make a ready function just to protect the label when there is another place

83
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.510
that would work just as well.

84
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.580
Computer does have a tree function.

85
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.980
I don't feel bad about that.

86
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.400
Okay so now we press play we should see a label by the computer and by the locked doors and they should

87
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.360
all look good.

88
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.470
They do look pretty good.

89
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.180
OK so we have these labels but right now they're kind of useless.

90
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.420
Let's make them useful.

91
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.550
In computer I mean add a new export variable and I won't call it lock LOC group and lock group are set

92
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.970
as a string.

93
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.680
I wanted to be a string because if I just have the value one in here it's going to assume I'm in an

94
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.730
integer.

95
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.400
But what if I don't want to be an integer.

96
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.670
What if I want a specific lock door or computer to have the label vault or CEOs office or I don't know

97
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.640
sweet shop whatever it might be.

98
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.970
Let's put it a string.

99
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.740
After all we're not doing any maths with this lot group which is using it as a label so it doesn't have

100
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.910
to be an integer.

101
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.370
We have our default lock group and I'm going to it you know.

102
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.000
I never said it as unset so that if we place a computer and we forgot to set the label it'll be obvious

103
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.970
immediately.

104
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.850
So we have this lock rope.

105
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.980
Let's send it through and send it through as part of the combination.

106
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.550
I'm sending a signal through.

107
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.720
Let's just piggyback on it.

108
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.600
So the second argument it'll send is lock grip.

109
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.490
Do not press play at this point because this combination is being sent with two arguments lock door

110
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.270
is expecting one if it comes you with two.

111
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.350
God will crash.

112
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.750
So what do we want to do back into computer Gedi.

113
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.810
Let's actually reset the label with this text so label dot text equals and it just give you the locker

114
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.540
room.

115
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.180
Were passing this information this argument for LOC group over into the locked door so it's got a locked

116
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.380
door an ADD lock proof as an argument.

117
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.600
You don't have to call it lock rope Remember you can call it banana I.D..

118
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.300
I'm going to call it lock rip.

119
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.350
Let's set the text the label.

120
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.800
Labelled on text it calls.

121
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.380
What group.

122
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.650
Now we could Pressplay.

123
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.590
And look these are all set to once I can see that this computer and these doors have the same combination

124
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.800
of I think through behind us Guard terrible security just letting me in.

125
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.470
These are set to unset.

126
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.120
OK.

127
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.920
So let's set this computer to group two and doesn't have any group to let's call it.

128
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.400
Ah the office knowing a good name for it.

129
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.360
Now I pressed play.

130
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.370
I can sneak my way into through a locked door one.

131
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.040
Not a very odd combination.

132
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.920
Don't mind me.

133
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.010
Our Andy office our Indi office great.

134
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.680
I'd like you to hide the labels when we're in dark vision and only show them a night vision.

135
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.480
There's a few different ways you can do this.

136
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.820
I would recommend that you try and use groups but there are other ways.

137
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.290
So pause the video.

138
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.560
Set the labels to only show night vision and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

139
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.780
And weak Mac.

140
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.670
Okay.

141
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:35.230
So what I'm gonna do is I'm an add all of these labels to a group called labels.

142
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.900
At that it's all underscore that's important.

143
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.130
And over here this group will be added to labels.

144
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.650
Great.

145
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.160
Save that.

146
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.550
And back in level one I'm going to go to my vision mode script and I'm gonna run it in here.

147
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.670
Why am I doing it this way rather than just adding it to the interface.

148
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.840
Well I'll show you.

149
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.480
I don't need a script for label rewon to put one in.

150
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.180
I can add a function for locked door and put these on interface.

151
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.280
However an even simpler way of doing this is in two way.

152
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.600
Vision majidi you.

153
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:20.070
When we're in night vision mode I want to get tree dot call group.

154
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.300
There it is.

155
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:27.650
I'm calling the labels group and Wanadoo to say hide.

156
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.850
I'm using the built in function.

157
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.200
I don't need a script for this.

158
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.050
This is something that all knows how do and.

159
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.490
Over here I'm going to show you's show.

160
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.150
Great.

161
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.980
It works but I've got the wrong way round.

162
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.150
I get so in dark vision where you hide in night vision.

163
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.680
You show.

164
00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.100
If you wanted to you could go to the computer you could put the functionality in here and you could

165
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.290
just say I will put night vision in here and put dark vision in here and then when the player script

166
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.980
calls interface night vision mode it'll know.

167
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.440
Oh that's part of the interface.

168
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.040
So just send that.

169
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.290
But I find this a lot more elegant So I'm just going to put it inside my vision majidi and that's going

170
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.010
to be great.

171
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.110
One more thing I want to do.

172
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:26.680
I'm going to add a couple of labels on the map so let's make a brand new note Judy and I'm going to

173
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.830
call this mat labels.

174
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.430
Add a label.

175
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.700
And let's move it to what sigga room.

176
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.310
This one.

177
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.210
I put it right here.

178
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:54.060
Going to load in my suit my theme soloed theme I will write the words which we write about.

179
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.320
Main office.

180
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.680
Put that somewhere nice and just add that to the labels group.

181
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.920
I'm going to put one more in.

182
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.230
I'm going to let's see you label.

183
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.260
Put this one down in the bathrooms.

184
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.580
Call it bathrooms

185
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.630
low the theme in here.

186
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.340
Lobed thien hope those are my bathrooms.

187
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.160
And I mean the same label.

188
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.560
Just to make it much clearer.

189
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.930
I'm going to call this.

190
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.150
What's it mean.

191
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.750
Office label and bathroom label.

192
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.300
I can see it in this country.

193
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.820
Now I press play.

194
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.470
Start labelling areas on the map.

195
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:57.220
One thing I should do is hide all of these things in by default so there's going to scripts.

196
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.920
And let's go back in to where did you go.

197
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.440
Vision mode.

198
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.670
Great.

199
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:11.060
And let's actually call this Hyde function straightaways on the call.

200
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.260
Hyde on ready.

201
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.160
Why.

202
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.720
Because this way we press play.

203
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.320
I don't see the map information that we stop.

204
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.620
So everything is nice and hidden.

205
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.720
Strange vision mode.

206
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.330
Nice unstrategic looks like blue prints.

207
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.050
And that brings us to the end of the video.

208
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.860
In this video we have rotated some labels so they always face the right way up.

209
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:36.390
We've sent multiple arguments within a custom signal and with hidden and shown labels depending on context.

210
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.510
We're a really great shape.

211
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.490
We can now make a strategic and tactical information available to the player but only if they take a

212
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.690
risk and can't see when the guards are looking.

213
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.000
So take a moment.

214
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.550
Label it various areas of our map that you think are interesting.

215
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.260
Put in some more lock groups and then come up with interesting names for different groups and share

216
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:53.830
what you've got.

217
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.310
I'm dying to see the kinds of levels you guys are making.

218
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.470
Meanwhile excellent work and I will see you in the next video.
