00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,690
Hello again you wonderful God to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,420
We're going to get ready for our computers by having a node they can generate combinations and it's

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,370
going to generate combinations of whatever length the computer asks for.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,510
So what do you mean by combination.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,390
Well a combination is an array.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,060
So if you remember when we did the locked door test we had an array of 4 1 5 that's three integers within

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,610
an array and these arrays are going to be of varying length so maybe one locked or has a three digit

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,370
combination.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,950
Maybe one has a four digit combination.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,700
Maybe one has an eight digit combination.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,100
And I want these combinations to be returned to another note.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,940
I want to have one thing one object that is responsible for generating combinations and I don't want

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,870
them to be within computers or anything else.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,170
I want a node called combination that just generates combination a single look at God.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,010
So if we look at the sync tree what I'm going to do is I create a brand new node or of it instance one

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,520
in that's going to be responsible for generating combinations.

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,580
I want to really take advantage of object orientation by having an object that does a thing and then

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,410
having other nodes ask it to do the work to do that I'm going to make a brand new scene.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,820
I gonna make a new scene rather than just put it in here because if I make other levels I want to be

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,070
one instance in this combination.

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,770
You know what we could call it combination generator that feels like a more useful note let's call it

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,730
combination generator and then make the simplest possible mode because all it's going to do is just

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,520
be an object that holds a script so it's just a node.

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,940
But you know 2D doesn't have to be a note day let's call it combination generator.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,200
Great.

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,250
Let's save that.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,190
And that's going into science which is here fantastic.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,540
And it's going to have a script so let's give it a script cognition generated GDP and that's going in

29
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,660
the scripts folder.

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:11,150
OK for now I'm going have a variable called length and I'm going to say a four digit code and I make

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,750
an export variable so we can change this nice and easily I say nice and easily.

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,660
If I click on commentation generator mode there's a link I can change that later on I'm going to remove

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,380
this variable because this information is going to be passed in from other nodes.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,020
But this just to get it working.

35
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,710
Let's make it function and I'm going to call it generate combination.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,520
And let's go take an argument of light.

37
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,060
That's how many digits do you want this combination to be to generate a combination of like.

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,250
Alright let's talk about what has to happen here.

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,470
We need to have the length of the combination and we need to generate an array.

40
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,850
So let's make an array called combination and just make it nice and easy and make an empty array.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,940
I want to say okay take this like while you're in this range why within length.

42
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,220
Iterate through it and add and add another random digit.

43
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,360
Well if I'm reading through Let's use a fall.

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,260
So for number in.

45
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,080
Range.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,520
What does in range mean in range means if I put a value in here so it's a link which right now is for

47
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,250
it's going to iterate.

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,210
No no no can be anything it could be I.

49
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,470
It can be a digit.

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,550
It can be donkey whatever you like but I'm going to call it number as a little easier iterate through

51
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,680
it.

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,710
So do this once and then its rate number up by 1 and keep doing that until this number is the same as

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,710
length.

54
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,900
So what do we need to have we need to randomize.

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,110
Why do we need to randomize.

56
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,450
Well what we need to do is pick a new random number and we need this to happen each time because otherwise

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,080
it'll only happen the first time instructions read and it'll always come up with the same random numbers.

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,240
Let's make this as random fossils are randomized and then we need to do is do a combination dot append

59
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,510
because were appending to the array.

60
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,010
And what we appending to and remember pend means we're adding a new digit to the end.

61
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:17,030
Well it's a random integer as a random integer up to 10.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,960
Now we're using up to 10 because remember we're starting at zero not at once of 10 digits from zero

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,150
is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,370
Those are the digits we want.

65
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,670
OK.

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,800
How do we know this works wonderfully is finished.

67
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,190
Let's print it.

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,520
Right now this won't do anything because I need to put in a ready function.

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,330
We're going to remove the ready function later but I need to check this is working and all to do is

70
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,690
generate combination links.

71
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,750
I test just this scene.

72
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm not good press the play button and press the play scene button which is this one right here.

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,170
You just press F six if you're on with us.

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,590
6 2 7 3.

75
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,330
Now you notice the scene is completely empty.

76
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,220
Let's try that again.

77
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,440
1 7 8 3.

78
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,410
Fantastic.

79
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:24,630
We now have a node that when it's asked to can generate a random combination of four digits.

80
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,970
My challenge to you is I want you to change the script or the export variable to generate an eight digit

81
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,950
combination.

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,750
Now for some of it's simply very simple.

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,010
And for some of you this might be a little more complicated.

84
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,530
So pause the media make changes so that you're generating an eight digit combination not a four digit

85
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,460
combination.

86
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,250
And then when you come back I show you my solution.

87
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,190
Welcome back.

88
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,430
As a couple of ways I could do this.

89
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,560
The first is I could change the export variables so I just put eight here and then run the scene.

90
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,500
5 9 4 2.

91
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,880
Bring it.

92
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,810
I could also return this back to whatever's in a script and just change it and script.

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,390
Now are on the scene.

94
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,350
There's another eight digit combination.

95
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,580
Awesome.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Now let's incense it with.

97
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,410
In this scene so I'm going to instance in level one.

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,720
Scenes and cut combination generator.

99
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,920
One more thing where change me go back to my original scene.

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm not going to change it here I'm a judge in the original scene and go to the script.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm going to remove export variable length 8 and the ready function and the print.

102
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,660
I'm not going to print the combination.

103
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,370
I'm gonna return it so as to return combination.

104
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,270
If you return by itself it will just end the script where you are.

105
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,130
So just stop stop doing.

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,880
But if you return combination whatever value this is which is the value of just generated right.

107
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,300
This array.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Send that back to whatever function called this one.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,460
So we are going to create a computer that is going to call this generate jeric combination and actually

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,130
generate combination not generate or generate combination of length that can be called from another

111
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,040
script and whoever calls that just send it back here.

112
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:27,270
This is going to be rather useful because if we look at any level one scene we could have five six 12

113
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,030
computers all calling this and they will each get their own combination of whatever length they asked

114
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,090
for which is a really good place to be right now.

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,140
And that brings us to the in this video.

116
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,900
In this video we've looked to creating a combination object.

117
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,690
The idea that a node is going to take the position of a script we could have put this in the computer

118
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,280
script or in the global script.

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,390
But instead we've created an object and that object is going to be responsible for the function it's

120
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,470
named after.

121
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,530
We've also started creating combinations bready for the computers and we've looked at Flip's again.

122
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,020
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
