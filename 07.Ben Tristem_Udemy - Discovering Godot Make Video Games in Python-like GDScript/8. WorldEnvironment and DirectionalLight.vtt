00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.450
Hello again glorious God.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.890
People in this video talked talking about world environment and directional light notes because we need

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.410
to make our game beautiful.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.850
Let's go to the game.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.510
One thing you may have noticed by the way take the camera preview off your game doesn't look like mine

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.680
because you've got a file here that I've managed to access delete.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.660
I put that back show and file and then paste in default environment.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.740
If you've managed to remove a default environment like I have here a change in me seeing my cat away

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.460
from the microphone.

10
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.890
There we go.

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.790
Thank you caboodle.

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.040
Can we move on our internet famous.

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.370
In my project settings and environment and right here default environment.

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.930
Mine is blank it shouldn't be some open a file default environment and I will go from a terrible washed

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.760
out grey to a terrible washed out blue.

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.920
What's happening here.

17
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.440
Well let's double click on default environment and take a look at ambient light.

18
00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.450
The only light in our game is this ambient light and it's blue so we're seeing blue light with a little

19
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.780
bit of reflection from an artificial sun that's been procedurally generated in the sky.

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.690
K this doesn't look great so let's make it look great by using wild environments.

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.970
By the way what environment is technically in code.

22
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.790
You can make a world environment note but we're not going to do that.

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.890
And here's why world environments should be placed in Cameron notes.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.220
If you try make a world environment you've seen tree God will give you a warning saying I'm ignoring

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.210
this.

26
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.440
However make sure you only place one world environment in the game.

27
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.110
Active at a time so in a scene anything that's being read on screen there can only be one wall environment.

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.410
You can't have three one in four hours at the same time.

29
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.140
Why.

30
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.410
Because environment controls background images like the sky the ground everything else and post-processing

31
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.690
things like how much reflection are we using ambient occlusion.

32
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.180
You can't have several settings saying contradictory things because God won't know which one to use.

33
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.610
Now I have just told you that I can only have one one varmint at a time and the world environment has

34
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.270
to be part of the camera so I know some of you right now are thinking to yourselves.

35
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.580
Hang on a minute you can.

36
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.210
You've said that world environments have to be in a camera and I can only have one camera active at

37
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.240
time.

38
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.920
So isn't it impossible to have multiple environments or first off.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.690
That's a weird thing to think to yourself.

40
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.700
But Second off I may have stretched the truth a little bit you see.

41
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.570
Yes you can only have one camera active perv you put up to now that's never really been an issue because

42
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.360
we've never used multiple environments.

43
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.140
But there is something called viewport container.

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.930
That's a control node a gooey element and if you pull container can contain a viewport and you can have

45
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.640
many viewport on screen at that time and each one can have its own camera.

46
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.010
For example split screen if you wanted to have two players four players whatever on screen at same time

47
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.040
each would have its own viewport with its own active camera.

48
00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.820
There are other instances maybe a mini map or a camera zooms in on an object or an inventory whatever

49
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.590
but you could have multiple cameras active in your game each within their own viewport.

50
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.960
And if you did you can only have one wild environment active at a time.

51
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.890
Otherwise you can hear all kinds of problems.

52
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.080
So enough of that.

53
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.040
Let's actually look at this environment the first and do it go into my camera.

54
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.000
I could create a new environment.

55
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.300
I'm actually going to specify you using default environment.

56
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.110
I don't need to specify that but I'm going to double click on my default environment and take a look

57
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.670
at the options.

58
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.000
Well if I go to clear colour that's what I was using before.

59
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.620
Right so this grey washed out thing that's happening here and I could change my clear colour in project

60
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.160
settings.

61
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.850
It's actually right here change to black or pink or whatever.

62
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.210
I don't like that colour some of that undo what I've just done.

63
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.790
There it is.

64
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.310
This is not great.

65
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.170
Custom colour.

66
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.470
I could have a background colour in the background right so well have one to rent the game is going

67
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.860
to render a blank colour.

68
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.000
Everything is going to be this weird terracotta paint.

69
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.950
And this by the way is a really ugly game right.

70
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.470
I've got this storm blue thing no shadows and this bright pink nickel that migrate online.

71
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.090
Not gonna use that.

72
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.110
We could also use a sky in other two different kinds of skies we have right now we're using a procedural

73
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.490
sky procedural skies when I tell it.

74
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.360
Okay here's your top colour.

75
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.780
Here's your horizon colour and do the same for the ground.

76
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.780
Actually you can undo those two changes made.

77
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.180
We don't have to do that.

78
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.790
If I clear this and make a new panorama sky I could but but texture in here.

79
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.290
If you load in texture here leg put in an e.

80
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.210
Yea right hechsher that's a 360 degree tax.

81
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.240
Plane hills or a shopping centre.

82
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.530
You'll find some of these online.

83
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.800
When I'm going to using these in this game because were actually in a pull back rally.

84
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.330
So for now I'm just going to pick a standard colour and myself colour.

85
00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.010
For now I'm going to put as black shop black and put the energy to zero.

86
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.370
It's sending none of its energy over.

87
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.460
Now let's take a look at ambient light.

88
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.030
I've got this thing here called Sky contribution and I've set my sky contribution to zero.

89
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.380
If it's one it's saying all of the ambient energy should be coming from the background.

90
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.760
There isn't any so it's not doing that.

91
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.060
My ambient colour is what's the colour of anything that isn't lit.

92
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.400
Okay so right now there are no lights in-game and everything is this slate grey colour.

93
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.850
Well what happens if we added lighting.

94
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.750
Let's do that make a brand new simple node.

95
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.660
Some shalah get right to the top and select node and call this all lights and within that I can add

96
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.920
a new light source.

97
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.080
I type in light see what our options are.

98
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.990
We have three types of light we can use.

99
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.300
We can use an omni light that's a light source that shows light in all directions at the same time.

100
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.320
It's affected by things like range.

101
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.920
So think of a light bulb or a candle light.

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.790
Single light source or directions.

103
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.650
We have a spot light which is like that but only in one direction so you give a direction and an angle

104
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.380
and everything else is like omni light and then we have directional light that has a position and it

105
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.130
has a direction but it doesn't have an angle something like the sun or the moon.

106
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.180
Right something very far away it casts light equally at all things in this direction.

107
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.800
So let's create that.

108
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.890
And you know move this up a bit and you can see the widget has position and it has rotation and it has

109
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.060
this big arrow that shoots the direction it's going.

110
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.340
So let's move this over here to this corner and nice and high.

111
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.130
I'm not going spend too much time on that light theory here because frankly that's a whole course by

112
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.490
itself.

113
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.660
In fact we have a course on life theory for unity which you should check out if you're interested and

114
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.460
going to angle us this way.

115
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.110
Let's see you there.

116
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.700
Now you'll notice I've rotated on the green right on the horizontal plane.

117
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.590
I have two more axes and I want to angle this.

118
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.180
So Amy saw the player but if I try angling using these it's actually quite difficult to aim properly.

119
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.000
That's because I'm using global mode right.

120
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.290
I'm rotating on global axes over here.

121
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.630
This little cube icon will change me to a local mode.

122
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:23.610
And here the axis of rotation axis rotation the Axis and at one of us are relative to the object.

123
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.280
Not the world so now on top down I'm actually tilting down and you can actually see the light hitting

124
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.970
it.

125
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.460
It also knows when to move up I'm moving up locally.

126
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.320
When I moved back to global and it's worth switching between global and local so you can have really

127
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.160
fine control when you're trying to rotate in position three objects.

128
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.220
Sometimes you want to do it locally sometimes you want do globally and that's looking pretty good.

129
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.060
Okay so this isn't well it yet because it's very flat.

130
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.280
There's no shadows slurring my words for no reason.

131
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.220
Let's put the shadows on their shadows enabled it took a little second.

132
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.210
Alright some basic tips for you.

133
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.330
First in nature.

134
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.810
Shadows are not black.

135
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.540
There is no such thing as pure black or pure white in nature.

136
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.830
You could possibly get away with it in a game like this because we are going to like a static but I'm

137
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.440
going to make this a deep purple shadow.

138
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.830
It's a very subtle difference but it's worth making.

139
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.940
Next my light I got pure white light pure white will work.

140
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.490
I actually make this a little bit brighter one point five but I'm actually gonna make it slightly yellow

141
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.040
something over to a yellow one.

142
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.130
Amber There we go.

143
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.560
This looks good so it's just slightly in the amber and that gives it a more like kind of a feel.

144
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:41.580
Let's go back into a wild environment and check out ambient light.

145
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.490
I really like wants to be sort of her round here like the Light Blues.

146
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:53.000
Reason I'm doing this is I want the unlit areas of the game to have a not quite opposite but kind of

147
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.870
opposite.

148
00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:00.620
The reason why is the unlit area should not have the light that was shining in it let me try explain

149
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.450
that slightly better.

150
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.230
My directional light is slightly yellow.

151
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.340
I want less yellow in the unlit areas so that makes sense.

152
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.450
So the shadow is the bit that the light isn't hitting.

153
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.270
I guess this is starting to look reasonable.

154
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.670
I me press play.

155
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.790
Now we're not going to have the black background the game we are going to add some actual scenery.

156
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.110
So I'm going to put some clutter in makes that better.

157
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.270
But it's coming along nicely.

158
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.670
It'll look even better if I turn the emission off because we see we're doing so limited any mission

159
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.550
off the ball.

160
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:35.480
Let's go to ball up open the scene just open the texture but never mind.

161
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.870
Got a mesh instance.

162
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:44.990
Click on the mash click on the textured emission off the of the ball looks like now and we can see it's

163
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.550
got much better in natural.

164
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.380
Great.

165
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.990
Cool.

166
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.020
Before we go any further I'd like you to set this up now right now.

167
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.830
This is still looking a little washed out there from two weeks in the making.

168
00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.190
But we're off to a good start so what I'd like you to do is add beauty to your world which is the most

169
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.080
uplifting.

170
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.770
Challenge title I've ever written.

171
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.190
I'd like you to set the world environment and directional light of your game.

172
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.380
The key here is to pick a light colour.

173
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.570
I've gone for something that feels a bit like a late afternoon so slightly yellowy and an ambient colour.

174
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:21.890
That's something that's going to be not that I'd suggest something a grey or dark of white black because

175
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.030
that means no ambient light.

176
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.590
There's no such thing as black light.

177
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.990
So was the video tweak these values and when you happy with them come back and show you where I go from

178
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.450
here.

179
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.710
And welcome back.

180
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.840
Okay so the first thing I do is I might make this a little bit brighter as a to my directional light.

181
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.810
Actually not only that where it is.

182
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.240
Instead I'm gonna make sure that things are turned shaded.

183
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.200
Let's look our materials I type of material to search every material and clean the ones we haven't looked

184
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.410
at yet we'll come up let's open the ball again.

185
00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.870
To parameters and switch from barely shading to shading some to diffuse mode or switch to shading.

186
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:06.880
What's done is it's just changed what lit and not let means it's got that transition.

187
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.570
We show that again.

188
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.930
His birley Look at that smooth gradient right there's a much more natural thing in his tone.

189
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.940
That's what we call sickle cell shaded.

190
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.110
That's a really clear you are lit.

191
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.280
You are not and there's nothing in between.

192
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.280
A save that because maybe you need to see that go to cube dude.

193
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.500
I wonder the same thing for Q2.

194
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.600
So change you to to unshaded.

195
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.160
And he's a lot brighter as they save him and do the same for kudu Louis.

196
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.980
Though we don't see that yet.

197
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.940
I'm pretty sure I've already got two enchaining in for the goals I have.

198
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.860
And what about the pitch doing the pitching shaded.

199
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.580
Actually not sure that we do.

200
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.930
Let's see what it looks like.

201
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.300
See that's very very bright.

202
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.590
I think we actually want that not to shade.

203
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.040
But now we play it fast play.

204
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:55.640
OK.

205
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.190
Cube dude needs to be able to move around a bit more.

206
00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.790
But this is starting to look better.

207
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.710
Why do you want to do is change the camera position.

208
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.740
But the ball's looking nice and stylized.

209
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.950
Q Do is looking a little washed out stylize I should think I've got a little bit too much light on him.

210
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.750
It's turn the light down slightly.

211
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:20.460
Yeah but then when Kimberly starts moving this look a little more playful right now he just looks like

212
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.440
a magnetized piece I guess.

213
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.690
But it's starting to come along quite nicely.

214
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.450
That's a nice start and put the back red elements in.

215
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.060
Can be easier to tweak these values.

216
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.590
But here we are some shadows some two shading in our game ready to go.

217
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.920
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video with looked at how to change the default environment

218
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.490
and what to do if you like yarn and you've deleted it.

219
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.350
We've looked at how to use world environment and how to use directional light nodes and look to have

220
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.050
a change to the sharing method of a special material.

221
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.910
I keep snipping my words as the sixth time I've tried to say this.

222
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.520
I've given up saying it is now recorded for posterity and just slurring the words shading method of

223
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.000
spacial material.

224
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.650
I am the champion before I sign off share levels.

225
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.580
What have you got.

226
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.890
Have you got a nice procedural sky in the background.

227
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.480
Did you go for complete different look.

228
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.070
Are you using too in shading.

229
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.130
Did you change the pitch material.

230
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.910
Show your progress so far I'm dying to see what you guys have made and excellent work.

231
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.250
I'll see you in the next video.
