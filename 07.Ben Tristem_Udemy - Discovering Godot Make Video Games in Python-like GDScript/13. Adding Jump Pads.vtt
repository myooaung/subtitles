00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.250
Hello again you lovely go to people in this video we're going to add jump pads bunny can jump high.

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Let's boost bunnies jumps I make Bunny go even higher to do that we can do the following.

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.430
First we're going to create a jump Pat scene as you might expect going to use area 2D.

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.530
I'm going to only detect players by using lasers and collisions and when I send a signal when the player

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.250
enters the area 2D and do a thing with that.

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.450
OK.

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.000
So that's pretty easy.

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.030
We've just done that with the spikes.

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.360
We're also going to learn a new node animation player.

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.030
Now this isn't the same as animated sprite animation players and gotto are really powerful because you

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.710
can animate any property.

12
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.620
And we'll take a look at that a minute.

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.340
Then we're going to jump really really really high which is my favorite bit.

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.600
So let's get into it.

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.000
Hello.

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210
Got a go to create a brand new scene.

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.490
And I want the root note to be an area 2D.

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.180
So custom node area 2D.

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.610
Great.

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.230
I want an animated sprite.

21
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.470
I want my nominee is an animated sprite.

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.930
So let's go.

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.710
Animated sprites do do do they want.

24
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.420
And on the graphics on the items right here.

25
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.270
So what I need to do is click on animated sprite frames and we want to make a new Sprite frame so click

26
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.420
on that then click on sprite frames.

27
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.760
And here we go can call the animation default.

28
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.440
That's fine.

29
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.830
I want to bring in spring and spring in so what I want is this kind of wobbly effect.

30
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.060
And if I press play it's kind of too hectic.

31
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.900
I'm actually gonna lower mine to one second and might be that slow.

32
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.580
Only be one point five on point five seconds feels good.

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.570
Now you'll notice that the sprite has two frames at different heights which means it's going to go from

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.620
where the center is.

35
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620
And this spring is gonna go through the floor.

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.890
Personally I don't mind that you could go to the offset and go minus 25 or 25 up which improves matters

37
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.040
slightly but I don't want to do that because I want the spring to be where the area 2D is if I start

38
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.330
moving things off center.

39
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.010
I'm gonna make things more complicated for myself.

40
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.260
Okay.

41
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.130
So the next thing we need is a collision shape.

42
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.370
Let's put that in vision.

43
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.770
How do you spell that collision shape 2D they are and that can be a shape a new Rectangle shape zoom

44
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.980
in and just drag the extents to here.

45
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.950
Now we've got this little skewing thing going on here right.

46
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.280
This isn't a symmetrical graphic set.

47
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.730
So I need to move this slightly off center and drag that in for now.

48
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.070
Let's stop that from playing because it's a little confusing.

49
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.960
OK so so far so good.

50
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.740
Right we have a collision shape and we have an animated sprite.

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.910
So before we go any further let's rename marriage TV to jump ahead and let's say it this probably needs

52
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.470
a new folder doesn't it.

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.640
It's not a level it's not a hazard it's not a place that's make a new folder then right click or you

54
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.050
could click this create follow button and I'm gonna call it items and you can be jump hand TCM.

55
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.080
Great.

56
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.220
Now jump pad needs a script.

57
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.610
A new script goes to items jump had G.D. fantastic.

58
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.020
And here it is also the reason I'm doing that is I want to connect a signal so the jump pattern to create

59
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.040
a signal to itself Let's get a note and let's go to body entered.

60
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.690
Click on that and it's gonna connect to itself on body entered pass.

61
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.200
Great.

62
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.360
Gonna leave that there for now.

63
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.650
Gonna come back to it a bit.

64
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.460
First we need a second animation.

65
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.750
So what I need to do is create a brand new animation in the animated sprite.

66
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.840
So let's go.

67
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.530
New animation.

68
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.660
And Nicole this boost and I could use two for this.

69
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.280
Let's go.

70
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690
Spring in spring out.

71
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.710
Let's bring in spring in going to click the trash can get a late spring out.

72
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.370
And you know what.

73
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.980
Let's play that now.

74
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.320
It might not show straight away so to show it.

75
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.600
I'm gonna go off the node and back and that'll refresh the resource.

76
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.190
Got a boost and onshore plant buying.

77
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.650
Great.

78
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.090
This one won't loop and you don't miss at this to 2.5.

79
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.560
And let's do that again.

80
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.650
So default boost playing great could possibly go a little faster but it's fine for now.

81
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.580
So what I need to do now is know when to change between them to do that.

82
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.180
Let's make a brand new note as a child a jump pad.

83
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.350
I to make animation class animation player is fantastic.

84
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.740
I can animate any property right.

85
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.240
I can also call functions in my animation which is even better.

86
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.360
We're going to do that when we come to coins.

87
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.610
Let's make this really simple.

88
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.360
First thing I need to do is create an animation.

89
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.090
And what I will do here is have an animation that triggers the boost animation waits a couple of seconds

90
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.300
and then brings it back.

91
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.890
So let's go to animation and click on the button and do new what I mean to call it boost.

92
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.020
It's fine.

93
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.060
So right now we have a one second animation.

94
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.100
I want this to be a bit longer.

95
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.280
I think two seconds is good.

96
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.170
So over here by the clock I can go right to and now going to add a track.

97
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.670
If I click on a track I see all these things.

98
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.560
I want a property track click on property and it can say what node is gonna be animated.

99
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.580
The animation sprite great.

100
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.770
What property of it.

101
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.340
And look here all the properties that has access to.

102
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.080
And I want animation some.

103
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.820
So now what's going to happen is I can trigger when these animations will change.

104
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.460
So if I right click on this animation track and do insert key.

105
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.790
Now let's double click on the key and the value says default cameras change the value to boost.

106
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.820
And that's going to keep playing for one point five seconds.

107
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.120
I want to right click again and press Insert key and it's put the same value in right.

108
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.340
So if I click here still boost and this line here means all of this is one animations for press play.

109
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.930
It should work isn't working.

110
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.220
Let's put on playing that again.

111
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.770
And now when I go back to my animation player for press play okay.

112
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.780
So how I know it's working well on two seconds let's make a brand new key Insert key and a click on

113
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.440
the key and switch this to default.

114
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.620
And now in a press play

115
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.110
it goes back to the other one.

116
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.440
This is going to be really handy.

117
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.280
All I need to do is tell the animation player.

118
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.940
Play this animation boost when the body enters.

119
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.380
Okay.

120
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.110
Let's go into the script to see how that works.

121
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.070
First let's get the animation player so animation player.

122
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.970
There it is.

123
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.860
Dot.

124
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.470
Play.

125
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.580
Boost.

126
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.930
Perfect.

127
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.610
Look at that.

128
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.020
And it'll play once while at play once.

129
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.930
Cause I'm not looping it.

130
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.310
If I wanted it to loop I'd press this.

131
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.930
I don't want us to be looping animation that's gonna be weird so it'll play once and then it's gonna

132
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.180
go back to the previous state.

133
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.120
Then I want to tell the body

134
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.630
to run a function called Boost which we're gonna have to write in a moment before we go any further.

135
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.630
Let's actually put this on the right collision.

136
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.910
So let's look at our layers what we've got here we've got terrain hazards we need a new LED oasis but

137
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.860
some left for Project settings and scroll down to layer names.

138
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.150
Here we go.

139
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.950
Judy.

140
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.020
Judy physics and left for is going to be items.

141
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.340
Great.

142
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.140
OK so now when I come back to it I can go to items.

143
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.610
You're not a player you're not terrain you're not hazards you are items and you can only interact with

144
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.110
a player just to make it really safe.

145
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.500
Let's go to the player scene and make sure

146
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.050
that the player can interact with terrain hazards and items.

147
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.280
OK.

148
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.640
So there's no possibility of us missing it.

149
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.870
Let's say that scene close it.

150
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.200
All right.

151
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.290
So now the play going to enter here.

152
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.400
It's going to run a function called Boost which will have to play and it's gonna play the animation.

153
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:12.880
Right.

154
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:13.690
OK.

155
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.310
So let's put that script him.

156
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.430
I've got to play a script here.

157
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.720
But if you don't get a level one open a script there it is.

158
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.020
First thing to do is decide how much higher in boots.

159
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.600
I would say that boosting is like jumping twice as high.

160
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:33.130
I could do this as a constant like this boost multiplier or if you prefer you could do it as an export

161
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.880
variable.

162
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.660
The only real advantage to me is next what variable is it lets you tweak it pretty easily here.

163
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.720
Personally I don't think I need to do that.

164
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.940
I to put as a constant but if you wanted to you could get constant boost multi player.

165
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.620
There we go.

166
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.780
Multiplier.

167
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.040
I think it is.

168
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.010
I have to check.

169
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.590
I checked it.

170
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.330
It is it's good.

171
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.540
OK.

172
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.670
So here's my boost multiplier.

173
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.030
Now let's get a functional boost function boost.

174
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:13.750
I don't need to call any kind of argument in all I need is motion dot Y minus equals jump speed multiplied

175
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.100
by boost multiplier.

176
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.730
Okay so this should work in order to do that we need to put in an actual item so let's get to level

177
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.670
1 and let's create another one of these organizing nodes.

178
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:32.140
So a simple note I want to move that to here's the rule one place and I'm gonna call this item's jump

179
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.430
had some Nicholas jump has

180
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.020
and now let's instance one in 7 press the little instance button go to find a jump pad and make sure

181
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.490
of a move and just drag this to as a good place how about here.

182
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.390
This is a good place great.

183
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.080
And let's just make sure that is actually playing the animation we want.

184
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.850
It is great.

185
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:56.840
OK.

186
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.850
So now when I get to this jump pad it should throw means the let's find out.

187
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.500
So let's press play and go into full screen mode and what we'll find is this will work some of the time

188
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.700
right.

189
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.160
So if I jump into it that's really high.

190
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.240
I might be too high.

191
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.380
It didn't work that time.

192
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:11.620
Right.

193
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.550
So why is it working sometimes but not others.

194
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.620
Well the reason is exactly the same as the previous problem.

195
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.130
Right the heart problem essentially we're on the floor and every frame motion that Y is being set zero.

196
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.030
So we need to get off the floor.

197
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.730
Stop physics for frame and then move.

198
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:36.890
So let's just copy those over and while we're at it I think too might be a little bit high at one point

199
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.460
five.

200
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.790
There we go.

201
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:46.110
Let's try that again so let's make our way over there to do and land on it.

202
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.390
Perfect.

203
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.200
Not touching the keyboard it's just boosting every time.

204
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:56.170
And that is one point five times higher than a standard jump.

205
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.990
Awesome.

206
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.200
So now we have working jump pads which brings me to the challenge.

207
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.510
Nice and fun challenge this one put jump pads on your level and feel free to edit your level and at

208
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.370
the tarmac move the spikes around soon we'll be adding coins.

209
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.460
So make this is as fun and as bouncy and as dangerous as you like.

210
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.850
Pause the video give it a shot when you come back.

211
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.430
Put a couple more jump pads into my level

212
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.910
and welcome back OK more jump pads I like this bit.

213
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.720
So I get a 2D view and I'm going to duplicate my jump pad jump at too great and jump that to you live

214
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.350
over here.

215
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.810
That's a good place for you and jump had three you live was a good place for jump had three.

216
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.000
I feel like I feel like there's actually not a lot of room round here.

217
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.890
You know what.

218
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.660
When I met Tom up on remove this tile entirely by right clicking it.

219
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.240
OK.

220
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:53.510
So now jump had three men to move you two over here and this spike needs to move doesn't it.

221
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.240
So it's got hazards.

222
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.160
Which one is this Spike.

223
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.740
Spike one.

224
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.660
Perfect.

225
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.480
Spike one you can live right here.

226
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.400
So I've got a nice big jump here.

227
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.950
I think it might actually make that jump let's find out oh nonexistent function boost on tarmac.

228
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:15.350
Apparently I've got to mess this up so let's go to my Tom Atlas look at my collision you are on terrain

229
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.120
you can touch the players.

230
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.470
OK.

231
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.290
Lets go of my jump pants.

232
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.650
My jump pads have the wrong collision.

233
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.590
I thought I fix this cyclic.

234
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.390
No apparently didn't.

235
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.600
OK jump pads it slipped my jump pants

236
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.490
for some reason jump pads 2 or three didn't get the right collision ever so let's just slip them both

237
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.450
and give them the right collision.

238
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:47.320
So your items and you can interact with players however we can also put some error checking in here.

239
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.010
So let's go into the script and just do this.

240
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.780
If body DOT has methods boost

241
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.130
and this way we can just check whatever's coming in has that method.

242
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.520
So this is a good way of fixing that bug as well let's give that a shot.

243
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.020
OK.

244
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.850
So yeah that looks great.

245
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.200
Whoa.

246
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.590
OK.

247
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.080
So apparently I can add in the jump and the boost and the pain all in one go.

248
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.080
But if I just end to this it should work fine.

249
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.590
Look at this we now have working jump hats which brings us the end of this video in this video with

250
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.490
created jump pants.

251
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.030
We've learned how to use animation plan notes and we've jumped really high which is my favorite bit.

252
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.390
Don't forget to share how your levels are going I'm really curious to see what you guys have made.

253
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.060
Meanwhile great stuff.

254
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.440
And I'll see you in the next video.
