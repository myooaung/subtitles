00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,060
Hello again like for God to be born in this video we're gonna make a character and a play a scene.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:16,000
Now what we have to do is we have a simple character scene from which the player characters and non

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,630
player characters will inherit.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,130
Now this was going be quite simple and we're not going to worry about the non player character just

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:21,730
yet.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,800
Over the course of this section these scripts and scenes for characters play characters non play characters

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,780
are going over Volve quite dramatically but with a start off very simply.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,640
So let's start off very simply here we are back in god.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,590
There's a lovely scene with that brown floor and our Brown table and everything's Brown.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,990
I'm actually regretting making the ambient light brown So let's change that why look at it let's go

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,840
to different environment and switch this back to a nice blue or at least be a little bit of contrast

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,370
to save that.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,590
That's not what I meant to be doing that what I meant to be doing is making a new scene.

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,020
Here's a new scene.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:04,130
And I don't have a bass note of a kinematic body I would call this character before I go any further

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:09,330
let's say that in our scenes and the characters just in here that's character doctor.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,830
Yes this is one that everything would inherit from now this won't have its own mesh.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,760
But I'm reporting for now so I can get a sense of scale.

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,430
So let's do that let's put in a measured sense and make it nice and easy.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,500
Let's make a new cube.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,090
This cube is going to be roughly people shapes so say zero point five meters on the x 2 meters on a

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,520
Y and zero point five on lizzette.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,130
And I just realized I typed zero point six because I can maths.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,810
Great.

25
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,200
So here is something that is roughly the size of a person.

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,100
Now I'm doing this primarily because the models we've got for the male and female are very different

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,190
scales we're going to need to get the right scale.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,840
It's a bit of a spoiler this motion sense won't stay but it gives us a good working environment so let's

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,630
move the character up.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,780
Where should I remove the character his origin or their origin is in the right place but I really want

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,910
the origin the middle the person that can like it where the feet is.

32
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,120
So let's get a motion sense and just move that up so transform and we need to translate it up by one

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,420
metre on the Z.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,960
And now the origin would be at the feet.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,940
That seems to make more sense to me if you'd rather have the origin the middle the person you can.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,810
We're going to be putting gravity into the game so it will sort itself out.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,400
But I like it there or at more important and that is really the collision shape which one really glad

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,660
that we have a meshed work with.

39
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,330
And I can see it as like a collision issue.

40
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,600
And this collision shape is going to be a capsule is that as you might remember from keep talking about

41
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,870
is traditional when you're dealing with any kind of collision that isn't very very precise.

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,290
It doesn't matter if you know it's an arm or a leg or a head that gets hit.

43
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,160
Just the character katsulas great shape.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,700
Okay so this galician Shape is clearly wrong because that's where it's going to collide.

45
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:01,330
So let's change that one and rotate on the X by 90 degrees and I'm going to move it up on the Z by 1

46
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,910
meter.

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,910
Alright it's in roughly the right place when that's in exactly the right place but it's clearly the

48
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,740
wrong size.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,430
So in to the kassell shape and my radius is going to be zero point five.

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,350
And that is pretty close to perfect.

51
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,400
Now we can tweak it when we get some actual measures in there but let's say that that is unu characters.

52
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,940
We have a character see.

53
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:33,890
Now if you look in models under players you'll see that I've given you the original Collider files the

54
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,570
human and woman.

55
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:41,510
I'm not entirely convinced that naming one human and the other woman is the best naming convention in

56
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,730
the world.

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,360
But I suspect that when catalysis made these he made them a little bit far apart.

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,450
They don't follow the same conventions which is why we're not going to be using them.

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,280
I show you what I mean if we open human There's new inherited one he's a giant.

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,630
But more importantly his skeleton is called human immature immature as what blender calls the skeleton

61
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,880
great so we'll open it woman.

62
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,470
Yay.

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,820
Animated woman nodding you inherited.

64
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,360
And how much is a different name.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,290
That means that every single animation that these characters come with will need to manually renamed

66
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:22,550
right because this note here the head animation points to human armature head at and the woman it points

67
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,760
to armature ahead.

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,760
That means that you would have to go through every single track of every single animation and change

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,660
them.

70
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,820
You don't want to do that.

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,090
I've done it for you.

72
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,480
It took a while but we won't be using these files.

73
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,810
These are here just in case anything goes wrong.

74
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,490
Instead head over to scenes.

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,850
And over in characters you'll see other players there's a good armatures.

76
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,160
And here I've saved the armature from M and F.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,270
Male and Female again.

78
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,800
And these have been renamed.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,930
So this one is mash.

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,550
This one is mash.

81
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,410
These are identical so we can drop them in to the same scene and they'll share the same frames and the

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,700
animations have all been renamed to the spine to bone 3 I don't know why the Swan has bones said but

83
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,600
that's fine.

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,800
One more thing I want to point how are they talking about skeletons amateur as a skeleton note.

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,590
It's just been named by Blender's that's fine.

86
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,610
How do we know how to move the MASH.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,900
And the reason we know is one this is how these skulls and was up in blender but two under mash you'll

88
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,220
see right here a skeleton and it's pointing at its parent.

89
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,280
So those bodies you can assign it to its own immature.

90
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,980
If for some reason you need to move meche and skeleton around that's how you'd set that you'd put that

91
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,630
in here.

92
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,960
However we don't need to mess with this.

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,090
You'll also notice that these come with a bunch of different animations.

94
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,670
I've removed all the animations we're not using So I've put a death animation.

95
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,670
In fact this war came with a death animation.

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,850
Oh it's so dramatic.

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,520
An idle animation.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,030
Yeah he looks pretty idle punching animation.

99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,730
Yeah.

100
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,630
Pretty mad are running animation and that's what's called working that's me for picking up.

101
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:17,390
I've given the same names to animation for the female mash for press that but you'll notice the animations

102
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,980
are completely different.

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,950
I'm okay with that because when you have different characters and different shapes you want them to

104
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,720
moving a little differently.

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,120
So for instance this pick up animation is the same as working.

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,660
It looks very different right.

107
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,140
The running animation is pretty similar.

108
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,500
Now she didn't come with the death animation so I've put death in here and I will admit I might have

109
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,970
messed up slightly because she's floating sideways.

110
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,520
On the other hand that's a pretty dramatic death.

111
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,170
I mean you have to give me that.

112
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,950
All right let's close these.

113
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,370
And I'm not going to say that.

114
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,710
And instead what I do is I'm an inherit from character and make a new scene.

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,830
I can make a single play a character for now.

116
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,700
We're not going to make a male and a female till later.

117
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,030
And what I'm going to do is we're going to make a single play for now and then later on the section

118
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:08,180
will make that a template remove the mesh and the armature from entirely and loaded in through script

119
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,430
so we can use the same character or just load in the mash the skeleton and the animation that we need

120
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,570
are not talking let's actually do some work.

121
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,000
Get a new inherited scene.

122
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,470
Remember we are inheriting from the character.

123
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
So here's our new scene.

124
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,130
I notice New think is unsafe.

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:32,080
I'm gonna call this player to a plethora and loading in a mesh instance and excellent shape.

126
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm going to close the animation.

127
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,730
Good.

128
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,320
And let's save this.

129
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,470
And I say this in the player folder and I say this as player.

130
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,640
A coin.

131
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,180
Let's start with the male character because that's the one that I happened to look at.

132
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,870
Alright first thing to do is I'm a load in this cilice.

133
00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:01,720
Add a child note under scenes under characters and the players armatures almagor.

134
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,750
First thing you notice are boys kind of big isny and he looks as she looks like that statue in Brazil

135
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,440
on the mountain.

136
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,500
What's it called.

137
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,700
You know the one.

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,570
But I know one.

139
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,780
So let's shrink and Ellen's got to omniture and on a scale and down to what looks good.

140
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,450
Zip.

141
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,950
Let's try the z axis instead so if I get the height right the rest the skull should follow.

142
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,740
Zero point five.

143
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,890
Oh you'll see your actual scale is on the Z.

144
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,560
Oh that's right he's rotated so let's try that again.

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,310
Zero point five.

146
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,820
Nope.

147
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,010
Zero point two five.

148
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,800
Closer was zero point two two small zero point two five is the best yet they are putting five is good.

149
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:48,490
So if I now scaled down my quarter in all axes he's the right height.

150
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,710
Now when I hide the mesh instance he should fit pretty perfectly.

151
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,960
Look at that in that capsule.

152
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,260
Now if you were using assets that you'd made yourself or your working with a team in the middle of your

153
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,110
game the scales all match up.

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,100
But because we are using creative commons zero assets which we're made to work with any engine we might

155
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,720
have to tweak them.

156
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,020
So here we've scaled down the armature.

157
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,640
I don't mind scaling this down because if we look at our image has seen schene not seen you notice there

158
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,870
is no collision and here we are not scaling any collisions so the scaling all works just fine.

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,980
It should also work with the animation.

160
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,320
Let's check.

161
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm going to right click on this and who editable children and any information player.

162
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,990
Let's just play deaf.

163
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,050
Yeah dramatic death.

164
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,310
Perfect.

165
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:34,740
OK.

166
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,400
There's an automatic death for me.

167
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,620
So then save this as player.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,380
And what you don't know is that there was an edited cut there because I've got a delicious cup of coffee

169
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,020
next to me.

170
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,850
And I saw it and I had some coffee but that's enough about my life.

171
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,380
What we do is really give the character the player a script.

172
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,000
Now again later I'm going to rename this he's not a big player it's just me player I'm going to remove

173
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,180
the armature from entirely but for now this will get us working.

174
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,500
So let's make a script for player.

175
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,370
Later we'll make more a character as well.

176
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,640
Let's just make something very simple let's make a script for play.

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,440
We'll put that in our scripts folder.

178
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
Do do do.

179
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,850
Because we committed to this structure.

180
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,200
Been course let's do it.

181
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,470
There is no script sold.

182
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,160
Why.

183
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,240
Because Windows doesn't like zipping an empty folder into as it file so let's make one make a scripts

184
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,350
script celebrities.

185
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,850
And within that player I'm going to call this player DGT or play as we saying script and create great.

186
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,930
I'm going to be using Moven slide again because I want to be able to slide off things and I bump into

187
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,090
them I don't just stop.

188
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to keep that machine going if possible.

189
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,580
So I know a couple of variables I need I need a motion variableness going to elect a three.

190
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,500
I need some sort of speed for now so let's make a variable.

191
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,630
In fact this is probably a constant isn't it.

192
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm loving my Constance above my very wants because reasons let's call this I don't know 50 random number

193
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,250
50 pixels per frame.

194
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,830
So we don't need to be calling this brain function at all.

195
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,630
We'll do everything within function process.

196
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,430
I'm just not uncommon at that and I don't really want to put everything in here.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,790
So I'm going to call a new function called move and move.

198
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,750
I don't think we need to pass Delta.

199
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,830
I'm going to leave it as it is and I certainly don't need puskas that doesn't do anything.

200
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,520
And we also need to make sure we have a function called Move to call them right pass in there for now

201
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,200
because we now need to put our keys in so that's going to project settings.

202
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:37,460
When he's a mappin our input into input map and I want for now three actions let's move forward.

203
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,710
Back left and right.

204
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,420
Okay.

205
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,890
And I'm going to map these in.

206
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm going do them as keys for now.

207
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm going to put in my controller yet do that later.

208
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:06,100
So the key for Ford is w a key for back is s key for left us amoc is a key for right is d w us a day.

209
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,280
Ha ha.

210
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,320
All right.

211
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,770
So we have a movie function what do we need to do.

212
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:18,110
Well we need to go if then put dot is action pressed.

213
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,880
We want forward and not.

214
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,150
Input is action press.

215
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,130
I did mean to put capital there but God will fix it for me.

216
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,420
Let's see.

217
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,000
So for going forward and not back.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,450
This should all be very familiar right.

219
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,020
But come on there what he wants to do.

220
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,770
Well now motion dot.

221
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm pretty sure this one is going to be the z axis.

222
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,110
I think I'm going to fix it.

223
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,760
Then motion Z equals one.

224
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,940
So I'm going to duplicate these two lines and reverse back and forth.

225
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,990
So if you go back and you not go forward.

226
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,530
This is negative one.

227
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,750
This is all very simple lace.

228
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,700
As we go through the section we're going to make this do things like mouse slow can move relative to

229
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,040
where the camera is pointing not where the person is.

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,120
But for now elisha's is something basic.

231
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,490
OK.

232
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,930
So we have both of those as you duplicate these two lines.

233
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,880
And here we go left and not right.

234
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,130
And that will be X will be negative one and right and not left

235
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,220
and here X will be positive right.

236
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,270
Let's save that.

237
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,770
And one I do my level template I want to put the player in.

238
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,950
It is the same in front of the camera Soulas instance in the player in a child of love the template.

239
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,270
And back up to scenes players.

240
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,100
Play em.

241
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,050
Great.

242
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,630
And look how much more he is in this desk.

243
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,560
I think we may have messed up the size a bit.

244
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,310
Hamwi How big is this desk.

245
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,700
Alf I don't limit the double check.

246
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,330
Scale is one that should be good.

247
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,370
All right fine.

248
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,010
Be like that.

249
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,700
Let's see what happens for Pressplay.

250
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,020
There's a desk waiting in the character and I can't move.

251
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,440
Why.

252
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,130
Because I've defined these inputs but I haven't told God what to do with them so very simple challenge

253
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,200
just to see how familiar and comfortable you are at this stage.

254
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,870
I'd like you to use Moven slide to move the player character and a quick tip.

255
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,220
You don't need shelter food and slide.

256
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,860
You do move and collide move and slide has Delta built in.

257
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,630
So if you were to multiply your move slide by Delta you would actually be doing it by Delta squared.

258
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,810
You I get acceleration not motion.

259
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,660
So pause the video use moving side to move the character.

260
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,580
And if you get stuck refer to the documentation and Either way when you're ready come back and I'll

261
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,550
show you my solution.

262
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,910
Welcome back.

263
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:10,270
Okay so there's nothing particularly complicated here except I need move and slide in a motion.

264
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,080
Time's speed.

265
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,430
Why speed.

266
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,720
Because otherwise we're just moving one pixel every fragment that's very slow.

267
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,470
And the other thing I mentioned it is an up fact right.

268
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,000
So if I put a little more room here succeed in doing.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,260
Did you do.

270
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,460
There's my up factor.

271
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,280
Now I can define up as a constant here.

272
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:40,430
So let's do that constant up is at Vector 3 and it's zero on the X Y and the wiser on us.

273
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,350
So let's put that in there.

274
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,060
And now when I press play I should be able to do that.

275
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,440
Way too fast.

276
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,890
Okay.

277
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,550
That's ridiculous.

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,320
And my speed is much too high.

279
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,240
Let's put the speed to 10.

280
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,090
Like a C and knocking over a giant desk.

281
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,430
There's a couple of other things I'm not doing.

282
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,820
I'm not stopping to put the stop here.

283
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,350
Or we could just do motion.

284
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,150
He calls vector 3 0 0 0 0.

285
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,680
So every frame is going to set this to zero unless we tell it otherwise.

286
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,220
This is not the solution we have at the end because we do want to couple it jump separately but that's

287
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,190
going to take a little work.

288
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,020
Let's take a look at that.

289
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,030
Okay I can move now.

290
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,570
I'm moving in reverse because what I'm pressing backwards I'm heading towards the camera left and right

291
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,110
moving fine.

292
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,570
So let's just reverse these.

293
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,830
So Ford is going to be negative Z and back is going he said.

294
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,250
You'll also notice I am not facing the direction of turning.

295
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,690
I'm also not animated but worry about that later.

296
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:57,470
So let's do that let's have a face interactions like a variable facing direction and will set that to

297
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,950
zero.

298
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,070
Every frame we're going to rotate to the right direction to make a new function called Face.

299
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:15,190
Or face forward I guess that a name faces a little on script of a face forward or at a function.

300
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,130
Face forward.

301
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:24,080
OK so what do what we'll do is rotate the actual armature of the model of the player.

302
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,380
Right.

303
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,900
We want to take the whole thing we just want to rotate the armature.

304
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,820
So let's do that let's grab the armature.

305
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,800
Which is a child of play which is where the script is running so that's fine.

306
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,370
And here I want to rotate but I only want to rotate on the y axis.

307
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,480
And how much shorter a tape by facing direction.

308
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,050
So now I need to set the space and direction now rotate Y if I look at this you'll see it's in radiance.

309
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,200
So you like me and you went to school.

310
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,560
Stop doing maths and when you're 16 you're now in your early forties and you never learned about radiance

311
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,990
at the time.

312
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,940
Here's what you need to radians is an entire rotation right to pi radians rather.

313
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,390
So here's what we do rather than convert the degrees we're just going to use that so facing direction.

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,390
Equals 0 0 radians don't rotate.

315
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,360
However if I want to turn backwards that's half a circle.

316
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:30,040
Well if two pi is a full circle then all it need is facing direction equals PI right.

317
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,590
Okay so what about right.

318
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:39,800
Well that's half Pi so facing direction equals pi times zero point five or divided by two.

319
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,850
OK.

320
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,420
And with a duplicate VAT's move it down and facing direction is one point five pi.

321
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,900
Let's find out now on PI where I try and I have horribly miscalculated.

322
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,460
Why.

323
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,810
Because this is the wrong function.

324
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,200
I don't mean rotate underscore why I mean rotation because I'm not setting a function.

325
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,620
I'm setting a value right.

326
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,940
Rotation dot y equals fixing direction.

327
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,580
That should be art better.

328
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,980
OK.

329
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:16,950
Now there's a reason why this is looking a little weird right is because right now the animation isn't

330
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,840
working when put the animations on the carit or facing the right direction but we are facing a direction

331
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,550
that will take 90 degrees.

332
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,830
I promise you it will work.

333
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,090
A desk is too big or our place is too small but we have basic motion.

334
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,270
One more thing we could do we could put the camera as a child or a player but we're off to a decent

335
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,840
start.

336
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,130
So quite a lot in this video.

337
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,090
We've looked at skeleton's meshes and animation players.

338
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,910
We've looked at how you can make sure that your skeleton and your measure are talking to each other

339
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,690
and we've looked at how you use radians in rotation.

340
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,100
We've got basic movement.

341
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,810
Next up we're going to put in animation.

342
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,760
It's a great work and I'll see you next week.
