00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,710
Hello you one forgotten to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,200
We're going to start showing text to the player now.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,570
So far we've been looking a lot at how to use variables how to use arrays how to combine them all and

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,890
use a printout.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,740
Right so we're going to print things in the output.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,850
But that doesn't help us in game.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,370
So in this video we start looking at ways we can display things to the player specifically we need to

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,950
look at how to import assets into gotto we don't want that weird blank gray screen that's just the default

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,520
background.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,470
We want to show pretty things how do we get pretty things in game.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
We've got to create a background texture.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,550
When I say create a background texture I've provided you with a texture we're going to create it in

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,320
the game we're going to resize the games display or look at the options of how to do that.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,790
And then we're gonna create a label node and update the label with our script.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,950
So along with this video I provided the download which I have called and we take a look on I've called

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,160
it or download it right here looney lips GFA X and J if X is you show for graphics and if I open up

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,790
the zip file it's a folder called J effects that's graphics again.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,220
So if hoping that you'll find a blackboard which is what an England we call a chalkboard two different

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,740
buttons it's actually one button one is pressed one is not pressed and a font called felt pen I'll provide

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,630
the links for all of those he can go look at them the buttons are from Kenny when he's allotted his

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,760
work he does great Creative Commons Work Creative Commons Zero's not actually open source but you can

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,500
use it even commercially without crediting him or paying him I'm going to credit him because he does

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,980
great work.

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,910
Okay so I have here this folder How do I import it into gotta.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,310
First thing I do is I'm gonna open up the resource folder right the folder where the the actual project

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,780
is the easiest way to do this is to right click on it and do open in file manager.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:58,200
So I'm there now let's go back to this zip file so I'm going to minimize you and find the zip file which

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,710
for some reason I managed to close down how do I import this folder.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,950
Well the first we do is I'm going to just copy it over.

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm going to drag it equals a right click on it do you copy.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,310
You could do control C control V.

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,450
I'm going to copy the graphics folder into here and I can close that.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,960
All right so now we have a graphics folder.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,710
How we got it to read it off.

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,690
I go again I don't have to.

37
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,030
It does it for me.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,900
Anything that is in the resource folder that can be edited by Godwin or edited in Godot will automatically

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,990
import if I click the little dropdown for the graphics thing you'll see this stuff is in here.

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,130
Now later on when we start dealing with sounds in the future games specifically hoppy days we're going

41
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,240
to have to look at how to switch looping on and off we want some sound to loop in some not too.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,810
Doesn't really matter with pictures but the principles go to the same and click on the asset we're going

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,900
to change.

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,480
We're going to import change what needs to happen with it and click report awesome.

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,620
So here we have our graphics.

46
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,150
Let's start by making a background to do that on a click on looney lips which remember is a control

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,960
node and an add a child to add a child.

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,150
I cannot press this button here at child node so this plus button or I can to control a little shortcut

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,150
shows up.

50
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,600
I almost never press controls on it do it just for fun.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,040
I was pressed the button quite like shortcuts and what kind of node we want.

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,100
I mean we could go through all the controls and look for we don't have to know.

53
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,940
This one is going to be a texture specifically a texture rect control for drawing textures let's create

54
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,490
it and rename it.

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,770
So a double click on it and type in background is a nice human readable thing.

56
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,040
Now at the moment we've got this node with no information in it and you can see here this empty texture

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,390
I can left click on it load it and go find the texture or I could just drag a blackboard into the texture

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,800
and there it is.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,770
And here we have a lovely background.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,740
Now this blue box that's what's going to be rendered to the player.

61
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,420
You'll see the texture is much bigger.

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,960
So if I press play here is my textures really zoomed in and when I resize the window I'm not actually

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,360
resizing the display.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
I would rather not resize in the blackboard.

65
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,790
It almost looks like I've cut a hole into my desktop and I'm widening and shortening the whole.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,940
But what's the other size is the same size.

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,770
So let's look at how we can scale that with a display.

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,150
The first images on a hit expand this texture scales to fit it's bounding rectangle.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,210
Let's switch that on.

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,980
OK.

71
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,130
And I want to press play it's teensy now.

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,430
Why didn't it happen here.

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,920
Well sometimes gotto doesn't refresh control elements that's anything with a user interface and a UI

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,960
element immediately an easy way to fix it.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,450
It's open You seen and come back to it and you'll see it just refresh the display by going away coming

76
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,630
back I won't close that scene.

77
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,270
You don't actually need it and I need this to be the right size.

78
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,470
I want to click this layout button and offer all these different options here.

79
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,590
And if I click anchors and go to full rectangle what's it doing is saying okay I want you to measure

80
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,570
these four corners.

81
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,790
Well how do I know.

82
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,130
Click on View and go to show helpers.

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,490
And each of these green things shows you the anchor it's gonna be.

84
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,650
Now it's important to note the right other texture is not actually for the full screen.

85
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,770
So there it is.

86
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,750
And it's just measuring where these corners are.

87
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,710
That's not that useful.

88
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,960
So let's go back to layout and press full wrecked right.

89
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,730
Full rectangle the full display.

90
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:38,010
And now when I press play this display actually re sizes which is much cooler.

91
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,580
One more thing we can do is we could change the default size that this display.

92
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:48,540
If we go to project and go to project settings and scroll down to we find Windows on the display you

93
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,720
can see here the width and height.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,060
So if you wanted you could go 10 80 by 800 for example press close and the default some very different

95
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,300
size one of us play.

96
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,410
It actually doesn't fit nicely onto my screen anymore so I'm going to put my back.

97
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,280
But if you want to change the default size you can you can also switch off re sizable.

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,050
What does that look like.

99
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,380
Well it means that the player can no longer drag the corners which might be what you want not what I

100
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,020
want but that's how you could do it.

101
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,120
You could go borderless and you can go full screen.

102
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,490
I'm not going to switch full screen on because it changes how my capture program in this case OBSS renders

103
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,640
recordings.

104
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,840
In other words I won't actually be able to record.

105
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,790
So only leave it alone as the defaults but that he can change those.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,030
Okay.

107
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,010
So we have this beautiful background and I want to press play.

108
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,640
There's a lovely background that just gets in the way and all the Texas still here.

109
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,170
So let's put a new note.

110
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm going to click on looney lips and I mean to add a new child and I'm gonna type in label which is

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
spelt with like that.

112
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,910
Why do I click on looney lips first because otherwise the label be a child of the background.

113
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,290
The label isn't a child of the background as a child of Looney lips a way you put your children actually

114
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,960
starts becoming quite important as your game gets bigger and as you can see right now it's just in this

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,490
little corner and I'm gonna write the words place hold a text we can see what's happening place holder

116
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,250
and I don't need that return and you'll notice a few things.

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,020
One this node takes up very little space to the font is wrong let's change the font first I'm going

118
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,290
to go down to custom font click it I don't need to enable at the moment I pick a font it'll do it anyway

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,240
but just for the look of the thing let's click it something click new dynamic font and then when I click

120
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,120
on the font all these extra options come up Firstly you'll notice by the way if I zoom in a text looks

121
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,610
like it's vanished it hasn't vanished the text is still there but we've just overwritten all the font

122
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:58,440
information there is no font so let's drag felt pen into font data and if I want to know the settings

123
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,130
and change the font size a strike 40 doesn't this nice some big zoom out a bit as looking pretty good

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,240
let's press play not bad now at the moment we're just in the top left so let's make this a little bit

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,670
better I'm going to again go to layout and I've set my anchors of the full rectangles I'm saying when

126
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,890
you resize check all four corners right don't just check the top left corner if I resize the bottom

127
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:31,000
right I want everything to resize got a layout and in all honesty full rect again however when a press

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,640
play I'm still not happy about how close placeholder text is to the edges let's give them margin so

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,210
let's get a margin just click here under control and I want to give it what's good I think 24 pixels

130
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:52,670
yes 24 pixels the left 24 from the top 24 from the right I don't mean that do I mean negative 24 and

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,930
probably negative 24 for the bottom and what this is going to do is it's going to make the text always

132
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,130
be 24 pixels no matter how big it is unless it can't fit.

133
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,390
Few more options we can look at while we're here to see you know what they are.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,510
A line left and V Line top.

135
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,150
This is your horizontal alignment I can put it in the center or on the right or fill.

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,140
There's not enough text to fill it doesn't matter.

137
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,370
And V Line works the same way center bottom fill top.

138
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,950
I'm also gonna put auto wrap on I want the text to automatically wrap around and just to see what that

139
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,370
looks like if I make this really narrow boom look at that it automatically moves it we can also change

140
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,150
everything to uppercase such as put something in caps not gonna do that.

141
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,230
It's weird.

142
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,340
All right so this looks good.

143
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,800
How can I actually change what's written here.

144
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,670
How do I know how to change a script.

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's go into our script and you know what.

146
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,690
I don't need it.

147
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,870
Instead I'm going to get a..

148
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,260
Get node is a function within G.D. script.

149
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,160
So if I hold control and click on it it'll open the documentation.

150
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,190
And this is part of a normal node so every single node everything can use this which is useful because

151
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,150
everything inherits from a node and what to do is get node and then as a string the path to the node

152
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,080
was that mean means I can click in here and just type the path or I can use the dropdown label.

153
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,340
There's a couple of things we can do to make this easier and I'll show you those in a second.

154
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,220
First let me not get myself too distracted and I want to know how do I change this text while I need

155
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,260
to know the property to do that.

156
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,170
I'm going to mouse over the word text and not touch anything.

157
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,870
And it has property text.

158
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,170
What that means is we get back into my script.

159
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,780
If I do dot and then the name of the property which here is text equals.

160
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,940
This is some text.

161
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,630
All right let's go back to 2D mode and just remind ourselves right now this has placeholder text when

162
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,160
I press play it's been updated by the script.

163
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,630
I know why hesitate on the word script.

164
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,700
I just did so we now know how to change this in code.

165
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,500
Couple of things you can do instead of doing get node label.

166
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:16,490
The first is if I don't want to type it off I'm not sure the spelling I don't know the path I can drag

167
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,240
it into the script which is awesome.

168
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,420
The other thing I can do is I can use a shortcut an alias I can use a dollar and then the name of the

169
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,970
node.

170
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,410
If I'm doing it this way I don't need to use strings.

171
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,400
I can use strings.

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,800
Doesn't really make a difference but I don't need to.

173
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:44,160
The only reason I would want to use strings is if for some reason there was a space in the node name

174
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,000
there shouldn't ever be a space in the node name because it's against the convention and I don't I'm

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,740
not gonna put these strings here because I don't need to.

176
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:58,990
I will point out that because we are using the default name label it's staying it's in this more colors

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,500
that there's a sort of lightly I think label is actually not a very useful name so I'm gonna change

178
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,790
this to display text.

179
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,150
What are we displaying to the player.

180
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,240
Well now label is wrong so let's use our nice dollar shortcut.

181
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,570
Display text is right there so it doesn't matter what type of note it is.

182
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,430
It knows that this is a label node and it knows that label nodes have a tax property.

183
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,300
So when I press play this is some text.

184
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,490
Also another thing you could do if you want extra credit is you could use a instead of a display text

185
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,040
we could change this to a different note.

186
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,080
I could have changed type and there there's another label called a rich text label.

187
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,520
We're not gonna be using this because it's just extra complexity that we don't really need.

188
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,900
But just to show you the difference if I open this it behaves very much like a label but it also has

189
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,260
Bebe code I can enable b b code and type B B code in here and the property instead of changing text

190
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,760
which is here would be B.B. code Tex.

191
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,750
You'll also notice all my fonts have reset.

192
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,260
That's because we now have access to bold italics and so on.

193
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,140
If I wanted to change the color or change certain wasn't too bold or underline them.

194
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,850
So the word the play gives me would be for instance bold and red.

195
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,560
I would set up a B.B. code thing.

196
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm not going to do that so I'm going to right click on it and change the note back to label and just

197
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,840
check my font is still good.

198
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,510
It's not.

199
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,570
So it's got new dynamic font loaded in and drag it.

200
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,460
Kaboom.

201
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,930
Awesome and placeholder text has gone.

202
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,320
I was right.

203
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,060
Place holder text and list changed my settings to be 40 again.

204
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,010
Great.

205
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,260
He also notices a bunch of other options we can play with.

206
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,540
We could give it an outline color.

207
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,110
I'm not going to because it's a black background with white text giving an outline is just gonna get

208
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,040
fuzzy.

209
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,940
Extra spacing does really care about that but in all these different options and I encourage you to

210
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,740
explore play with it really get to know it all these things.

211
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:15,120
Okay so far so solid but what's happening is I'm pressing play very nicely changing the text up here

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,690
but everything that I need is down here so this is my challenge to you.

213
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,700
I'd like you to make better use of the label node tri to or try displaying the story and the prompts

214
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,790
together in this new display text this new label that we've just created so pulls the video.

215
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,450
Give that a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

216
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,440
Welcome back.

217
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,540
This is actually a lot simpler than it might sound so if I go into the script we've already solved this

218
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,640
problem in fact I can get rid of print entirely because I'm setting the text property to be a string.

219
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:01,220
And here we have a string that is plugging in strings from an array so all I need to do is go story

220
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,190
which split that percentage prompts and in fact I can just get rid of it entirely.

221
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,120
I will press control.

222
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,950
K It's going to come and tell the line and press play.

223
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,690
Once upon a time someone could someone called Yan hmm.

224
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,350
I didn't.

225
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,690
Who wanted you wrong I know what I did wrong when I changed the type it reset all of these.

226
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,400
So let's just do auto wrap and try that one more time we'll pretend that was good.

227
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,110
Once upon a time.

228
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,260
Look at this someone called Yan a banana flavored sandwich which made him feel all tingly inside.

229
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,410
It was a glorious day.

230
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,310
Look at that.

231
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,720
One more thing I'll points out in this script is when I'm changing the property here I'm changing the

232
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,670
property of a child node right looney lips lives up here and the display text is down here.

233
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,890
So we've actually just learned how to change the properties of a different node which is really good.

234
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,340
His fundamental skill that we'll be using a lot.

235
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,500
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

236
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,300
We've learned some really cool fundamental things how to create a background texture how to import that

237
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,740
texture into gotto how to change a know type and then how to change it back because I didn't want to

238
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,690
change anyway.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,860
We've looked at how to resize the games display how to display text using a label node and how to change

240
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,210
the properties of a child node.

241
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,540
Really strong foundational stuff to use again and again and again.

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,370
So a really great start and now I will have to say is great stuff and I will see you in the next video.
