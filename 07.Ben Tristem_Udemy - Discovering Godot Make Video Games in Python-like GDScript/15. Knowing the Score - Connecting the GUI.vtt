00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.070
Hello again the life for God.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.610
People in this video we're going to finish the game.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.200
We're not finishing a project which is making the game itself complete.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.610
We can add a lot of Polish afterwards.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.920
But by the end of this video we're going to have a fully functional viable product prototype.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.480
It was hard to say but you know why are we doing this.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.820
We're wiring the gooey when to connect the grease so the player can see the score which means that we're

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.900
going to have all of our major game play omundson.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.260
So let's get into it.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350
And the first thing I do is open the gooey scene.

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.710
This is the gooey scene we did last time here's my lovely little banner and I might add a script to

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.770
the gooey to the canvas.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.560
Note the root note of this scene.

14
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.320
Why am I putting it here because going to be much easier to deal with in the actual game scene.

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.480
If I don't have to go editable children and find the individual components.

16
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.390
So the gooey is going to be responsible for everything beneath it.

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.360
So when I open up our scripts folder and call it goofy and it's good to go.

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.160
I get caught.

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.160
So let's talk about what's going to happen when a goal is scored that can be right here on goal detection

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.800
body entered.

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
We already have a couple of pieces of information.

22
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.110
The first is what's entering the body.

23
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.260
Now that's a default argument that's passed on from the signal.

24
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.840
And honestly I don't really care about it.

25
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020
I can't remove it easily because it's got it.

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170
The singles passing automatically but I don't need it.

27
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.880
I know the ball is entering is the only thing that cannot.

28
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.560
Want to do care about is the goldney.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.600
So.

30
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.360
I'm going to pass that information through into the going.

31
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.180
No this goal idae is reverse warming by reverse.

32
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.760
Take a look at the games thing.

33
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.330
Goldie one is the greengard.

34
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.360
So let's play a tu's goal.

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.130
Why.

36
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.990
Because when a ball goes in their play or one gets the point not player too.

37
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.770
So I've reversed them alright.

38
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.730
The other thing I should talk about is what's what node is responsible for what I want to keep as close

39
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.350
to the single responsibility principle as I can.

40
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.380
Right I don't want to split the responsibility between notes too much as far as I'm concerned in mind

41
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.930
game.

42
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.260
The gooey is responsible for displaying score in end game information just displaying.

43
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.860
That's all it does.

44
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.650
Now you could make an argument that the gooley is going to be the thing that keeps the score and it

45
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.030
tracks score and it just passes information of okay the game is over.

46
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
You could make that argument but I'm going to keep the score in the game so I'm going to make a couple

47
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
of variables in here.

48
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.000
Put a capital on Player 1 because snowed in that's the conventions I play on one score and that's a

49
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.010
starter zero.

50
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.100
I would duplicate that and this one is player to score because that's numbers.

51
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.700
And if he grew up in England in the 90s and you heard that or even Britain he might have said that's

52
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.300
no Wang.

53
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.220
If so those points for you.

54
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.540
I've got the score and on goal detection I want to update the score.

55
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.740
Right so let's make an update score function here instead of printing.

56
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.790
Play a one has scored.

57
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.910
I don't care about that.

58
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.510
Let's make update goal and I'm going to pass through this Goldie.

59
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.610
At least I would do if I could type.

60
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.020
So we now have.

61
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.430
Update.

62
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.120
Go let's make a new function.

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.090
It's coming to a distraction free mode and give ourselves lots of space.

64
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.100
So we're doing two lines below the previous function function update score.

65
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.390
Is that what I call it a call to update goal as the running.

66
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.130
Were not updating the goal or updating the score.

67
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.660
So update Scott and we're bringing in an argument.

68
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.000
Now remember this function doesn't really care what this argument means just what it is.

69
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.220
And in fact I can rename it which I'm going to do.

70
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.270
I'm going to call this player.

71
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.820
It's the same argument right.

72
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.670
What's happening is God is looking at what the position of the argument is.

73
00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:03.960
If I have multiple positions if I have player name age date of birth favourites my little pony.

74
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.090
I don't know much about them my little ponies but I taught a girl who was obsessed with something called

75
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.160
a shutterfly.

76
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.680
It doesn't matter what names I give these values.

77
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.500
I need to use those names within the function but they could be called other things in the function

78
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.070
that passed them in.

79
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.350
Just like here.

80
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.170
What does matter is the order they come in.

81
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:26.740
Right so if we think of this as an array array 0 the first position rammer 0 offset is going to be this

82
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.270
right so it doesn't matter what I call it macourt Play WIP is going make more sense in here.

83
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.960
Okay so if player is 1.

84
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.120
So if the player is one if Player 1 has scored a goal or play to a score an own goal that's also a viable

85
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.050
thing.

86
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.890
Player 1 score their list goes up by 1.

87
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.760
All right so that makes sense.

88
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.950
And if it's player to then play a two score goes up by 1.

89
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.740
At this stage we should probably have a maximum right now.

90
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.220
We haven't put one of those in yet so let's put in a maximum of score because otherwise the game gone

91
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.510
forever which it can do.

92
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.870
But I feel like a victory condition is going to be useful.

93
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.550
Let's put this in the inspect list given export variable of Max in on the score.

94
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.580
And let's set this four five right now.

95
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.120
Export very well so I could change an inspector.

96
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.000
Honestly in a project this size I could just change the script each time.

97
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.790
But you know I've had it.

98
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.250
I want to now send that information to the goalie.

99
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.750
I'm happy with the idea the goalie is always going be a direct child of game.

100
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.230
It's lots of other children but it's not a sub child a grandchild of some kind right.

101
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.340
Goofy isn't in staff positions it's not in players.

102
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.580
If you're not happy about this you can use a trick you've been using a fine.

103
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.490
Right so you could get Tre get root find noad gooey.

104
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.380
That's fine.

105
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.640
I'm not going to do that because I am pretty happy with it so I'm going to find the goalie.

106
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.040
Let's go in here and make an update score.

107
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.740
I need a ready function.

108
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.700
OK we need two pieces of information right we need the player I need the score.

109
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.410
Great so let's get start back into the game state.

110
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.250
I need to call the update funk optical function.

111
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.510
It is great and I'm a past player and a variable I need to pass through the put the player score.

112
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.930
Now I could make update score exist in both of these conditions right so if it's player one incorrect

113
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.870
player score by one update score play a one player one score.

114
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.470
But I don't really wanna keep repeating this in both and right now we only have two players but what

115
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.690
if we have I don't know.

116
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.020
The same would make a game like this where we have four teams playing at once the same pitch which will

117
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.330
be kind of Wheating crazy and I actually kind of like that.

118
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.140
So what they do is at the top of function and make a new very new score.

119
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.600
Can't think of a better thing for now but that's.

120
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.990
New score equals play on score.

121
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.650
And then I'm going to duplicate that and move it down and over here you score.

122
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.980
Player to score.

123
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.440
So whoever scores were going to make that new score variable their current score.

124
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.490
Now I can do stuff for this.

125
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.200
I first came past the goalie right so I can go new score.

126
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.490
Great so we can now use that information.

127
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.280
You I can do is check if we've reached the maximum score.

128
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.180
It's really much easier with one variable right so we can check

129
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.220
check if the game is over and I'm going to pass in the new score.

130
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.480
And you know what let's make a little gap here so we can make it nice and obvious what's happening.

131
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.660
OK let's quickly make a function call check game over soon forget it.

132
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.080
Check.

133
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.720
Game over.

134
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.900
And I'm just gonna pass is something called score.

135
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.510
I'm a pass that for now.

136
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.860
Before we actually make this thing because I can leave it with a pass.

137
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.160
That's fine I'll just run the function and do nothing.

138
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.520
That's an easy function to run.

139
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.630
Let's go to the QE and actually display the school to do this.

140
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.120
I'm going back into the gooey scene so that auto complete works.

141
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.900
I have player to score and play once score.

142
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.400
Alright now we have two possible players and we're getting the player information in so we know who

143
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.110
scored.

144
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.290
Let's not write an IF condition instead lets use get known.

145
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.680
Because get no use as a strength.

146
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.950
If I bring in the player 1 score as a strings go drag it in because I love this trek ops long drive

147
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.190
into the right place because I love that trick even more.

148
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.710
So we are now bringing in a string that is a reference right.

149
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.340
Okay so some people hate string referencing I know Ben as he's watching this.

150
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.360
It's spitting because it makes them angry.

151
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.870
But check this out.

152
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.990
I can count cats an 8 in the value of play because I've got my notes named play a one score play to

153
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.440
score.

154
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.910
I'm getting a valuable player.

155
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.860
I can just stick that in right so I can get that no.

156
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.740
OK let's use that as a very not so variable score label.

157
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.260
I need a better name for that.

158
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.480
We're.

159
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.550
Get node there so we're gonna get that.

160
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.590
So now it's use.

161
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.610
So let's go.

162
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.980
Gonna lay all there it is.

163
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:24.400
Text equals so cast that as a string.

164
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.000
Now if Player 1 scores.

165
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.650
There's a point.

166
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:36.990
And if Player 2 scores an own goal which would help if I can actually play my own game.

167
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.140
Oh goodness.

168
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.430
Talk among yourselves the bigger player one gets the point.

169
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.230
And I could put this over here.

170
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.300
Great.

171
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.940
Now this is recycling stuff a little bit I should probably do something with the labels but I can worry

172
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.370
about that.

173
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.570
We start adding polish.

174
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.070
Right now we have an update score.

175
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.220
Fantastic.

176
00:09:59.460 --> 00:09:59.940
Okay.

177
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:05.830
Now let's talk about what happens when the game is over first going to win the game is over is I want

178
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.340
to stop the timer from working somehow I need to stop the ball right.

179
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.230
I don't want it to respawn the game is now over.

180
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:17.890
I think the easiest thing to do is probably to delay the time because of the time as deleted.

181
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:25.970
We'll never get on time a time out and the pitch won't reset so let's try that let's try timer dot Q

182
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.620
free Q free.

183
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.010
Okay let's set the maximum score.

184
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.620
Find out all one.

185
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.340
So one player one will score a goal.

186
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.220
And the timer won't happen.

187
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.020
There's no bug.

188
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.860
Nothing happened.

189
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.760
Great.

190
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.660
Secondly to do is we need to tell the gooey tell the players the game is over.

191
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.060
So all I need to do is tell the guy.

192
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.550
He's in the right capitals.

193
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.830
Game over.

194
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.120
And I just realize that the reason my test worked is not so much because the maximum score is 1.

195
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.620
I'm actually not using that yet am I.

196
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.190
And he's put in if condition.

197
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:16.830
If score is equal to maximum score that would have been embarrassing.

198
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:23.280
Then do these things wouldn't elsen because if it doesn't happen we're just going to ignore this function.

199
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.410
Great.

200
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.710
Now let's make a game overfunctioning gooey and see how that works.

201
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.360
Now if we look at the good season we've already made this pop up right so this pop up shops are game

202
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.530
over and play again.

203
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:40.520
So I need to do two things I need to make this button work and I need to figure out how to show the

204
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.660
game the pop up while it start with the pop up so on function.

205
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:49.180
Game over.

206
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.710
And just because I don't trust my own typos.

207
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.250
Game over.

208
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.110
Yup that's how I typed it.

209
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.780
Great.

210
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.220
So what's going to happen while wiggling a pop up dot.

211
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.470
Shut up.

212
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.700
Pop up centred and that should do it now.

213
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.020
The button won't show yet.

214
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.240
And just a check that I haven't messed up the script.

215
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.160
Let's change the maximum score to 2 right.

216
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.750
I don't want this showing on the first goal.

217
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.440
A player one scores her player play on scores again.

218
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.170
There it is gameover now the button doesn't do anything right now.

219
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.840
That's fine.

220
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.750
Let's make it do stuff.

221
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:33.320
So we now have an ability to show the game is over a wire and this button as a signal on button press

222
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.020
and that's going straight to the goalie.

223
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.840
I'm not going to rename it because we only have one button now because it's just in one thing.

224
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.480
I'm okay running this and agree.

225
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.970
Strictly speaking this violates the single responsibility principle.

226
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.410
Right.

227
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.320
I really said that the guy is only responsible for gooey stuff.

228
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.420
So even as I'm saying I change your mind it's going to it's parrot.

229
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.180
Lets make the game deal with restart games.

230
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.990
I think a function called Restart game.

231
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.280
And we're going to get goolies parent because we've already decided it's always in direct child so that's

232
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:10.730
fine.

233
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.740
If not going to have to use your get tree get root find.

234
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:20.680
But OK so let's go get parent pregnant.

235
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.080
I can spell there is get a parent and I want to call the new function I just made which is restart giving

236
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.580
reasons not completing.

237
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.830
Haven't seen the script to restart again.

238
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.520
I will check that.

239
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.600
Great.

240
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.000
So what's that going to do.

241
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.400
Well let's get into the right scenes.

242
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.050
Alter.

243
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.300
It's just going to rerun the scene.

244
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.260
I'm not going to change scene.

245
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.680
Reason is were in this scene.

246
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.160
If I say change scene to the current scene there's a chance of my go.

247
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:47.630
I don't need to.

248
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.150
I'm already here so let's not do that attitude get tree and I'm going to use reload current scenes which

249
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.710
does exactly what you might expect.

250
00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.580
And if I've done this correctly now what Maxum score is to let's see what happens.

251
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.780
I press once.

252
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.250
And twice I pressed play again and we restart the game.

253
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.260
Fantastic.

254
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.580
Now I am going to fix the bug with the where you just move side to side a little bit.

255
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.480
And I'm pretty sure the reason here is because these labels where they play are to score play at once

256
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.250
school are aligned to the left and then reciting the exelis and line them to the centre.

257
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.340
And we're going to give them a minimum size So what do you think.

258
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:36.810
Scott who racked current size 16 and give them a minimum size of a note that's thought that's the height

259
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:43.220
what the width has given the current size of 90 and 90 to resize the banner.

260
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.900
But that's okay I can do that.

261
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.120
Here we go.

262
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.780
Size is currently 900 let's call it a thousand.

263
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.810
And just to make everything nice and clear going to recentre at the top.

264
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.180
And it's now going to go.

265
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.580
Let's just check that I haven't broken everything.

266
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.220
Score a goal.

267
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:08.960
Score a goal.

268
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.740
Yeah I press this button now current.

269
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.710
I don't have any feedback.

270
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.180
There's no sound nothing else will put them in with the Polish.

271
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.780
Which brings me to the challenge.

272
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.700
I'd like you to change the text on game over.

273
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.230
That tells me who's who won.

274
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.660
So if I look here.

275
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.950
Game over play again.

276
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.740
That doesn't tell me a lot of information change this so that say Player 1 wins player 2 wins.

277
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.520
How you want to put it.

278
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.940
Hooray for player one player two is victorious.

279
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.970
Go go nuts.

280
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.750
Be creative but show me who won.

281
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.610
So possibly you give that a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

282
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.540
And welcome back.

283
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.270
All right so the easiest way of doing this is to build on what we already have.

284
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:57.160
We already have game over and all I need to do is bring in an extra piece of information I need to know

285
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.050
who scored the last goal because it's impossible for two people to score at the same time in this game

286
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.220
because the goals aren't in the same place and there's only one ball.

287
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.910
If we ever change that if we have a game of football with five balls which you could do by the way you

288
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:16.730
could absolutely make this as crazy you wanted this wouldn't work for now it'll work.

289
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.540
But in order for this work let's actually pass that information in.

290
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.520
Otherwise God is going to go.

291
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.780
I'm expecting an argument.

292
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.640
Where's the arguments in game over.

293
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:31.750
I want to bring through the player which means I need whoever scored in here and we may as well use

294
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.210
the exact same format we've got to but isn't it confusing.

295
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.790
Play a new score.

296
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:42.490
That information is all in this function so that's fine and in check him over his player new score new

297
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.320
score doesn't need ring remey naming because it's fine.

298
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.660
Now this player information is passed it's game over and we can now change the text so let's make sure

299
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.800
I'm in the right scene.

300
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.690
Look at the scene tree and I want to change the label on my pop up size.

301
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.150
This one here sir into my scripts and

302
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:13.050
Pa label in lowercase because it's not an old equals and I'm just going to get the notes.

303
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.240
Alice put the dollar sign in and drag it over and I don't need these quotations.

304
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:20.810
OK.

305
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.830
So there's the label label dot.

306
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:32.610
Text equals player space plus player as a string.

307
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.260
He's a cast that in.

308
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.040
Space wins.

309
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.150
That should work just fine by me.

310
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.650
Put it in brackets just to make it nice and clear that this is all one argument.

311
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.640
I think I'll probably be fine without it but I find this more readers really.

312
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.460
I find it more readable not necessarily easier to say but definitely more readable.

313
00:17:52.700 --> 00:18:02.620
I might have to recite this just to be sure I'm going to go to my to you and player 0 wins.

314
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:05.940
OK.

315
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.530
So let's just change the size of that celestra 500 pixels.

316
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.450
Yeah that's fine.

317
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.140
So far I've got about 200.

318
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.480
That's looking good and you know what the button doesn't need to recite itself so let's switch off expand

319
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.800
on the button switch fell off the button.

320
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.930
It doesn't need to do that and to make the button centred I think there's only one way of doing this

321
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.910
in the V box containers.

322
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.720
Put a centre container because that's what it does.

323
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.590
Ray sent us things which means the button signal will now break.

324
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:38.330
So let's fix that disconnect and reconnect to going and should go back to the same place and now when

325
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.300
I press play.

326
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.150
Doo doo doo doo doo do one.

327
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.710
Too much more like.

328
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.070
Player 1 wins play again and it's done fantastic.

329
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.400
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video we finished worrying the gooey so we can display

330
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.540
the score information and end the game but we also finished making our game functional somewhat polished

331
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.040
to come as no sound than it yet.

332
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.700
We put the particle effects and nice lighting effects.
