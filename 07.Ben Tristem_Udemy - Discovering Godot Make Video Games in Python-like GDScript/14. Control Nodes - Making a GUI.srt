1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,120
And welcome back you lovely God people.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,710
In this video we're going to make a graphic user interface or as I like to call it gooey.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,030
You don't have to pronounce it gooey.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,260
I'm pronouncing it gooey.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,090
You could say a graphic user interface or user interface or gee you I or you I.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,410
It really doesn't matter.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,460
The whole point is we need a system where the player can understand how many coins and lives they've

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,580
got so that's what we're making to do that we need to play with control nodes.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,890
Quick pointer we're not going to go through every possible control node because there's a lot of them

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,260
but the basic idea.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,320
So you can then play with them and find out what they all do at the end of this video.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,890
You can have a user interface or a gooey up in the top corner or everyone to put it that can adapt to

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,330
how they want to size your screens.

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,660
So if I realize the screen you'll see can shift position and keep this aspect ratio.

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,490
Here we are in game and I'm going to make my goalie in the camera.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,720
So what do we want.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,900
Well if we look on the graphics and the hard heads up display you'll see I've given you three things

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,260
a banner a bronze coin and a life up.

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,030
These are the three symbols I'd like to use.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,920
My thinking is this If money is here.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,910
There's going be a banner here within which we'll see.

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,440
Quain counts a life counts.

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,070
A quaint symbol and a bunny symbol.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,580
So I'm going to make a banner and then put these elements within it.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,560
So let's make a new scene.

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,640
And I don't know quite why all the spikes are showing there let's go on.

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,730
So let's make a bass note.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,920
And our bass note is going to be a canvas layer.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,820
This is the simplest of background drawing layer right.

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,490
The thing that won't move and the let's say about this is it doesn't really have any properties it's

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,360
just start here draw from here.

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,300
That's what we're seeing within our canvas layer.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,410
I'm going to start using some controls.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,940
Let's look at these controllers.

35
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,660
They're all in green and they're designed for user interface.

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm going to begin with texture wrecked.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,670
We've used this before.

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,950
And this is going to be my banner.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,180
So let's call this plan.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,080
I want the layout of the banner to be anchored from the top right.

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Or what does that mean.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,810
It means why look at the margins.

43
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,690
These are calculated from the anchor position.

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,810
If you want to see the anchor position go to view and show helper's and you'll see the angle right now

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,260
on the top left.

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:35,320
So what this is saying is the texture we put here is zero from the left zero from the top.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,050
So first thing to do is I must set my anchor to the top right.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,750
And you'll see the margins of recalculated.

49
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,970
Let's put in at Texas under graphics under HUD you'll see these three things.

50
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,210
Let's drag the banner into the texture.

51
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,610
I will expand it which can only scale.

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,070
And they get a little bit bigger because this is control now by the way you can see all those measurements

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,330
a little bit wider.

54
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,870
You can Reece's this to your heart's content.

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,220
And now just set my margins so let's set the right margin to zero.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
And the left margin too.

57
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,470
Well you know what go over that now.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,220
Great.

59
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,030
Here's my banner.

60
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,670
Let's not put that totally in the right hand corner.

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,560
So the right banner is going to be minus 40 and the top banner is going to be minus five but nope not

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,320
minus 40.

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,400
Going to be 40 because we're calculating from the top left as make the bottom a bit bigger.

64
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,900
Great.

65
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:42,920
So now if I rename canvas Let's agree and say that in scenes if I run the scene.

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,240
You'll see that the banner is in the top right.

67
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,760
If when you were inside the screen you start seeing the aspect ratio changing.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
We can fix that.

69
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,110
This is important in the main game right where in the main game and I change the size of the screen

70
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,040
I have an aspect ratio that you didn't think I was going to have like some succeed by 9.

71
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,460
If I resized this look squished bunny is right now.

72
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,300
Let's quickly fix that.

73
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm going to project settings and scroll down to we find a window which is here on a display under a

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,430
stretch mode with a bunch of options.

75
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,510
We could do keep and that's going to keep the aspect ratio.

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,890
But it's going to do that by adding those black letter box things on the side.

77
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,710
So if I pick keep and then I run this.

78
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,160
When size again you'll see these black letter boxes and some people really hate those.

79
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,610
It can look very filmic.

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,620
I'm not a huge fan.

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,770
So instead under windows which I've lost again there it is.

82
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:47,700
Let's go to expand and now it's going to do its very best to keep everything at the same aspect ratio

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,390
and fill the window which is quite lovely.

84
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,430
Great.

85
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,660
Let's go back into going.

86
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,390
All right we have the banner and I want to put in these numbers and these icons.

87
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,260
Now I can try and do this manually.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,320
But here's a nice trick with imbaba.

89
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,750
We have a new sub a..

90
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,080
And this one is going to be one if we're going to control.

91
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,540
You'll see these containers and these box containers and sent to containers everything else.

92
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,640
What these do is say anything that's within this container.

93
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,060
Try and organize this using the schema.

94
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,600
I guess they're using the method I've told you so if I pick a box container which obviously I could

95
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,110
just type what that means is organize everything in here in a horizontal box.

96
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,490
Okay that's that's a bit weird.

97
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,940
Let's actually talk about that means so in my box container which I'm going to re size.

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,380
To fit my banner.

99
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,110
There it is very lovely.

100
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,840
And let's actually make that all white bounds of the banner.

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,500
And I'm going to put the anchor in the right hand side so that it will try and recalculate its position

102
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,360
from this right margin.

103
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,950
Within this I can now start putting things.

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,770
I start with the texture rectangle and I'm going to give this the coin image and call this coin I can

105
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,890
duplicate that.

106
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:26,030
Call it life icon and put in their life bunny sign.

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,130
We can keep going like this right.

108
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,430
So let's put it in a couple of labels.

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,950
And this can be coin count.

110
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,430
And another one saying life counts.

111
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,280
Before I go any further let's make sure we can actually see what's in there so we give these both text

112
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,850
to 0 0.

113
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,850
And let's apply a font to one of those.

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,050
So back to my fonts.

115
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,280
This should be pretty familiar right now.

116
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,710
Right.

117
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:06,190
Custom fonts and custom colour custom font they are new dynamic fonts font it's candles.

118
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:14,810
And let's give the sites how the size of what you think 40 50 50 is pretty good.

119
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,100
OK.

120
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,500
I can now copy my cost my Coston font my custom font.

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,700
Copy that and paste it here.

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,880
And now any change I make to one will happen to both.

123
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,170
That's a really nice way of keeping everything nice and centred not centred.

124
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,240
It's a really nice way of keeping everything nice and systematic.

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,870
Now if the word was the word where everything is kept all the same and organize.

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,090
It's a nice way of doing that.

127
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,190
Great.

128
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,840
The nice thing about Abebooks container is that it'll display based on the order here.

129
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,120
So if I put coin count before coin icon and life count before life I can look at that.

130
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,040
I can even make sure that the alignment is centred.

131
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,900
And now all I need to do is just give bunny here a little bit of an icon so Bunny whereas your anchor

132
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,280
your anchors the right hand side.

133
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,220
Let's give you a minus 10 on your margin.

134
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,430
And books contain a list make it a little smaller.

135
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,650
That's pretty good.

136
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,140
Bunny I think you need to be up again don't you.

137
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,030
When is an and box contain.

138
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,810
Let's move you making sure I move everything not just the child.

139
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,570
That looks pretty good.

140
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,770
And finally the banner could be a little smaller.

141
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,790
Cut it.

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,110
And now just eyeballing everything I could start doing the margins again yet as do the margin so top

143
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,350
is 40 right is minus 40.

144
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,730
Great.

145
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,660
Now we have a go.

146
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,710
Let's take a look at it.

147
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
Yes there it is.

148
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,270
And when I re size it.

149
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,660
It'll work just fine.

150
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,820
So now we need to do is instance that in my scene less isn't it on the camera.

151
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,480
Yes it's on the camera.

152
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:22,540
So into the scene and not add new noad instance child node scenes and go out now when to press play.

153
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,430
And it is our go is in place.

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,730
It's not currently wired in but that's easy enough to do.

155
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,430
Did I talk about it and if I recycled this window it'll rescale and always be worried let's put it.

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,000
God has control nodes are really flexible and you can do a lot of stuff very quickly but there's some

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,310
key things to understand.

158
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,290
One get to grips with anchors and anchor towns got to where that margin goes from.

159
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,640
If you don't pay attention to where anchors are margins can do really weird things too.

160
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,460
You can make your anchors visible.

161
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,420
Remember going to a view show helpers and there they are several container nodes can sort things automatically

162
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,010
right.

163
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,960
Box container V box contain a grid contain a list container.

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,230
There are some really useful ones.

165
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,190
So play around get to know they do.

166
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Look at the documentation.

167
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,540
The more you play with control nodes the better your user interface is going to be.

168
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,010
Which brings me to the challenge.

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,460
I'd like you to share your Gooly.

170
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,940
Show us how you've customize it did you put it in different places you changed the colours.

171
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,610
Have you used different fonts different graphic assets.

172
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,750
The discussion forum on discord and off Facebook.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,300
Let us know.

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm dying to know the kinds of games you guys are making.

175
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,900
Which brings us to the end of this video.

176
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,780
So in this video we've learned how to make a goalie how to pronounce gooey how to use control nodes

177
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,120
and the joy of a box containing a box container another container.

178
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,570
That's really key stuff because if you can get to learn to love God as gooey system and its container

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,810
nodes its control nodes.

180
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,740
You can do amazing things.

181
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,900
It's a great work and I'll see you in the next video.
