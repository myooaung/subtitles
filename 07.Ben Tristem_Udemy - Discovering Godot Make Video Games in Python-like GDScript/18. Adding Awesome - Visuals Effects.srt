00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,930
Hello again lovely God people in this video are going to finish.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,430
Awesome.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,630
Because eveillard Lots of awesome.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,130
And now his final dose of awesomely the awesome cherry on an awesome cake if you like cherries.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,820
If you don't then find something more awesome and have fun with the metaphor.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,610
Would you add some visual effects and specifically our awesome visual feedback is going to be particles

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,940
that the player is going to emit when they score a goal.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,640
I also wanted something funky with the lighting.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,360
I want a spotlight on the player that scored a goal that's only going to appear when that goal is scored

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,180
and whenever goals scored.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm a dim the main light that big directional like we have going to dim that completely out.

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,810
So let's begin with particles of the particles on the plate.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,260
Just got to have a steer over the particles on the player.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,130
Some want to open a play a note a particle right above the head.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,760
That way we couldn't keep the position consistent and not have the coming of the body which can look

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,550
really weird.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,350
So let's go into one of the placings doesn't really matter which one because there's only one placing

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,970
I'm a high the collision shakes out you need to see it right now.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,470
What I do want is to add a particle node.

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:17,050
Now we're not going to use a particle to deal with these particles and particles emit 3D objects.

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,680
So first things first let's move that to just above the player's head.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,860
At about there.

23
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,800
If we go into models and we go into particles you see there's a star mesh right here.

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,200
What I did was I found a star object and just exported the mesh directly and save that so here we have

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,470
a nice little star mesh and to use it.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,270
We need to put that under draw passes.

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,740
We can see an error here and particles and it says nothing is visible because you haven't given me a

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,430
draw pass.

29
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,120
I don't know what I'm using So let's just drag the mesh in and as a star is not doing anything yet it's

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,160
just hovering there but it's a start.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,410
I also want to give some material so let's go into the mash and find the material.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,190
And you know it will load in the same material as the ball which I believe is in graphics as Ball material.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,330
Perfect.

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,720
That way it can have a nice consistency and then we have we have a nice little start.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Now we've drawn a star but this isn't yet being used as a particle So let's go process materials and

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,600
other process materials as make a new particle material that's imported.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Okay that's looking a lot more fancy.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,670
First thing I notice these stars are way too big for me.

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,440
On about half the size I won't go into the processed material and scroll down so I see scale and I'm

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,360
going to put these as zero point five has that look cool would make me smaller.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,930
How does it apply to 5.

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,370
It's a little too small.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,340
No I will fix the speed in the direction of stuff.

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,300
This is just to get started.

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,760
Alright so we're off to a good start.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,220
Go back up to the actual particles note as a couple of other things on a change.

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,170
I want this whole Ask for 3 seconds rather than 1.

48
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,250
And you'll notice that the slowing down why they're slowing down because they're only drawing 8 other

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,520
times with the wait for one to vanish.

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,900
So it's going take three seconds of me redraw.

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,900
That's okay I can I can work with that.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,990
Let's now change how these behaves.

53
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,850
We go into particles and let's take a look trail looks good images shape OK.

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,300
So we're emitting at a point as various things we could do here as a sphere and then it's just emitting

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,030
from a radius of a surface as an imaginary sphere here and it's emitting them.

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,770
I quite like point by going emit from a single point.

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,080
What I do want though is I want to go up and ask me.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,790
Gravity you see Gravity is set to negative nine point eight minutes at the time nine point eight.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,430
Looking more like it I want a lot more than that so let's change us for a one shot see how it's going

60
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,730
to look when they are emitted so admit you mean it.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,370
But they're all in it at the same time.

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,930
OK so let's give them some randomness.

63
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,690
So full randomness and a half explosion he can look up what all these do in the documentation I will

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,070
link the documentation policy IMET.

65
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,270
Okay looking a bit better.

66
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,990
Assume it's 64 of them.

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Now that's a victory.

68
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,460
Why do want though is the Stars I want to rotate randomly So the first thing we do go to flags and enable

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,420
rotate Y.

70
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,280
Now you notice they're still not rotating.

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,900
Why.

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:16,810
Because they don't have enough velocity so to do that lets go into angular velocity and going to speed

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,760
that by let's say 10.

74
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,760
There they go look at that.

75
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,270
That's much more like it.

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,020
Now they're too close to get on to spread out on a spread.

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,570
So that's a 180.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,890
Looking a bit better.

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,060
And how about some radial bossy less really.

80
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's really speed them up another 10 on radial Lossie.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,820
There we go.

82
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,530
Much more explosive.

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
So you can tweak with these values or you like.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,580
I think they look great.

85
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,600
For now I'm going to switch off emitting because we only wants to a certain types that say that it's

86
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:56,650
going to cube dude and I'm gonna make a new function called emit particles.

87
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:06,280
One of the do is I'm going to set particles not to admit I'm missing rather equals true.

88
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,640
They're only going to emit when they get this signal.

89
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,370
There's no brackets on True.

90
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,470
True is a boolean not a function.

91
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,840
They are only going to emit when they receive the signal.

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,660
So let's put the signal in.

93
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,610
So game that put this right here on gold attacked as you might expect.

94
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,840
So we're already calling can move to the players.

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:37,740
So let's call a second single assuan a duplicate can move and instead of can move less to emits particles.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,590
Now we're not going to pass the argument fops.

97
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,100
Let's take a look at that.

98
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,750
Make sure of emitting the right thing.

99
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,680
That's good.

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,170
Now this isn't going to be perfect just yet because it was going to happen.

101
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,130
Turn the sound off.

102
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,290
You don't have to hear it.

103
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,520
Both players are emitting particles.

104
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,230
That's what I want.

105
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,660
So let's add an extra piece information and the actual piece of motion is goal wide.

106
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,740
So another pass at through is an argument then cube dude.

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,490
I would bring the argument and call it player and nounless say if player is the same as play idea.

108
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,250
So equals equals player eidy then emit particles.

109
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,980
You also notice that the particles didn't stop emitting or Istiklal why.

110
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,280
It's pretty simple.

111
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,830
I should put them as a one shot.

112
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,650
I forgot to do that.

113
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,730
Let's take a look at what time.

114
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,730
It's a player wants to score.

115
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,300
Look at that.

116
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,660
They're putting shells on everything.

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,320
Now you notice that they lasted too long.

118
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,880
So let's give them a two second timeline.

119
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,710
So that's the first step.

120
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,260
All right now let's do something with the lighting.

121
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,190
I'm going to go into lights which was a fold only you noticed we've only got the one light in.

122
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,130
And I put an animation node under direct and the directional light that's set there.

123
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,620
So animation tree player not animation tree player animation play this important animation play and

124
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,800
make a brand new animation called dim light.

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,660
And I think one second is fine.

126
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,470
The first thing to do is I'm gonna grab the key for the energy.

127
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,620
And at the end of one second the energy is going to be zero.

128
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,080
And that's put the key in there.

129
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,080
So let's play that.

130
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,080
OK.

131
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,560
So it's a one second faid that's looking pretty good.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,110
So now I would put a script in directional light let's put a script in there.

133
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,410
And put the script in the script Holder do Derek Rose directional.

134
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Excellent on ready.

135
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,960
I want to make sure that we set the light energy back to want because otherwise when we are going to

136
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,920
have to set it back here in the animation player every time we run the game and I will do that no one

137
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
worried about that.

138
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Let us put it in sup white energy equals one because that's our default rate.

139
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,510
Its double check that yet thats default.

140
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,430
OK its on Red is going to do that.

141
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,060
Now I need a function that can be called as part of a group because of function.

142
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,680
Dim light.

143
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,010
And whats going to happen all of the do is play the animation layer.

144
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,480
I am actually thinking Im not going to call the function dim light.

145
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,500
I want to call the function goals scored because we have a second light.

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,100
Thats also going to react at the same time in a moment.

147
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,410
So lets put it in the same group call lets put directional light in a group and call this group by lighting.

148
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,890
And now back into games Judy.

149
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,600
And let's actually call that allert needs a mission player anymore.

150
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,520
And let's see.

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,330
Yet we're in the right place.

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,480
That's what our group calls in one place

153
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,260
and let's get Tre got call grip.

154
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,410
I can type.

155
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:06,970
OK.

156
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,250
Group is fighting.

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,490
And what do we call it we call it goals scored.

158
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,380
Yes it.

159
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,820
OK.

160
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,400
So whatever is in the function call scored in any node with this tag on it with this group name is going

161
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,130
to happen.

162
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,500
If there's anything in that group that doesn't have a goal to add function it's just going to ignore

163
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,610
it.

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,610
So that's perfect.

165
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,480
Let's see how that works

166
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,500
and the lights don't dim.

167
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,180
So let's actually lower the animation.

168
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,760
We need to tell it what animation we're playing.

169
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,590
We are playing dim light.

170
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,640
That should work better.

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Let's move out the way and score a goal and the lights dim.

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,810
Awesome.

173
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,590
Now the lights don't do is come back up but this is way too dim So let's bring lights back up.

174
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,940
We need a new function called recept.

175
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,720
What's it going to do.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,160
That's going to bring the light energy back to one.

177
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,020
Well we're already doing that here so let's just call the reset function.

178
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,690
Ready.

179
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,740
As looking a bit tidier right.

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,900
So now we want to make sure we call that reset for the lighting group.

181
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:21,650
So back at the game and were already resetting the pitch so we'll put it right here get tree call group.

182
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,270
What are we calling we're calling lighting.

183
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,630
And we're telling it reset.

184
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,440
All right.

185
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,770
Let's see how that works.

186
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,030
Get the lights and bring them back.

187
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,690
Awesome.

188
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,630
One more thing I want.

189
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,730
I want a spotlight.

190
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,830
This is a new type of nobody not seen these yet.

191
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,190
They work just like directional lights except they have additional things that look a spotlight.

192
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,290
There it is.

193
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,710
So here's our spotlight announced a high directional light that should hide its actual light source

194
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,580
as well.

195
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,820
So you see a spotlight has a couple of extra things.

196
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,640
It has a range which directional it doesn't.

197
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,220
And it has an angle.

198
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,990
As well as an advanced mom doing put it at zero let's say sex that a good height Zero is in the centre.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,910
Six units up and I need to rotate it down.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,950
I think that's minus 90 on the axis.

201
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,810
Perfect.

202
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:27,950
And let's tighten this beam a bit so under spot we've got some extra doohickeys right here my range.

203
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,380
I actually need this enough range to hit the corners so one would do is I'm gonna angle it up just to

204
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,490
take a look and try and get to the far corner.

205
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,630
How put into local mode.

206
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,520
Yeah.

207
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,650
You see that's not quite far enough idiots.

208
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,460
Let's make the range.

209
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,610
What is that furthest range is 10 11.

210
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,700
And what's our angle house 30 degree angle.

211
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,250
20 degree angle.

212
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,310
So and get and is not quite quite enough.

213
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,590
Mcginnis And an energy too.

214
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,660
I also want this to have shadows as a neighbor's shadow on it.

215
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,670
Now if it points at a player in a nice dramatic shudder.

216
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,650
There it is.

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,230
All right take off global mode and reset its rotation so this reset to mine is 90 0 0.

218
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
It's going to points straight down at the ball.

219
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,190
It looks good.

220
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,420
So that's unhide the directional light for now.

221
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,800
Now put the spotlight in the same lighting group so let's add that's lighting.

222
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,610
And I'm going to give it a script.

223
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:45,160
So spotlight in these script sold a spotlight Judy fantastic and on ready.

224
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm going to hide I go.

225
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,780
So I'm going to leave visible for now in the mainstream but I never hide it.

226
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,730
The moment the game starts that's going to help me remember that it's there.

227
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,460
Mike there is a spotlight.

228
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,800
And now it needs to do something.

229
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:06,850
One of do is make function goals scored because we're already calling that.

230
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,270
I wanted to show on goals scored so let's just do that show.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,360
However I wanted to point at the player that scored the goal which is the challenge.

232
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,600
I'd like you to use look at to aim the spotlight at the player that just scored.

233
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,430
So look at is your hint right if you use.

234
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,590
Look at that the light will just stay where it is an angle itself.

235
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,930
Don't forget you're going to need a vector 3 to tell it which direction up is so poor the video you'll

236
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,660
look at.

237
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,870
In the spotlight at the player that's just scored when you're happy with the results.

238
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,630
Come back and I'll show you my solution.

239
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
And Mac Mac.

240
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,600
Its all going to use.

241
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,060
Look at rates so look at.

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,300
And look at takes hoops and underscores what it takes.

243
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,830
Takes two things the first thing is what am I looking at.

244
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,350
And the second is which direction is up.

245
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,590
What am I looking at.

246
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,940
Okay so I need to get the two players.

247
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,110
Let's do that now.

248
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,850
So La player 1.

249
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,000
So what's player want.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,590
Let's find out let's do get Tre dot get root find no good player one.

251
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,970
And duplicate that change all the player wants to play it too.

252
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,690
OK.

253
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
So with foul play I want to play it too now.

254
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,320
I need some way with this function of figuring out who scored to do that and how to go to game Judy.

255
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,370
And when we call goals scored I need to put in gold.

256
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,380
Now if I was smart what I would have done is put players and lighting all in one group called them something

257
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,220
like victory or something like that and then put goals scored for both of them because were passing

258
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,860
the same information through a pass the goal idea.

259
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,020
It's important that any function that's being called here now has an argument.

260
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,970
Even if he doesn't use it so it's going to directional right now and put goal Heidi we're not using

261
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,760
it but we have to have that argument in.

262
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,340
Otherwise it's going to pass through with an argument that the function isn't expecting and God will

263
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,090
crash well crash just for up.

264
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,210
All right.

265
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,350
So now we have a player in here.

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,540
So let's put if condition in if player is one he calls he calls one.

267
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,410
What do we need to do.

268
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,520
We'll do the thing let's just get the rest this conditioning else pass.

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:45,800
I think I need one more variable and the call is variable target targets he calls play out dot translation

270
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,530
right where he's on the x y and z.

271
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,050
That's good.

272
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,740
Duplicate that and put it over here.

273
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,570
Now play to time translation.

274
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,080
And now I look at it's very easy.

275
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm going to look at the target and then even up vector is a vector 3 and that's 0 1 0 right.

276
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,760
That's up just before we go any further.

277
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,450
This isn't gonna work because I've forgotten that there's extra booleans in here so let's go.

278
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,980
My big is recursive.

279
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,460
Yes it is.

280
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,080
Do I own it.

281
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,250
No I don't.

282
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,340
I forget that every time.

283
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,030
So if you're using a fine note it's not going to tell you what the error is as your say I haven't found

284
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,560
anything.

285
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
Let's see how that works.

286
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,060
Look at that dramatic spotlight.

287
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,670
Everything.

288
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,990
Now the spotlight isn't hiding.

289
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,890
I need a reset function here.

290
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,150
And that's just going to be hide and that should work fine.

291
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,320
Now I'm going to refactor really quickly so play a one.

292
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:49,240
I don't want to add you to the lighting note let's just rename that lighting group so lighting is going

293
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,420
to go away and I call this celebrants things that celebrate has a weird name.

294
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,010
If he can come up with a better name by all means do so.

295
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,500
So I'm gonna add that group spotlight.

296
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,770
I'm going a from finalizing group and add you to the celebrant group and all players will be added to

297
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,810
their group to keep Dude you are still a player.

298
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,600
Pick a celebrants.

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,250
Don't move so you're not going to have your position reset but you're salaried.

300
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Okay now I need to go to the game g script and actually redo those calls.

301
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:33,070
So Ganji And look they're all using resets so I could actually just put celebrant and remove that.

302
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,150
Do I spell that group right.

303
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,010
Let's find out.

304
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:45,400
Yes I did emit particles can be renamed and then I can just get rid of that one completely but celebrant

305
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,980
and put goals scored and back to Cube did.

306
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm going to rename it particles to goals scored because we pass this information through it right.

307
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,280
In fact if I have a goal scored let's move can move back in us and we get rid of that completely and

308
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,510
on the cube do.

309
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,080
Goals scored can move.

310
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,710
True False rather cultive.

311
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,100
It is going through looking for any other versions of that great.

312
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,710
So now it looks to me go through all the scripts very quickly.

313
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,880
It now looks to me that we don't need a play rebuttal so let's get back to our player and remove him

314
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,760
from the playgroup.

315
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,780
And I think this should work fine.

316
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,700
It does fantastic.

317
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,720
Before we finish one more thing I want to show you what if you want to add a controller to this sort

318
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,400
of project settings and to input map and let's say I want play or want to to work on my control.

319
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,310
So one to do is take up one.

320
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,060
I might add a new mapping to the one that one exists.

321
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,850
I've got various options here and I really care about Joy button and joy access and move the player

322
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,620
on the axis so on a join access device Zero is the four is searched just like an array.

323
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,870
Right so counting from 0 at device Zero is the first joypad or joystiq and then we have these different

324
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,560
axes.

325
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,890
Axis 0 is left stay left and right axis one is left stick up and down axis 2 is right stick left and

326
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,410
right.

327
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,670
Pretty easy right.

328
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,170
So I could just add less stick left for that.

329
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,510
I'm not going to because it's silly.

330
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,940
It's up so let's do that again.

331
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:36,700
Joy access and not left stick up great and there and joy access and that's left stick right there it

332
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,080
is.

333
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,150
Put these in a strange order have an eye down Joy axis love stick down.

334
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,490
Same thing for left that's the wrong one.

335
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:54,880
There is left one joy access left stick left.

336
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,250
And if you wanted it to do the same thing but now is of device zero It's device 1.

337
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,860
Ok if I want to use any buttons for anything with a kick or something like that.

338
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,130
Very simply I would go to droit button and then just pick the button I want on the correct device including

339
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,020
the deep end.

340
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,170
Let's just check that works so I'll play my game so my joypad is plugged in.

341
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,840
Let's see how that works play.

342
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,860
And I can move on joypad and it's pretty simple now all we haven't done is put a analogue in but we

343
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,920
dont have any analogue with it anyway right now.

344
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,890
That's a different kind of get a little tricky to move right now.

345
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,590
It's kind of fun.

346
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,650
So if you really wanted to we could do it you can put both players on one joypad and have them wrestling

347
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,090
for it.

348
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm not going to do that because I can foresee very violent.

349
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,600
I've actually hit you on the head with your prepared.

350
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,450
But if you wanted to do.

351
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,520
And that brings us to the end of Cube kick about nail polish you could do you can add more sound effects

352
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,050
you could add different models football background then you could change the camera.

353
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,280
But Im going to call this project done.

354
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,140
Which brings us to the end of the video.

355
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,700
In this video with added the final awesomeness so much awesome in this game I think its ready to go.

356
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,730
Weve also introduced 3D particle notes and spotlight nodes and looks at how to aim like notes especially

357
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,140
spotlight notes using a look at.

358
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,700
So dont forget to share your cube did kick about.

359
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,890
What if you added to it what have you done differently.

360
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,470
Have you got a completely different aesthetic.

361
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,420
Are you doing this with two cats.

362
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,120
I'd love to see the game youve made.

363
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,380
Meanwhile excellent work and see in the next video.
