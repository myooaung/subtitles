00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.010
Hello again you lovely God people in this video we're going to display the amount of boxes the player

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.210
has available and update that the gooey element.

3
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.760
This video is about boxes because boxers are awesome.

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.980
An item list an item list is really awesome.

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's talk about what we want with this display for disguises.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.650
I want to do the element that shows the disguises as an icon.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.460
It's really easy to do this with the label.

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.670
Right.

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.250
We could just update the text with the right value so disguises three disguises too.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.230
And I'd like to update that goofy element with the correct number of icons which seems obvious right.

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.060
Yep.

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.590
Let's get into goller and first thing I do is open the gooey scene.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.780
Here's I go seeing and I'm sure you tweak the suspicion meter.

14
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.630
But I did make a mistake in a previous video I told you to use in a split container which will work

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.130
fine.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.030
But remember there was that mouse thing in the way.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.940
I didn't mean that's right click on it to change type.

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.020
I meant a box not check box.

19
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.740
That's wrong.

20
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.620
Try that again.

21
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.340
Change type box container.

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.530
There it is.

23
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.720
That's the No Limit split container.

24
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.200
It's something that the player can drag which is where that mouth came in.

25
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.840
But now back to h box.

26
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.980
Secondly the suspicion meter a space we're not using here.

27
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.250
So let's go to the top of suspicion meter and make sure I'm moving the parent and all children's some

28
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.970
click on this whatever that is icon and let's drag it down to what looks good to 90 by 120.

29
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.260
Yeah looks good.

30
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.380
Awesome.

31
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.670
All right.

32
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.440
Let's make a brand new element.

33
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.490
I want this in the top left is going to say the sky's at the top and then is going to icons for each

34
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.500
box.

35
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.500
So let's start with a new nine patch rectangle and I need a texture for that so let's put it in the

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.580
texture graphics interface.

37
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.620
PRNG and it's going be one of these glass textures.

38
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.040
And this one has a corner on the top left slits do the opposite.

39
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.380
Missing the bottom right.

40
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.910
Let's also drag this out so it's a proximate size as good.

41
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.610
And before we can tell if it looks good or not let's actually do a patch much as we had 12 last and

42
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360
only 12 12 12 jobs.

43
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.100
That's not 12.

44
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.380
That's 12.

45
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.930
Great.

46
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.100
And you are what you become.

47
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.140
No.

48
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.580
No I quite like this size.

49
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.810
What size of we end up with here.

50
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.330
So that's going to be seat to 70 by 100.

51
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.130
Sounds about right.

52
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.460
So I got my own patch rectangle rectangle to 70 by 100.

53
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.470
You can change this to your heart's content.

54
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.010
Couple of things I want to make sure this is anchored to the top left you see I've got these green things

55
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.460
here.

56
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.300
Press view and show help us noshir rulers show helpers that shows you where you're anchored to.

57
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.440
That's a good place for me.

58
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.960
Let's also put in the same kind of margin we had here.

59
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.850
So let's go to margin and these suspicion me to have a margin of 20.

60
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.070
So let's do the same thing.

61
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.520
So our top managers get 20 and I left margin go with 20.

62
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.200
And we just need a little bit more space like so that looks pretty good.

63
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.870
OK.

64
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.010
Rename this to display container not display container disguise container that would display in my head.

65
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.820
All right.

66
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.370
That is going to split things vertically not horizontally so this is an H box container.

67
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.240
This will be a V box container.

68
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.630
By the way I didn't rename the container because we've got scrips and so on.

69
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.500
You can.

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.420
It's not a big issue because we're using groups that won't matter.

71
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.270
But it's also not the end of the world if you leave it as it is.

72
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920
Okay.

73
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.030
I no longer need to look at anything a suspicion meter.

74
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.670
Let's focus here.

75
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.040
So what that's going to do is it's going to split everything inside it vertically.

76
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.860
The top thing as the top child at the top the second channel underneath and all the way down.

77
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.350
Let's make sure we're using all of this space.

78
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.830
Let's do a full rectangle.

79
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.220
And our first shark would be a label.

80
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.370
This label is going to say disguises.

81
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.930
If you want to call it something else got something else.

82
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.760
It's called.

83
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.820
You'll notice we're not using the theme.

84
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
Back up to disguise container and load our feet in.

85
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.210
There it is.

86
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.240
I could do with a bit of a margin of eBox How about five in each direction.

87
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.490
So let's add in our margin five from the left maybe bit more than that Tenten left.

88
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.490
Yes 10 from the top.

89
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.990
Yeah looks good.

90
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.550
So there's our label that's not going to change.

91
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.440
Just go say as it is.

92
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.380
Now there are a couple of ways I could do this.

93
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.960
I can now put in a new box container and then as a child of these put in sprite's okay but I'm going

94
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.110
to use a different note one that's not automate a lot of this work somewhere delete this node and instead

95
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.730
as a child of reebok's container I'm use one called item list item list is no that is designed for things

96
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.950
like inventories and hot baths.

97
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.540
What it'll do is it can create a bunch of items that have an icon and or text right so you can tell

98
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.650
it.

99
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.560
This one has text this one has Nikon This has both.

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.620
You'll notice right now it has nothing in it.

101
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.230
First thing I do is scroll down to size flags on the vertical.

102
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.920
Let's go expand.

103
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.010
Let's just say make this some big.

104
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.740
Secondly you notice this doesn't have a theme yet.

105
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.550
Okay we can edit the thing must go to disguise container.

106
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.400
Scroll down to thien.

107
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.070
Click on theme and edit.

108
00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:01.920
We can add a class item of item list and all I want to do is get rid of this background so let's select

109
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.870
item list from a list here and under styles b.g. means background.

110
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.190
Right now there's nothing loaded.

111
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.670
I want something empty.

112
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.170
Click the down arrow and do style box empty and it vanishes.

113
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400
Awesome.

114
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.460
One thing you will notice by the way if you go back to item list there is nothing here that will let

115
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.980
you add in textures because that's not what this is.

116
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.720
This is basically a grid container with extra functionality.

117
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.750
So if I want to add an item what I do is I got this items button and I press that.

118
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.620
This is really an interface for an array.

119
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.330
Each item is going to have a name.

120
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.310
Or text.

121
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.370
And an icon.

122
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.820
And whether or not enabled.

123
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.660
So let's load in an icon.

124
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.880
And I'm going to go graphics injy tiles.

125
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.440
And just pick the box I pick one to 9.

126
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.000
You can pick 1 5 6.

127
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.810
You can pick whatever you like if you want.

128
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.450
Bring in your own icons is cool but I don't pick one to night.

129
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.200
Okay a few things going on here.

130
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.660
One not a big fan of this size 2.

131
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.500
I don't really want the Texas let's get rid of the tax entirely.

132
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.000
We can change the size of this icon If we click on Icon.

133
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.450
We have a couple of options.

134
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.210
One we can change the scale and here's a zero point five which point yeah.

135
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.620
Nothing has changed.

136
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.130
Well bugging God this won't change.

137
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.820
Let's update it.

138
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.180
I can either leave the scene and come back.

139
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.700
Which by the update or I can drag it.

140
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.220
I don't really want to drag it until everydays.

141
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.260
Next thing I want to do is I want to get rid of this weird scroll bar thing we've got here.

142
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.290
So to do that.

143
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.950
Disliked expand as I like to add again and Ill recite for us.

144
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.730
You'll notice by the way there's probably no reason to have all this room.

145
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.190
Don't worry about that.

146
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.060
Let God worry about how much room we have.

147
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.800
But if you really want to change it put a margin whatever.

148
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.160
Let's make sure that we have enough room somewhere put the next item in.

149
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.720
And I'm just going to duplicate this.

150
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.650
It's going to load in the tile and have no text.

151
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.510
And let's do that one more time.

152
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.260
No text.

153
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.630
Load in a tile.

154
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.540
Wait this is what we want.

155
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.160
Well just like a grid box container.

156
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.150
We need to tell it how many columns we're using right now was using one column.

157
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.090
Let's put them on the same column and say the maximum you can have a more column is what you think.

158
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.440
One two three four five six seven say 7c alagoas you know this is not updating.

159
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.230
Leave and come back shut.

160
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.690
It didn't just click on same column up.

161
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.680
We send text somewhere when we have text because I missed it.

162
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.530
OK.

163
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.970
So now if I click same column they're on the same column unless there's text you or.

164
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.870
And that's looking pretty good.

165
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.470
However at this point I'm going to remove them all because I want this done in code.

166
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.690
So let's delete all of these.

167
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.460
Click on that.

168
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.420
No press delete delete delete.

169
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.090
And they'll go away.

170
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.710
Now let's rename item list to disguise.

171
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.760
Display our disguise displays but a name disguise display.

172
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.170
Let's give it a script.

173
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.750
I'm going to put this in the script folder.

174
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.470
Call it this disguise display.

175
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.100
And we get to go.

176
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:30.420
OK.

177
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.160
What is this going to do.

178
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:38.330
Well all I need is a function called updates disguises.

179
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.060
And I'm going to pass in an argument and that argument is going to be the number of disguises.

180
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.020
It doesn't really matter what it's called On the other side.

181
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.870
That's what we're calling it here.

182
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.440
And the very first thing to happen is when we update the disguise clear the disguise.

183
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.500
Otherwise it'll just add to it.

184
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:54.960
Right.

185
00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:04.410
So if this functions run remove whatever's in there now we are falling for I in range.

186
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.900
No.

187
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.640
What does this mean.

188
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.990
Well this eye isn't declared.

189
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.980
That's fine.

190
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.010
We're just saying has a value any value.

191
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.500
Call it iPhone now and iterate it in the range of no.

192
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.760
We can call a number of disguises we can call it Den's donkey fixation.

193
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.720
It doesn't matter for I for some reason is traditional with a lot of programmers call it disguise it

194
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.020
makes you happy for disguises in range.

195
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:41.860
No that means every time you do this make disguises go up one until it reaches this value.

196
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.190
So we get the number five.

197
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.960
Do this five times if we get it 205.

198
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.480
Do this two hundred five times.

199
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:48.880
Thank God.

200
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.110
Well I we want to do.

201
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.420
Well let's take a look at what's available to us in an item list.

202
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.830
So no hok controlled press item list.

203
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.690
Lots and lots of things.

204
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.610
But the one I really care about is ad icon items.

205
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.080
We have an item which will add string texture and a boolean.

206
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.510
But I don't want a string so let's just use the one only as an icon.

207
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.860
What this is going to do is ask for an icon and is the selectable.

208
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.020
I don't want the selectable because this isn't actually a hot bar an invitation to misha's to display

209
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.740
so I'm often flexible.

210
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.860
Okay back to our script.

211
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.730
So I want to add icon item and this is going to ask for a sprite.

212
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.450
Well that's okay because we have these in global.

213
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm going to load because it's a string in global global dot box Sprite.

214
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.960
Awesome.

215
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.980
Second value is a selectable FOSS and that's it.

216
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.060
That's all we need.

217
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.490
Before we actually make that work I've got a challenge for you.

218
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.750
So let's save the script and have you update the item list.

219
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.250
I'd like you to figure out a way that we can run this function whenever the plays are the skies.

220
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.450
There's a few different ways you could do this but pause the video and when you're happy with the solution

221
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.510
come on back and I'll show you my solution.

222
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.200
And welcome back.

223
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:15.960
All right.

224
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.650
I am tempted to use a group I could use a signal but then I would have to wire it in which I could either

225
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:28.300
do it inside a level or through code groups feel a lot cleaner and it means that I don't have to worry

226
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.110
about wiring them.

227
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.240
Each time I run the level if I move things around they'll find each other so I mean add this to a group

228
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.430
and a click on disguised display click on groups and call disguise display.

229
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.850
But that's not a small display.

230
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:52.560
We're also going to copy that the fly and it admittedly using groups for one item like this probably

231
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.100
is going to slow down the code if the game gets too big but at our scale I think it'll work great.

232
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:03.410
Now I'm going to save this and go into our player which I haven't have open here.

233
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.220
If you don't have an open here go into your file system go to scripts and file player.

234
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.890
Now from here should be quite simple.

235
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.210
I need to scroll down to where it says disguise right.

236
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.590
It's not going to check if we're disguised because we're doing that in toggle.

237
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.940
Can you still disguise yourself.

238
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.460
If so great when you do.

239
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.760
All I need to do is make sure I call it after I update the number of disguises.

240
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:36.000
So let's do that let's say get tree core group.

241
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.500
And what's the group called.

242
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.370
It's called disguise display.

243
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.060
It's it.

244
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.430
Control be injured give the line.

245
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.580
What function we call it we're calling update disguises.

246
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.780
Copy that and paste that in here.

247
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.640
And we also need to pass an argument.

248
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.960
No argument passing is how many disguises which is a variable we have disguises.

249
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.890
One more thing to do.

250
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.780
I want to make sure I call this in ready.

251
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.170
So in fact let's make a new function.

252
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:24.390
Let's make a function called Function update disguise display and move this function down here.

253
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:34.690
And then I can call it right here updates disguised display when I called it display up and do the exact

254
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.180
same thing in ready.

255
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.970
And now assume we have done everything right.

256
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.290
Here's what we should see.

257
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.680
We're going to start the game with three disguises skalak.

258
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.750
I have three disguises.

259
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.690
I press E.

260
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.910
The disguise goes down.

261
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.940
I come out of disguise.

262
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.560
I use it again.

263
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.460
I use it again and now it doesn't matter how many times I press the button and look what if we decide

264
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.100
that in our level scene I play up because we have this is an export variable.

265
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.720
What if we start with 10 disguises.

266
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.870
How's that look.

267
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.540
An automatically updating grid element.

268
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.110
Now the scroll bar isn't in theme but you could do that if you wanted to.

269
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.110
There's a few different ways you can handle this but this is really cool.

270
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.740
We have an automatically updating gooey element with a very few lines of code.

271
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.890
I mean look how little this took.

272
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.230
It was really as simple as a follow up with a little clear set three lines of code plus the function

273
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.000
so forth.

274
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.120
And then a one line function really simple.

275
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.670
And that brings us to the end of this video.

276
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.730
In this video of looks at updating icons using simple group or signal calls you could also do this with

277
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:03.860
the signal and why item lists are awesome because you can also use this for hot bars for special abilities

278
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.110
and for the Tories.

279
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.790
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
