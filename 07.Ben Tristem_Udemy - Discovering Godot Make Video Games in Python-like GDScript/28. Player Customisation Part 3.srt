1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,080
Hello again like for God people let's finish customization off in this video and apply the customization

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,100
that we managed to get going in the last two videos.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,720
So before we do that let's talk about what needs to happen if we apply customization.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,170
We need to store important variables in a singleton is a great place to do that that allows us to keep

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,720
these variables between scenes.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
We also need to be sure what we mean by an important variable.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,490
Specifically I need to know which P.S. we've selected.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,850
So which play a model of my loading in and I need to know what material to apply then I need to spawn

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,180
the correct P C and apply the correct material and they're going happen in slightly different places.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,740
Let's begin by figuring out where the placement spawn is.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,480
So I've got a play here and what I'm actually going to do is go in to the template some will add the

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,900
little template and remove the player.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,030
Dum Dum da Boop.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,030
And instead I'm gonna spawn in a position 3D node record player start player start position as it could

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:10,860
be placed opposition a save that go back into Level 1 and not move the floor move the player start position.

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,420
There it is.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,110
Just move that over there leave it up a bit.

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,400
Now I think it's probably facing the wrong way but once we get the play going other I'll check.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,640
Next thing I do is make new scripts scripts and make a new one and I'm gonna call this customization.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:35,280
Judy and let's put it in the script folder scripts folder customization really save done and I need

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,220
to save the import information specifically.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,260
Play materials and

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,650
play a character.

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,810
Why capital B.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,020
Because I'm referring to a.

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,960
While we here.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,580
Let's also preload what the players are.

28
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,950
I mean like a new variable called a male.

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,950
And I'm going to preload.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,320
And why my preloading.

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,320
So it'll be fast.

32
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,010
Right I'll be ready in memory the moment we need it.

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,760
But I'm going to preload into scenes go into characters go to players play a M C and that she's going

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
to live right there.

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,770
Elsie the same for female freeload and drag the female loon.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,980
So save that right now I have a script.

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,170
Let's make it a singleton.

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,390
I'm an auto let this project project settings auto load.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,380
We've done this before right on the path.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,750
Click on the little dot dot dot then and find it says in Scripps.

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,260
It's called customization.

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,980
Can I add it.

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,340
It's enabled as a singleton so we have two singletons that file grabber and customization.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,150
Awesome.

45
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,960
We can now access them.

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,780
Let's before we go any further actually make sure that we're resetting these variable supply materials

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,140
and player character to do that.

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,470
I'm going to go in two scripts folder and open character customization.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,440
Judy I'm going to pass this information through on start that unpressed.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:13,000
So first thing I do customization dropped player materials equals.

51
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,410
Now I could just put in current material right and current material is just an integer.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,630
So if I do that I'm going to have to scroll up here.

53
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,530
Sure I have to do left the wrong file gabra again get the same files and then load them in again.

54
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:37,200
So instead let's make a brand new variable and call this selected material and let's make a note so

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,050
we remember what it is.

56
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,710
What's the difference Tweenies in the current material selected material.

57
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,190
Is the material that we're passing through to customization.

58
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,470
Judy I wish you'd put that let's put up and change material because we're setting these materials here

59
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,050
so I'm going to do some selected material.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,970
There it is.

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,450
It calls and I just need to copy this through it right so I'm going to grab this bracket here load materials

62
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,420
this current material.

63
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,330
Well if I'm doing that then why am I putting this in twice so instead of repeating load materials this

64
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,650
current material let's copy selected material and just put it here apart everything else is going to

65
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,440
get a lot more readable.

66
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,740
Jemmy brackets there it is.

67
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,890
We are setting material 0 with selected material.

68
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,220
Awesome.

69
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,290
Now instead of current material we can pass through selected material and the beauty of this is we are

70
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,550
now passing through the object not the string reference so we don't have to put in any loads or anything

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,600
it should just work.

72
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:47,480
OK we have the selected material we also need customization dot player underscore character he calls.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,210
What did I call this double check.

74
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,290
Current player.

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,540
Now this will pass through as a string.

76
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,330
But that's okay we can work with that.

77
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,180
Alright so we now have the Select Committee on the player coming through into customization.

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,030
Now we need to apply them first let's open game state.

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,630
If you don't have game set up trailer and scripts don't worry.

80
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,400
And on the ready elements set it with a new function and let's call this function.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,180
Apply customization.

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,250
Copy that and pull it down here.

83
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,210
Looks good functioning.

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,680
Apply customization as per pass for now because it occurs to me.

85
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,940
I could also put something called Count me I must do that count.

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,210
Enemies let's copy that and you know you to move this down.

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,070
Once you move this down count X..

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,150
Now I think that customization is not really a good name because what we're doing is picking the character

89
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,090
so let's call it select character or instance character.

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,320
That's a good one instance.

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,750
Little good spell again.

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
P.S. good name instance.

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,180
P.S. that's what were doing incensing the tippler player character.

94
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,670
Or I must start with a new variable.

95
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,690
We call this play.

96
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,130
Now let's go to distraction free mode.

97
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:14,450
I could see more of the screen and now it's a simple condition if customization dot player character

98
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,270
equals two equals because we're checking so is the same as male.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,940
It doesn't actually matter which a pick player.

100
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,480
Equals customization.

101
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,630
DOT.

102
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,900
Male.

103
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,610
OK.

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,080
So why are we using this.

105
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,090
I'm using this to load this in somewhere load it in this instance let's just put it in an instance now

106
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,730
because I've only got two characters that I can just do a simple if.

107
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,750
Else if I was using multiple I could use.

108
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,540
If iliff or a match case or dictionary.

109
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,990
But as I've only got to this feels pretty solid.

110
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,120
So if it's not male It has to be female.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:57,130
Because we have an unfortunate binary thing happening customization dot female dot instance.

112
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,810
All right so we've decided what the play is going to be.

113
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,170
Let's add the child child player.

114
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,140
Now let's get our destruction free mud from it and figure out where this is going.

115
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,530
Player is going to be added to game state dog video game 6.

116
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,520
She's always going to be the root node so whatever level we've got if we keep getting levels it's going

117
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,300
to be here.

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,740
Let's check where our player start position.

119
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,530
I need it to move to here.

120
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:29,680
So back in the Scripps asked of the child let's move of play dot transform equals and now I just need

121
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,330
player start position dot transforms or whether this is moving there too.

122
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm pretty sure that this is facing backwards but will check that niman Alright so we'll apply the customization

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,340
for which character were doing.

124
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,880
We have done the texture's I'm going to put this in play which again is open twice and a close one of

125
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,020
these and put it here on ready.

126
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,830
Why am I putting in the play a dodgy bit is the player should be responsible for how a player looks.

127
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,630
This isn't a game decision right.

128
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,260
The game is something which player will loading in but the player needs to be responsible for how the

129
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,150
player looks so ready.

130
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,580
I need to update the mesh.

131
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,810
If we look character customization and I take a look over here we can remember that what we actually

132
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,760
need is the armature mesh set surface.

133
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,130
Easiest way to do this.

134
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,830
I go back into the correct script.

135
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,560
Why you.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,590
I won't go into my scenes folder which is right here in two characters players and it doesn't matter

137
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,170
which player picks up I play F. And I need to change the material on this measurement right click on

138
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,370
it and do copy.

139
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,780
Note path back into my script.

140
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,720
I am just going to go dollar omniture mesh.

141
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,590
I get.

142
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,330
Sure Shemesh dot in you the set surface material so millot Copy that over.

143
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,840
That's in customization.

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,010
Here we are set surface material.

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,060
0.

146
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,780
I don't need set set the set surface material 0 will already loaded this in as an object So customization

147
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,940
dot player material.

148
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,890
Okay so how would check if this works.

149
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,960
Well let's open the customization sinks back into my scenes followed into customization and open customization

150
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,180
and just check on in the right place.

151
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
We aren't going to run this scene.

152
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,790
And let's customize the look and press begin.

153
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,380
And here we are.

154
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,520
And we are facing the wrong way but the customization has applied to so many just that.

155
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Now it's a little slow.

156
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,260
I should probably preloading the scenes but we can do that when we polish.

157
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,860
Let's just make sure we're facing the right way.

158
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,280
So I go into my template.

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,170
Here it is.

160
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Actually probably not a template because we don't know which way it's facing.

161
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,550
So click play it start position go to transform rotation.

162
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,450
I'm rotating on the green access that's the Y and it's 180.

163
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,800
So one more time run that scene.

164
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,210
Choose My look just begin.

165
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,130
And there we go.

166
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,330
Perfect.

167
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,550
Outstanding.

168
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,600
We have now applied character customization.

169
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,720
Now at the moment there's no way to get into that.

170
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,390
But there is one place we should be put we should be going into it so let's go in to a level template

171
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,070
or just maybe manner which will open the pores manuscript.

172
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,170
So let's open the pause menu scene rather.

173
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,480
So I'm in my possession you must show my pop up.

174
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,390
I want this cat.

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
This customize character button to do something.

176
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,050
So let's go into the Customize character node and connect it so selected that button breast and going

177
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,210
to connect that to pause menu and I need this to load that scene.

178
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,010
So get free any pass.

179
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,750
Sheesh scene.

180
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,770
Let's go find the scene.

181
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,480
It's right here.

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,590
I happened to have it there.

183
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm going to going to load that scene in.

184
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,330
OK.

185
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,950
So far we're off to a great start.

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,590
But if I play this game now we're going to have a problem.

187
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,380
Check it out.

188
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,080
Oh no.

189
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,200
What is happening.

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,600
What's happening is that we don't have an error correction because we're not starting in character customization.

191
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,030
We're trying to load in things that haven't been set.

192
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,150
So here's my challenge for you.

193
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,090
I'd like you to put in some error checking make one of the pieces and the materials spawn.

194
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,250
If we haven't thought through character customization suppose the video give it a shot.

195
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,170
And when you come back I show you my solution.

196
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,250
And welcome back.

197
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,680
First thing I do is I'm going to go into the play a script that's open to play a script.

198
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:53,230
Now all of these models have a different texture but I am setting it to a texture and that's why that

199
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,250
character went black.

200
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:07,390
So instead let's do this if customization dot play materials is not null and if I look at customization

201
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,890
you can see it's starting off as noll's is a variable with no entries and an empty string.

202
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,270
It has a null variable.

203
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,330
So what I'm saying is if it's not null applies material.

204
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,750
If it is would just skip this entirely.

205
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,140
So let's see what that looks like.

206
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,180
Great pretty solid.

207
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,620
Now at the moment it's picking the default character for us.

208
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,960
And let's take a look at why.

209
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,270
It's because I've done this else.

210
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,160
If right I've forgotten that that was going to be a side effect.

211
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,150
If we didn't want it to happen we could go to play character and set this too.

212
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:44,460
I don't know female However this ELSE IF will actually work for us so let's try that one more time.

213
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,930
I'm going to go into a game.

214
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,620
So it brings to full screen.

215
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,330
That's working pretty solidly but look.

216
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,230
And when a postgame press can customize character and nothing works.

217
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,570
Why doesn't it work.

218
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,860
Because we pause the game to get to that menu and we never came out of port so we've loaded paused.

219
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,010
Okay how we fix that up pretty easily.

220
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,740
What I need to do is make sure that when we load this level we come out of ports and open scripts and

221
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,680
go into character customization and on ready right at the top.

222
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,580
I mean do this get tree dot paused.

223
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,000
He calls false.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,720
I don't need a toddler to set the FOSS so straight up one more time.

225
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,400
So go into large screen customize my character.

226
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,190
We are no longer paused.

227
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,700
I can customize to my heart's content Let's bring in Frey and I will where the nice grey shirt because

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm wearing grey shirt right now.

229
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,150
Press begin and look at that.

230
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
Awesome.

231
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,930
Look at that.

232
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,800
We now have a working character customization.

233
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,290
Our game is very nearly complete at this point.

234
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,520
It's just a couple more things we need to do.

235
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,930
So in this video we've looked at storying applying character customization and whether this system will

236
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,690
scale so if you have lots and lots of customization in each character we can just scale this up.

237
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,040
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
