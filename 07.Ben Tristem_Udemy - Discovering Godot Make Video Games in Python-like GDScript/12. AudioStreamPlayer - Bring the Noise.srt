00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,060
Hello again you splendid go to people in this video we're gonna bring in sound effects and music and

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,550
I'm going to make a little confession here although this is not a complicated topic it is kind of ironic

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,490
because I did manage to record this entire video just now with my mike switched off so I get a sound

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,850
effect video with no sound I am the best teacher ever.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,060
OK.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,250
Let's bring the noise using audio stream player.

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,380
I'm going get into Gordo and let's go straight into the player scenes.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,650
I'm a press player and click on the open and edits I think and I'm going to bring in a brand new note.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,940
So if I type an audio you'll see that there are actually three different types.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:51,120
In fact let's look at the slide so I've got an audio stream player and an audio stream play 2D and 3D.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,860
And the difference between these is position audio stream player inherits from node so it doesn't have

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,430
any kind of position data it plays equally everywhere audio stream play 2D on the other hand inherits

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,850
from no 2D so it has an x position and a Y position or an x value on a y value the closer you get to

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,310
the position of that node the louder it'll get audio stream player 3D exactly the same but it also has

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,370
a z position or z position entirely up to you.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,780
So let's switch off this annoying red light and get out the slides.

17
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm going to add an audio stream play a note for now let's take a look at the Inspector we've got a

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
few properties can play with the stream.

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,210
That's the sound face gonna play.

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,850
I've already opened my SFX folder down here so I've got my sound effects my music ready to go volume

21
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,590
and decibel.

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,100
Nice and easy pitch how high how low is it playing is it auto playing and so on.

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,010
One thing you'll notice is this only one stream I can only play one sound per audio stream player if

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,990
I want multiple sounds to be playing simultaneously I'm going to need multiple audio stream playing

25
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,370
notes if I don't need them playing simultaneously I can just change the stream property here.

26
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,370
So let's take a call he sounds I'm saying jump and put it in there and I can listen to it by pressing

27
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,410
play playing rather.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:20,110
So playing well that's looping maybe I don't want looping in fact if I have a slipping a press space

29
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,690
and unless I tell the sound to stop it's going to loop forever that's gonna get really annoying.

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,010
He's a turn looping on and off for sound can make sure I've got my sound effect selected and then the

31
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,820
top left having a press input and you see it says loop.

32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,140
Turn that off and you must press report.

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,580
If I don't press report nothing has changed.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,030
So press report and now the soundtrack will play once and stop.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,650
There are times you will want looping sound effects maybe I don't know the sound of a breeze or a trickling

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,710
stream or music but I don't want it for now so I'm gonna just deselect that and get back in my scene

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,860
and you know all we hear let's make sure that pain that's the sound effects going to play when he's

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:11,410
hurt is also not looping So switch off loop and re import good coin won't be looping anyway so that's

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,820
fine.

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,190
And the two pieces of music we can leave looping back to the same view again now have a couple of options

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,070
here.

42
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,030
If I want pain and jump to be able to play simultaneously I need to audio string players I'll have to

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,980
name them.

44
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,300
However the logic of the game tells me that this will never happen because when I'm jumping I'll play

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,210
jump and while when I hit something I'll fly up as if I'm jumping I want the player to hit a sound effect

46
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,610
of pain I want that feedback to be good.

47
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,070
So one thing to do is just have the one audio stream play a note and switch the streaming code.

48
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,430
OK so let's get into the script as my play script and scroll to find.

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,860
Jump.

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,280
There it is.

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,720
OK.

52
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,090
So what is that the first thing to do is set the stream so let's go audio stream player not stream equals.

53
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,560
And I could just well be careful.

54
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,990
You could just drag it in here but this is not a sound.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,310
This is a string that won't work.

56
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,970
In fact I'll say if I press play I jump.

57
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,520
I wait.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,200
You can't put a string there.

59
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,500
Great.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,680
So I need to convert this from a string to an actual file to do that.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm going to use load.

62
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,180
Well this is actually doing is costing much in the same way.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,280
If I change a string to an integer or an integer to a float I can put load and change the string from

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,190
just a string of characters to an actual place in the file system.

65
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,340
Okay so I can put that in but I'm not playing it.

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,920
So let's go.

67
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,730
Audio string player dot play I don't need to put in any kind of check.

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,020
Right.

69
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:55,800
So I could go if audio stream player not playing I actually what the opposite of this right so I could

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,370
go if not playing then do this but this makes no sense because it's not looping anyway and it'll only

71
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,370
play if we press jump and we're on the floor.

72
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,260
So just holding down the spacebar won't do anything.

73
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,480
So I don't need this check.

74
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,380
This is meaningless.

75
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,110
I will take that out.

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,310
Let's just make sure that we will actually pay some of that when we jump

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
Haha awesome.

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

79
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,710
That's looking good and now let's switch out the string to paint dot O.G. when we heard something good

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,340
that's the heart function and I would put it right to life.

81
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,310
So let's go.

82
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:41,630
Audio Stream player dot stream equals put as a file and just drag pain in there and make sure we actually

83
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,240
play it so audio stream plan don't play.

84
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,550
Let's see how this works.

85
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,950
That works at

86
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,440
awesome.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,500
OK so these sound effects now working now.

88
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,110
I will put some music in now.

89
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,910
I'm not going to put the music on the player because it doesn't depend on the player.

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,870
Instead I'm gonna put it on level one second level one and go right up to the top.

91
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,200
You know let's minimize these hazards that I need to see them.

92
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,760
Let's just use control at our child node and it's a brand new audio stream player and let's call it

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,330
B GM.

94
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,830
For background music it's a B G M.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,160
Right.

96
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
So you'll notice we've got these two pieces of music and I'll link them to right to in a section but

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,190
just to remind you I got them both from open game art dot org and I've got Chip tunes I've actually

98
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,800
picked one of these.

99
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,490
If you want to pick another one go for it.

100
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,590
And I've also picked some a park by Scribe and we can listen to those.

101
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,620
Let's head back over here and have a quick listen.

102
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,700
So Chip tunes whoops.

103
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,340
Click on music player listened chip June and play

104
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,990
very lovely.

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,230
And then this summer Park which sounds a bit more like this

106
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,090
great.

107
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,820
So I'm going to clear that up and here's my challenge for you.

108
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,350
I'd like you to pick your background music listen to chip tune adventures one awesome a park one and

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,690
make them the background music for you hoppy day's game.

110
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,940
Now you don't have to pick those if you're not planning on distributing your game anyway.

111
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,430
Pick any music you'd like.

112
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,110
If you are planning on distributing it make sure you pick one with with the rights that you can actually

113
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,460
use both of the tunes I've used on the creative commons zero license which means you can use them for

114
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,300
any purpose without attribution without paying anybody.

115
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,410
Go ahead but use whatever you like.

116
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,650
Quick caveat Gordo won't read MP 3s and P3 is proprietary format Gordo is an open source engine.

117
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,200
No one is paying for the licence from P3 so if you do want an MP 3 you'll have to convert it to an O.G.

118
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:55,680
G file or wildfires and let that pick the background music for your game and make sure that music plays

119
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,810
When the game starts as a couple of different ways you could do that.

120
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,080
But pause the video.

121
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,900
Get that going.

122
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,520
Pick your music.

123
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,120
Get it started when the game starts and when you come back I show you my solution

124
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,160
and welcome back.

125
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay I think I'm gonna hit some of polka quite like this one it feels very relaxing.

126
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,120
I realize relaxes into Word but on the knees anyway as a couple of things we could do here we could

127
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,670
make a script for the GM right.

128
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,140
So let me put it right here.

129
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,050
Announcer To show you how this work and I can make a ready function.

130
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,150
There it is.

131
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,470
And I could just go play and that will work fine.

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,710
However why would we want to make a script.

133
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,440
There's a much easier way of doing this song is going to close the script.

134
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,700
I don't want to save it discard it.

135
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,590
Great.

136
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,850
Let's make sure I haven't created it here.

137
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,940
I have just delete it out of the tree.

138
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,310
Okay.

139
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,660
I don't actually want any kind of script for this.

140
00:08:49,670 --> 00:09:00,450
I'm compress auto play and now in a press play.

141
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,140
Awesome.

142
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,850
Now there was something on it is just now when we tried that that let me play it for you.

143
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,500
I'm trying to jump and get some time and it's cutting off the sound effect.

144
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,240
I read like that.

145
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,340
So you know what my idea of bringing this streaming with code wasn't a good one.

146
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,910
Let's change it.

147
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,060
So I set of audio stream play at the school this jump SFX and it's put a brand new audio stream plan

148
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:33,810
note in there and call this pain as effects and not drag the right sound effect into the right one.

149
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,930
So pain has this stream and jump has this stream and now back to the script.

150
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,950
Let's get rid of the bit where I load the stream.

151
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,560
That's now redundant but this is not no longer enough.

152
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,060
There is no note called audio stream.

153
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,580
You are now called Pain SFX.

154
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,800
Got to jump into the exact same thing button.

155
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,640
There it is.

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,860
I don't need you an audio stream player is not a known name anymore.

157
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,850
So now you are called Jump SFX and now in the first play

158
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,590
great I can hear both the same time.

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,530
Now I'm getting a little bit of distortion here so I could bring the volume down a bit.

160
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,240
So let's say minus five decibels

161
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,510
and just to make absolutely sure on the click on the audio tab here and just make sure that nothing

162
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,480
here goes into the reds let's press play I'm still a bit loud but you know what I think that'll work.

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,040
And one more time.

164
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,500
It's not distort anymore.

165
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,720
Maybe my music's a little loud so I could turn that down let's say minus 10

166
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,710
That's too quiet isn't it.

167
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,790
Maybe minus five.

168
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,220
Just bring that line with everything else.

169
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,530
Looking good.

170
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,010
Okay.

171
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,360
And that brings us to the end of this video in this video.

172
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,790
We've looked at the three different audio stream play notes and what you'd use each one.

173
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,690
How to Change of sounds is looping and how to use auto play.

174
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,350
So what music did you use.

175
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,860
I did you could find the entire different How's your game coming along.

176
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,340
I'd love to hear your progress.

177
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,820
Meanwhile great stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
