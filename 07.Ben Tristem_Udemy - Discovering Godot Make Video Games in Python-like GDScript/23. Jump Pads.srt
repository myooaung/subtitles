00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,310
Hello you marvellous God.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,800
People in this video we're going to boost the bunny with some jump pads.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,760
Let's make the game even more exciting by not making just dangerous but faster and higher.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,130
So what do we need a jump had to do.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm picturing a coiled spring and when he touches it it's suddenly uncoiled and Bunny goes higher than

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
normal and then it resets to its original animation.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,290
It goes back to its state.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,950
So how can you make that happen.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,730
Well let's begin by making a new song and I'm going to zoom in and out a little bit just to get rid

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,810
of that weird bug.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,650
And we want a brand new known to do you know we don't want an area to be a life.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,850
We want an area too deep.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm going to call it a jump pad because that's what it is I get rid of that we had capital A That I

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,340
don't need.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,420
OK it's an area too deep so it wants a collision shape before we give it a collision shape.

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,600
Let's Wonderwoman the Scripps folder and then give it Sprite.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,070
You know what let's give an animated Sprite.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,540
All right so to make an animated Sprite work it needs frames let's give it a new Sprite frames.

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,550
Click on Sprite frames.

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,330
That's what I just said there.

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,640
Click on Spike frome's great rename default to Idol because I think default is a bad name.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,240
I don't know why.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,230
I just don't like it going to graphics.

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,640
And if you look in items you'll find we have three icons in I'm thinking that if we alternate between

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,990
Spring in and spring let's see what that looks like.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,410
Has looking pretty good.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,690
Way too fast though so let's go back into our Sprite frames and change that to two frames per second.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,100
Not bad.

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:52,070
What you will notice is that it's going from the centre that could get irritating because this is going

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,090
to go through the bottom of the floor.

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,630
Speaking of irritating my stomach playing just for now because that's really distracting.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,920
It's going from the centre.

33
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:07,880
We could do some stuff using offsets like an offset and switch it off centre and go minus 75 I think

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,790
that's how big it is and that's what 50 up and one is 50.

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,090
That's pretty good.

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,560
How is it playing.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,180
The problem here though is that now it's working so often at the top.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,320
I actually don't mind it from centre.

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,640
And it's give it back to 0 0.

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,450
I don't mind working from central planning like this is going to go through the floor and maybe hover

41
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,490
a bit but I'm actually fine with that.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,930
If you're not you would have to alter these sprites somehow so give it an alpha sexual rest of it.

43
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,550
For now this feels good.

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,110
OK Ellis given the colours and shapes of this needs a collision shaped hoodie I could use a polygon.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm not going to and I'm going to give it a simple rectangle shape.

46
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,730
It's not going to be pixel perfect because well look this is a kind of skew If shape isn't it.

47
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,030
But if I go like that that looks pretty good.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,410
And remember use the extant handle's not the scale handles.

49
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,340
If you try and scale a collision shape by dragging that the SCO handles you really are all kinds of

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,300
annoying bugs.

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,390
That's looking pretty good.

52
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,390
It's a little bit wider.

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,940
I'd rather give money a little bit too much run too little.

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,180
Let's hide the collision shit for now.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,160
For forget let's hit jump pad and press select the parent not the children the one the moving around

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,380
we know what we know.

57
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,800
Second thing let's put this on a collision layer.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,820
So on the jump pad itself under collision make sure the layer is set to something pick ups or train

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,930
either of those put on pick ups masking to the player.

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,870
If you're going to use these collision masts we have to be consistent and not forget them forgetting

61
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,170
them is going to really mess up the game.

62
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:03,080
We have a simple animation let's put in a second animation and hit this new animation button right here

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,900
and when they call this spring and for this I just need one.

64
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,780
So it's just going to go like this.

65
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,250
So we have two postle animations.

66
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,450
If we look at a meta Sprite and put it on playing from idle to spring.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,070
And back to you I'll great leave that play for now although it is a little bit distracting.

68
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,200
Actually I'm not really but playing.

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,520
I lied.

70
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,830
Now the other thing we need to do is go to the spring animation and then return here and I'm going to

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,920
do this after a set amount of time.

72
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,030
I'm thinking one and a half seconds to do that.

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,490
I need a time an old timer those are awesome.

74
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,560
They do exactly what you think they would do.

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,580
They have a few options.

76
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,800
The first is the wait time that there's at one point five six seconds.

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,800
Is it a one shot.

78
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,470
What does it mean.

79
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,040
It means it'll stop when the timer reaches zero probably.

80
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,750
I think so.

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,020
And auto start does it start the moment the level starts.

82
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,930
No I don't want this stuntin them and the lost lights are right.

83
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,750
If we have a note that's going to connect by signal because it has a time out signal built in which

84
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,270
is exactly what we want.

85
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,390
We'll probably need a script.

86
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,270
Let's make a new script for jump ahead.

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,000
And that's going in the script folder because that's what they do.

88
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,620
And I probably don't need a ready function but I do need a couple of signals the first one is going

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,030
to be the jump pads area 2D signal and that's going to be body and it would use this quite a bit haven't

90
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,560
we.

91
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,860
So on body entered connect yourself you're going to do the thing this tidy this up a little bit.

92
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,010
The other one I want to use is timer.

93
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,150
And what does this do exactly you'd expect when the time hit zero.

94
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,270
Call this function.

95
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,850
Okay.

96
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,520
What needs to happen.

97
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:58,090
Well when Bunny enters this area Trudy we need to change what we're elevating so animated Sprite play

98
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,480
and you want to play spring.

99
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm just going to double check this what I actually called it because that would be silly.

100
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,170
It is.

101
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,510
I also want to start the timer Let's get that right

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,140
timer start.

103
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,520
Time to start will do exactly what expect it's going to start the timer at the time or start from a

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,170
point five seconds and it'll take down.

105
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,410
When it gets to zero it'll call this function.

106
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,390
This function is going to reset the animations all it's going to be.

107
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,540
So I made a sprite to play default.

108
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,050
Great.

109
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,800
We have now successfully used our timer and that's looking pretty good.

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,730
The other thing it needs to do is move the player.

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:53,990
Well let's save this scene in scenes jump had scenes and let's get to the play a script that is I'm

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,740
going to make a new concept.

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,350
And this one will be called Jump underscore but sort of not a school that's close brackets.

114
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,850
That's an unschool.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,260
And I mean set this constant to this is a multiplier.

116
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,030
How many times higher than you normal jumps speed do we go.

117
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,750
So if my normal jospeh is negative 1 7 5 0 0 negative 1750.

118
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:21,030
Multiply that by two and that's give me my boost speed and let's pick a function just after jump.

119
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,040
Take that up a bit.

120
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,790
Main function and we are going to call this boost.

121
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,890
What's going to happen on boost.

122
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,790
Well it's essentially the same as jump isn't it.

123
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,620
Motion dot.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:44,150
Why does the most not white Eagles jump speed multiplied by Jump bust.

125
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,900
And that should work great.

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,750
Let's make sure we're actually calling it set back to jump had global dot player start boost.

127
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,540
Is that what I call it double checking.

128
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,790
It is why I called it great save that okay.

129
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,670
That should now work.

130
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,520
So let's put one on the level and double check it.

131
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,910
Can I make a new container note for it.

132
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,450
No.

133
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,030
2 D.

134
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,200
Which isn't actually contain a node but I'm using it to contain things and I call this jump pads within

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,420
which I'm going to instance opes that's not instance this child I'm going to instance at this time I

136
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,670
mean it a jump had.

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,190
And let's put one right.

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,110
No no no.

139
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,820
Let's move you not scale you.

140
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,410
If you get the thing I just say we actually start scaling things just hit the move.

141
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,890
But let's put you right here and let's make sure you're actually on the right things so animator's Sprite

142
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,410
you are an idol and you are playing save you.

143
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,530
That should work great.

144
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,190
Now you see here where I said it's going above it.

145
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,300
I can live with it.

146
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,280
I think that's pretty good.

147
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,390
Alright let's double check how this works.

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,110
It's funny.

149
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,410
Anybody can believe that.

150
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,350
One thing I'm interested in listen carefully is these points.

151
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,740
Every time I pick up a second coin it's restarting the sound.

152
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,860
The reason for that is there is only one audio stream player for all these coins.

153
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,540
Somebody are something that's zavada a on our Q and A for this course pointed out.

154
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,880
We can have an audio stream player on each coin rather than a global sound effect.

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,980
So for now let's try that one remove quite a SFX from my sounds delete the node let's remove it from

156
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,790
the global script.

157
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,260
So in two scripts.

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,340
Global.

159
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,940
But Judy will remove coiner SFX.

160
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,280
Finally let's get in to one of our quaint scenes.

161
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,050
And add a node full audio stream audio stream player.

162
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,780
There it is back in the sound effects but the coins back and what do we say we said minus 15.

163
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,350
And let's change the script sort of Colobus.

164
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,020
Not quite.

165
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,020
SFX not play.

166
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,430
Let's do audio stream player dot play.

167
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,070
It only has one thing it can play.

168
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,610
So that's what it'll play now when go back in the game.

169
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,830
Each coin should probably play.

170
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,780
Doesn't that sound satisfying.

171
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,590
Great.

172
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,450
Which brings me to the challenge.

173
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,830
I would like you to boost that bunny add some jump to your level.

174
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,560
Don't be afraid to tweak the level so you can take advantage of exciting new opportunities for Bunny.

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,190
And if you want to you can lead and lower the play at a certain point with clusters of coins.

176
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,840
Suppose the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my tweak level with Boost pads.

177
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,770
Try and get at least two in there.

178
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,730
I'm shutting up now.

179
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,510
Pause the video.

180
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,590
See when you get back.

181
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,690
And welcome back.

182
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,920
Okay let's make some fun level stuff.

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,360
I've got one jump had here.

184
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,510
Do I like it here.

185
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,060
I kind of do but I don't want Bunny to hit its head so I'm going to move this type map here.

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,730
Let's get the right ground one to over here.

187
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,370
That looks good right.

188
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,140
Let's get out the tile map.

189
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,110
Let's duplicate this jump pad and I'm sure make sure I'm in mood mood move.

190
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,650
Yes and that way no matter where I press I'm moving the thing I've got selected.

191
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,610
Let's put one here.

192
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,660
This looks like a dramatic spot doesn't it.

193
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,640
That a good place.

194
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,600
That's a great place coins I'm going to select this coin duplicate it and back into move.

195
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,790
I little zigzaggy pattern like that.

196
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
That looks exciting.

197
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,520
And let's tempt the player to do something silly.

198
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,530
Are you going to many coins but you might lose the life you're about to get.

199
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,220
And I feel like one more that looks like a really big high jump doesn't it.

200
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm going to put the end of the level eventually here so if I can lure the player down this way.

201
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,930
As looking pretty good where should I put this junk pad.

202
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,990
Do do do.

203
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,660
Put you right here next to the spikes set to mean.

204
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,280
Yes that is to me.

205
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,880
Let's move this spike.

206
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,720
Move the spike to.

207
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,820
You know what that looks nice and dangerous doesn't it.

208
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,360
What I might do is just tweak it like that.

209
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,430
Or shall I make a bigger thing bigger platform for it.

210
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,270
Oh no that looks good.

211
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,110
I would leave it like that.

212
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,940
Let's test it.

213
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,860
I want to I can do my own level.

214
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,880
Okay honey make me proud.

215
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,780
Here we go.

216
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm the one that annoying when we have a jobs that affect us make that jump all the way.

217
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,320
You almost.

218
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,250
Spike.

219
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,170
You need to move on get a dominant boying.

220
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,390
Very nice.

221
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,820
Put the exit right here.

222
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,610
This be a dramatic finish.

223
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,700
Great Before I forget which Spike was it was this spike.

224
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,060
Spike let's move you into there about one last thing.

225
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,990
I've just realized I made a mistake I made a bug.

226
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,830
No I said I don't like calling things default.

227
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,270
I did just don't know why I didn't like the name so I didn't.

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,630
And then I did look and I made a sprite.

229
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,860
The animation is called Idle.

230
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
There is no default.

231
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,520
That doesn't work and chase that backed up idle and safe.

232
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,160
There we go.

233
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,910
That feels better in this video we have learned about the time and load we've had a jump has to be days

234
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,710
and we've redesigned a level to take advantage of the jump out share your tweak level shows where you've

235
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,110
put your boot pads and how exciting you can make this.

236
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,510
Can you lower your player into dangerous dramatic jumps and drops don't forget you can make them drop

237
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,300
onto a jump pad they can't see.

238
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,780
So sheil level with us on Facebook group on the community forum or discord.

239
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,930
I'd love to see what you guys have come up with.

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,980
And meanwhile great work and I'll see you in the next few.
