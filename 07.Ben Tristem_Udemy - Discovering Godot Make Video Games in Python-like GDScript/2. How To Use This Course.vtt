00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello you wonderful people.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.640
Before we get started with the engine I thought to be a good idea to do a quick video.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.530
How to use this course.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.190
I want to make sure we get the best out of this.

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.350
Each section of the course is going to be a different project a different game.

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.930
So I start with a very simple text based game looney lips very simple word game and then we're gonna

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.690
move up in scale and complexity until the last project to this course which is a 3D shooter with no

8
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.030
guns food fight where we can throw food at robots while there are a whole bunch of 3D stuff is going

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.710
on around us.

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.610
So each project is going to get more complicated.

11
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.230
We'll start with very common foundational principles things like variables printing to console suffixes

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.020
again and again and again and by the end of it we'll talk about things like blending animations in 3D

13
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.950
with animation trees how to deal with physics bugs stuff like that.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.880
There's something else we should talk about which is how to use this course in terms of where to go

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.930
for help and when to look for help well where to go for help is a good place to start.

16
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.240
And the easiest place to start is right here on udemy.

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.830
On each lecture you'll see a little Q and A.

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.030
You can ask questions well maybe you want something a little more immediate or maybe just want to get

19
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.950
to know the community hang out make some friends get some ideas get some feedback on your project stuff

20
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.670
like that.

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.430
For that I would recommend discord.

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.120
I spend a lot of time on our discord.

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.610
We have our own discord server and if you don't know discord is it's a free chat program voice and text

24
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.200
chat.

25
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.370
Ours is almost exclusively text.

26
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.890
Very few people chat so you don't feel like talking to my friend.

27
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.170
Don't worry it's not an expectation.

28
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.490
We make sure that it's very supportive friendly and welcoming community.

29
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.470
And if you look in the resources this lecture which I believe at the time of recording will be in the

30
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.940
top left of your screen there'll be an invite to our discord.

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.580
You can join it.

32
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.330
It's free.

33
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.860
You don't even have to download the program if you want.

34
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.320
You could use the web browser.

35
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.400
You could also if you're a little old school.

36
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.220
Use the game def TV forums.

37
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
I say old school I feel old people parties forums.

38
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800
Ben's been working quite hard to make these up to date.

39
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.620
You go there browse other people's stuff introduce yourself and all kinds of things.

40
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.780
Talking about how to use this course you're going to see a lot of these slides every time you see these

41
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.430
green boarders.

42
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.310
I'm going to set you a challenge now of course you don't have to do the challenge but I do recommend

43
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.750
it.

44
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.760
I recommend that you listen to the instructions and the one to tell you to pause the video.

45
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.650
He pulls it out leave a gap of that four seconds and then you can come back and I'll either wrap it

46
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.570
up or move on.

47
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.020
So my challenge for you is to introduce yourself.

48
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.150
I would suggest dropping by and saying hi in one of the game to have social spaces.

49
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.700
You could go to the Q and A.

50
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.270
If you do.

51
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.450
Do remember to mark your post as answered so reply to yourself in markets.

52
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.090
Answer it.

53
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.050
I am very interested in seeing your welcomes and hellos but if we see 300 unanswered questions and it

54
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.300
turns out that 100 of them are Hi I'm new I'm excited to see everybody which is wonderful.

55
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.150
We might not get to help help I need help.

56
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.650
So do not get his answers if he can go to the game dev community forum.

57
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.450
Go to the disco.

58
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.740
We also have a Facebook page which I will link here.

59
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.590
You can go join our Facebook group and say Hi

60
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.900
and welcome back.

61
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.290
OK before we any further let's talk about the second point on this slide.

62
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.260
When to look for help.

63
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.160
So you do want to try and solve problems yourself.

64
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.040
Right it's a great way of learning but you don't want to punish yourself and not necessary understanding

65
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.940
something or knowing something quite yet.

66
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.370
So what I would recommend is if you get stuck which happens all the time sometimes it's a silly mistake

67
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.780
sometimes it's a fundamental misunderstanding I certainly get stuck lot.

68
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.870
Try solving it first.

69
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.220
Say 5 to 10 minutes if you're not getting anywhere from there.

70
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.920
Reach out Udemy is a great place to look for solutions that people have already found Discord is a great

71
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.890
place for quick answers and forum is a great place for slang for slower more considered answers so I

72
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.480
would suggest give it a shot for a few minutes then either take a break and come back to it or reach

73
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.940
out.

74
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.480
Don't keep hammering your head against the keyboard metaphorically or literally if you could just get

75
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.330
some support.

76
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.680
And with that I think that break is the end of the video.

77
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.360
So in the next video we look at installing gotto on a P.C..
