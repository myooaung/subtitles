1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,030
Hello again, you glory has got people in this video, we're going to finish off the pitch and finish

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,420
off the pitch.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,370
I mean, make it usable for our game.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
We don't have a complete game yet.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,400
There's a lot still to come.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,020
Not that much is quite a simple game.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,320
But still, we have to watch today.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
What do I mean by finishing off the pitch?

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,560
Well, our pitch needs the following.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,790
It needs some goals when put in some goals.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,980
They're not going to track the gameplay yet.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,870
They just can be physical objects that can stop ball.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,440
But when it goes, we also need some boundary walls.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,260
Right now, the ball and the players can fly off the pitch.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,190
That's the problem.

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,140
Now, we could make a system where if the ball goes off the pitch, the game stops, I think, to the

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,390
bolts.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,860
And there's a really small patch.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,060
I like the idea of invisible walls and then we need beautification.

20
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,340
But we're not going to do that now because beautification is Polish, not gameplay.

21
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,320
And you want to put Polish in once the game plays an in place.

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,490
You don't want to sort of make things beautiful, spend a whole bunch of time getting asses just right

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,780
and then decide they're wrong.

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,880
So we're not doing that in this video.

25
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,130
So let's get started with what we are doing.

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,430
And for some nosegay getting into Gotto and I want to goals.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,600
Let's open up our models and go open.

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,360
Gold.

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,530
Gold up d.

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,110
The Claudia file is going to say, well this is automatically import.

31
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,870
You can't save it.

32
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,310
I will press open anyway.

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,330
And here is our goal.

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,320
What we have here is a scene route, which is just a spatial noticeboard import from blender.

35
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,490
And because it's been imported as a chloroform, it has an animation plant.

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,660
I don't care about add two measures.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,710
No collisions.

38
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,680
Okay.

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,130
Now, right now, this is a DEA file.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,120
Like, I make changes, but if I try and save it, I'll say no, can't save as a DEA.

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,220
But what I can do is I can take this goal and save that safe branch is scene.

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,730
And that is gonna go in my models in my goal.

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,970
And I'm gonna call it gold mesh not.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,240
So now I can close this.

45
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:55,940
OK.

46
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,790
So now let's make a brand new scenes, a new scene, and I'm going I have a three scene.

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,280
And right now, there's just a spatial node, which is like a node with 3D transform information.

48
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,260
Very, very basic.

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,350
It's like the No 2D, but it's an old 3D called spatial.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,740
And in this, I'm going to insert that gold mesh.

51
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,710
OK, so here's my go mesh inside this special.

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,730
I'm going to rename that to Goal.

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,880
And you know what?

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,270
Right now I've got an inherited scene in this case.

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,940
I don't actually want it to be an inherited scenes on the right.

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,210
Click on it and I'm going to make it local.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,020
So make local.

58
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,390
And now this is no longer instance.

59
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm going to rename this goal here to Goalpost MASH Space, and I'm rename a net to Net MASH, just

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,650
some very, very AKCA, a glance on saying tree what everything is.

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,720
So right now we have a spatial node that has two measures.

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,100
Let's change what the special node is.

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,510
We're right.

64
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,150
Click on it because I actually want this to be a static body.

65
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,900
So right.

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,760
Click on my static body change type.

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,320
Static body.

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,770
That's nice.

69
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,370
Well, static body.

70
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,440
That's a spill static body.

71
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,030
Okay.

72
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,330
So here we have a static body.

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,000
We have the goalpost mesh and the net mesh.

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,170
There's no collision.

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,050
And at the moment we've got a little warning.

76
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,090
What's the one thing you have to have collision.

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,850
Now, I actually want two static bodies here.

78
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,200
One is a child of the other because I want two different collisions.

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,290
I want the player to be able to go through the net, but not the ball.

80
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:32,830
OK.

81
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,590
So the ball comes in here.

82
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,450
It will stop.

83
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,800
But the playability through that, nothing can get through the actual post Monday through post.

84
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,770
If you hit the mesh of the posts, you can't get through.

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,670
Why are we being so cagey with if you hit the mesh of the posts?

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,570
Well, I'll show you one.

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,550
That's plus press goalpost mesh.

88
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,570
We want to give us a collision.

89
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,540
Now I can make a brand new collision shape, let's say make a box.

90
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,140
But if I do that, the bowl coming here is going to bounce off.

91
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,160
That's no good.

92
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,930
We need to only get the mesh, not just the block to do that.

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm click on Mesh right here and I can generate an automatic mesh.

94
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,870
I have two options.

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,400
I can create a static body.

96
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,490
Well, the goalpost is already a static body, so I want to do that.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,560
Or I can create a collision sibling.

98
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,600
That's a collision layer on the same level of the same tree as the mesh.

99
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,420
And I can create trash or convex.

100
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,890
I don't want to create Convex.

101
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,930
And I'm gonna show you why.

102
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,430
If I create Convex, you'll see here the collision shape is just taking the simplest possible route.

103
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,680
Now, that might look good, but what we actually have is a wall that doesn't work for me.

104
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,550
So we delete this collision shape and I'm going make a tri mesh.

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,630
Now, the down side of the tri mesh is it's often much more complicated.

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,950
You can see here is such a little difficult because these little triangles.

107
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,240
This is quite simple shape.

108
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:58,000
But the more complicated we make this collision shape, the more we risk slowing down our game.

109
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,740
Now, I also want a collision shape on this map show.

110
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,000
On this one, I'm just I click it.

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
And a new static body.

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,080
So try mesh static body.

113
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,940
And you can see right now you actually can't because a too small but the blue lines follow each one

114
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,660
of these points.

115
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,550
That might be a little bit too complex.

116
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,920
But given that we have a quite small game, I think we got away with it.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
Now, before we go any further.

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,610
Well, first, let's save this as a goal.

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,660
Someone put this in level.

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,590
It's a level asset.

121
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,360
We call it gold.

122
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,330
I said earlier, I want the plant to be able to go through the net, but not through the post and the

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,350
Bull Connor through either.

124
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,360
We should really set up some physics lab.

125
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:42,060
Let's do that project project settings and scroll down to lab names, 3D physics.

126
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,450
Here we go.

127
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:42,700
OK.

128
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,770
So low level one is going to play.

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,490
Let's say let's play.

130
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,330
She was going to pitch.

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,420
Level three is gonna be ball unless a level four is net.

132
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,860
And that should work.

133
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,430
Now, I could rename pitch because I'm looking these a boundary walls on that.

134
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,110
But essentially, anything that's going to stop the ball coming through, as I say, that also will

135
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,030
put the goal there.

136
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,280
So why do we call that obstacle?

137
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,320
No, when we call that level.

138
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,800
It's part of the level that's gonna behave as part of the level.

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,540
So that should look good.

140
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,300
Let's take a look at our static body.

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,210
First, we have the goal.

142
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,750
What collision, Les?

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,270
Well, you are not a player.

144
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,130
You are part of the level.

145
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,940
And you can interact with the player, you can interact with the ball.

146
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,270
Great.

147
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,810
I don't need to interact with a level there's no reason for the level to interact with itself.

148
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,670
It's not going to be moving.

149
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,320
It's a static body, on the other hand.

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,680
This static body that is a child of the net mesh.

151
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,020
You on the layer net, you nothing else.

152
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,660
And you do not interact with a player.

153
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,070
You do what's right with the bowl.

154
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,690
And that should look good.

155
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,340
Now, that said, we now have to change the collision left the other things.

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,540
Let's go back to our main level and very quickly go through them.

157
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,770
Some are open play player one and open play a template and quickly take a look at the collision on the

158
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,460
physics body.

159
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,590
You are a player.

160
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,550
You can interact with other players.

161
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,920
So if the two players hit each other, they can't go through each other.

162
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,420
They can't get to the level.

163
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,920
They can't go through the ball.

164
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,660
They can go through the net.

165
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,680
Some say that.

166
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,250
Now, let's play a one just to double check.

167
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,850
Those mosques and labs rule in place.

168
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,330
Let's go back to the level I want to change the pitch on the pitch and very simply.

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,530
You are past the level and you can interact with the player, the level and the ball.

170
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,370
Awesome.

171
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,540
We don't the ball falling through.

172
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,330
OK, so what on the pitch from the players, we've done the goals we have put them in yet.

173
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,360
Let's do the bowls.

174
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,090
Take a look at the bowl openly.

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,660
The original seem to want a change.

176
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,070
All instances of bowl.

177
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,920
And this is a rigid body.

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
Doo doo doo doo doo.

179
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,950
Where's my coalition?

180
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,010
There it is on the physics body.

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,990
You want the ball and you can interact with the player, the level.

182
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,070
There's only one ball.

183
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,270
There's no reason for turn itself.

184
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,400
And the net.

185
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,300
OK.

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,270
So that should be good.

187
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,710
Close the scenes we don't need.

188
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,740
And just to make sure I'm not dancing, very stupid.

189
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,550
I'm going to press play.

190
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,780
I'll just check that.

191
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,400
The ball doesn't get through the pitch.

192
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,180
And the player.

193
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,030
Cargher through the player.

194
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,700
Great.

195
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,470
Let's put some goals in.

196
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,800
So first thing to do is to make a brand new spatial node.

197
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,210
Call this goal.

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,250
Sorry, it's not a spatial.

199
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,480
It's a default mode.

200
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
It has no transport.

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,150
Information leads us to organize.

202
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,970
Just like we did with high surmises.

203
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,240
So within that, I'm an instance in a goal.

204
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,430
And let's make sure my snap is on and it puts it just about here.

205
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,980
And I want to rotate it 90 degrees on negative 90 degrees.

206
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,860
OK.

207
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,210
So we have our green goal that's moving forward.

208
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,910
One, I kind of feel like I should move back.

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,470
These markings aren't entirely precise.

210
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,090
That sketched on on purpose, but I feel like it's going to look at this, right.

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,270
That I'm going to Wieseler back a little bit.

212
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,840
There we go.

213
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,090
Shouldn't have any major impact on gameplay.

214
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,520
OK, so we have a single goal.

215
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm gonna rename this to go one.

216
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,550
This is the green player's go.

217
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:12,750
You know what?

218
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,800
Let's get rid of the grid.

219
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,610
I want to see it.

220
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,510
It's getting in my way.

221
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,950
Let's duplicate gold.

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,040
And I'm going to move you to over here.

223
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,090
La, la, la, la, la.

224
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,170
Turn around.

225
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,950
Dooby dooby doo.

226
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,190
So you face that bright line.

227
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,780
You choose.

228
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,760
I bring you down here.

229
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,590
Turn off my grid.

230
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,070
Snapping.

231
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,510
And just drop down to the line, feel a bit like Bob Ross right now.

232
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,520
OK, so we have two goals.

233
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,900
We have a green go for the green player on a green golf, the blue plate.

234
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,780
That last bit isn't great.

235
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,800
So click on the goal.

236
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,280
And on the right, click on it to editable children.

237
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,110
It's still instant's, but I can change the properties of the children within this scene.

238
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,450
It doesn't change the default properties for everything.

239
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,530
And the simplest to do, it's got a goalpost mesh and go to material.

240
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm going to do the material override.

241
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,530
So brand new spatial material.

242
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,020
I was going to give it a nice blue that kind of matches that plan.

243
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,920
OK, we now have two goals.

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,590
See how they work.

245
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,580
So I want to move the blue player the way first thing kind of bluefly go through the nets.

246
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,280
Yes, he can.

247
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,350
Can the blue play go through the goalpost?

248
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,960
No.

249
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,530
So that works fine.

250
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,820
Secondly, I do.

251
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,650
Can the ball go through the net?

252
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,300
It can go through a little hoop.

253
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,140
It can't go through the net.

254
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,190
It stops right there.

255
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,290
Awesome.

256
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,820
Which means in theory, I could push it out to go once the game play.

257
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,980
She starts what happen?

258
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,640
And we have no wall go off.

259
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,030
Let's put in some boundary walls.

260
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,290
OK.

261
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,260
So we've got our goals to minimize that.

262
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,510
Let's make a brand new basic node, basic node renamed to boundaries.

263
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,640
OK.

264
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,550
Now, right now, this ball is quite liked.

265
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,280
I might make this heavier, in which case there could be a point in which the ball gets stopped here

266
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,410
and the plant can't get behind it to push it out the way.

267
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,180
For now, that's not an issue.

268
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,200
But if it becomes an issue, we're gonna have to put a second layer of boundary walls following the

269
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,560
white.

270
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,100
The only stop the ball.

271
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,810
Nothing else.

272
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,430
We'll also have to make sure it's behind the gold line on the Z axis.

273
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,390
With all that said, let's make a brand new rules.

274
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,130
Can be a static body.

275
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,150
And I'm gonna call this backwell.

276
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,360
And why don't you just line it up with his back wall here?

277
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,400
So let me get Brennan collision land collision shape.

278
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,910
There it is, new shape.

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
It's gonna be a box.

280
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,210
And I can zoom in and see my little box.

281
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,290
Let's play with the extents.

282
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,930
Let's see the X extent.

283
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,190
It's gonna be a point for.

284
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,230
No, that's wrong.

285
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,240
The stealth isn't be point five.

286
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,580
There we go.

287
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,790
The X X stunt is going to be what we think, 12 meters.

288
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,320
Well, that's pretty good.

289
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,550
It's a little off the edge.

290
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,730
We got away with 11 meters, but I'm fine with that on SNAP and just dragging it over to that.

291
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,370
I want to do want to make sure is that actually lines up with the very edge.

292
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,590
Do, do, do.

293
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:03,830
OK.

294
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,580
So let's try it.

295
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,840
ZF point to five.

296
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,960
And yeah, that's pretty good.

297
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,220
Okay, one meter is no good.

298
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,370
There is a reasonable chance that this ball will bounce.

299
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,290
So let's make it taller.

300
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,000
It is a 10 metre tall, which is five metres tall.

301
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,370
And you know what was going to transform?

302
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,700
And on the y axis, let's move it up by five.

303
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,800
And that's all Backwell.

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,230
Okay.

305
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,130
Before we go any further, let's check on collisions.

306
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,540
It is not a player.

307
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,470
It's part of the level.

308
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,120
And just to be double sure, it's OK.

309
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,020
Not play player and the ball.

310
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,930
Now, I've just made a bit of mistake here.

311
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,680
What I did was I moved the collision shape, not the wall.

312
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,610
That's not what I want.

313
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,600
So I don't want to do is just take this five negative eight.

314
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,440
I got here on the back wall going to transform one of that five up and negative eight on the Z, and

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,330
then the collision shape should be at zero zero.

316
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,930
Common mistake.

317
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,540
I want to move the parent node.

318
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
So there we go.

319
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,460
A collision lay as a mass of goodwill backhaul.

320
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,200
Duplicate that and call that frontwoman

321
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,010
and move the duplicate.

322
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,180
Easiest way to move the duplicate.

323
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,470
It's Tana's negative eight into a positive eight because symmetrical around the origin.

324
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,220
Nice and easy.

325
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,190
Let's duplicate front wall and caldas left wall.

326
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,370
And I want to transform this show on the Y y axis, which is the Green Arrow here.

327
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,690
That's my that's my pivot.

328
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,860
90 degrees.

329
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,310
And let's see.

330
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,860
I don't want you to be.

331
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,670
Off Central to Z, so let's put you back at zero.

332
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,530
And what do you say this was 20 to that, right?

333
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,930
No.

334
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,500
12.

335
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,580
22.

336
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,210
How's that?

337
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,150
That's a little bit too far, isn't it?

338
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,540
So let's try 11 right on the line.

339
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,120
I quite like that, but it's not the levels have been negative 11 and adjudicate that.

340
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,220
Make it the right.

341
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,200
And that is going to be my lesson.

342
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,620
You'll notice I've got this overlap here, but these are invisible collision lines that don't interact

343
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,270
with themselves.

344
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,470
They only interact with the player in the bowl.

345
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,400
So I'm fine with that.

346
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:10,880
Let's see.

347
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,270
Outplays.

348
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,450
Some big I couldn't kick the ball, it hits the wall, the player hits the wall, too.

349
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,190
Now you'll notice I can't get right into the corner, right.

350
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,020
This could become a problem later.

351
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,850
Right now, it seems fine.

352
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:34,210
I think it is possible we will get situations with things blocking that wall seems to be high enough.

353
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,320
I think the ball is too late.

354
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,820
It's also possible.

355
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,450
If we had made it to the play, it could hit this net for the weather.

356
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,990
It would be possible for the player to go up.

357
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,060
But because kinematic body has no gravity.

358
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,930
It would be stuck there.

359
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,510
However, because playing the through the net, that's not an issue.

360
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,320
If it had happened, if you decide to play, couldn't go through the net and your game.

361
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,100
That's fine.

362
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,480
You just need to put in a gravity script for your play.

363
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,000
So it needs to be pulled down by the Y.

364
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,890
If it's not on the ground, that is looking pretty good, isn't it?

365
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,380
So there's my ball and you're trapped in the corner.

366
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,290
You know what that is getting trapped in the corner, isn't it?

367
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,630
So, yeah, let's do that now.

368
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,970
Let's make a second load of boundary walls.

369
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,540
While I'm doing him a backwell, duplicate it.

370
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,980
And on this duplicate or change the collision.

371
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,590
This doesn't stop the player.

372
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,820
It only stops the ball.

373
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,900
It goes.

374
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,110
Right here.

375
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,490
So is it on the white line?

376
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,800
I think that she is.

377
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, look at that.

378
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,020
OK.

379
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,370
So that is minus six.

380
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,160
So I'm going to duplicate from all.

381
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,690
That's six now.

382
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,280
I need to be a bit careful on the sidewalls here, because I do need the bull to cross over the gold.

383
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,140
So let's take lawful duplicate that.

384
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,430
And I'm just gonna move this over once.

385
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,380
So the ball can still cross there.

386
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,380
And let's do the same thing on the right will.

387
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,500
Move it.

388
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,880
One unit.

389
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,730
I got Chris, nothing else.

390
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,320
It's nice and easy.

391
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,490
And before I forget, let's actually make sure they've got those collisions on all the walls.

392
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,390
I don't, do I?

393
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,450
OK, so let's take wall two on all those got a collision and just make sure that it stopped the player.

394
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,790
OK.

395
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,890
Let's test how that goes.

396
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,820
Boo boo boo.

397
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,600
OK, first off, the player can cross this line.

398
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,850
The ball cannot suck.

399
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,280
I shouldn't have been a situation where the ball can't get stuck in a corner, including the corner

400
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,110
than that, because I can always come around this way.

401
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,750
Now, of course, the other player can get in the way and stop me from doing that.

402
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,790
It's actually quite awful to control by myself.

403
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,800
There we go.

404
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,010
Let it go.

405
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,290
Now, can the ball go in there?

406
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,070
Can a ball.

407
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,690
Can you go in there?

408
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,210
No.

409
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,540
OK.

410
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,660
So fun failing to do it.

411
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,230
Just make sure that the left the right walls are not quite so far across.

412
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,420
So it's got a left wall.

413
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,330
Look at the transform.

414
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,760
It's of minus 10.

415
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,510
Let's say unity at minus eleven.

416
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,170
Let's double check.

417
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,650
No man's land doesn't work.

418
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,770
So let's put you up minus ten point five.

419
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,460
That should do it.

420
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,780
And right will, too.

421
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,580
You should get to ten point five.

422
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,770
So one more time.

423
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,680
Can you get me the blue planet the way.

424
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,110
Yes, it can just cross the line.

425
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,550
Now, the moment does cross the line.

426
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,130
We're going to stop the game anyway, but that feels a lot better.

427
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,610
So what we have here is a nice closed-in pitch with physics lads working girls working and plays it.

428
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,410
Don't turn around yet.

429
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,250
We'll fix that soon.

430
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
But we don't get the vote stuck.

431
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,610
And that feels like a really good place to end this video.

432
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,170
So excellent work and I shall see you in the next one.
