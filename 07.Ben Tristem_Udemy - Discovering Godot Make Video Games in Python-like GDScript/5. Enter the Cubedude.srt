1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,180
Hello again, you amazing got people.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,650
Let's create the cube do let's put a player into our game.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,580
So we go right into it because last video was very talky.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,200
And let's start by taking a look at the acid against my models of a cube dude and open cube.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,900
You got the eight.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,340
Now, we have three choices here right now because Cube do Doda is an imported file.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,830
It's not gonna let us modify it.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,830
The reason for this is gonna.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,760
Doesn't actually save D.A. files.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,750
It can open them.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,070
It doesn't save them.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,490
So any changes I make here won't be saved.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,720
Now I can make a new inherited scene.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,770
If I do that, it'll take this scene route.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,900
And it's basically imported all the information as a brand new CNN, which has the armature, the skeleton,

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,840
the mesh and the animation player.

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,500
The other way I could do this is just say we'll open it anyway and don't worry about it.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:00,920
Right.

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,050
In either case, we now have this player here.

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,300
And if I make any changes to him.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,670
So I want to rename it.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,310
I can't save it.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,150
So when I close it.

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,670
And come back.

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,210
It hasn't changed.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,100
So we need a way around that.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,320
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take Cube DDA open him and I must say open anyway.

28
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,010
Let's take a look at our scene.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,670
We've got the seam route we've imported from Blender.

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,460
And by default, that's what it's gonna do.

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:33,710
Right.

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,690
It's gonna have the special nut.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,860
Then we've got the player itself, which is called Armature, because the way the plate that blender

34
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,460
makes Rick skeleton's and that's a spatial node.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,160
Then we have the skeleton.

36
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,170
The skeleton has a number of bones in it.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,760
So let's zoom right in here and say Bone five is called hips and it's the hip bone.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,130
Right.

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,980
And then it's got the mesh in because it was created as a rigged animation in Blender specifically for

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,990
using in games.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,070
It's set up to work.

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,700
It knows the skeleton is its parents set up, ready to go.

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,770
So what I can do is I can save Branch as seen Halo folks.

44
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,110
Yeah.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,500
From the future here from about three videos time.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,720
So later on in this cause I realize I've made a silly mistake here.

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,290
When I told you ignore this coalition shake that's coming on a future video.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,080
When I told you that we can.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,320
Right.

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
Click on the armature and do safe branches scene.

51
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,030
I was absolutely correct.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,870
We can do that.

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,730
But I forgot about the animation player.

54
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,100
And the animation player is a child of the scene root here renamed as play a template.

55
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,660
Again, this is all from a late point, of course.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,940
So instead of right.

57
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,020
Clicking here and saying Save Branch seen, what I would do is the following models.

58
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,550
I'm going to go to Cube, dude.

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,270
I'm not going to keep the DEA, ODAC and open anyway.

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,250
I'm at 16 route and I'm going to go save scene as and then put that in my plans folder.

61
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,730
If you do that, we can then continue where we're going.

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,380
But instead of making the armature the kinematic body, which is coming a little bit, we'll make the

63
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,910
singer to cinematic bodies, which is right.

64
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,420
Click on it.

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,660
And he change time and there's a kinematic body and everything from there will work fine if you don't

66
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,090
do that.

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,540
There's going to be a lot of bug fixing training at the animation to work.

68
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,910
So just a bit of future proofing safe branch has seen is not the correct Kahir because I forgot about

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,600
the animation plan.

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,200
Make sure you save scene as a TSA n in your players folder and let's make a brand new folder.

71
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,280
And I'm going to call this place and I'm gonna call this play a template.

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,800
Dot, TSC.

73
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:38,880
Great.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,010
So I'm now going to open that scene and close cube dude.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,450
OK.

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,910
So his play a template.

77
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,940
Let's rename this too.

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,310
Play a template.

79
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,600
OK.

80
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,120
So right now it's like to play a template.

81
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,110
But I can't use it.

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,100
Right.

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,520
Click on it.

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,310
Change type allowed a kinematic body.

85
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,320
Why kinematic body.

86
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,030
The players can have direct control over it and it's going to generate force rather than being moved

87
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,170
by having force supply to it.

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,550
OK, so here we go.

89
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,020
We have a play with kinematic body.

90
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,180
We have an issue though, don't we?

91
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,250
We have a node configuration warning.

92
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,600
There's no collision shape.

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,030
You can't use it of anybody who doesn't have collision.

94
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,230
That's finally gonna get a collision.

95
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,290
Collision shape is in 3D.

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,070
It's in red.

97
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,760
Perfect traditional shape we can use.

98
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,020
Now, we have a couple options here.

99
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,380
If we're making a very, very high precision game, we would want collision that perfectly follows all

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,900
of these joints.

101
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,800
But I don't want that.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,710
So I wanna make a new capsule.

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,240
We're going to transform.

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,730
I want to rotate it all.

105
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,500
I think the x axis by 90 degrees.

106
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,590
Great.

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,470
And let's just fit that, so come down here and the radius is point five, I guess.

108
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,420
Look at that.

109
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,300
And it needs to be a little bit higher, doesn't it?

110
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,290
I was going to drag it up on the Y.

111
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,680
And what I want is for the floor to be right here.

112
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,020
Okay.

113
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,180
Now, why am I using capsule shape?

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,030
It's often used for simplicity.

115
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,330
Right.

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,310
It's very easy for golf to render this collision shape.

117
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,830
It's not that much taller, Trina, but more importantly, it's going to make the game a lot more fun

118
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,810
because the ball is going to have a much more erratic journey when it's being kicked.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,910
If this was a box, for example, coming from the front would mean we could always predict the angle.

120
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,020
But I want that chaos in this game.

121
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,510
I want the players to be running after the ball and trying and getting in there.

122
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,810
It's going to make it feel a lot more skillful when you score a goal.

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,580
So that is my collision shape.

124
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,720
They will look at.

125
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,270
We don't actually have a material coming here.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,530
Right?

127
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,860
We're supposed to, but we don't.

128
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's take a look at the mission since I click on the mesh.

129
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,610
The surface one, we have this blank material cube dude material.

130
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,700
Now we also have these two other materials that are made for now, Malicki.

131
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,550
This is blank, but we could do is we could just drag in Q2, for example.

132
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,280
We can we can click on it, that albedo, and then drag it in as it happens.

133
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,100
I want the template to not have this so that if I see this, I know that we're dealing with the template

134
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,060
that is looking pretty good.

135
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

136
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,620
With that done, let's actually use this template to make a ones.

137
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,660
So I make a new inherited scene and it's going to herit from play a template.

138
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,870
I want to call this player Green.

139
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,510
Oh, she'll give them numbers.

140
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,870
Let's get another play out, one much better save you in players.

141
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,840
Fantastic.

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,370
And player one is just like that, except it hasn't new material.

143
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,990
So here's why I will be careful of if I change this material.

144
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,480
Right.

145
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,730
So let's say I wake you read and I got to play a template that's changed to.

146
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,860
Why?

147
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,980
Because I have changed this material.

148
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,970
Everything that uses this material is going to change, too.

149
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,950
So instead I'm easy material overwrite.

150
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,740
I we're back to the top and click on this material.

151
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,860
Not a shot of the mesh.

152
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,420
And let's make a brand new special material in here.

153
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,830
Click on that good albedo and bring in my cue.

154
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,730
Did I say and go back to the play template.

155
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,750
The play template does not have this material override.

156
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,090
Right.

157
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,300
I'm doing it this way because if I try and change this base material, even if I use make unique, it

158
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,170
sometimes doesn't work.

159
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,380
Right.

160
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,190
It can be a little fiddly.

161
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,640
So using material override is great when you're going over templates.

162
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,730
So as I play one, it'll will save us like a brand new player.

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:24,930
So.

164
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,540
And you inherit it.

165
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,460
Scene inheriting four plant template.

166
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,390
Same thing.

167
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,110
So play a two.

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,290
And I plan to.

169
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,880
Is going to go here.

170
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,260
And it's got a material override, which is you dude blue.

171
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,550
The newspaper material, excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
