1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,150
Welcome back glorious gotto people in this video.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,410
We're going to start using the engine and get to grips with it by making gotto say hello world.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,220
This is traditional right.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,450
Every time you start a new programming language the first thing you try and do is you make it say hello

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,060
world.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,060
So we get gonna say hello to got to do that.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,110
We're going to have to figure out how to start a new project and how to make it say hello world.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,400
Nice and simple.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,820
So here's my desktop and I'm going to open got a three point one.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,040
You'll notice I'm currently using beta released 2 or beta released 2 depending on your accent.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,970
That's because at the time of recording go to the three point one isn't officially released yet but

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm not expect any major changes.

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,690
And if there are I can rerecord the video.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,140
So a double click on it.

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,510
I'm going to get this error message.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,850
You don't currently have any projects would you like to explore the official example projects in the

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,860
asset library.

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,920
I wouldn't say in a press cancel now.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,860
The reason why I've got a blank screen is I download this directly from the got a Web site.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,080
Right.

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,250
If you don't have this blank screen if you have a bunch of projects in this area there are two possible

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,320
reasons one you've use got before in which case you're probably not surprised that you see things here

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,780
the others you downloaded it from Steam because Steam will give you a bunch of example templates and

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,150
you could see a lot of them here.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,900
Now look the templates I can see tutorials examples projects you can build on and some of them are very

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,200
cool.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,290
However I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna make a new project.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,930
Also if English is not your first language pick your language.

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm going to stick with English because it's my preferred language it's the one I'm best that I want

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,450
to click new project.

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,630
OK.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,940
Now you'll probably see that some of stuff in the background is change.

33
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,640
That's because I've gone and rerecorded this Hello this is Yan from the future.

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,010
The reason is the screen for a new project has actually changed since I recorded this because I recorded

35
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:52,070
it originally in beta when I life so it was a new project and I want to get this window so to do it

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,480
on the site.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,710
Hello.

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,220
Gordo is the name of my new project and you'll see here.

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,580
It's not gonna let me create anything and it's got a project file.

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,050
I'm going to document dot repos I'll show you how to change your default project file and if I want

41
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,730
this to work I need an empty folders own dos create folder and you'll see this now goes green.

42
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,210
We've created the right folder.

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,850
What Renfrew do we want.

44
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,670
You can read the descriptions here.

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,380
In this particular case it doesn't really matter if you're using an old machine or small machine or

46
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,300
you want to do something the web use open AGL yes to I won't be doing open yet.

47
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,050
Yes three.

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,640
So I'm going to create my project

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,460
and here it is and I'll now leave you in the capable hands of me from the past.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,740
All right.

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,860
So if you use a previous version of gotto you'll notice that the layout is slightly different.

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,310
Not massively but slightly if you haven't.

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,380
This is all new to you.

54
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,560
So I'm just gonna switch to this snapshot mode at Windows 10 has a snip and sketch it's called which

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,820
is strange right.

56
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,450
And also to highlight these various errors over here we have a scene treat

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,250
over here we have the file system

58
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,330
and this over here is the inspector

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,110
OK.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,710
The scenery is where we're going to develop all of the nodes in our scenes and we're going to explore

61
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,190
that means a few videos.

62
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,400
The key concept here is the node is like a building block right each node can do a specific thing.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,310
So a node might be a sprite.

64
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,480
It might be an animation player.

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,230
It might be an audio player.

66
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,170
It might be a timer.

67
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,470
So if I need a timer on my game I'll put a timer node into the scene seen as a little bit more abstract

68
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,410
for now we could just take the more literal idea of a scene can imagine a scene as a single room a single

69
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,140
place.

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,440
Actually the way the got to handle things is a lot more clever than that almost anything can be a scene.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,210
But we'll explore that when it becomes necessary the file system is all the files are in this project

72
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,940
you see here we've got reds reds stands for resource.

73
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,280
This is the folder that we've created for this project.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,490
OK.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,390
So in this case it's.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,810
Hello.

77
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,490
Got her.

78
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,430
And before we go any further if you want to change the layout or you need to do is click these three

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,140
dots and change your dock positions.

80
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,520
We'll put this here.

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,600
I won't put this here and it's all changed from my import tab over there if I don't like it I can get

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,810
to Ed. Ed layout and default and it'll put it back.

83
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,120
Now I did say that there is a way you can change way your default repository folder is to get back to

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,230
the editor's settings and all of these settings that will change every time you run the engine.

85
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,210
These are not bound by project.

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,300
So I can go to directories and here's my default project path.

87
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,220
I've got it to D.

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,780
Which is my harddrive documents repos while we here.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,780
You can also go to theme and change the colors.

90
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,830
We have a bunch of presets I'm going to using default.

91
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,700
You could use alien which is nice and dark with green highlights.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,690
Very spooky.

93
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,870
Maybe you want a light theme has a nice light thing or you can create your on one the base color is

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,780
going to be this lovely public color.

95
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,470
And the accent color is going to be bright red.

96
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:16,080
That is completely unusable so I'm just going to reset my theme and put it back to default

97
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,290
right.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,890
I would recommend you keep the default theme just because going to easy to follow along if my screen

99
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,530
looks like yours.

100
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,200
However if you want to change it change it it's your go.

101
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,320
You should do whatever you want with it.

102
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,340
OK.

103
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,460
That was our Quick whistle stop tour.

104
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's take a look over here in the scenery.

105
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,670
The weather got to work is that every scene is built up of nodes.

106
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,990
And there is always a root node and a root node can have a bunch of child nodes.

107
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,280
God I gonna ask us to make the decision of what I'll root note notice if we wanted to do a scene we

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,850
should pick this one a 3D scene.

109
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,890
Is this user interface or do you want something else.

110
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,980
If I press custom node here is a list of all the nodes and gotta add we can expand these.

111
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,950
So the no 2D has all of these and joint 2D have all of these and we can keep going.

112
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,080
We don't need to worry too much about what these all are.

113
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:16,460
But what is interesting is the way that they inherit every node automatically has access to all of the

114
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,680
properties that its parent node have.

115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,880
For example no 2D is a 2D game object.

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,420
The parent of all 2D related nodes it has position rotation scale and z index.

117
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,940
What that means is if I click on any one of these I say like 2D it will have access to z position scale

118
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,030
rotation and z index.

119
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,290
No 2D has access to all the node properties and this is the simplest thing we can have.

120
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,830
This is the base class.

121
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:51,890
So what I'm to do is I'm gonna create a basic node and over here see the properties of note and it has

122
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,080
access to polls which are not going to worry about for a few games and it can hold a script that's all

123
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,840
a basic node can do.

124
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,390
What if I don't want this on the close this scene.

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,650
Don't say that I make a new one.

126
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:10,040
If I make it a classic 2D scene it has all the properties of node and it has all the properties of canvas

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,200
item and it has its own properties.

128
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,830
Okay so anything that's anything that can be accessed by canvas item for example visibility can be accessed

129
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,690
by no 2D and all of no 2D children.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:21,940
All right.

131
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:29,060
So let's get rid of the scene and I'm gonna make a brand new node and I'm gonna call this hello world

132
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,580
the convention here is that nodes should have a capital letter for each word but no spaces.

133
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:34,840
Okay.

134
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,180
This is just the the guidelines within the style document okay.

135
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,350
So right now I want hello world.

136
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,370
And if I click on output here I'm sure of clear it.

137
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,760
This is where any error messages or printouts are going to happen.

138
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,170
This isn't all the places.

139
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,730
This is what we can see so we can use a print command to print things out at various points in the code.

140
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,030
That's a really useful tool when we're debugging to try and find errors.

141
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,120
We'll just try to make sure that something is working as we expect.

142
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,450
So it's click on Hello World and click on this attach new or existing script buttons as a little scroll

143
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,270
with a green plus on it and click that.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,540
And here we have our script thing we can change language.

145
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm not currently using the mono build that's the C sharp build I've got.

146
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,760
So I don't have C sharp in here.

147
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,490
I'm not going to use native script.

148
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm not going to use visual script which is the visual scripting language mostly because I don't personally

149
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,280
find it that useful.

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,090
But if you want to do that's how you access it needs G.D. script it inherits.

151
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,810
Note This is a basic node and we don't need a template for it so we'll leave it as default.

152
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,420
I can also have an empty template.

153
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,420
No comments will look at that later.

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,200
Everything else is going to save as is and press create.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,840
And here is our script which is in the script tab.

156
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,540
Okay.

157
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,850
We looked at a file system.

158
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,790
Our new script has just appeared Hallowell stopped G.D. if we look at hello world it now has a script

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,990
I can we can click that to get to the script and within the script time we can see all the scripts we

160
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,170
have opened.

161
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,490
We can also press this little button here.

162
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,740
This is distraction free mode of a press this.

163
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,250
We get rid of the other things we don't need.

164
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,520
I can't see the inspector I can't see the same tree.

165
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,240
I can't see the file system.

166
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,970
I could just see the script and let's take a very quick look at what we've got here.

167
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,960
The first line is important extends and then a note type extends node.

168
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,580
That means this script is supposed to work on a node as in the type of node called Node.

169
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,360
If I type node 2 D it could only welcome to Node 2 d it wouldn't.

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,650
It will not work on this because this is not a Node 2 D.

171
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,090
This is a node so I want to put it back somewhat extends is a keyword.

172
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,220
Key words are in red.

173
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,140
What does extends mean it means take all the basic functionality that's inside a node which is pulls

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,900
a script and extend the following behavior.

175
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,750
Anything with this little symbol here which in England is called hash in America is called pound and

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,900
I done what's called in other countries is a comment.

177
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,370
Gordo is going to ignore everything on this line after the hash sign.

178
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,690
So declare member variables here.

179
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,950
Examples variable a equals to verb equals text gotto isn't going to to look at that.

180
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,730
If on the other hand I get rid of it it changes color.

181
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,410
That means Gordo is reading it.

182
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't want these comments I'm going to delete them and instead we left with a single code block a

183
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,420
single code block being a single chunk of code that does a thing.

184
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,730
Code blocks and got our declared him functions.

185
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,300
That's what this func keyword is.

186
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:46,890
Right so every function has to have its own function code block and underscore already is a built in

187
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,360
function.

188
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,870
What it does is it runs the script the moment the node has been created in game so once the node has

189
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,630
been created in the same tree you've put it in.

190
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,210
Now run this script.

191
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,630
There are other things we can do to run it.

192
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,470
Before you finished creating this node the moment you enter the scene Run this script.

193
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,710
Don't worry if you've created the node yet we're not gonna worry about their functions in gotto have

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,430
to have these brackets here.

195
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,090
And that's because some of them have an argument that comes in.

196
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:22,460
So I might bring in a variable called name or player.

197
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,540
This one doesn't need that so I'm not gonna put it in finally.

198
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,770
Let's take a look at what this function is doing.

199
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,890
Function ready pass what is passed do it.

200
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,630
It says Don't do this function.

201
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,810
Ignore this function.

202
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,400
So what we have here is a script that does nothing.

203
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,340
And if I press play first it'll say you've never saved it.

204
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,070
Do you want to say that.

205
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,880
I'll say yes save it as Hello World and here's my go a game and nothing is happening.

206
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,390
Which actually is fantastic cause I sort of told it to do I told it to do nothing.

207
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,090
But nothing isn't a very useful test.

208
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,590
We won't say hello world did you that would replace pass with print.

209
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,780
Print is a function so it's going to take these brackets.

210
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,790
Now if I hold control and click on print the documentation is going to come up for that argument.

211
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,720
Print dot dot dot dot dot and the dots are Varg.

212
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,110
Var ARG is not all cash it's variable arguments.

213
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,520
It means you can put as many arguments as you want to in here and I'm going to close this.

214
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,470
I could right click on it and do close or I could use this shortcut on windows this control to be so

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,830
close that you see this little star here.

216
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,820
That means this script hasn't been saved the moment I press play.

217
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,090
Well this is the second time in first place that says you haven't selected the main scene so we just

218
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,920
press select.

219
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,380
Do I have a world scene.

220
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,240
There it is OK.

221
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,480
Nothing has printed here.

222
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,410
What if I want only to print.

223
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:55,200
Well I mean put some a string in here a string is a series of letters and numbers and spaces and anything

224
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,190
within these quotes.

225
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,530
It doesn't matter what I write gotto isn't going to interpret them it's just going to treat them as

226
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
a variable.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,450
So I could say hello world.

228
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,060
And now when I press play hello world is printed in the output.

229
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,840
Now you'll notice it's not displayed in game.

230
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,090
Right.

231
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,480
This is the game section.

232
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,230
It's not showing the play anything because that's not what print does print puts things in the output.

233
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,840
OK I mentioned the word variables into some of you.

234
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,420
This is a pretty simple topic to some of you.

235
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,250
This is new information.

236
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,620
So let's take a moment and we'll get the same page.

237
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,310
Variables like functions are a key concept in programming.

238
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,050
They actually come from algebra.

239
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,770
And Ben once described variables to me as an empty box.

240
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,390
So here is of variable

241
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,220
and this empty box can have anything in it.

242
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,840
Now Gordo doesn't really care what's inside the box.

243
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,310
God who cares about the variable which means we can change what's inside when we need to.

244
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,820
That's why it's a variable and not a constant a constant

245
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,520
is like a variable.

246
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,640
It's called const but we're not allowed to change it once the program starts running.

247
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:10,890
Okay.

248
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,690
So we're a of change between runs but within the at runtime when the game is running we're not allowed

249
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,620
to go in here variable on the other hand this contents can change at runtime so we can change it during

250
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,250
game play when I press a button maybe the speed or change something like that and a variable is going

251
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,110
to have a name.

252
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,910
So Nicole this word and we could put anything in here and there are basic types of variables as a string

253
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,250
that you don't want to change color for this let's go with a nice well what do we have a nice deep red

254
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,680
a string variable we could also have an integer a float

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,600
a boolean there's a couple of others we can have as well.

256
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,890
Colors for example.

257
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,180
These are the most common ones.

258
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Let's define what these are.

259
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,830
A string is is if you imagine one of those celebratory flag strings right.

260
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,060
So we have a string and a bunch of letters on them and each of these characters fits on that string

261
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:26,140
so this string is a collection of numbers letters punctuation and spaces for the most part.

262
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,580
Gordo doesn't care what's inside the string.

263
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,530
They're all ways you can make it care.

264
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm going to do that little bit an integer is a whole number five is an integer a float is a number

265
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,510
with a decimal point point 5.2 five is a float not an integer.

266
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,460
Boolean is a true or false value which is incredibly useful in programming essentially.

267
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,090
Variable is something we can change.

268
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,900
It's a box.

269
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,660
Here is a box called word.

270
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,110
Take a look what's inside.

271
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,820
Now if you're used to a static programming language something like C sharp C++ any of the sea based

272
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,730
languages in fact then you'll use the idea that variables have to be defined by type.

273
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,250
These are called typed languages.

274
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,480
Right so I have to say this variable is a string called this

275
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,370
by default gotto doesn't do this new in three point one.

276
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:31,770
It can get me to find that Gordo or G.D. scripts to me to be more accurate G.D. script is a dynamic

277
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,390
language dynamic language also known as

278
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,390
duck typing.

279
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,890
If it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and it sounds like a duck it's a duck that's what duck

280
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,940
typing means.

281
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,170
In other words this word variable could be anything we like it could be a string an integer a float

282
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:03,770
or Boolean if I say there is a variable called word and I tell you it's five.

283
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,530
God I will say fine that's an integer if I say it's five point two five it'll say okay it's not an integer

284
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,190
now it's a float.

285
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:17,740
If I put it in a string it'll say Okay now it's a string dynamic languages don't care what type of a

286
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,670
variable you are a typed language will say we you told me that this is a string that's fine but if I

287
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,010
get rid of the quotation marks it'll just say nope that's not a string that's a float you can't have

288
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,760
this.

289
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,740
There are advantages to using type languages.

290
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,540
I personally prefer dynamic typing but it can slow the program down new and three point one.

291
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,230
We can now have typed G.D. script that allows us to define the types of variables in our script so we

292
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,550
can use the advantages of typed but not go into C sharp.

293
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,510
For the moment I a stick with dynamic because it's a lot easier to learn.

294
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,930
Personally I prefer it but there are very good arguments why not.

295
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,700
So we'll look at those little later.

296
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,040
So with all that said let's put a variable in.

297
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,510
I don't put my variable here use the variable keyword var and now it says well you if told me this Val

298
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,910
but you haven't told me anything.

299
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,700
OK so let's say word if you know what I'm not saying a word and as a greeting.

300
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
So now I have a variable greeting.

301
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,670
I'm not using it to define it.

302
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,000
I mean whose equals.

303
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,320
And it's gonna be equals.

304
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,990
String Hello.

305
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:23,900
OK.

306
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,880
So how would I use that.

307
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,510
I wanted to do it and get rid of everything in print and I'm using use a print the greeting.

308
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,300
No that's not the word greeting.

309
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,470
There we go.

310
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,590
When I press play it's now printing greeting and greeting isn't in quotes.

311
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,370
It's looking for a variable called greeting which is learned here is Hello.

312
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,860
If I wanted to say hello world but I don't wanna specify the word hello.

313
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,050
He's a variable I'm going to do this plus

314
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,170
world I'm adding a string that isn't a variable.

315
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,690
You notice up a space here.

316
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,770
That's because this string doesn't have a space.

317
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,670
I could also do that and it would work just fine.

318
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,310
So now when I first play hello world.

319
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,270
Nice.

320
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,110
So what we have here are operators.

321
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:19,320
We have an equal and a plus equals is interesting equals sets of value.

322
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,300
It doesn't check a value now in common mathematics equals means is the same as.

323
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,850
Right so if I say greeting is the same as Hello.

324
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,920
That's fine.

325
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,040
But what if I want to say check if the greeting is the same as hello.

326
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,740
Well if I put a single equal I'm going to set greeting to Hello.

327
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,360
If I want to check a value I need equals equals double equals his check.

328
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,470
And right now it's saying you can't do that you can't tell me there's a variable and tell me is it the

329
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:51,510
same as this double equals is check single equals is set this plus here will contaminate these two things

330
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,340
together because they are strings you can't add strings like you can numbers.

331
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:03,630
So I could do five plus two and print that and it'll press seven print seven but if I do five as a string

332
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,380
plus two it won't let me.

333
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,180
Why.

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,250
Because you can't add a number to a word if I want five and then put.

335
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,500
And what in here.

336
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,610
Let me show how do that.

337
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,230
In fact let's define a variable called number and I'm going to call this to write.

338
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,640
This is an integer in number I would say five plus number.

339
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,400
Try and do this won't work.

340
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:27,860
Why.

341
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,720
Because I don't know how to add a word in a number.

342
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,520
What I can do is turn this into a number.

343
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:40,670
I'm going to cast it to be a string as TR means cast as string.

344
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,450
And now when I press play the numbers 52.

345
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,780
OK.

346
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,540
So we can tell gotto take this variable and translate it into another things I can turn an integer into

347
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,450
a float a float into a string and so on.

348
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,180
Which brings me to the challenge of this video.

349
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,410
I would like you to change the code.

350
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,680
We're going to print out the words.

351
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,400
What are we waiting for Godot in the console.

352
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,290
And I'd like you to use at least one variable you could use more than one but try and use at least one.

353
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,110
So when you see this slide remember this is a challenge.

354
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:20,280
So pause the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

355
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,240
Welcome back.

356
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,090
OK.

357
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:28,180
So let's get rid of these completely and this completely.

358
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,430
So the first thing to do is defined my variable here.

359
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:39,140
So I must say people and let's go to a string called we a space at the end and under Corliss engine

360
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:48,480
actually I'm not going to call this thing and this is gonna be called gotto and I want to type in a

361
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,870
string.

362
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:57,940
What are space close the string then add in people and add in a new string.

363
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:09,850
Then I'm going to add my thing variable and I'm a plus space between the operator and the string or

364
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,550
the operator and the variable because it makes it easier to read legibility and code is key.

365
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:24,930
Gotto will understand who's got to understand this but I as a reader might find that difficult.

366
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,460
One of the most important skills we can develop when coding is making code that's easy for people to

367
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,690
read.

368
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,630
When you come back to your code in six months or if someone else picks up your code they should look

369
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,670
at it and follow what it does.

370
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,600
So now if I press play what are we waiting for.

371
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,830
God oh look at that we've done it.

372
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:46,980
And that brings the end video in this video we've covered a lot of key concepts how to start a project

373
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,890
where things are in the editor how to start a script how to print on the console basic introduction

374
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,300
to variables and we'll go into a lot more depth here and how to set your preferences.

375
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,370
Don't worry if a lot of this has flown Bost as we get used to the engine in the next few videos this

376
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,790
is going to become second nature.

377
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,700
The first time you come up against the cost of the variables it can be quite confusing.

378
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,980
But I think we're off to an excellent start.

379
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,980
I think we're now ready to start our first real game which is going to be loony lips a word game.

380
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,040
So excellent luck and I'll see you in the next section.
