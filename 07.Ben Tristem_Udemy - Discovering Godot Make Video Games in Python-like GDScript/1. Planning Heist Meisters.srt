1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,780
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,600
Delightful God.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,890
People in this video we're going to plan a heist meissner's which our top down to the stealth game.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,100
We're really excited about this game it's got a lot of really cool features.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,470
And what can I gain on a make.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,290
Well as you might remember I like to start with the essential experience.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,500
For me this means let's start with the play a feeling and build the game from that.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:32,270
I see the game as that play a feeling so let's create the the best crafted player experience we can.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,960
I see it as us being an expert thief who sneaks through dark and dangerous locations to steal valuables

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,900
and going out and detected key words expert thief dark and dangerous get out undetected.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,470
So if we look at a bicycle chart that's what we have.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,650
What kind of gameplay mechanics we're talking about.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,230
Well this is a top down game but it's a stealth game.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,400
And key in stealth games is that the player has to have more information than they would in real life.

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,140
If you want to feel like an incredible cat burglar or jewel thief or spy in a video game it's key that

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,940
you understand things like guards line of sight.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,710
What's the other side of this wall.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,410
How much danger will be in here.

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,340
I want the player to make tactical decisions.

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,550
I want to say that the player can be seen briefly.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,160
I can see run past the guard I can sprint.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,260
So there's going to be a concept of detection and the maximum detection threshold.

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,250
If you get beyond that the game is over.

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,970
It's going to rise pretty fast and fall gently over time.

25
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,880
So the guard of the camera might see a glimpse in the corner of the eye oh it's probably nothing.

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,660
And this is going to be very dark going.

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,560
The only lights that can be visible are going to be what the guards and cameras can see.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,940
So the play is going to be able to switch from normal vision to night vision.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,000
But there's going to be a penalty for that if you're in night vision mode You're not have access to

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,140
key information.

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,450
And if your normal vision there's other information you have.

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,720
So when to switch views is going to be a critical element of this game.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,490
So if I go into sketching mode like this here is our top down player who's got one big began the other

34
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,130
and is bald it's basically Agent 47 but it's not age of 47.

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,440
So it's a bald head and he's got shoulder pads.

36
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,180
And here is a guard who is grumpy.

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,440
Why's he grumpy.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,380
It is terrible haircut.

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,610
I don't know why the Guard is going to be able to see in a cup and that Khan is going to be made of

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,140
light.

41
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,480
Right so we're going to have to see where that is.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,080
This is essentially the guard's torch or flashlight depending on what poll arguing.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,460
There's also going to be other guards which are cameras.

44
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,500
Cameras can't move but they rotate left and right and they're going to have that same come.

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,760
So we're going to be using this concept of inheritance with inherits scenes they're going to get behaviour

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,410
from classes above them.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,780
All three of these are going to be part of the character class as can be a character class.

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,620
Then this can be in pieces.

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,020
Player.

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,170
And NBC will further break down as soldiers and cameras.

51
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,510
We could keep adding up things right if you want and guard dogs anything like that.

52
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,980
That's how you would do that.

53
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,180
There is behaviour that is true for all characters and will inherit down.

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
So let's keep going.

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,500
Another thing I want is some sort of gameplay flow.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,080
So far all our games have been one level games.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,500
I'd like to extend that so we're going to have a splash screen.

58
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,840
That's the introduction screen with various options are a tutorial.

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,570
We need a tutorial level for this because it can be quite difficult game level so a start game.

60
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,870
And acquit.

61
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,250
Which is just taking out of them entirely.

62
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,810
So from the splash screen but we go a level one and then from level 1 which you want to a too.

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,030
3 etc..

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,880
Maybe we'll let people pick more difficult levels.

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,350
We'll see how that goes.

66
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:04,070
There's some other great features coming including auto tile I'm saying in a weird way because I have

67
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,760
done this six times now and I keep trying to write auto light.

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,200
It's not a light it's an auto type what an auto tile.

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,920
Well take the concept of a tile map that we did in in Hobby days and extend it further.

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,640
What if the game could figure out okay I've drawn this shape like this.

71
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,570
Now apply all the textures and corners and collisions and light occlusion where we can.

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,210
Really fun feature.

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,350
What else have we got.

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,040
We've got line of sight which is very dramatic and useful in lots of cases.

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,720
We can play with themes.

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,760
It's a theme it's a way of saying to go to work every time I create a button or a panel it should look

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,550
like this unless I tell you otherwise.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,020
This is my default font.

79
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,540
These are my colours and it will remember them and apply them.

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,700
It's a really great way of making things work.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,650
We're going to have combination locks that are randomly set and these combinations can be variable so

82
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,230
I can say this store has a four digit combination.

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,410
This one has a 12 digit combination with no crazy with this.

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,910
Lots of cool things to look for.

85
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,130
See in the next video we can get started.
