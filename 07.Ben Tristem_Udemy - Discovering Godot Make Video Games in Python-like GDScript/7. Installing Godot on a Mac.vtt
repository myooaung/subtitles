1
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.940
There.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.850
Ben tristam with you.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm going to talk you through installing a doe on the Mac.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.540
So two options.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.680
Very much like the one you could use steam.

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.100
I would say the advantages are it's super simple and it will manage the upgrading process for you the

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.860
updates just like a game.

8
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.800
The disadvantages are.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.380
Every time you want to run godot you have to run Steam an open steam and log into steam or put it in

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.120
offline mode.

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.760
And the other disadvantage is that you can't do the C sharp version if you're interested in doing so

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.700
you shop later in the course.

13
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
And I strongly suggest you do follow me through a scene sharp at the end of luny lips so we're not going

14
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.140
to do it with steam.

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350
We are going to go to the Go download page.

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.650
Just google for download.

17
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.330
Good.

18
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.380
And then we're looking for the Mac 32 bit plus 64 bit version number it going to do them one version

19
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.060
now because it's more complicated.

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.750
We will get there towards the at the end of Luni lips.

21
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
When I talk you through the conversion of that project to see Sharpe after I've sold you on the benefits

22
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.540
of learning C sharp as well as Judy's quit.

23
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.270
So for now we're just going to get the 32 plus 64 bit version.

24
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.630
They just click on it.

25
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.260
It's going to do a download 40 odd make at the time that's on good old version 3 0 4.

26
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.710
But it would be a much later version when you're watching this video and that's fine.

27
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.720
Just get the latest version might be a little bit bigger.

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.730
Not a problem that should unzip itself and immediately take you to where it is on your disk.

29
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.670
All you need to do from there is move it into your applications folder.

30
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.440
Clearly if you can't see that applications in the sidebar like I've got it then there's a couple of

31
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.270
things you might need to do.

32
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.490
You can either go to view and show side bar and hope that applications is there or you just make yourself

33
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390
and you find a window or find a tab and you drag it there anyway.

34
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.190
I'm sure you can manage to get the file into the applications folder then to note once it's there you

35
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.090
can have multiple version.

36
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.880
So I already had good muno the mono version and then this is the one I've just installed.

37
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.080
You can rename it if you want.

38
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.090
If you want to keep track of where we are so this is three point o point for.

39
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.430
Call it whatever I like.

40
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.040
I can drag it down to my to my doc but in your doc if you've got more than one minor good ole ready

41
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.220
then make sure you're clear about which one you're using.

42
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.090
So in this case I'm managing it to make sure it's gadow 3 0 4.

43
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.760
You see the benefit of actually naming the application there means when I hover over it in the dock

44
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.990
I can see exactly what I'm getting.

45
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.020
I know this is the non mono version.

46
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.270
It's important you dont use the one version that for now because if mondo's not set up right on your

47
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.990
machine and is not the right person it just won't run.

48
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.960
It just won't open which is really kind of annoying.

49
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.430
So let's click in to it and we just want to make sure at this stage that it runs.

50
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.940
That's it.

51
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.620
This is your challenge for the section.

52
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.230
In fact one might ope mind opens.

53
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.560
I'm going to give you your challenge your challenge is to download and install goodo It's as simple

54
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.130
as that.

55
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.070
Just grab a copy of a 3.0 for a later and install it on your Mac and then come back to me.

56
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420
Once you have done that or so are you in a second.

57
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.720
Okay so one of the things you may have got when you tried to install this is goodo 3.0 point for is

58
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.250
an application downloaded from the Internet.

59
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.950
You sure you're an open it case so we can say okay now it may not let you open it.

60
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.150
By the way if it doesn't then you need to go to System Preferences.

61
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
Security and privacy and you should be getting a warning just down here.

62
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.630
UPS just down here in this space below.

63
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.710
Allow apps downloaded from saying you need to goodo is attempting to open open anyway so you'd unlock

64
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.490
here with You'd now more Mac password.

65
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.160
And then you'll click open anyway and then next time you try to open out it should open.

66
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.510
So there is one gotcha now and you will start off with nothing in here like this.

67
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.000
No about my font size will show you how to change that in a moment.

68
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.960
What we want to do is want to make a new project and understand what this is doing so if you browse

69
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.370
to say downloads.

70
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.670
There you go.

71
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.190
Select current folder downloads.

72
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.780
If I now say I don't know.

73
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.630
Donkey test why donkey you just use the word donkey like it's a recognizable word.

74
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.960
If I create folder look what it's doing is putting green tick.

75
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.540
To say that's all good I'm making a folder called Donkey within.

76
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.240
Download simple create an edit.

77
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.610
Let's see what happens.

78
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.400
So good I will open up and that's it.

79
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.100
As long as you can right click right mouse button and move around.

80
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.290
We're running inside guys.

81
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.020
Oh that's cool.

82
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.300
If we look at what's changed on the disc in downloads we've made this folder here called Donghae test

83
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.460
and in there there's various files which we'll learn about as we go through the course.

84
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.360
Only other thing to say is if you don't like the font size go to Ed. Ed settings interface an editor.

85
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.960
So that was Ed the menu editor setting submenu interface on the left editor and then you've got a font

86
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.610
size here.

87
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.770
You can change it all you like to say 30.

88
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.890
And immediately the whole interface font size will change.

89
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.230
Alright fantastic.

90
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.650
That is it.

91
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.940
That is how you install godso on a Mac.

92
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.600
And of course you just close the app in the normal way and off you go.

93
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.490
So we'll see you in the rest of the course.
