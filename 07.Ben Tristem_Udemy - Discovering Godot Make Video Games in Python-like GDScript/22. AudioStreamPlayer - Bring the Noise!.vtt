00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.480
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.290
Fantastic God.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.440
People you know I was thinking Barney is doing already well we've got some great animations jarndyce

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.580
can take damage.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000
Has lives and coins.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.550
But you know what.

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.980
Money doesn't have noise in this video.

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.780
Let's put sounds on our game.

9
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.240
By the way quick technical point.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.770
I don't really mean noise.

11
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.430
Sound engineers get really upset when you say that noise is a sound you don't want.

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.020
Let's bring this out but the noise is a song from my teenage years and I quite miss it so very nice

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.160
to do this.

14
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.470
We need to talk about three notes audio stream player audio stream player to me an audio stream player

15
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.970
3D.

16
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.090
Makes sense right.

17
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.620
What's the difference.

18
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.230
The difference is positional information audio stream player has no positional information.

19
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.220
If you use it it will just play the sound equally through all your speakers.

20
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.180
It's not gonna take into account things like distance it's not going to take into account things like

21
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.970
stereo.

22
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.590
It's just going to play the sound audio streamed player 2D and 3D do have positional information.

23
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.780
If we run a sound effect of bunny in audio stream player 2D God is going to calculate where money is

24
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.830
in relation to the camera and play the sound there.

25
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.170
In this case it's not what I want.

26
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160
But he jumps I want the sound of jumping.

27
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.490
I don't want some jumping from the left hand side of the right hand side of the screen it just gets

28
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.960
confusing.

29
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.670
On the other hand if I was doing something where there's lots of characters or pieces onscreen doing

30
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.220
something then 2D or 3D position information makes a lot more sense.

31
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.380
In our case I'm going to be using audio stream player not to do your 3D so that's going to go to first

32
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.590
where I do create a category for all these different sound effects and audio stream players.

33
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.300
So let's create a note to be a cocreate node.

34
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.960
But I've been using notI so far.

35
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.130
Let's keep it consistent and I'm going to call this sounds.

36
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.520
And within that that's put a child node.

37
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.620
That's an audio stream player.

38
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.520
Let's call this music we call it background music BGM and all the rest of it.

39
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.190
Now we actually have two possibilities here because I couldn't decide which one to pick up.

40
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.040
Your options are chiptune adventure and summer park.

41
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.590
And if you want to hear what they sound like you can drag one of them into the stream over here and

42
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.570
hit play.

43
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
And then this summer park.

44
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.730
Which brings me to the challenge.

45
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.680
Quite an early challenge.

46
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.670
This time I'd like you to pick your background music it's going to make a huge difference to how your

47
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.420
game feels.

48
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.270
So give chiptune adventures one and some a park one a listen and then decide which one of them are going

49
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.130
to use or if you want.

50
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.870
You could use other music.

51
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.730
The music I've picked is on the creative commons zero licence so we can use it commercially without

52
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.530
any kind of attribution or any problem like that.

53
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.120
I have already linked to the sites where I got them but I will ignore them again in this video.

54
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.720
If you want to use something else.

55
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.530
Be advised.

56
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800
You cannot use an MP 3.

57
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.290
You'll have to use a web file or an oh g.g. because MP 3s are not natively supported by God.

58
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.380
So if you want to use I don't know that beautiful people by Marilyn Manson.

59
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.630
Pick a song you like.

60
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.870
You will have to convert it and know that by doing that you can't use that commercially.

61
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.360
That's just for your own enjoyment.

62
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.340
Fine so pick the song you want and put it in your game and make sure that the music actually plays when

63
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.790
the game starts having back from it that doesn't play doesn't work.

64
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.750
So pause the video pick your music get it playing and the game starts and when you come back I'll show

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.500
you how I do.

66
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.020
I'm a Mac.

67
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.880
Okay so I've already created that music.

68
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.060
Now that's easy enough.

69
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.250
I'm actually kind of feeling saal Park.

70
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.360
Let's find out.

71
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.800
Maybe I'm feeling Chips's and Fletcher.

72
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310
I'm definitely feeling some a park knowledge Hitchings place today.

73
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.920
I do like cheap tunes but not today.

74
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.830
If not also the volume by the way I can just use the decimal on it get but minus 10 and now when I play

75
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.280
it nice chill back.

76
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.570
Alright so how when it was playing just a couple days.

77
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.060
I can go into games say Judy create something in the ready function say now play it but an easier way

78
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.200
involves no script at all.

79
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.120
I could just press auto play now and to play the game.

80
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.320
Isn't that wonderful.

81
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.650
No lines of code.

82
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.980
Just use the inspector got older for me.

83
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.120
Fantastic.

84
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.570
What I am going to do is actually put this at minus 25.

85
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.430
That's not how I have an end game but it means that I can talk to you while I'm running the game.

86
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.490
Let's put it's more sounds.

87
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.920
So next on what to put in is just another audio stream player.

88
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.050
Remember it is a two day and I'm gonna call this jump.

89
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.650
SFX and we already have jump one right here.

90
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.520
These three sound effects are all from kennyi Audio packs which we have linked to in the past and are

91
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.510
linked to again.

92
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.880
I'll also give you an option of how to generate your own sound effects later in the video.

93
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.550
Alright so we have jump and I would put this at minus 10.

94
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.600
I think there's a good level.

95
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.430
Well I'm not going to do is you playing auto play however however what I am going to do is give this

96
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.400
a script.

97
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.600
I'm going to put it in scripts not in scenes create it.

98
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.920
There it is.

99
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.280
Why am I doing this because I want to create a global reference to it.

100
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.510
I want to create a jump SFX.

101
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.740
Why am I doing this.

102
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.580
Because were trying to image string referencing in this project so let's make that as consistent as

103
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.720
we can.

104
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.280
So global dot jump SFX equals sulf great.

105
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.610
And let's do the same thing for the other son of God which would be coin and pain.

106
00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:01.380
So let's create two new audio string players one and two wide and duplicate it because it would also

107
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.800
have duplicated the script and that would have just been a little bit more extra What put you down here.

108
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.460
Great.

109
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.510
When to call you pain.

110
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.640
As a fax.

111
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.170
And quain SFX.

112
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.460
Let's go to global.

113
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.220
I will put those two in so variable pain is a effects and variable coin.

114
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:39.820
SFX two news groups one not it seems you are in scope's.

115
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.790
And one more.

116
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.310
Variables mis named as negligibly SFX light effects.

117
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.480
There we go.

118
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.130
Cool stuff.

119
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.870
Great.

120
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.560
All three of them are done let's save that.

121
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.790
And they don't need these open anymore.

122
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.490
They won't have anything else in their script.

123
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500
Those are just there to initialize them.

124
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.920
OK let's use them.

125
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.010
Let's go in to the.

126
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.140
Play edgy when the player is jumping when you're actually moving.

127
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.250
Let's play this sound.

128
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:31.860
Now I could put this in game state but this does feel like it should go here some global dots jump as

129
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.860
effects play.

130
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.460
Let's see if that works.

131
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.980
Seems to work.

132
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.720
Well it's kind all out and I'm for the music too quite so let's change that a little bit.

133
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.030
Job effects must be at minus 15.

134
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.070
I think this a go on and the music wants to be at minus 15 too.

135
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.640
Let's see if that works.

136
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.040
Alright.

137
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.150
Is up next now.

138
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.800
Coins are not picked up anywhere in this group so let's actually put that in the script.

139
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.840
That makes sense.

140
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.560
Some global dot coin SFX dot play and that's probably me a little loud.

141
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.590
There's nothing actually in here.

142
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.350
I need to actually put the sound effect in.

143
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.350
Oh that would have been embarrassing.

144
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.360
I think we were way too loud.

145
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.230
Minus 10.

146
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.590
Let's pitch.

147
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.510
Don't change the pitch.

148
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.150
Minus 10.

149
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.070
Great.

150
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.720
Let's see if that works.

151
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.350
We go we have sounds.

152
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.460
Last I going to do is a pained sound and that will be in games under hurt because that feels a good

153
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.300
place.

154
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.560
So global adopts pain.

155
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.540
SFX stopped play and let's make sure we actually have that sound effect.

156
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.150
Then we notice.

157
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:07.800
OK.

158
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.090
Let's see if that works so that should all be set.

159
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.190
Ah ha.

160
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.060
You hear that.

161
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.860
That sound effect is looping.

162
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.680
Pain is looping why is pain looping.

163
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:31.630
Well when God imported these sounds it made some decisions and one of them was Lupa sound effects unless

164
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.700
you're told otherwise.

165
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.820
We need to tell God otherwise.

166
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.300
So head over to this import.

167
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.150
Next scene and uncheck lip.

168
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:45.520
And you know what let's hit reimport And let's check that jump isn't looping because it might give us

169
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.850
weird things and coin's isn't looping because that's not dugit isn't looping.

170
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.770
Looping is turned off.

171
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.120
Correct.

172
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.800
Kennedy's effects is a web file not a g.g..

173
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.560
So that's why it's looking a little different here.

174
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.110
But let's see if that's any better.

175
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.770
Change the sound valances for those so let's keep most 10 feels good.

176
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.300
Ten minus 10 minus 15 okay minus 15 looks good.

177
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.650
This is not the volume might have it in the actual game but it makes it easier for me to talk to you.

178
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.460
Let's see.

179
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:35.040
Do we have sound effects music.

180
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.880
And we have eight.

181
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.740
One thing we do have is the music ending here.

182
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.260
There's a couple of ways we could do that.

183
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.060
We could have a singleton that plays the music all the way through.

184
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.060
We could have different music here.

185
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.950
But for now I think that's great work before we go.

186
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.960
Here's a tip from our bnz.

187
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.660
Dave from discord.

188
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.670
Maybe you don't want to use these sound effects.

189
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:05.070
Well you could use JF X are not frozen fact or document and to provide a link.

190
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:12.180
This is handy little site that can make little sound effects for you and you can tweak them and get

191
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.310
exact sound effect you want.

192
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.710
If you don't.

193
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.700
The ones I provided.

194
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.720
Make your own sound effects and really make this game your own.

195
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.370
Which brings us to the end of this video.

196
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.910
In this video we've looked at the three types of audio stream player knows how to change on a sound

197
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.350
as looping and how you use auto play without using any script to just get a sound to automatically play.

198
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.380
If you've used different sounds or music I'd love to hear what you've got so please share them with

199
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.920
the community and great work and I'll see you in the next year.
