00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,260
Hello glory glorious God.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,230
People in this video we're bringing cube dude in.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,790
Enter their cube do now have got into salmon stuck in my head.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,570
If you're not familiar with Q dude cube dude was created as part of Michael's character creation course

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,290
so if you've made your own characters you can bring them in too.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,320
But for now we're going to use this because it was made in blender.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,630
Another great open source program and a really well together.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,170
So let's start by making a new.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,000
No we're not making a new scene.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Things are different now.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,430
Why.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,890
Well let's go over to models and if we open the cube dude folder you'll see right here we have Q dude

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,740
Doc D A.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,050
This is the commodify row we've looked this before.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,540
This is the import.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,720
But this is being treated as a scene.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,110
If I double click it you get this little window here just to tell you what's happening here.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,480
You cannot modify the actual file.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,320
Right it's not actually seen as being treated as a scene if we open it anyway.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,500
It'll let us make changes but any changes we make won't actually be saved so we want a new inherited

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,310
scene based on the clodfelter new inherited.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,400
You will notice some weird things going on.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,660
First off can't really see cute dude cute dude is gay.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,610
Why is kudu grey Why doesn't he did have material.

25
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,010
What you did does have material click down here on the actual mash.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,400
See he's got a material on the MASH but the material is the default grey and talk about why in a second.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,230
Ducking a notice of the root node cubed is a kinematic body.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,950
This is important because that's not the default.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,570
If you bring your own assets in that won't be true.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,760
I've gone and change them for you but just in case you use your own assets or for future reference.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,480
Here's what I did.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,500
Click on the cube dude over here in the file manager the file system go up to import and these are the

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,250
two things you want.

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,310
Root type and root name.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,700
The default is spatial right.

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,650
All assets are brought in like this will be brought in a special note.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,290
I don't want the root note to be special.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,940
I want to be a climatic body so I changed the signals root name.

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,880
I just changes.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,270
Did.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,390
Otherwise you are imported and it will be called spatial member.

42
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,320
If you make any changes press reimport.

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,690
Right let's talk about why Q dude has this bizarre colouration.

44
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,330
Where is the textual we know and love.

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,780
Or we don't know it that we will know enough.

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,430
Well let's go off to the slides you see when you bring in 3D asts materials.

47
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,990
All the information for the ascent material is buried in a file so there's a that's a dot.

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,390
Empty L. file if you bring in an object file.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,860
B.j. jail come with a material file and written in that file is where God can find the texture or material.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,310
If that textual material does not have the right name or is not in the right place you'll get a blank

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,720
material created for you with that name.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,170
And that's what's happening here.

53
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,580
If you're working on a large project or with a team of people or just by yourself.

54
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,220
An important part of project management is making sure that the files materials are in the right relative

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,040
position with the right names.

56
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,590
Because if at some point only to move more rename them God will just create a new material.

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,500
Okay so let's change the material.

58
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,330
This right here cube space dood is our mash and it has this material on it.

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,160
I can click on this mash and then click on mature to edit it or because I am already sure that this

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
material is being applied.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,610
I can just double click on material.

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,910
It's the same thing.

63
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,370
It's a spatial material.

64
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,810
The Albino colour is correct.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,770
Right but we actually have a textual to replace and take 11 cube GDP injy and apply it and there it

66
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,390
is a lovely little texture.

67
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,880
Couple things one to make sure of first as get metallic.

68
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,300
I want to make sure the metallic and specular are at ceara.

69
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,150
This is not vital for any normal project but I am going to be using two shadings and I want things to

70
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,720
look like.

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,300
Turns out we're not setting up to shading yet but I'm preparing for it.

72
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,800
Also roughness will be at once all I want completely flat light as little reflection as possible.

73
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,540
By the way just so you know how would I apply to unchaining and the primitives get to fuse mode and

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
hit tone.

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,340
The reason I'm doing it yet would have any lighting in so there's no point.

76
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,690
So I'm Cleaver's birley now I've changed this.

77
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,390
The material hasn't updated in order to be sure that this has worked.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,340
You need to save your material if you don't save in materials.

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,770
Chance that it just changes won't actually stick.

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,600
So all him do is click on the floppy disk and remember if you don't know what that is you should ask

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,370
your grandparents.

82
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,450
Click on floppy disk and press Save and overwritten material and there it is.

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,300
Later will make a second material for the blue one.

84
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,260
If you want we can actually do that now on a duplicate this material.

85
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,900
And I would call this cube do blue and all I did was I took this texture and bought it again up and

86
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,700
recoloured it so open.

87
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,510
Clue dude.

88
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,530
Blue Cloud to say make sure I've got the right one open and bring that texture.

89
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,270
A save that.

90
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,730
So we have a cube dude and we have a blue material ready for when we have two players.

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,150
No point using it yet.

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,270
We're not quite ready to go cube dude is a kinematic body kinematic bodies require collision.

93
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,560
So let's put a collision shape as a child of Cupid.

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,460
And as is normally the case when we are using any kind of 3D movement the default is going to be a capsule

95
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,360
wire capsule because it has these lovely round cylindrical things so if we bump into things it's not

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
going be like it's a cube.

97
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,880
I made a cube that can be those jagged corners when things are coming at me from let's say 37 degrees

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,240
and they'll bounce off at the correct normal.

99
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,280
I don't know what that would be but if you do have fun with it I'll get a collision shape is one sense

100
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,880
that the feet.

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,790
What that's no good only to change that somebody to transform and translation this is a ramble where

102
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,930
you are on the x y and z axis.

103
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,710
So I know that Y is my up I think one will be halfway through.

104
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,630
Yes.

105
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,670
I happen to know that Q duties two units tall.

106
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,310
There was a unit meter and I need to rotate this.

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,190
Let's rotate this.

108
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,840
So that's the up point is at the top.

109
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,640
And I believe that B minus 90 looks good.

110
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,440
The collision is way too big.

111
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,130
So what I need to do is I need to bring it in a bit and I dropped the height.

112
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:36,190
I'm looking for is the feet should be as close to the collision as possible and I don't need Pixel Perfect.

113
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,500
You could in theory make a collision box for each one of these sub measures.

114
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,810
Right so you have a bunch of different measures one for arms what four hands one four fingers.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,310
But there's very few times we need that precise collision.

116
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,640
In this particular instance we really don't need that conclusion precision kaloogian Precision very

117
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,390
fond of say.

118
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,060
I do want to do though is make sure he's on the right collegiately.

119
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,470
So go back up here and a collision layers.

120
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,510
He's not the pitch.

121
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,470
He is the player.

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,770
So he's on the collision there and he's got to interact with the pitch the ball and the players or players

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,510
have to bump into each other and we can save you as a scene so.

124
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:21,520
Q Do you now seem elates instance I'm in so I'm just going to create a blank node and call that players

125
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
just to organise my players.

126
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's bring in cube dood and why we can't play a one.

127
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,590
And here is this cube dude.

128
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,590
In our scene outside we have this player and we have the ball and if I press play.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,660
The ball can drop down the player can't move.

130
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,460
And right now the players looking a bit dull.

131
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,410
So let's give the player a script get back into cube dude and I'm going to add a script to him.

132
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,840
So scripts and keep dodgy looking good.

133
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,380
We don't need any comments.

134
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,020
Great distraction free mode and the first thing I want to do.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,030
I don't really need a real option right now.

136
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,680
What I do need though is a variable called motion and that's going to be a vector 3.

137
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,670
We are now dealing with vector 3s.

138
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,090
What's a vector 3.

139
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:14,280
It's a it's like a vector to write a vector 2 is a variable with two values in it which we all call

140
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,830
abstractly x and y.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,250
I don't actually have to be coordinates that could be any two but I'm going to call them x and y vector

142
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,170
3 is the same thing but it has 3 x y and z.

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,170
So our motion is going to be a vector 3 because we are dealing with three axes.

144
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,840
I also want an export variable called speed and that's going to be the speed that we can move at.

145
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,320
For now as move that 10.

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,690
I have a feeling that's really far too fast so if I want to move that's can be happening on every tick

147
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:49,470
rate and specifically every tick of the physics and its function process physics whereas there it is

148
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,680
physics process that's what I meant.

149
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,620
What's that mean.

150
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,090
Well we have a process that's going to happen every calculation and we have a physics process every

151
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,780
calculation in the physics engine.

152
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,180
These are slightly different.

153
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,220
I want to use the physics one because I want this to be more accurate.

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,990
And all that can happen is I'm going to move somewhere make a function called move in the physics process

155
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,090
and also compute one later could fall because kinematic bodies don't have built in gravity right.

156
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,250
They're not rigid bodies rigid bodies have physics happen to them.

157
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,960
Kinematic bodies have to make their own physics so if analogies make moves that look at that move and

158
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
not move.

159
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,810
What needs to happen.

160
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,900
Well that's a good question.

161
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,370
I'd like to challenge you to make kudu admit.

162
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,520
Now this is a little bit more challenging than some of your challenges because we haven't done this

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,670
in 3-d yet we've done so much in 2D.

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,510
And I want you to get a feel of how much you've picked up and how familiar are are and if this is a

165
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,260
little bit overwhelming That's okay.

166
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,810
That just tells you okay I need to figure out these bits too.

167
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,720
So don't panic.

168
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,690
Here are some tips you going to be using move and slide move and slide and move and collide both existing

169
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,070
kinematic bodies just like they do doing kinematic 2D.

170
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,590
Were going to be using move and slide because we want the motion to be calculated.

171
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,380
Once the player has hit the ball we move and collide.

172
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,160
The player will simply stop and none of that energy will be transferred to the ball the ball will never

173
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,820
move.

174
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,450
So we're using move and slide and will be using two arguments.

175
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,210
The first argument will probably be motion which we've already set up as effective 3.

176
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,490
The second will be up and I've defined up for you vector 3 0 1 0.

177
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,250
So an example would be moving slide motion vector 3 0 1 0.

178
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,630
Okay so pause the video and when you're either satisfied with solution or you think you know what.

179
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,590
I just want to see how he does it.

180
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,340
Come back and I'll show you my solution.

181
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,780
And welcome back.

182
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,610
OK.

183
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,980
So first thing I need to do is I need to get the input from the players and the condition right then.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,730
If so.

185
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,790
If input dot is action Prest keeps pressing too many keys.

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
And for now let's just use the default.

187
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,620
You I.

188
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,200
Up down left right buttons were going to change those later but for now I'm just confused.

189
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,000
So you I.

190
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:17,000
Up and we may as well build in the ability to not press two buttons that same time and not copy this

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,160
because they feel like type it all again.

192
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,350
So if you're pressing up and not down

193
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,540
pay attention yet if you're pressing up and not down what happens.

194
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,420
Well I'm going to double check this in 3D because I get this one wrong all the time.

195
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,360
I want to make sure I know which axis is which.

196
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,730
OK so let's say Player 1 and on the transform get a translation.

197
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,720
If I move X to minus 1 OK.

198
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,990
So X is my red which means Z is my blue arrows time of the positive is that way so if I press up I want

199
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,990
to move a negative one.

200
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:00,600
OK let's do that let's go back to Scripps motion Z distraction free mode.

201
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,440
He calls loops equals negative speed.

202
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,630
Note by the way that I am not doing minus equal speed.

203
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,630
What that would mean is every tick.

204
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,230
Take the current value of speed and subtract speed from it.

205
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,860
That's going to be good for acceleration but I don't want acceleration.

206
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,340
I want a very sort of clunky blocky childish movement right.

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,850
That's the aesthetic I'm going for.

208
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,810
If I did want that I would then also have to put in a clamp value write some minimum speed and a maximum

209
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,600
speed but only 10 minutes be the maximum speed.

210
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,880
There are only two possible speeds speed and zero.

211
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,490
So let's duplicate these two lines with control B and just start changing things so when you're moving

212
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:56,170
down and not up there motion Dodd said he calls speed shows this to an L If there's no point doing.

213
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,380
If and if you can't have both the same time and I need one more I need.

214
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,830
Else let's just give you motion on Z equals zero.

215
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,870
So just to run through the code is doing its checking.

216
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,120
Are you pressing up and not down.

217
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,740
If so motion does z is negative speed.

218
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,290
I pressing down and not up.

219
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,230
If so motion not set equal speed.

220
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,130
If you're either pressing both or not pressing either motion does it because now do the same exact thing

221
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,160
just duplicate all that code.

222
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,460
But I go on the left and right.

223
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:38,510
So if you're going left and not right and left is negative exelis It's put that abss that says it has

224
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,380
not X and if you go right not left.

225
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,720
That's positive x otherwise X is zero and then right at the end.

226
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,910
I want to move and slide.

227
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,700
What's the skinny.

228
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,360
Motion comma Lecter 3 0 1 0.

229
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,280
And I always get this wrong right because I've finished a bracket.

230
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,630
I always forget the second bracket.

231
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,520
Now right now this is a bit magic number three right has put vector freezer or ones your own weak.

232
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,020
It may not be clear what that is.

233
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,010
You could very easy to make this constants.

234
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:22,740
We make conser caught up and letters vector 3 0 on the axe one and the wiser on the set and then I can

235
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,720
put up in here and just a bit more legible.

236
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,140
Great.

237
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,820
Now if I've done this correctly and I really hope I have we should begin with the cat.

238
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,100
Move left right down and up now there is no gravity applied so right now I can go over the edge.

239
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,160
Later we will put visuals here and I can kick the ball.

240
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,070
What's happening is the ball has moved me up.

241
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,700
Now you can't retell because any shadow or way of measuring height but I'm not too high to touch the

242
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,770
ball right.

243
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,940
The ball is too heavy and I'm not.

244
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,880
I have no gravity.

245
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,580
So let's put some gravity make a function called Fall.

246
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,270
And I'll put this after move and slide makes more spaces so yes you'll be doing going here.

247
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,640
Function.

248
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,790
For now we are using move in slide and you might remember moving slide has access to is on floor and

249
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,730
is floor requires up very defined sort of fights.

250
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,720
If it is on floor for has two O's in it which is an important fact that I'd forgotten.

251
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,070
If you're on the floor then motion dot why he calls 0.

252
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,040
Else motion.

253
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,410
Why he calls.

254
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,450
I need a new concept or it needs and they call gravity so let's write gravity here and let's define

255
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,850
it so constant I'm keeping my concepts together because it's good practice that's going down which is

256
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,740
negative y.

257
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,440
And so five five sounds good.

258
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:55,760
OK.

259
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,150
Let's find out how that works.

260
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,270
So I can move left right down up I can move diagonally.

261
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,130
You will notice by the way I'm moving fast from a diagonal to about wine a while I want to touch the

262
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,780
ball I don't flap in the air.

263
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,520
Now I can't move the ball for a couple of reasons.

264
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,940
One I'm being pushed up let's stop that let's go back to Cupid.

265
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,550
Click on the root which is I can Carnatic body and let's click access lock.

266
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,610
I don't want to move at all on the angular Y or the linear all right some will apply gravity but don't

267
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,750
be moved by them.

268
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,040
The other reason is the ball doesn't know that it should be moving.

269
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,440
So it's click on the ball and there's a couple of interesting things here.

270
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,750
Because balls a rigid body it can sleep.

271
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,680
Switch that off.

272
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,110
I also want continuous C D.

273
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,780
What a seedy stand for it sounds full collision detection is he got I was trying to save resources by

274
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,240
not measuring if a rigid body needs to be moved unless it knows and if something hits it fast like the

275
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,990
pledge said it will ignore that.

276
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,030
Let's move that now.

277
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,420
We also change the weight of we wanted.

278
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,430
But I believe we move now.

279
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,320
Ha.

280
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,630
By Do Bible look at that.

281
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,590
I move the ball moved off the pitch and it kind of broke everything but it can work.

282
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,920
I make short can sleep as off and continue C.D on.

283
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,450
We don't want these for too many rigid objects at the same time because that's when the game will start

284
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:25,180
slowing down so if I had I don't know five thousand of these balls on screen at same time and I set

285
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,040
that on that very annoying.

286
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,140
Just for giggles let's put Bout's one and press play and I think the ball should now bounce a little

287
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,620
bit.

288
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,410
In the case now dodge ball.

289
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,350
That's too much bounce.

290
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,670
But I want to play with it when we get some collision walls in in the next couple of videos we can start

291
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,270
playing with that.

292
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,630
But we're off to a great start.

293
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,110
In this video we looked at changing the root node of an important asset which you shouldn't have to

294
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,740
do in this game.

295
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,370
Just in case you using your own assets and going forward how do you do that.

296
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,940
Why 3D objects will have like materials and the basics of moving in 3D.

297
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,720
Excellent start and I'll see in the next video.
