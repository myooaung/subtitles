00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.680
Welcome back phenomenal go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.210
We'll talk about area two denotes going to make Spike hazards.

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
Let's make this more challenging for the player more dangerous the bunny and more spiky for the spikes

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.070
an area to denote and there's a 3D version obviously just called area an area to denote is just a part

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.080
of the game world where things can happen is going to detect when things are entering when things are

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.560
inside or where things are leaving and all you really need to know about an area 2D is how to use it.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.850
So to use it you have to give it collision.

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.630
Now what's different here is that with a physics body something like a kinetic body 2D or rigid body

9
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.270
2D that collision is there to stop things from hitting is it's actually colliding not how it works in

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940
every city in every 2D.

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.360
We're not colliding.

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.070
We're just detecting when things are coming in.

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.290
So really this shouldn't be called collision and should be called detection.

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.080
But we're going to use collision modes anyway so let's get into it.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.940
The first thing I need to do is make a brand new scene and it's going to be a custom node to make an

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.780
area 2D 2D area for detection and 2D physics influence.

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.990
Great.

18
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.020
So I'm gonna call this spike top because we have multiple spikes you can use and you'll see wait a minute

19
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.410
before going any further let's give it a sprite.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.680
And on the graphics on the environment scroll down you'll see a bunch of spikes spikes top and we start

21
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.410
with this one.

22
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.310
She's going to drag that into the texture and zoom right in now you'll see a little warning here.

23
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.670
We need that collision.

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.970
I could use a simple box but I'm not going to miss a polygon and we'll use it before we made the platform

25
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.260
so it's less an easy child node.

26
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.210
And I want a collision polygon 2D and let's add those nodes so create point.

27
00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:02.710
This little green plus thing and just get them nice and close to the corners not worry about being too

28
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.610
precise because I can tweak them so as you like to go here and drag it.

29
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.610
That seems pretty solid.

30
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.920
Okay.

31
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.630
So right now I have a very simple area 2D right.

32
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.550
Sprite goes with its.

33
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.030
So it looks like and a collision shape but it's not going to do anything.

34
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.230
Let's make it do something.

35
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.800
First thing.

36
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.340
Let's save it and I'll make a brand new folder.

37
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.970
NICOLE This has its and Spike topped up TSC and that sounds good.

38
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.830
Now let's give it a script.

39
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.710
So new script and I'm only this empty is good name for it.

40
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.510
She is not a good name for it because they're were going to share the same script so let's call it hazards.

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.150
I might have multiple so much has is that GDP create that I might have multiple types of hazards right.

42
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.780
I have Spike top Spike bottom single spikes we don't need a different script each one.

43
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.170
And the reason we're doing this is so we connect the signals so it's going to note and you'll see here

44
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.460
we have all these options I don't want area entered.

45
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.810
The reason is I'm not having to area 2D bump into each other.

46
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.200
I want body entered and you'll see here it the physics city body I'm going to connect that to itself

47
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.700
and there it is.

48
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.590
Now see here passes in an argument the body the thing that has entered it so every time anything enters

49
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.970
this area this signal can fire.

50
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.590
And what you could do here is you can put an if condition in right.

51
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.410
So if body dots less a name.

52
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.500
Right so if the name property of it is player and I'm actually checking not setting such B equals equals

53
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:43.380
then do a thing or I could do if body is kin somatic body to day right.

54
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.470
If it is of this class if it is this no type do that however doesn't even ease your way of doing this.

55
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.920
I don't need a conditional statement what I'm going to do is use these collision last.

56
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.300
Let's go back to the inspector and over the collision and you know what.

57
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.810
Let's set a new collision lab for us so projects project settings and on a scroll down till I see landings

58
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.490
to 2D physics layer 3 can be hazards.

59
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.890
Great.

60
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.890
So now when I look over here in the collision I compress these three dots to see what they're called

61
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.350
much easier than hovering over them.

62
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800
So the layer is what the object is.

63
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.570
The mask is what it can interact with.

64
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.870
It is a hazard.

65
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.950
It is not terrain.

66
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.220
It is not player and it can only interact with players.

67
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.720
It cannot interact with trains.

68
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.890
It cannot interact with other hazards important.

69
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.220
You could have multiple spikes overlapping but you don't want them to trigger this hut thing so it can

70
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.380
only be itself going to be a terrain and it can only strike with the player just to make things like

71
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.810
the safe.

72
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.810
We go into the player collision and just make sure that it can interact with terrain and hazards.

73
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.600
Now actually we don't need to do that because as long as one mask can interact the other it'll work.

74
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.760
But it's good practice.

75
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.370
So let's get back to a spike top and make it do a thing.

76
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.750
Just to check it's working let's go.

77
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.930
Prints Hello Bunny.

78
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.150
Who is going to print it in the output now and it's actually put on the level.

79
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.630
So let's save that get back to the 2D view the level and I want to create a new node just like we did

80
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.400
with the looney lips thing when we looked at the node a solution for stories and to create a brand new

81
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.900
empty node.

82
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.550
I'm going to use a basic node not a node 2 Deeks I don't want this to have position that's too easy

83
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.240
to drag out of place I'm going to call it hazards because spikes if you like uncommon hazards and within

84
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.220
that I'm going to instance in just like we do with a player a spike top.

85
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.480
Okay so here's my spike top first you know just can't see it.

86
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.030
Not a problem.

87
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.970
Let's go back to the spike top scene and under canvas item visibility you'll see modulate.

88
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.270
This is what am I doing to the colors here.

89
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.400
Well let's get a different color we think about orange.

90
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.910
No but he's like orange don't they.

91
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.130
What don't bodies like.

92
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.940
I hear the bunnies don't like

93
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.450
a dark red hair.

94
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.240
They despise dark red.

95
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.750
Why.

96
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.130
I don't know.

97
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.730
Okay that looks pretty good.

98
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.730
If I save that I should eat nice deep red spikes.

99
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.480
Now when you try and drag this you gonna come up with a problem.

100
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.830
Yes.

101
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.820
Select my spike top I'm gonna drag it.

102
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.320
Okay that works fine.

103
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.850
What happens if I just slightly miss it.

104
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.020
Oh no.

105
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.670
Why is that happening.

106
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.870
Well right now I'm in select mode so I'm going to try and select whatever I'm looking at if I don't

107
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.030
get it just right.

108
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.400
It's gonna select the wrong thing.

109
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.680
Easy solution.

110
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.760
Select Spike top click the move icon or w on the keyboard and just place it where you want.

111
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.950
You'll know you'll have done this correctly.

112
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.540
If when you do run this test and we you the print Hello Bunny.

113
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.510
If it's overlapping we shouldn't get a hello Bunny but when I enter Hello Bunny TALABANI Talabani fantastic

114
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.410
you might get a bug with how a bunny comes up once the moment you press play.

115
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.050
If that's happening you'll collisions all set up correctly.

116
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.850
For example if I said it to also work with terrain which is this one here Hello Bunny will come in immediately

117
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.560
because the moment entered the scene something has entered it.

118
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.110
Now this can get crucial because every single spike that overlaps it once we start taking lives away

119
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.070
from Bunny are going to take a life away from Bunny the moment Bunny enters the level and that's no

120
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.330
good.

121
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.790
So let's not do that.

122
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.250
Okay.

123
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.530
So we have a simple Hello Bunny test.

124
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.640
It works great little more time.

125
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.430
Here's a bunny emigrating it great.

126
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.580
Lots of greetings.

127
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.810
But that's not what you want.

128
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:46.130
So instead let's give bunny a hut function so duly do to do and let's figure out what we want to happen.

129
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.210
The first you want to happen is I want Bunny to jump when it went her right.

130
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.990
So I want a visual cue the player that's nice and easy we have that here.

131
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.170
I'm going to copy this line motion dot Y minus equals jump speed seconding his plan he's gonna lose

132
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.830
a life that's easy we can do that this got back up to Constance.

133
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.920
Now this isn't gonna be a constant this will be a variable Y because this will change at runtime.

134
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.310
Okay if it's a constant I don't want it to change the number that will never change once the game is

135
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.090
running but this will change so lives equals three.

136
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.160
That seems like a good number.

137
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.560
So let's also lose a life.

138
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.270
So lives minus equals one.

139
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.100
Great.

140
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.240
And then we could just do a simple if condition if lives are less than zero.

141
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.620
And again nice and easy.

142
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.010
Right we've already made the end game function that's going to work just great.

143
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.260
I've also put too many indents in here so I don't need that next thing to do is go back to hazards and

144
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.740
actually make this work.

145
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.630
Nice and easy.

146
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.820
Body Dot.

147
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.210
But now we know this will work because we're literally just written this but if we wanted to we could

148
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.150
put in some basic error correction.

149
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.520
So if the DOT has method

150
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.600
hurt right.

151
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:08.720
Nice simple error check you'll see this a lot by the way when we're using methods in other scripts we're

152
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.430
gonna call them as strings we don't have to put the brackets in.

153
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.370
That won't work because it will try and call heart brackets brackets brackets brackets won't work.

154
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.890
So instead just hurt.

155
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.120
So if it has this method call this method.

156
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.310
Realistically we don't need to run this because we're doing this with collision lands but if we didn't

157
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.420
this would be another way we could do it.

158
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.820
Okay.

159
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:38.950
So on Spike top body entered body diehard let's pass play and see what happens.

160
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.800
Hmm.

161
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.090
Doesn't look as working right.

162
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.780
Well let's find out.

163
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.150
2 3.

164
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.150
Game over but we talk funny to jump.

165
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.080
Why isn't Bunny jumping when hurt.

166
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.520
Well let's take a look at our physics process.

167
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:59.100
Every single frame we're going to apply gravity try and jump try and move try and animate then move

168
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.280
and slide apply gravity.

169
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.430
Let's take a look.

170
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.240
If you fall off in the world limit and the game.

171
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.210
That's fine if you're on the floor.

172
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.730
Set.

173
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.350
Motion to zero.

174
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.480
This is competing.

175
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.440
Okay so what's happening is 60 times a second as much as it can.

176
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:21.160
And I know that because project settings physics common physics frames per second.

177
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.780
60 60 frames per second.

178
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.900
It's going to set the motion to zero from the floor.

179
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.990
So what's happening is this is setting and immediately being on.

180
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.810
So the first thing I need to do is move up by tiny amount position.

181
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.510
Don't Y minus equals one pixel.

182
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.860
That's all it'll take.

183
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:46.220
But this itself isn't enough because if I run this here still won't work right.

184
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.730
So let's try this.

185
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:56.110
What if we move up then pulls a frame and linger to do that.

186
00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.970
When you use yield yield means don't do anything until I tell you otherwise.

187
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.450
I guess a yield needs to listen to something is going to listen.

188
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.300
Get tree.

189
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.160
Right that's the function it's going to listen for and get trees going to give a signal and the signal

190
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.600
going to give one signal going to give is idle frame idle frame means when the next frame happens.

191
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.030
So just wait one frame then move up.

192
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.040
So we're going to move up by pixel and the next day just wait a frame and then move up and that is going

193
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.130
to bypass gravity.

194
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.690
I'll show you going to I'm not press anything.

195
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.310
3.

196
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.010
Done.

197
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.880
Perfect.

198
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.380
And this should work every time.

199
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.370
So if I jump into it hands off the keyboard.

200
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.090
Perfect.

201
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.270
So this will happen a lot right.

202
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.800
Sometimes the physics is gonna catch up with the script so it's going to happen before things can do

203
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.630
anything else.

204
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.240
You just need to wait afraid you got if you want to duplicate this and do this in two frames.

205
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.480
No real need.

206
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.400
Hello folks Yang from the future here.

207
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.640
Now we have a bug.

208
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.960
I didn't notice this bug till we got about four or five videos ahead.

209
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.280
At which point I figured out how to fix it but just so you know you might have something that looks

210
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.830
a bit like this.

211
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.570
Now I want to show a future gameplay here.

212
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.930
So don't freak out when you see a bunch of coins.

213
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.890
So here we are in a future version the game with a bunch of coins and I gooey all stuff you gonna be

214
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.880
making soon.

215
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.470
But look what happens when I walk into the spike from the side.

216
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.300
So is that not happening.

217
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.640
Well yeah.

218
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.880
If I jump on it sometimes it'll work and sometimes it won't.

219
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.400
Let's not worry about that just yet.

220
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.390
And when we catch up the code is looking familiar.

221
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.560
I'll show you how can fix that.

222
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.120
So bear with me for a few videos.

223
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.200
We are gonna fix that bug.

224
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.980
Meanwhile back to present day me and now I've got a challenge for you.

225
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.060
So let's go back into my 2D and out of distraction free mode.

226
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:50.590
I can for example duplicate this one and put it over here and maybe I want to make a third one but just

227
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.830
keep duplicating I'm on move.

228
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.460
So does it matter where I'm clicked.

229
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.960
And let's put this one over here.

230
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.860
I could go back and Spike tops and make it top one or a single one.

231
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.360
My challenge for you add spikes your level Spike it up a bit as I say use the spikes if you want to

232
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.590
make sure you test your level to make sure you can actually make it across there's no point making a

233
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.330
game that can't be played.

234
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.530
I know some people disagree with me.

235
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.410
I agree with me because I think I'm very agreeable so pause the video.

236
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.580
Customize your level a bit and when you come back I'll show you how I'm going to customize my

237
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.500
Mac.

238
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:33.550
So I'm gonna stick with these simple spy tops for now and I'm gonna lose them around it's a splotch

239
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.060
lodge and splotch.

240
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:43.620
You know what let's make this one a little bit difficult and put one right on the edge.

241
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.760
And see if I can actually do this.

242
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.050
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

243
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.280
He's sound that way does sound like she did sound likes.

244
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.980
I think she has a sound.

245
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.960
Okay so let's try this.

246
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.040
Doo doo doo.

247
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.650
Little bit tricky I may have made this too fast.

248
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.040
Oh my God accompli my a game.

249
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.070
But look we have the basics of gameplay.

250
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.100
We have a nice simple level.

251
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.300
We've got some houses going on.

252
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.280
Nice and easy.

253
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.500
You'll notice the debugger is giving us some warnings.

254
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.050
Don't worry about these all these are saying is by the way you're using move in slide but I'm not using

255
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.370
the value I'm getting out of it.

256
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.260
We are using it.

257
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.030
It's just not aware we can disable those warnings if we want.

258
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.030
They're not doing any harm.

259
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.780
Meanwhile that brings us to the end the video in this video we've looked at setting up and using area

260
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.750
to denotes using collision mouse and.

261
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.070
So we don't have to write a bunch of conditional statements which is a really great way of saving time

262
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.040
and using yield to wait for frame which is a really cool technique so don't forget to share your levels

263
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.600
if you've made something you're proud of.

264
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.980
Or you just want people's feedback.

265
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.320
Let me see how you put the hazards in.

266
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.250
Meanwhile great stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
