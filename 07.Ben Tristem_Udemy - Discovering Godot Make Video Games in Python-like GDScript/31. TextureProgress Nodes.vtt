00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.640
Heller you glorious God no tears because I felt like switching in other bits are God as He is of God.

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.740
People just saw this video in this video with a look at texture progress notes.

3
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.430
What we're doing is we're starting both the gooey and this idea of suspicion what's going to happen

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.910
with the guards and the cameras see us.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.290
So let's talk briefly about what can happen.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.820
Here we are in God.

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.700
And what's going to happen is when I walk into the camera we can have this thing called suspicion.

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.260
If the suspicion goes up the player will see that he gets to a maximum level.

9
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.240
The game's over if you step out of the light that suspicion will drop.

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.050
Now in this video we're not going to code that change.

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.090
We're just gonna set the stage for.

12
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.830
So let's start making gooey so brand new scene back to make new scenes and it makes no sense.

13
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.380
And our root node is going to be a canvas layer y canvas layer because I don't want to move around the

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.770
screen.

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.800
It's going to stick to the view ports were always going to see within the canvas layer.

16
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.330
I want a child node and I'm going back to our good friend nine patch wrecked so we can have a nine patch

17
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.630
rectangle which I'm put down here in the bottom right.

18
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.350
The first is give the texture is not a scene graphics interface PRNG and I'm off pick one of the glass

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.180
textures because I'm going in the bottom right.

20
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.330
I'm thinking this one with the corner lopped off the top left.

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.430
So Angela drag that into the texture.

22
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.350
And um to give it a decent size.

23
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.380
Let's for now just drag it out to about that looks good and take a look at the size.

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.960
All three hundred by 150 almost exactly.

25
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.470
That sounds pretty good.

26
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.650
So right now I have this nine patch rectangle.

27
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.650
It's in the wrong place.

28
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.740
I want it down here.

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.810
I'm gonna click on the patch rectangle get a layout and actually hit bottom right now it's on the bottom

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.610
right corner a remain have a Slayer to a.

31
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.030
Save this as a new scene.

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.640
Go back to my level and I'm an instant sit in.

33
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.930
I don't need it to be a child of the camera because it's a canvas.

34
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.720
So I was already on the viewport salacious instance in a new scene guly.

35
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.810
And you can see it over here.

36
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.810
But don't worry.

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.980
It should be the bottom right of the camel me alive.

38
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.780
Pressplay.

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.320
And there it is.

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.380
And because I've got it set to the bottom right when I resize the screen it's always in the bottom right.

41
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.090
However I get it right on the edge like that that doesn't feel good to me.

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.890
I'll give it a little bit of marginson back to the gooing click on my patch rect and let's give it a

43
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.790
margin so in margin I'd say maybe I would think 20 pixels so negative 20 pixels from the right.

44
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.740
Negative 20 pixels from the bottom and you'll see it's actually re sized again so if I want to I can

45
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.160
drag it out this way.

46
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.350
Let's take a look.

47
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.230
Pressplay.

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.480
And we have a little bit of a gap there.

49
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.170
Great.

50
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.690
Now I'm using my patch rectangle but I haven't actually set it up so we zoom in you see it's very blurry.

51
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.460
Not a problem.

52
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.330
We know how to do that.

53
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.760
We're going up to patch margins within nine patch rectangle.

54
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.450
Let's look at the patch margin and let's give it a 12 12 looks pretty good.

55
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.710
We don't need it to be much bigger and 12 because that's 12 pixels from the left about here.

56
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.790
If we keep going it's not going to make any noticeable difference.

57
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.400
If you want to you can set it to 40.

58
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.990
It'll look exactly the same which tells me that the value is useless after a certain point.

59
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.640
It's looking pretty good.

60
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.950
I to rename name patch rectangle.

61
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.290
I'm going to call it suspicion meter container.

62
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.610
Why.

63
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.410
Because we have several elements in the guly.

64
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.750
By the time the Games finished we can have an area for loot.

65
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.540
If were carrying it we can have an optional one for objectives if you wanted and we're going to have

66
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.510
a place that counts how many disguises we have.

67
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.620
That's right by the end of the game we're going to have dyskinesias we can use specifically we're going

68
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.870
to disguise ourselves as boxes because that's traditional stuff go.

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.770
We now have a pretty good looking.

70
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.880
Little container here because we've told you at the bottom right and it's anchored correctly wherever

71
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.730
I Reece's the screen to or however resize the screen that's going to look OK.

72
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.010
This next bit take me about six takes because I keep saying suspicion meter container wrong.

73
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.260
So maybe I don't want to call it suspicion me to container let's call it suspicion container.

74
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.490
His eyes my suspicion.

75
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.470
I think it is.

76
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.140
Let's find out.

77
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.000
I guess we have this lovely little girly element here.

78
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.090
Let's put some stuff in it.

79
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.390
So what I want is the word suspicion on the left and some sort of progress indicator on the right.

80
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.710
So start by making a centre container.

81
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.030
What I'm doing this so the whatever putting it in is going to be centred within this box.

82
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.280
This will be important later.

83
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.620
So let's do the lay out and make this fall rectangle.

84
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.080
OK.

85
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.140
So now whatever elements we put as a child of centre container will be centred here within this.

86
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.080
I'm going to use a split container.

87
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.350
Now whatever we put in here is going to split horizontally.

88
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.800
So the first thing will be the left.

89
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.720
Second thing would be to the right of that.

90
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.080
And the more things we add the more it'll try and fit in.

91
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.180
You'll notice right now by the way it's got nothing in there.

92
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.910
It'll fill it.

93
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.850
Don't worry.

94
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.280
Let's put it in a new child label of a split container and that's going to be a label and would put

95
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.480
a theme for our labels.

96
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.690
Let's load our theme I'm using label by the way because we said that to be a smaller text and white

97
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.840
as opposed to a rich text label which will be in black I white will look better against this background.

98
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.610
Alice give us Tex So suspicion.

99
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.490
Great.

100
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.360
Next back to the container and I'm going to add a texture progress texture.

101
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.770
Progress is a special kind of node you touch.

102
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.500
You give it a couple of different textures or three textures if you're feeling really fancy and it knows

103
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.010
which one is zero and which one is full.

104
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.960
And then it'll move between them.

105
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.490
So let's use texture progress.

106
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.590
I'll show you what I mean.

107
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.590
First went to load in a texture so let's press textures and use these dots were all they do.

108
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.200
Here they are.

109
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.730
I won't use these dots my under texture is what zero looks like so let's use dot shadow for this my

110
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.800
progress texture is going to be red.

111
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.520
You'll notice by the way nothing is changed.

112
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.180
I'm not using over at all.

113
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.910
If you wanted to use some sort of overlay that's how you use.

114
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.250
Right now I'm not using it but if you want to do that's where you do it.

115
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.230
Right now our minimum zero hour maximum is a hundred and step is one so it knows that every time we

116
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.750
add anything at it by 1.

117
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.320
So if I type 50 it's half full.

118
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.490
If I type 25 It's a quarter wet full and I don't know 80.

119
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.520
No way.

120
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.990
Now if I press play.

121
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.540
You can see what this looks like.

122
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.360
So at zero it's going to be all the way to the left and it forces me away there.

123
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.220
I also have this nice little split that I should probably hide let's hide that it's got a bit container.

124
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.360
Click on mouse.

125
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:25.320
Well just to ignore what that means is when to press play again the mouse isn't going to see that container.

126
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.960
Now this is great but I'm not looking for a left to right progression I come like a clockwise progression

127
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.810
and to do that I no my texture progress and right here foulmouthed you have all these options.

128
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.090
So left to right right to left top to bottom.

129
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.880
I want clockwise.

130
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.480
So this is 80 percent.

131
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.540
Yeah that's great.

132
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.350
Now you will notice that while they succeed in game because when any detection code and even if I walk

133
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.520
up to these lamps right now it doesn't know what this control does.

134
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.230
I'm standing in the red light nothing's happening.

135
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.660
What if I want to see what this looks like a various values.

136
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.440
If I go to the inspector and type in 25.

137
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:12.520
The game doesn't update Here's how you make it update first go to the debug menu and WC sync scene changes

138
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.870
and sync script changes sync script changes would be if I wanted to change something in the script and

139
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.320
see what looks like an Life game I'd use that.

140
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.970
I want to see will happen if I change anything in the scenery when inspectors on a sync scene changes.

141
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.240
And now I'm looking again at 25.

142
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.490
Is 25 percent but 50 50 percent.

143
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:40.820
If I type 100 that's full and zero loops and zero is zero.

144
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.950
Fantastic.

145
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.970
So that brings us to the challenge.

146
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.490
I'd like you to set of your own version of suspicion to.

147
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.980
Feel free to use the same settings.

148
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.910
We have the play around with it first.

149
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.340
Maybe you want left to right or bottom to top.

150
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.690
Maybe you don't want circles.

151
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.850
Maybe you want I don't know icons.

152
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.060
Feel free to use your own texture's but set an under and a progress texture and then share your progress

153
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.930
with the community.

154
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.970
Maybe you want your goofy to be in a different place.

155
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.760
Personalize.

156
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.350
Let's make this your game so pause the video and when you come back I'll wrap up this video.

157
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:21.360
And what Welcome back in this video we looked at how to make texture progress notes work.

158
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.820
They're great fantastic for health bars stamina bars or suspicion meters.

159
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:31.030
We've also looked at how to change inspector values and see the changes in a life game.

160
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.580
So great work and are suing the next video.
