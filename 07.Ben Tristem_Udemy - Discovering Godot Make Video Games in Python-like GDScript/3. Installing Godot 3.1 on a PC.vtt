00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.490
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.560
Gloria's got our people.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.610
Let's go and grab.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.910
Got a three point one.

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.150
Assuming we're on a P.C. from a Mac you should watch Ben's video on how to download on a Mac.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.540
If you're on Linux it's very similar to the Mac.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.210
P.S. about you know with a different tab talking different tabs let's look at our options.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.310
If I want to grab got a three point one.

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.410
There's a couple of questions I want to ask.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.920
I want to ask do I want to get it from gotto engine dot org or steam.

11
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.280
I'll show you both and talk about the pros and cons.

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.200
I also want to ask myself Am I going to be using C sharp.

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.160
So let's go over to my desktop.

14
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.960
Hello desktop.

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.270
And I'm going to open steam his steam.

16
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.190
Currently there's a Sega publisher weekend Halo Sega and I'm sure I've been gotto and press enter in

17
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.830
the search and write the top here got engine free to play for download here I can just use now if it

18
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.650
doesn't say use announced because you haven't already done a lot in the past.

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.150
But if I press this and say Oh it's gonna take me two minutes probably take me less than that to be

20
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.640
honest and it'll start downloading.

21
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
The advantage here is that we'll update automatically.

22
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.110
It's good to go.

23
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.170
You don't have to do anything.

24
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.630
It'll also download all the example templates which also means that you're downloading more than you

25
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.620
need to.

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.190
The disadvantage is that the steam version doesn't get updated as quickly as the main page version.

27
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.870
It takes a few extra days so there's a new big version for instance three point one was officially released

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.090
two days ago but it just went live on steam today.

29
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.280
So it has a big version and you're on Steam you might need to wait a little.

30
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.870
A guy is just about done and you can see this is a five hundred and forty four Meg download tiny it's

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.760
half a gig for press launch he has got to go and hear all of the demo projects we can use as well as

32
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.770
some templates.

33
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.280
Right.

34
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.150
There's a lot of stuff being downloaded.

35
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.350
Well what if I told you Steve.

36
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.640
Well let's close time let's open browser.

37
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.300
So I'm going to open my browser and right here I've got to go.

38
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.640
Engine dot org and I just want to get a download and it should detect my operating system so it knows

39
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.620
I'm on windows specifically Windows 10 and I have a couple of choices do I want the standard version

40
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.770
that's going to allow me just to write in Judy's script or do I want the Mono version which includes

41
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.540
C sharp if you do want the C sharp version which is recommended if you want to learn C sharp do read

42
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.790
the right the 30 bit mono libraries do not run on a 64 bit Windows system.

43
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.690
So at the time of recording if you have a 64 bit machine you must download the 64 bit Mono version if

44
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.340
you want one.

45
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.850
If you don't want mono you could download the 32 bit if you want.

46
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.680
I don't see the point if you have a 64 bit machine.

47
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.960
You also need to make sure that for the mono build you have M.S. build all right.

48
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.210
So I'm going to get my standard 64 bit version and if I wanted the Linux version I'd go to Linux.

49
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.360
There it is but I don't use the windows because this particular machine is a Windows machine anima hit

50
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.610
64 bit and it can say well your savior will save the desktop go and it's going to take oh it's done.

51
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.780
Now the reason is it's not downloading all those other projects right there's no templates but if I

52
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.190
go over to the zip file this just downloaded right here and I open it.

53
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.370
There's a little EMC you're going to do.

54
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.880
I'm going to copy this and open my actual got a folder which I emptied for the purpose this recording

55
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.270
I want a piece that there and you might be thinking OK so I've got it.

56
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.570
Where's the rest the far right this is 51 Meg.

57
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.820
That's a very small file.

58
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.020
So next up how do we compile this how to get it ready.

59
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.150
And the answer is you don't.

60
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.730
It is ready.

61
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.080
You double click at and he's got it ready to go with all my projects going on.

62
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.150
Which brings me to the challenge.

63
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.240
I'd like you to download.

64
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.600
Got a three point one.

65
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.310
Figure out you really have got an engine or from steam.

66
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.820
Figure out for the C shop do note by the way if you do want to use the Mono version if you want to use

67
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.690
C sharp as a programming language it won't work in steam currently.

68
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.270
So you will have to go through the engine I've provided links for the Gollum engine in the resources

69
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.600
this lecture so post the video download it.

70
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.890
And when you come back we'll wrap this up

71
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.950
and welcome back.

72
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.300
Right.

73
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.090
We've got gateau.

74
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.480
We're ready to go in the next video or at least the next one I'm going to teach.

75
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.470
We're going to introduce ourselves to go to do have a go and learn about variables.

76
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.720
So great stuff and I will see you in the next video.
