00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.310
Welcome back delightful God.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.620
People in this video.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.490
Let's make the gooey actually work.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.660
This lovely interface.

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.520
Let's update it.

6
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.630
When the bunny loses a life.

7
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.630
So what do we need to do.

8
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.010
Well we need to create an update gooey function.

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.390
Then we need to display the current number of lives to the player in an update the gooey whenever bunnies.

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.930
Let's get to it.

11
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.680
Here we are.

12
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.770
And I'm going to go to camera and into ghillie and I'm just going to create a new function within the

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.740
Ghostscript So the function is going to be called update.

14
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.610
What do we want to do.

15
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.040
Well we want to update the text in life count.

16
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.630
That's our life count right.

17
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.180
That's what we're updating.

18
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.910
So let's.

19
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.130
Let's grab it by going.

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.930
Life counts.

21
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.570
Dot text equals.

22
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.050
What does it equal.

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.340
There's a couple of ways we could do this.

24
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.170
We could go global dots game States dot lives.

25
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.380
That's the lives variable here.

26
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.750
I really don't like doing that.

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.460
You want to avoid turning individual variables into global variables unless they really want to be.

28
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.460
Yes you can call things globally like this but that's not why we designed this global script.

29
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.340
So instead let's just call lives.

30
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.370
I'm going to call lies as an argument into the script.

31
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.240
Now the lives is going to come from this variable but this variable is an integer and text needs a string

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.060
so let's cast it as a string.

33
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.270
So using C S T R and brackets I can turn this value into a string and display it.

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.290
So now let's create this function here.

35
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.160
So I function as above.

36
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.080
Hurt feels like it should be one of the first that's happened and I'm going to create another function

37
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.660
called Update gooey and this one is with in game state.

38
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.870
It's the same name.

39
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.550
It's a different function.

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.000
Now I would do the challenge a little bit early this time.

41
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.350
I would like you to connect the update gooey I've just made to the gooey in the gooey script.

42
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.740
In other words when update gooey is calling game state g d it should trigger update gyuri in the gooey

43
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.810
script.

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.050
Pause the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

45
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.530
Like Mack.

46
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.640
So let's go global dots go sort of date.

47
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.700
GO.

48
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.630
THERE IT IS.

49
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.660
And we've got a past lives into it because that's what it's expecting right.

50
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.000
It wants those lives.

51
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.650
Okay.

52
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.970
That should be enough but let's make sure we actually cause functions so update.

53
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.500
And that should be it.

54
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.470
That should be all we need to do.

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.070
So when we start again.

56
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.210
We have three lives.

57
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.520
Look at that now.

58
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.170
What we haven't done is connect hurt to it so let's do that real quick.

59
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.210
Let's head down to hurt and we will go update gooey and now press play.

60
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.020
We'll start with the cranium of lives and will lose life.

61
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.630
Every time we take damage and if we have less than zero.

62
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.970
The game's up.

63
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.160
Awesome.

64
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.830
Now there is one thing I would quite like to change.

65
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.150
There is whereas it in the Gooly there is this thing here there's no gap between the zero and the bunny.

66
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.700
And I would quite like to put one here but it's automatically being centred.

67
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.180
I'd like to thank Derek also known as Clay Aiken in our discord for this solution.

68
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.540
We can put something here and this twoness Alpha is transparency or it's a passage rather all the way

69
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.390
down.

70
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.290
And that create a separate force so let's do that.

71
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.960
Let's bring in a copy of the life Bunny.

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.480
I mean duplicate the book come back.

73
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.680
My duplicate that and remove it right here to scan at the set is going to work as a separator.

74
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.170
And then what am I to do.

75
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.140
We'll rename it to separator which may be spelt wrong.

76
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.270
I'm not entirely sure.

77
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.340
Oh no.

78
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.470
Good out of visibility an inspector modulate just like we did with colour.

79
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.200
But this someone modulate the alpha.

80
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.360
There we go and put expand on so I can actually scale it.

81
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.970
Minimum size will be 32.

82
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.540
Yeah.

83
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.710
Looks pretty good.

84
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.890
Let's see how that works out.

85
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.860
And then we look at that beautiful separation and it just looks seamless.

86
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.090
Which brings us to the end of the video.

87
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.950
In this video nice the symbol We've been connecting the lives to the gooley.

88
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.590
We'll update them every time the close her and we've done with very little code.

89
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.810
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
