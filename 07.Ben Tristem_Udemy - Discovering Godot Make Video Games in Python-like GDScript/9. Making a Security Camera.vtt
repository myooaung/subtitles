00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.460
Welcome back you delightful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.780
We're going to make our first NPC.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.510
We don't make a security camera.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.600
What do we need.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.490
The security camera.

6
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.290
Well the good news is this is the most basic form of NBC going to have because it's going to have no

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.250
movement code no navigation no pathfinding nothing like that.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.260
It's just got to sit there and rotate left and right slowly.

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.060
Great.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.110
This is going to allow us to detect player.

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.820
Now we're not going to set up player detection in this video.

12
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.840
It's going to come later.

13
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.530
We're going to do now is set the stage for when we get things ready.

14
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.920
So let's do that before we get into it.

15
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.690
Can I make this a little bit easier to use so I'm going to go to canvas modulate and make it invisible

16
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.390
still there.

17
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.010
I've just toggled visibility second thing and I really want the character node in here some scanner.

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.140
Right click on that and go delete node.

19
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.980
We still have it in our folders it's still difficult scenes and characters.

20
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.620
There it is.

21
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.810
It's just not in the scenery.

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.750
Then I'm going to open the pliocene and I'm going to move the torch from it because a player isn't actually

23
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.610
going to have a torch.

24
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.650
Let's make sure that doesn't crash anything.

25
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.760
So now into the play a script.

26
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.320
And I'm going to remove everything we did with the torch.

27
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.640
She's going to delete that.

28
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.970
If you'd rather not delete it you could comment that out so show what that looks like.

29
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.460
Everything is controlled.

30
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.970
K on ABC that just has to comment.

31
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.520
But I don't need this and we didn't do enough for me to really worry about it.

32
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.330
Let's just delete it for now.

33
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.680
Save that and go back to to leave you.

34
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.460
And we now have a player in a big empty warehouse.

35
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.150
Awesome.

36
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.820
Let's make a security camera.

37
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.200
Security camera is going to be a new scene now we could do what we did with player in character and

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.670
just have the body that's going to be there as the root.

39
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.530
However let's take a moment to think about what the camera's going to look like.

40
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.660
I'm picturing one of these cameras here.

41
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.210
We have this lens here that can see the player.

42
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.700
It's going to rotate left and right like this these cameras.

43
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.440
Have a little arm thing that they pivot on.

44
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.020
So here's the pivot and it rotates around this access and it attaches to the wall and here slot player.

45
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.510
And he's very sneaky.

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.380
Very sneaky player.

47
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.920
And you know what.

48
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.540
It's probably.

49
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080
So here's Bob and he's sneaking around the place.

50
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.960
Good job Bob.

51
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.930
Bob you seem to have developed a body.

52
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.880
It's fine when trying to make here is if the camera is the root here.

53
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.700
So let's say I make an area to see for example and I set this to rotate left and right.

54
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.530
That rotation is going to be relative to its parent.

55
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.570
So if I put an area to D and then the arm and the rest of the sprite's here they're all going to rotate

56
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.810
and their position rotation is going to be relative to the parent which is going to be the level that's

57
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.340
going to cause all kinds of bugs.

58
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.650
So I'm not going to do that and delete this node and instead I'm going to make a No 2 D is my parent

59
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.540
node.

60
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.810
This security camera

61
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080
I'm not going to put a space on it.

62
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.760
Great.

63
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.870
There's my security camera out.

64
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.690
Okay let's put in the arm.

65
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.570
This is going to be a Sprite and I'm going to go into graphics and underpin G and tiles you'll find

66
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.760
a bunch of tiles.

67
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.830
And one would do and they use this one tile 463.

68
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.520
This is actually going to be our door Sprite but a repurposed sollis drag that over there that's going

69
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.440
to be kind of chunky That's roughly the same size.

70
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.230
The player isn't.

71
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.240
So let's make that small on a transform let's do point to five point five that looks pretty good for

72
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.600
now we can always tweak it later.

73
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.250
Save that under scenes.

74
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.930
Great.

75
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.390
What needs to happen.

76
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.880
Well we need a brand new body let's do for now an area to day say for now because this is going to change

77
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.170
later.

78
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.190
But to show you why let's make the mistake first.

79
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.620
And this is going to be a direct child of security camera not of Sprint vehicle.

80
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.260
This camera body.

81
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.270
Camera body is going to need a sprite.

82
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.640
Give that a sprite.

83
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.660
And I going to repurpose this old school CRT monitor this cathode ray tube monitor it cos if I rotate

84
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.780
that and transform this or take you and make it agrees and then scale it up point twenty five point

85
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.560
seven five point five.

86
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.190
And let's just move you.

87
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.280
At stancil a good case of point seven five on the y axis.

88
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.980
No.

89
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.140
Oh it's rotated.

90
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.050
I'm not thinking the rotations try to on point five on the y.

91
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.230
It's 75 on the X point five on the X.

92
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.430
That looks like a camera.

93
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.250
Look at that.

94
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.880
We have a security camera.

95
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.310
I want to do is this arm is too far out so I'm just going to make that smaller.

96
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.270
So on the x axis Let's make you point three and it's movie that way.

97
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.410
So you're going move minus five pixels.

98
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.280
The reason I'm doing this is when this rotates.

99
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.630
I don't want the arm peeking out from the camera.

100
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.200
Okay.

101
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.230
That looks like a security camera.

102
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.390
Let's make sure.

103
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.830
Save it.

104
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.600
Come in here.

105
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.530
And another one let's instance it.

106
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.350
So we have scenes up here that security camera somewhere else this move that before we go any further.

107
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.280
So where you on under scenes.

108
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.460
Technically you're a camera.

109
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.520
On a right click and move to scenes characters a character camera is one of the mpac characters.

110
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.430
As instance you in character security camera great ups make sure I move the right thing go and just

111
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.920
to make sure that works for guys to move on.

112
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.290
Let's put you here.

113
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.780
We have a security camera right now it's peeking over the wall.

114
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.230
That's an easy enough fix will do that a little later.

115
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.180
First let's give it the beam of light.

116
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.520
The beam of light is what we're going to use to one see the player and to give the player feedback.

117
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.620
This is where you are seeing stealth games work when players have more information than they would normally

118
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.800
have so you can see lines of sight.

119
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.050
That's how I do it.

120
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.810
To do that I'm going for instance in the torch.

121
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.040
So click on camera body instance in your torture scene or flashlight depending on what you called it.

122
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.870
I'm calling it torch a couple things if I press save and go back in you'll see this light is way too

123
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.880
big and it's coming from over here.

124
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.770
Well wait how big is an easy fix called torch and on texture ask not touch a scale on transform.

125
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.760
There it is.

126
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.000
We want to set the scale down by half.

127
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.990
Now look good as find out that looks a lot more reasonable.

128
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.460
Now let's move at such a move the whole torch shooty over to here

129
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.930
safe.

130
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.300
Looking good now.

131
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.580
I've just made a really bad mistake to show you a switch on canvas much lately in this nice easy Pressplay.

132
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.400
So far so good.

133
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.550
Right.

134
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.340
We're not crashing.

135
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.290
But look what happens when I move in.

136
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.450
Well that looks great until here.

137
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:27.510
Do you remember when I told you that like to dinos calculate the light from their zero position.

138
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.420
Not from the texture.

139
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.200
So what's happening is it's using the texture with given it but it's actually calculating from this

140
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.180
point here.

141
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.590
I shouldn't have moved the light to decode.

142
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.540
I should have offset the texture.

143
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.320
So let's do that let's go back into a security camera thing and let's move the position back to zero.

144
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.850
And now let's offset the texture.

145
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:56.560
So this texture I happen to know that I want to move this by 365 pixels wide of 365 pixels because a

146
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.620
little more than halfway.

147
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:04.630
So 365 puts me right here and then let's get to me now when I go back in it looks a little like it did

148
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:11.590
before against a little far maybe 365 was a bit overzealous house 360 suit you not thirty three sixty

149
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.410
three sixty look better.

150
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.570
May I say that.

151
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.480
360 six get less Pressplay.

152
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.480
Now.

153
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:30.600
The shadows are being calculated from the right place which is a lot more like it.

154
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.160
So we have the beginning of our camera but right now it's a street light.

155
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.340
We want to move left and right which is my challenge to you.

156
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.330
I'd like you to try and get the camera rotating left and right over a few seconds.

157
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.870
So in my mind of seeing like a 12 second loop.

158
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.950
So this is going to go left wait go right wait and loop.

159
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:58.530
And for me that loops about 12 seconds but you can tweak that and I'm thinking left by 30 degrees right

160
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.150
by 30 degrees so we have a nice.

161
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.950
What would that be a 60 degree arc.

162
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.940
I can't see that my head but there's a few different ways you could solve this.

163
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.360
Suppose the video when you're happy with the results unpause it and I'll show you my solution.

164
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.900
And welcome back.

165
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.820
Okay.

166
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.990
There's a couple of ways you could do this.

167
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:23.240
You could do this in code you could use something like a tween node or a timer and move from there.

168
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.710
I'm not going to do that.

169
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.530
I'm going to use the animation player because that means I don't have to play too much with numbers.

170
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.650
I could just plug it in and it'll work.

171
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.050
So let's go to a security camera and as a child of camera body weight camera body needs a collision

172
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.690
shape is this particular shape.

173
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.290
In fact the collision shape

174
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.250
right now it doesn't matter what this relationship is but it does need to be there.

175
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.900
So let's just give it a rectangle.

176
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.560
Doesn't matter.

177
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.690
No colliding with it.

178
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.300
OK.

179
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.560
Now I promise back to it.

180
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.010
What are we doing we are doing an animation player.

181
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.650
There we go.

182
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.350
Okay I wanna make a new animation.

183
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:05.900
I they call this security camera scan scan left and scanned right.

184
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.330
And I said what 12 seconds and I'm feeling two second steps that feels good.

185
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.350
What's going to do.

186
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.680
It's going to rotate.

187
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.330
Camera body and because camera body is a child of security camera.

188
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.780
It'll rotate and work fine.

189
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.030
I'm going to put player detection on the camera body.

190
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.610
What I need to do is create a brand new track.

191
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.670
So I just need the rotation.

192
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.290
I don't need scale on location.

193
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.780
Make that key.

194
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.400
And let's zoom out of it's excellent day.

195
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.510
I'm thinking of the first two seconds you should be to the left.

196
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.990
So rotation degrees minus 30.

197
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.860
But a key two seconds in repeat the key.

198
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.340
It's going to take two seconds to get the centre two seconds to get to the right.

199
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.250
So at the six second mark I will go 30.

200
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.910
Pick a key and eight seconds.

201
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.060
Make a key.

202
00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:02.320
That's all I need to do now is just to loop it and auto play it because if it's looping it's going to

203
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.370
take four seconds to get back to this position so let's look.

204
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.420
See alagoas.

205
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.770
I looking pretty good.

206
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.910
And then it loops back and it'll just keep going for.

207
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.600
Great.

208
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.430
So now we save that.

209
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.840
I press play.

210
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.210
We have a working camera that has lights that update.

211
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.310
And give wonderful shadowfax Couple of things I want to do.

212
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.190
First off the player is very dark.

213
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.050
If I make the scene any darker.

214
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.910
The players not police able to see their own character.

215
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.060
So let's fix that is going to player make a light to denote.

216
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:59.410
And what I want to do is I go into my graphics folder into hitman and I only use the player's texture

217
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.850
as it's like map.

218
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.760
So now we press play.

219
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.900
The player can see themselves.

220
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.790
Not bad.

221
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.270
As a couple of other ways we could do that but I quite like the solution because the players like map

222
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.220
is the same as its texture.

223
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.280
It will only light things that are in there and a like them by that colour because the only thing that

224
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.680
can enter the play is itself.

225
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.390
That's great.

226
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.060
One more thing we need to do.

227
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.720
We've started playing with collisions.

228
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.370
Let's set up some collision layers.

229
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.200
It's a good time to do so in project settings going to scroll down to see today physics and it's make

230
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:46.950
some black names where one player layer two walls Layer three is gong to be security cameras.

231
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.620
Now there are more layers we'll be using later but I'm not going to put them in yet.

232
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.990
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

233
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.450
It's designed for what we need rather than what we think we might want later.

234
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.870
Very quickly let's put things in the correct light walls.

235
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.890
Start there on the tarmac for walls on a collision maps.

236
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.990
They are not players.

237
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.430
They are walls and they can interact with players.

238
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:14.620
Players know how to play a scene to make sure that I change all instances of player and make sure I'm

239
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.870
on the actual player node because that's where the collision information is on the physics body to me.

240
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.820
You are a player and you don't interact with players you interact with walls.

241
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.330
Why don't you interact with players.

242
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.190
But checking if I put in something else and forget to change its collision layer this will mean that

243
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.010
I walk through it and I should be able to spot that.

244
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:41.430
Finally save that security cameras on camera body find the collision there is.

245
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.940
You are not a player you are a security camera and you don't bump into anything.

246
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.380
Looking good.

247
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.190
Pressplay.

248
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.680
Check out a slip on the walls and I can walk through the camera.

249
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.870
I can walk through the camera.

250
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.470
Awesome.

251
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.960
One thing you'll notice is that I'm shedding light through the camera not only my shedding light through

252
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.140
the camera.

253
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.100
The camera is clipping into the wall.

254
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.390
Let's fix that.

255
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.050
I will make a brand new folder so I'm gonna make a new note hoodie.

256
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.130
As a child of the level I call it security cameras.

257
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.200
Let's rename security camera security camera one and put it in.

258
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.000
Drag it in.

259
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.600
And now this is effectively a folder.

260
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.770
So on the do is move it above walls between walls and play it right there.

261
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.570
Finally let's check that we're actually going to rotate properly so I'm going to switch off the canvas

262
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.490
for a moment just disable it.

263
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.730
I need a copy of these cameras at a few different angles make sure the rotation works or duplicate a

264
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.560
camera move it to down here.

265
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.500
That looks good.

266
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:54.520
Transform it rotate by my wrist 90 degrees that's put you right here in the centre.

267
00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:02.950
Duplicate one more of these rotate that by 90 degrees in the positive and put you there.

268
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.360
That looks good.

269
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.270
Should I switch to my canvas modulate Let's do that real quick.

270
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.330
And how's this for an atmosphere.

271
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.920
Look at that.

272
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.690
Awesome.

273
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.310
Again.

274
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.380
Only in the video I said that we're all making this an area to day but that's actually the wrong thing

275
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.350
to do and you could see here have changed it to kinematic body today.

276
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.910
Let's explain why why change it back for now.

277
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.100
Well is my area today.

278
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.120
OK.

279
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:40.040
Area to me camera body is going to get a script and that script is going to extend when herriot from

280
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.880
the character script.

281
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.720
So if I open a character script you'll see why that's important.

282
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.510
Here's my character script.

283
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.640
And you'll see at the top extends kinematic body today.

284
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.790
Now we can do things like this right extend character and that's fantastic.

285
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.460
When all you've got is a type of node.

286
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:05.390
What this means is it has access to all of the functionality of that note.

287
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.410
If we look in closets and we type in kinematic body today.

288
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.580
Other top people will see inherits can mattick what he inherits from a physics body which inherits from

289
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.700
collision object which inherits from note to see if On the other hand we check area to Dean.

290
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:31.000
They are not closely related area too deep would have to be the next one down from kinematic body and

291
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.740
it isn't.

292
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.730
Which means we can't set up script inheritance we want to script inheritance because the whole point

293
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:43.420
of this character Judy is that it's a template that every else extends from to fix this in our camera

294
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.910
with a right click on it.

295
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:51.370
We're going to go change type we're going to select kinematic body tuti now and put the script in It'll

296
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.900
be able to access all of the stuff that kinematic body to do nodes can access.

297
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.610
And that brings us to the end of the video.

298
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.250
We've done quite a lot of good work to get us into a great position for future videos.

299
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:07.530
We've created a brand new mpac with extended the character script but not the character scenes so that

300
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.420
gives us a lot of flexibility and we've paved the way for play the action not only that we've got really

301
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.510
atmospheric moving lights in our game.

302
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.110
So awesome work and I'll see in the next video.
