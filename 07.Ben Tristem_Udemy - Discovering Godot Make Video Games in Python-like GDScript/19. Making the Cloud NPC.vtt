00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.280
Hello you wonderful go to people and welcome back.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.690
In this video we're gonna make a different kind of NPC unlike Spike man this isn't gonna be an NPC that

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.330
hurts when the it touches it.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.640
This is gonna be the NPC that tax when the bunny is in the right place and then flies a projectile.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.280
Let's make a scary cloud that fires lightning.

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.700
Okay let's talk about a cloud NPC cloud NBC isn't going to directly hurt Bunny.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.060
You can move through clouds just fine.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.080
However if bunnies directly underneath the cloud the cloud is going to drop lightning at bunny now you

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.470
can only drop lightning once every few seconds.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.800
That's really important.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.150
Otherwise every frame that bunnies underneath the cloud is going to spawn more lightning.

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.240
And what you end up with is a terrifying wall of lightning and the cloud is going to gently drift left

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.250
and right just like spike around us.

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.530
OK.

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.950
So clearly we should talk about lightning.

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.880
Well lightning I've couldn't hear an NPC I guess is really a hazard.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.540
It's going to drop straight down and it's going to vanish if it hits the terrain or bunny.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.320
Now that means it needs to be able to detect terrain and behave differently depending on what it hits.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.430
It's going to vanish if it's off screen.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.260
We don't want lightning staying around forever if it doesn't hit a platform.

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.700
Right.

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.690
Let's free the resource.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.550
If we don't need it.

24
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.290
And finally it needs to actually hurt Bunny if it hits bunny.

25
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.220
Otherwise it's just a light and lighting effect.

26
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.290
We don't need that.

27
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.120
OK so let's get to it.

28
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350
First thing I need to do is make a brand new scene.

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.330
It can be a 2D scene analytical cloud.

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.680
Now next Monday is going to make a Sprite and under enemies which is graphics and amazing.

31
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.270
Here is a cloud I need to make an animation player.

32
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.050
Boom.

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.460
And back to sprite.

34
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.240
Couple of things I want I want a time a note with penalties before and a brand new one I need a way

35
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.310
of detecting if buddy is there.

36
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:07.520
So let's make a recast that I press CAPS LOCK right recast 2D queries the closest object intersecting

37
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.460
array.

38
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.010
Think of this like a beam of light from an electronic door.

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.260
If something breaks that beam of light it will do something great.

40
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.340
Let's put you in and.

41
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.870
The order doesn't matter.

42
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.900
That works fine.

43
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.510
Now if I zoom in you can see your ray cast as close the animation for now.

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.770
It's a very very short little blue arrow and we can see here right.

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.890
It's casting from its origin 50 pixels down.

46
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.230
Well first off let's move down a bit.

47
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.950
So let's move you down to what you think.

48
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.210
Sixty.

49
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.590
That's pretty good.

50
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.510
It's going to exclude its own parents so it's not going to detect the sprite.

51
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.220
That's good.

52
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.380
And that's clearly not far enough in it.

53
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.030
So let's cast you down to 500.

54
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.720
You know we could probably affirm that and say 750 feels like a nice long area.

55
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.510
One more thing we need to do with a recast and this is really important and really easy to forget if

56
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.810
it's not enabled.

57
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.360
It won't do anything at all.

58
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.660
So let's enable it.

59
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.350
OK now we don't need any kind of collision because we're actually a sprite.

60
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.970
OK.

61
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.370
Clouds can move through things.

62
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.800
That's fine.

63
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.580
What I do want to do is check that this is going to work probably I want to check that when I drift

64
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.990
left and right it's all going to look good.

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.780
So it's doing your animation.

66
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.230
And when the quick clouds drift

67
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.290
and nice long animation for eight seconds I feel less alone.

68
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.500
And we need new tracks back up to its parent.

69
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.290
And the keys are in place because animation player is a child of it.

70
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.520
That's nice.

71
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.690
Let's start with a key of 0 0 on the position.

72
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.270
Fantastic.

73
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.930
And let's say it'll take you let's set the snaps to one second so that the play frame will just be in

74
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.320
my place.

75
00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:03.280
And when you think two seconds to drift let's try it two seconds to drift minus 500 boop and then four

76
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.520
seconds six seconds to drift to positive 500.

77
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.830
Put a key there.

78
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.550
Endless loop it and multiply it.

79
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.620
So here's what we should see go left reasonably fast and immediately go back to the right and immediately

80
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.520
get back to the left

81
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.510
awesome.

82
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.150
That's looking pretty good.

83
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.700
Let's put you back to here so we can place you properly and that's looking pretty shiny to save you

84
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.600
two end pieces as cloud TCM and let's instance one end just to make sure I haven't mess ups on the end

85
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.390
pieces on an instance in a cloud I make sure I got my move to selected and just drag you here and press

86
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.690
play

87
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.890
OK.

88
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.850
Looking pretty good now it's a little hard to see him against the background it's a shame but nothing's

89
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:05.020
gonna work out fine if we wanted to we could modulate the sprite so we could go to visibility and make

90
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.620
it a little bit darker let's see how that looks oh a storm cloud are quite like that yeah.

91
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.560
Here we have a cloud is going to drift left and right and it's not going to do anything is just going

92
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.890
to drift.

93
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.380
Well that's OK.

94
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.540
Now we can make it do things.

95
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.910
But before we do that let's make some lightning so lightning is also gonna be a 2D thing

96
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.180
and it's going to have an area 2D

97
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.000
why is gonna have an error today.

98
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.580
Because it needs to Detective things.

99
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.680
And specifically Bunny and terrain.

100
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.610
So it's going to need some slight collision shape before the collision shape.

101
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.090
Let's put in the icon.

102
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.460
You'll notice there is no lightning on enemies.

103
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.290
I have got sun.

104
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.060
You can't play with that but I'm going to just have a cloud and other particles you'll see.

105
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.070
There are two different lightning a blue and a yellow awesome.

106
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.280
So let's make an animated sprite.

107
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.630
And a brand new Sprite frame.

108
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.730
Click on sprite frame.

109
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.260
And here we go.

110
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.500
Drag those in here playing and that's looking pretty solid.

111
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.110
OK.

112
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.590
Save you as lightning.

113
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.720
You can be an NPC for now.

114
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.640
That's fine.

115
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.290
And let's go back to our area 2D and make sure collisions are correct.

116
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.760
So what are you.

117
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.630
You are not a player you are a hazard.

118
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.660
We can actually take it entirely off the collision and that's fine.

119
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.970
But we needed to detect player and terrain very important it needs to take both.

120
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.640
Let's actually put the collision shape in all this isn't going to do anything.

121
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.400
So collision shape and this can be a nice simple rectangle.

122
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.130
So here is a rectangle shape.

123
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.540
Zoom in and get this more or less right.

124
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.910
In fact that's pretty close to perfect isn't it.

125
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.710
And we can now hide that that we now have collision shape.

126
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.410
Awesome.

127
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.090
One more thing I do want to put in and I'm going to put this as a child of the area.

128
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.200
Beauty is a visibility notifiable.

129
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.930
This is a really useful note.

130
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.750
This is going to do is detect when we're on or off screen and we can use a signal right here.

131
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.200
Does he screen entered and screen exited.

132
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.350
That's the one we want when this signal triggers it's going to destroy the lightning entirely.

133
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.090
Okay so let's add a script of the clouds back to cloud and I'm going to add this on the actual cloud

134
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.490
parent and that's nice and easy.

135
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.430
There we go.

136
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.940
And the first thing to do is figure out if the right cast is colliding while we do this every frame

137
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.370
so function of process.

138
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.590
We don't need to be doing physics process at this point and we're going to get the right cast node and

139
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.450
use a built in function called is colliding.

140
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.570
Now we've set the right course up properly.

141
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.840
It can only collide with the player right.

142
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.170
So the recast not the lightning the right cast is only going to take the player and I should make this

143
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.500
an F segment so if the right cast is colliding.

144
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.910
Fire.

145
00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:02.720
Okay so now let's make it for function call fire and what this wants to do is it wants to spawn a brand

146
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.060
new node as a child of either the Sprite or the to studio.

147
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:14.540
Let me get a child of the right custody so let's add child add child is going to add a resource as a

148
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.310
node to the same tree.

149
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.070
So one thing to do is tell it what I want to add.

150
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.480
Well I want to add doo doo doo doo doo on the embassy's the lightning scene.

151
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.020
Well that is a string so that's not going to work.

152
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.300
So instead of adding a string let's cast it as an actual resource.

153
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.090
Now at the moment it's saying well wait you've got a resource here.

154
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.980
I need a node.

155
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:42.050
Okay so we're going to add you in as an instance and that should get rid of the error messages.

156
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.760
So just talk us through what's happening.

157
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.780
We are casting this string as a resource and then we're saying Okay now load in a single instance of

158
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.770
that resource.

159
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.630
In other words load the scene but load a copy of the scene as a node in this tree.

160
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.380
However I don't want it to load for the cloud because cloud is going to be in a different position from

161
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.060
sprite.

162
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.410
Okay so instead let's load this in.

163
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:13.210
As a child of recast 2D so sprite recast 2D dot at Child load.

164
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.100
Yeah yeah yeah.

165
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.130
And that should just load some lightning.

166
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.670
Well let's check if I press play.

167
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.190
Okay so here's a cloud and two things.

168
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.840
One you'll notice the lightning is the same color as the cloud.

169
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.210
That's okay I'll show how to fix it the second to the lightning is drifting left and right.

170
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.660
We actually don't want that but we can fix that too.

171
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.680
Okay.

172
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.310
First things first let's fix this lightning color.

173
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.380
I shouldn't have used modulate I should have used self modulate.

174
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.190
What's the difference.

175
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.560
Modulate is going to change itself and all of its children.

176
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.670
Lightning is now a child of recast 2D was used just charter sprite.

177
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.820
So instead let's clear that and just make self like an ice Gray.

178
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.640
Now one of us play the lightning should be its original color.

179
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.420
Very nice for the second one.

180
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.040
Let's put a script on lightning so bring your script.

181
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.420
You could be called Lightning G.D..

182
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.860
That's good.

183
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.770
Thankfully one day is all function ready.

184
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:15.580
I'm going to use a command call set as top level can enable that.

185
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.230
And all this does is say don't inherit position information from your parent.

186
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.530
Okay now that's going to be a little annoying and I'll show you why

187
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.680
my lightning didn't show up as it did.

188
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.270
It's up here.

189
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.250
Look it spawned a 0 0.

190
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.510
Okay so I'm gonna do that.

191
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.940
The next thing to do is set my global position.

192
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.740
Global Position is like position but it doesn't from the parent.

193
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.090
It's just what is my absolute position.

194
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.070
Okay so we need to know what's the global position of the ray me.

195
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.730
That's where you're coming in and that's going to be the parent of this lightning.

196
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.680
So get parents dots global position

197
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.650
and now when I press play

198
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.440
there's a whole bunch of lightning.

199
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.390
Okay so one more thing we need to do.

200
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.610
I want to make sure we only fire when we can.

201
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.920
So here's our timer and it's set to.

202
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.310
What is that.

203
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.030
One second.

204
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.210
Very nice.

205
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:24.150
Okay so we make a global variable here called time out and then set that to false add on fire.

206
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.850
Well check if we're in time out.

207
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:34.560
So if not time out then you can spawn the lightning and the lightning war event itself.

208
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.410
Then I want to start the time as a timer not start

209
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.510
this be a one shot timers the moment it finishes the moment it finishes it'll go to zero otherwise it'll

210
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:56.140
keep looping and looping and looping which can be weird and then we're just going to set timeout equals

211
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.350
true.

212
00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:58.880
All right.

213
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:04.630
So right now it'll fire and then set the timeout but we need to actually set a signal here don't we.

214
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:12.320
So let's make a new signal called time out connect that to the cloud and Oh and do here is put time

215
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.740
out he calls false.

216
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.340
Let's take a look.

217
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.320
One every second.

218
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.200
Look at that beautiful.

219
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.280
That's everything we need for the cloud.

220
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.010
Now let's make the lightning much more awesome.

221
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.600
First thing I do is I'm going to make this visibility notify work.

222
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.840
That seems to be the easiest thing.

223
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.600
So let's do a screen exited and connect you to lightning.

224
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.390
Nice and easy.

225
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.750
If you screen you going to cue free.

226
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:52.180
Let's just check that so piece of lightning rain lovely and very carefully make it over here and now

227
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.600
that piece of lightning should be gonna take a look Yep it's gone awesome.

228
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.410
Just what we needed saying we got to move the lightning down so let's make a function.

229
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.130
Process

230
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:13.350
and all I do is set my y position so position dot y plus equals.

231
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:21.520
I mean your speed for this don't we don't make a constant called speed and constant speed equals we

232
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.810
think 200.

233
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.840
Okay so plus equals that be heading down I had to check them ahead.

234
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:32.500
Now be careful when not using move in slide Move and slide automatically uses deltas lets you speed.

235
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.540
Times Delta.

236
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.390
Why.

237
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.180
Because I wanted to be the same no matter the frame rate.

238
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.080
So let's take a look at that

239
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.060
look at that.

240
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.870
It's falling.

241
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.090
We have falling lightening on are so lovely.

242
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.560
Okay.

243
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.500
We have falling lightning.

244
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.960
I'm happy with that.

245
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.480
Next thing we need to do is we need to check if you're colliding and we do this every frame.

246
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.950
Let's make a new function called manage collision

247
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:04.060
so right here in New function called manage collision function manage collision feels like there should

248
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.710
be a better name for that and they mean things is hard.

249
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.530
OK.

250
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.910
And I don't need the output.

251
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.850
What do we need to do here.

252
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.140
Well let's make a new variable called collider.

253
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.160
The thing that is colliding.

254
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.110
And that's going to be in the area 2D because this was going to detect the collision and it's going

255
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.570
to be get overlapping bodies.

256
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.900
What is get overlapping bodies do exactly what you might expect if we take a look at the documentation

257
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.500
returns a list of intersecting physics body 2D which is handy because our tile map is made of static

258
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.040
bodies.

259
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:36.620
Right.

260
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.870
And that's a physics body.

261
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.590
So it's going to return a list of bunnies and tiles.

262
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.180
Great.

263
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:48.430
Now I want to use a for loop for objects in collider.

264
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.360
So what's this going to do.

265
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:54.310
Well it's going to make a new conditional check is very much like an if condition.

266
00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:00.070
But what it's doing is it's it's creating a new variable called object and the object is whatever is

267
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.080
inside Collider.

268
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.940
And now we need to do is check what that is.

269
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:13.630
So if object dot name equal equal because remember I'm checking not setting clear which is a string

270
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.060
let's just check this works out each

271
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.950
so now the line is going to drop if it hits the player should get.

272
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.450
Ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch.

273
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:27.990
Great.

274
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.160
Well we don't actually want that to print out.

275
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.790
So what I want to do is go to game state.

276
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.700
We've got a group called game states and we're just going to call HUD.

277
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.530
Let's see how has it does it's an open why hazard script to do to do.

278
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.660
I'm just gonna copy this comment right here get tree core group game state hut.

279
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.550
Great.

280
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.830
You can live right there.

281
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.890
Now no matter what is colliding with it we want this to cue free.

282
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.920
I mean go back to this level right here and I'm going to queue free.

283
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.920
So if it's a player hurt the player no matter what.

284
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.840
Remove the lightning.

285
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:05.100
Okay.

286
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.020
So that should work.

287
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.850
So now if we get the lightning to hit the floor it'll just vanish.

288
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.410
Great.

289
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.750
If we get the lady to Bunny doo doo doo.

290
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.630
Very patient very patient and out.

291
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.820
Awesome.

292
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.910
I could probably speed this up a little bit.

293
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.180
Those guys who lightning and chain you to 300.

294
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.590
I feel like that's more exciting

295
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:31.360
yeah.

296
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.340
It's looking pretty good.

297
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.790
And that is a fully functional he's a lightning.

298
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.950
Okay.

299
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:36.960
So let's take it here.

300
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.090
So let's do a nice fun easy challenge.

301
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.580
My challenge to you put some clouds around your level.

302
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.820
Now this might not feel like an actual challenge but no I'm asking you to design a compelling game so

303
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:52.740
post a video put 2 3 as many clowns you like you're on the level make it challenging make it fair and

304
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.560
when you come back I'm going to do the same thing.

305
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.250
Welcome back.

306
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:00.600
OK.

307
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.140
Let's put some clouds in.

308
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.410
So I'm ready to leave you.

309
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.630
And let's just duplicate the cloud.

310
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:15.410
Make sure I'm in move mode and I feel like right here would be a nice evil place to do it.

311
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.890
Underneath that the players should be able to see it coming.

312
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.150
Want to get all of these coins and that feels good.

313
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.950
And you know what.

314
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.580
Let's do another one around here somewhere contemporary popular to this area have a nice and high.

315
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.370
That looks good.

316
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.230
Let's see how that feels

317
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.060
out.

318
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.930
I caught lightning.

319
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.200
I was so proud I was secretive.

320
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.030
I'm going to make it all with three out taking damage.

321
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.130
I didn't I got damaged.

322
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.260
But look we did it.

323
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.230
Awesome.

324
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.810
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

325
00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.200
We've looked at how to instance a scene right using add child and using the DOT instance function.

326
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:07.200
We've learned how to use recast 2D nodes and to check what body just entered an area 2D using get overlapping

327
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.010
bodies.

328
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.290
We've also looked at how to use visibility notifies which is kind of fun.

329
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.590
So how's it working out.

330
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.820
How's your level looking shell.

331
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.050
We've got so far I'm really curious to see where guys are coming up with meanwhile great stuff.

332
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.150
And I'll see you on the next video.
