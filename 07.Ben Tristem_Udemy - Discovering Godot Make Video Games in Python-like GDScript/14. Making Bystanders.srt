1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,190
Hello again you marvellous God people.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,660
And this just occurred to me I don't think I've called you Marvellous not before but I have now.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,510
So marvellous God.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,790
People in this video we make some bystanders.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,420
Let me show you what I'm thinking for these bystanders our bystanders are not animated.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,940
I'm using assets like attorneys that have known animation rigged to them that no rigging to them.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,940
They can't move.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,240
They're effectively statues.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,190
They're going to be randomly selected from a pool we're going make a bunch of bystanders and then God

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,480
is going to pick them to do that.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,290
We're just gonna use foul grabber that's one of the reasons why we made it.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,520
And they're going to be sporn on a semi random basis.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,450
We can tell God oh pick a random integer from one to another number and we'll change that number as

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,030
we need to and spawn another bystander when that takes over.

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,390
There are obstacles right.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,120
They're not characters they don't have to inherit from a current class at all.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,540
They're just there to get in the way and make the game play a little more interesting.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,350
You don't always have a clear shot.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,160
OK.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,100
First thing to do is make a bystander scene and to do that let's go take a look in the model's folder

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,960
and in the bystanders subfolder subdirectories whatever you call it you'll see a bunch of mesh some

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,290
females Some are called male.

23
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,090
One is called Woman.

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,730
I'm not sure why this one is different.

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,240
I was going to be doing this one actually.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,620
And these were all supposed to be in the background of a game right so you can imagine if you're doing

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,300
I don't know let's say a racing game you know very fast and there a bunch of figures that go past in

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,020
a blur.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,670
It doesn't matter fenham move.

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,260
But here we are to do things a little bit differently.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
First thing to do is check the scale.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,170
So I'm going to minimize that drag this in this chulalongkorn.

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,660
That's fine.

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,040
It's twice the size it needs to be more or less take that off snap and you just move that close.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,800
And yes she's twice the size so does the check I've got those numbers right.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,760
That's scaled down by zero point five.

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,460
All three axes.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,260
And that's yeah that's about right isn't it.

39
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,300
So we know that our bystanders are going to have to be half the size they're gonna come in that are

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,560
let's make a new scene and make a new template for beisner and all to save in the scenes folder.

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,830
That's good live right here.

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,890
Now I want my bystanders to react to the projectile.

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,450
I want them floating off into the distance.

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm going to make a rigid body as my basner and I'm going to call this bystander template just so I

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,850
don't accidentally use this in the game.

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,950
And let's make a new folder Wally.

47
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:41,200
Here's a new follicle bystanders and a save the bystander template in this folder but put the individual

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,960
bystanders here so that the file can just grab everything in the subfolder gets by so the template is

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,000
going to need a mesh instance and a collision body.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,530
Let's put those two notes in real quick.

51
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,730
Have to do collision shape.

52
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,550
Awesome.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,980
Okay let's put it on mesh.

54
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,830
So back to models to bystanders It doesn't matter which one I pick for now because when I switch them

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,420
out anyway.

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,820
But there they are.

57
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,510
I'm going to scale the meche instance down not the rigid body and not the collisions are just the motion

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,600
sets.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,860
So you are zero point five on all three axes.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,780
Awesome.

61
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,110
Fine let's put a collision shape in an inch.

62
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,940
He's a stat a capsule shape which is going to have to be rotated by 90 degrees on the X I believe.

63
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,780
And I'm thinking as been moved up by that looks like about a meter that's moving up by a metre.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,570
So up on the y axis and then it needs to be scaled down not scaled.

65
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,340
You don't scale we need to change the actual extant.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,010
I should know that by now is there a point five.

67
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,250
Well looking good.

68
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,450
That is pretty much perfect now.

69
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,590
There is a little bit of gap in places but honestly this game isn't that precision right.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,370
There's not going to be any head shots in here.

71
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,780
It's not like we can shoot the Fullerton and have a certain effect happening it's just here is the shape

72
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,550
of the body and they can all share the same collision.

73
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,980
So great you cannot save that in my scenes folder as by stand by standard template.

74
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,030
Which brings me to the challenge.

75
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,960
Another early challenge.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,470
I like these early challenges for this section because I feel like you guys have progressed quite fast

77
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,450
as we first out on a journey so let's see how comfortable you are with this.

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,980
Ignore the little slide thing down here it's not important.

79
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,200
I want you to make more Wice that let's create at least two more.

80
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,770
I'm going to be creating all of them.

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,450
But if he just will read a couple to see how it feels.

82
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,790
That's the minimum you should be using and remember.

83
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,410
Put all of your bystanders in their own fault.

84
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,690
I'll put them all in.

85
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,310
Do do do this.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,210
Bystanders fold everything and he'll get used so Pausa Lydia give that a shot and when you're habu's

87
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,820
your results or you're sick of it and you want see how I do it.

88
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,550
Come back and I'll show you my solution.

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,250
And welcome back.

90
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,010
Hi.

91
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,550
So one of the DO is it a new inherited scene and going to inherit from by set a template.

92
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,020
And now I'm going to go into my model scene.

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,700
Where did you go.

94
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,620
Doo doo doo.

95
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,650
Normal scene models falder into bystanders.

96
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,910
And I'm just going to start reading them so I'm going to rename this running female running.

97
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,620
And that's nice.

98
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:29,830
Any of those words a female running go and I'm going to save this under US scenes.

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,240
Bystanders female running great.

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,350
I'll show you one more.

101
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,050
So let's once again inherit new inherited scene.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,510
It's important I'm inheriting a scene again right.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm not saving him or running as a new thing.

104
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,410
I'm not duplicating it.

105
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,070
All of these are going to inherit from the same scene.

106
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,480
So then all I need to do is change by set a template and anything i change in here will propagate down.

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
So let's do that real quick.

108
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,310
I'm going to drag my feet are standing measure here rename this wanted female stand

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,460
and I'm going to keep my naming conventions the same so it's nice that he's It's your doing and just

110
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,160
save That's save into Bystanders and What to keep doing that for all of them and I could just speed

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,380
up the video while I do it.

112
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,210
But you know what.

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,630
You've seen me do this recently with food so I'm just going to cut forward.

114
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,870
And welcome back.

115
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,950
Okay so I now have all of these new scenes of ormet that I've made all in here.

116
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,900
That's terrible grammar.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,300
I'm looking at Save mail walking in my basic bystanders scene folder.

118
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,630
Language is difficult today.

119
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,770
Let's just check the on here one two three four five six different seats.

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,490
Awesome.

121
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,960
I don't need all these others I'm just going to close all of these.

122
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,260
Now there's a few more things we're going to have in our bystander but I'm going to change the default

123
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,230
by set a template and it's going to propagate everything except what we've explicitly told is different

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,360
which in each of these is just what is the mesh.

125
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,680
Everything else is identical.

126
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,880
And while also the name but that's an important.

127
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,890
So any changes I make will be to buy set a template.

128
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,590
For example I want an audio stream play a 3d.

129
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,550
I want this because I want a sound effect to play when they're hit by projector.

130
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,660
Well don't worry about that in a moment.

131
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm just going to leave that node in there for now.

132
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,780
But first let's make a sport.

133
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,230
I want an object that spawns these things and fires them as if they were bullets.

134
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,500
Right.

135
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,660
So I want a simple she sees a spatial the simplest 3-d node.

136
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,600
It has 3D position and she's going to fight objects.

137
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm going to give it a ammash Just so I can see it in the level right.

138
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,290
This bit isn't it isn't vital but it's helpful.

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,290
And I'm going to use a simple She's the cute mash seems kind of huge.

140
00:07:52,330 --> 00:08:00,200
Not that it matters too much but let's scale that down so size zero point five zero point five bizer

141
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,630
point five that's your size.

142
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,360
Awesome.

143
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,550
So here is our sponsor.

144
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,010
Which I shall name Spooner because it's us Borna.

145
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,670
I will say that in scenes.

146
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Done.

147
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,180
Now I need a couple more things here.

148
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:21,720
The first thing I need is an idea of where Ford is right I want to spawn the bystanders outside of an

149
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,010
eye.

150
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,370
I want to use a position 3D.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,600
We've already use one of these and I'm going to do the exact same thing when they call this forward.

152
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,570
Just like you did before and I'm gonna make sure that this is on the z axis right.

153
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,590
This is vital.

154
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,360
Don't just pick the direction that you think is forward.

155
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,700
Actually use the one that's inside got.

156
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,440
So I want Z forward one meter that looks good.

157
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,630
Great.

158
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,430
So there's my forward one more thing I need.

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,490
I need a timer note.

160
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,670
Let's give that a timer.

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,590
And that I think should be everything we need except for a script.

162
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,260
OK script time let's create a script inside the RIP's folder because reasons called spawn are dodgy.

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,530
Awesome.

164
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,750
Okay I can save this.

165
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,260
And before I go any further I can actually put one in the level so this level will need some filling

166
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,920
out no in a while and it's a little room here in a room to the other side.

167
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,590
But for now let's just put a sponsor in here to make a new simple note.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,330
Might call this spawn so I can keep them all separate.

169
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,340
And let's.

170
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:34,180
Instance in a Spawn's So your scenes and your spawn are and you live say over here.

171
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,600
How's that.

172
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,770
That looks pretty good.

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,730
OK.

174
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,840
I need to know which way forward is don't I.

175
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Let's put edits children on and see where Ford is you see now that forward is going to fire my pieces

176
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,250
that way.

177
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:55,420
I don't want that and fire too into the room putting snap on and rotating this bent like not the forward

178
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:03,410
of the whole thing silly rotating by 90 degrees you are rotated and you are not.

179
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,000
Awesome.

180
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,450
A switch off at Shelter affinia.

181
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,990
Now this will move and be edited for the rest.

182
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,600
This is just the check basic functionality.

183
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,510
What I want is a system where it's going to fire bystanders who are going to walk through the middle.

184
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,020
Once we get later in the game and put no visible collision walls the player can't cross this line.

185
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,940
We'll put some furniture and things is going to yeah our whole level.

186
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,710
But for now let's keep nice and simple.

187
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,670
And keep my sensible.

188
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,050
I'm going back into Scripps.

189
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,220
First thing I need to do is I'm going to have a couple of variables and a bystander speed which is how

190
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,430
fast bystanders go.

191
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,830
I'm about 10 for now.

192
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,630
We can tweak that as needed.

193
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,980
The other thing I need is a maximum wait time.

194
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,280
The max amount of time you can wait before firing the next best and say 5 seconds from now and let's

195
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,100
go into the spawning season so that all the alter completes work nice and easily.

196
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,340
One more thing I do need and this is not an export variable is the actual list of bystanders.

197
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,660
This is going to be a dictionary.

198
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,660
Why a dictionary.

199
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,510
Because many used file grabber and that's typeset file grabber up.

200
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,020
First you need to do is fill thatcherites right so and we use to treat the moment you are brought into

201
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,570
the scene.

202
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,770
Don't worry about anything else in a scene just when you're brought in you need to fill this entry.

203
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,440
Bystanders equals file.

204
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,750
Grab a dot.

205
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:41,380
Get files and then I need a string that points to the right folder which is this one copy path and pace

206
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,980
that it great so that should be good to go.

207
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:51,820
I also need to set the randomise were going to be using random information specifically random numbers.

208
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,410
We need to generate a random seed we need to do this once but we do need to do.

209
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,180
I guess I have this timer here.

210
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,960
I want this wait time to be changed depending on this value and this is going to happen multiple times

211
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:11,380
not just once when add a new function called Set a timer and let's make sure we're actually calling

212
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,910
it in a month.

213
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:18,570
We get to the scene so we're going to do set time as a function highlight what is set time and do well.

214
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,040
It's going to go timer dot wait time.

215
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,060
Equals.

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,420
And now I need a road number.

217
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,890
It's going to be a random integer modulated by maximum wait time.

218
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,850
Now key thing to remember if I look at random integer some kind of hold control in documentation you'll

219
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,750
notice were actually counting from zero right so we counted from position 0 and this many spaces.

220
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,770
So we're not actually counting between 1 and 5 seconds were counting 0 to force.

221
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,810
Let's add that in.

222
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,740
So now it's going to be a random integer modulated by that and add 1.

223
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:04,020
If my max wait time is 5 the lowest number you can have is one and the highest you can have it's five.

224
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,490
That's what I'm looking for.

225
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,600
What do we need to do from here we actually start the timer.

226
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,270
And timer got start into the timer.

227
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,660
Let's make this a one shot.

228
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,760
So it's something to keep repeating.

229
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,050
And let's actually connect it to the script.

230
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,330
So node signal.

231
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,470
So when I connect my time out to the spawn a script and there it is.

232
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,170
Was it going to do it's going to spawn which does not have a spot spawn.

233
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,370
Let's give it then spawn spawn bystander.

234
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:46,370
Great and we're going to go straight back in to set time right so we just got to loops this forever.

235
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,350
All that's left now is to make spot buy stamps.

236
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:56,660
Let's do that function spawn bystander and this is going to be very similar to this flight function.

237
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,470
Going to use actually almost identical code but I'm not going to copy paste it and then write it out

238
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,220
variable bystander.

239
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,430
This is not the same as bystanders and I do need to be careful here because it's the kind of mistake

240
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,250
I like to make.

241
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,680
But what is variable by Santa when we need to load in a bystander and we alone it's something from the

242
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,660
bystanders.

243
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,110
Dictionaries are bystanders and this is a dictionary so we need to tell it.

244
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,400
Which one were loading it so it's going to be called by key.

245
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:31,010
So let's pick a random key so random integer I am going to modulate that by the by standers dictionary

246
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,030
size.

247
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,770
So what I'm telling it is go to this bystander's variable dictionary right.

248
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,500
Find out how large it is.

249
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,560
Count how many things are in it and then pick a random integer.

250
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,470
Now I don't need to add one here.

251
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,270
Why.

252
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,650
Because if I look at my file I got a script.

253
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,590
The first key is zero not one.

254
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,020
So you don't have that off by one error that we would do if we're using the timer.

255
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,420
In other words if there are five things in this bystander The keys are not 1 2 3 4 5 they're 0 1 2 3

256
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,140
4.

257
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,310
So this will work.

258
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,340
However before I get too excited.

259
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,500
We do need to load this in as an instance.

260
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:19,340
So let's going to destruction from those we have from here which go instance so bystander is a random

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,500
entry of the bystanders dictionary loaded as an instance.

262
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,630
I get reports.

263
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,140
Now let's add that as a child.

264
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,200
So add child.

265
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,740
Bystander.

266
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,690
Now let's move the bystander to the top level.

267
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,880
Technically speaking this isn't necessary because the sponsors aren't going to move.

268
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,140
But what if we do want moving supporters right.

269
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,790
You could put in a situation where your sponsors are going to get through right seems like a show I'm

270
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,310
talking about.

271
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,080
Maybe they'll do this right.

272
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,470
I'm not going to do that because that's going to cause complications for my vision of the.

273
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:05,940
But if we did we'd need to set as top level design and that takes truly doesn't it.

274
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,770
So we have spawned in a random bystander and we've told it don't take your movement information from

275
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,970
the sponsor right.

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,420
Just use your own Moven information.

277
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,390
Now let's actually move to the right starting position so bystander

278
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,390
dot set transform forward and I want its global transform

279
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,290
global transform

280
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,190
and that should be everything I need.

281
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,030
Because I've told it don't take your parents position information I need to use the global transform

282
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,150
for power for the forward.

283
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,830
If I hadn't done that I could have just used the forwards transform but I'm going to set this as global

284
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,510
because I want these things to be fired as projectiles.

285
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:03,110
Finally I need it to move some bystander got set linear velocity.

286
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,970
There it is.

287
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,510
OK.

288
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,620
So settling in velocity will take a vector 3 so I can't just use the speed.

289
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,230
Well we have a vector 3 right.

290
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,300
We could use the basis of forward plus two that we could go forward.

291
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,710
DOT gets global transform

292
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,310
an unknown basis and I want this on the z axis.

293
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,740
Right so how fast are you moving on the forward backwards axis.

294
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:37,670
So let's say with a square bracket and that's entry to Y masir Square bracket because basis remember

295
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,880
is an array is a matrix.

296
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,750
Okay so I need a square brackets for that.

297
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,180
It's a good habit to get into.

298
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,570
I'm just going to normalize it in this particular case.

299
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,350
Doesn't matter because I don't have any of my sporn As far diagonally.

300
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,790
But what if he did.

301
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:56,660
What if your level had sporn is at a 45 degree angle not a 90 degree angle so it's normalized.

302
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,150
OK.

303
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:03,140
So it's currently set to exactly the same speed as.

304
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,590
Forward.

305
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,420
Forward isn't moving.

306
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,180
Let's multiply that by a bystander speed.

307
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,560
And if I've done everything correctly.

308
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,530
Drum roll please.

309
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,540
When I press play.

310
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,210
We should start seeing.

311
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,740
Pieces coming in.

312
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,290
Look carefully what's happening coming in and then slowing down.

313
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,230
Why.

314
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,240
Because they're hitting the floor.

315
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,980
That's okay.

316
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,920
Let's go into a by saltz plate and start fixing this one.

317
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,630
Gravity scale zero Don't be effect by gravity.

318
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,140
Now an Everest play.

319
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,270
We should just saw through the door.

320
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,520
Fantastic.

321
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,310
In a semi random right.

322
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,330
They're going quite fast.

323
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,000
I could probably slow them down if I wanted.

324
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,120
That's easy enough to do.

325
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,760
But you know what else I can do.

326
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,790
Let's move this to here.

327
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,090
And duplicate it and put it on the other side.

328
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,590
So I'm just going to keep moving over here.

329
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,560
Rotate you by ninety two negative net.

330
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,190
Greece is just tickled.

331
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,550
So a small child.

332
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,830
Whereas the forward no piny to keep rotating you surprise I forgot how rotation works.

333
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,720
OK so there's your forward and let's get this child off again and make sure that they're not facing

334
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,890
each other because then we're going to have weird collisions so let's just move you to here.

335
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,140
How's that.

336
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,780
Too much.

337
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
They hit the door.

338
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,060
Maybe get the best players how it looks.

339
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,660
Never do goes it coming.

340
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,670
There you go.

341
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,380
OK.

342
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,590
So I've created a mosh pit simulator.

343
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,440
That's fine.

344
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,790
I can just.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,290
OK.

346
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,280
And after way too long fussing around I've decided to pause the video and come back to it because it

347
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,210
took me ages slightly up properly but just to show you what I've done.

348
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:15,970
Spawn or one is on the Z of minus one point seventy five and spawn two is facing it.

349
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,380
The Z of minus a point seven day.

350
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,080
So they're just going to miss each other unless something goes wrong.

351
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,100
Okay let's put some more things in bystander.

352
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,520
First we need to do is I need a bystander script.

353
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,350
So let's put in a script for that.

354
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,550
Let's go live in the script solor doo doo doo.

355
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,140
There it is.

356
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,860
Bye bye set a template not she went on a call.

357
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,350
I want to call it by stand a script by Stella Judy.

358
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,650
All right.

359
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,270
One more thing I want to do.

360
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,860
We've got a situation where bystanders could in theory all congregate around the place and eventually

361
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,600
they're going to start slowing things down.

362
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,090
I want to clean them up.

363
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,940
I want a system whereby if they go off screen vanish.

364
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,220
Now this is a little bit of a cheat and you might not want it for every game.

365
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,610
But I would put it here just as a sort of error catching.

366
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,880
So I need a visibility notifier.

367
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,000
This is a type of no we have looked at before but it does exactly what you might expect.

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,390
Right.

369
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:19,060
It tells God how can this be seen and what I want is to connect as a signal on camera.

370
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:27,460
It's it it's so when you exit the camera and connect that to buy set a template and owner says if the

371
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,140
bystander leaves the camera.

372
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,790
So not if they haven't been in the home yet but if they've been onscreen and then leave delete them

373
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,220
unless you have that looks.

374
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,220
So he was bystander.

375
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,610
And he vanishes.

376
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,060
Right.

377
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,300
Look up look down they're gone.

378
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,380
Now this could get a little annoying a certain type of games.

379
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,990
I know your grand theft auto games you see stuff like this where you see a great car you turn the corner

380
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,310
to try and chase it down and it'll be gone.

381
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,090
But I also don't want bystanders just clogging everything up so I'm okay with this.

382
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,270
Next thing I want to do is at a time a..

383
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,580
And this timer is going to be connected to the by cell the template by set of script.

384
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:19,430
I'm putting this here so that when the bystander is hit by food it'll vanish after a little amount of

385
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,610
time.

386
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,640
A small amount of time so on time a time out.

387
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,570
Q free.

388
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,550
Let's make sure that I'm not auto starting my timer.

389
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm not.

390
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,440
It is a once one shot that's fine and I don't call this three seconds.

391
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,990
What's this going to be used for.

392
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,690
This is going be used for when we're hit by food and we a function called hurt.

393
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:47,810
And this is a nice simple one on a start the timer so timer start and play the audio player audio stream

394
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,860
player so audio stream player stopped play.

395
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,010
You'll notice we don't actually have a sound and he said let's fix that.

396
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,690
It's SFX which is why sort of scenes and I've got this oh no.

397
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,970
Which I made myself because I'm king of sound effects I'm going to drag that in here and let's see what

398
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,000
it sounds like.

399
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,470
It sounds amazing.

400
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,530
Let's make sure is not looping that import and turn looping off and reimport it.

401
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,610
Now there is a bug that sometimes hits this version of God where you drag the sound in and playing gets

402
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,530
stuck on.

403
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,980
If that happens save the scene close the scene open the scene.

404
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
It'll be fine.

405
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,150
Okay.

406
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,400
So I now have a script which has a function called hurt.

407
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:39,780
That'll start a timer play Ono and play it once and then when the timer goes out it'll keep fruit that

408
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,400
you'll notice.

409
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:47,220
Hurt is never being called so right now I have a bystander that could in theory be hurt but isn't well

410
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,760
something fancy we can do that was a projectile and as go into the actual projectile scene which I did

411
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,720
do.

412
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,600
Emma there is.

413
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,700
Let's connect the rigid body to itself.

414
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:02,940
Go.

415
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,840
So I want body entered like body shape entered and neck.

416
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,260
That to itself.

417
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,460
And here is a fun bit we could do this with collision master of doing that a lot.

418
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,280
But here's an easy way of doing it.

419
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:29,110
If body which is defined as an argument so if whatever the body is has method hurt and this does exactly

420
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,280
what you might expect it's going to see whatever the food has collided with.

421
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,840
And then check.

422
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,550
Okay.

423
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,410
You object just collided with whatever you are.

424
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,820
Do you have a method called hurt.

425
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,570
If you do run it

426
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,100
and if you do I'm out of here.

427
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:56,170
Now I run the same you'll notice that it won't actually work right.

428
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,790
Not hearing oh no nothing's happening.

429
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,970
And the reason why is I need to switch on.

430
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:08,850
Both contacts reported and contact monitoring for mouse over that you'll see the rigid body will emit

431
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,030
signals when it collides with another rigid body.

432
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
If that is an on rigid bodies won't report each other.

433
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,990
So let's switch it on for both.

434
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,170
Make sure continues.

435
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,140
Collision detection is on and that we're monitoring at least one contact a need to do continuous collision

436
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,020
detection because otherwise fast moving projectiles might not be reported.

437
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,740
Let's Pressplay and see how that works.

438
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,340
Let's tell the time a down to two seconds.

439
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,060
Great.

440
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,450
But that's looking pretty good.

441
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,100
One more thing on do.

442
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:52,170
I'm like I know a little bit louder Let's make you know decibels to 5 and Max decibels to five is much

443
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,010
less nice loud.

444
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,920
So what I am.

445
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,350
And you'll also notice dopplers on.

446
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,220
Right.

447
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,760
As they get closer to us the test is going to change.

448
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,390
And now we have bystanders that we can increase the rate of fire quite easily even go to the spawning

449
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,790
a scene and change our maximum wait time to three seconds.

450
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:27,090
For example I could slow down the bystanders but we have a lot of control and we have basic bystanders

451
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,810
which brings us to the end of this video in this video.

452
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:40,080
We've looked at how to use his method to check if a body should do something which is a really useful

453
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,010
technique right.

454
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,270
I don't have to worry about fancy being a script.

455
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,500
I just need to say this body you're interacting with.

456
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,360
Just check it has a method if it has it tell it to run it don't care about what it is or what it means.

457
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,600
Let the node worry about it which is a really great way of the principle of responsibility being enforced.

458
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,940
We've also use a visibility notifier to check if a note is still on camera.
