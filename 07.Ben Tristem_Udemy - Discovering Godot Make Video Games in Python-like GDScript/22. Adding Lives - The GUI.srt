1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,260
Hello again glorious God.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,570
People in this video.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,880
We're going to continue with this project of adding lives.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,810
Now the players already have lives but we don't have a way of letting the player know how many lives

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,960
they have Tweedledee are.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,790
Let's make a goalie now.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,690
We've done some work on going in other projects.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,760
And there's nothing too surprising here.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,890
So instead as break down what we need I think we need a refill.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,940
We need a way of showing the player this is how long you have to wait in that ammo box before you've

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,770
picked up any AMA some sort of progress.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,880
I'm thinking a texture progress would be perfect for that.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,130
We also need to measure how much ammo we're carrying.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,630
We actually already have that.

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,390
We just need to tidy this up polish it make it a bit more fancy pants and we should display how many

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,760
lives the player currently has.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,120
Because when you get to zero you will lose the game.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,340
You should know when that is good.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,810
Let's get into it.

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,760
So first thing to do is fix a quick buck.

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,290
So a quick look.

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,190
If I make this big screen.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,760
And as big as mama.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,600
Oh we crashed.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,940
Why the function hurt is expecting zero arguments in by Senator Dodd Judy.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,680
Let's get to my sendup scripts bystander.

27
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,440
Here it is.

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,240
By some of what Judy has a function called hurt.

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,060
Right so we are calling it but it's expecting an argument even if we never use it.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,130
It has to be.

31
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,790
So I'm just going to write that in analogy worked fine.

32
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,050
We should get busy bystanders flying around the place.

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,680
Perfect.

34
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,910
Awesome.

35
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,800
Okay so now let's get going with this gooey.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,890
Let's get back into 3-d mode.

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,250
If you look over here in some tree we already have a going.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,370
So what we do is I'm good.

39
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,620
Right click on it save branch as seen put it in scenes in gooey.

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,310
And there it is.

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,170
Save it.

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,640
Done.

43
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,570
Let's open it up.

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,930
Let's start with this idea of a texture progress of a make a texture progress note.

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,470
There is texture progress and if I go to the root directory to graphics you'll see I've got a couple

47
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,210
of items here.

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,080
Circle empty circle full.

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:18,460
Let's open texture's circle empties my under texture and the progress is circle full.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,620
So just to check how it's working.

51
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,780
Let's type in some values so these are out of 100 watts 50 percent look like Order 66 percent look like.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,660
Let's not click randomly there.

53
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,500
OK.

54
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,360
That's not actually how I want to say look I want this to go clockwise when a film mode and clockwise

55
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,290
and that's looking a bit better.

56
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,310
So let's start you at zero.

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,820
I kind of got this in the top right and I'm thinking having this label in the centre.

58
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,550
So let's start with this to actually progress.

59
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,320
We're going to do anchor in the top right and positions right cool.

60
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,770
We could give us some margin as well.

61
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,930
So how about 10 pixels for the top drag and eyeball.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,450
There it is.

63
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,230
You live here.

64
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,070
Awesome.

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,160
This label is now in the wrong place.

66
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,760
I want it centred here so to do that I'm going to add a centre container make that a child of text press

67
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,880
and drag the label into there.

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,050
Now I can't see it.

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Why.

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Well it's over here.

71
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,230
It wants to be over here.

72
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,860
So is that a container that's making full wrecked.

73
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,410
Now that's the full rectangle of this tax progress.

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,130
Finally Let's rename texture progress to refill and Let's rename the label to account.

75
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,790
And that started to look pretty good.

76
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,890
Now I also mentioned and I'm going to go to the Scripsit can see this go to the play script and all

77
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,390
one on the bottom to update good.

78
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,110
We have this comment here move to a group call.

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,630
Good idea.

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's move the gooey to its own group.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,610
So press node press groups and call it good.

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,640
OK.

83
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,210
That's all done.

84
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,770
So now let's give Gooly its own scrip so we can start moving the functionality of the good.

85
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,100
I don't really want to tell the gooey what to be doing from another scene because of what we talked

86
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,440
about earlier in the course this idea of single responsibility.

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,990
Right.

88
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,260
So let's make a script for going in a call this go and I have put it in my script folder.

89
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,800
Because as you might know of reasons and create.

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,150
Now let's move this functionality.

91
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,650
So update Gooly.

92
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:31,370
I can give you this comment and let's go to distraction free mode for a moment and just give myself

93
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,350
some typing space again.

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,490
Alright so I want to call a group so get tree dot core group.

95
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,690
And as you might remember call group takes the following.

96
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,990
You need a string for the group name that string is going to be gooey.

97
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,910
We need a string for the method name.

98
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,610
Haven't written a method yet so let's write a method.

99
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:59,030
What we do here is refresh Smokeout So function refresh underscore Smokeout why my spelling it like

100
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,730
this with this word capitalisation because an account is the name of the node.

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
So I'm going to keep that going.

102
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,540
So when I read it I can see oh I'm referring to a note here.

103
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,090
Okay clearly I need to pass an information through it so that information is going to write as ammos

104
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,740
So an argument is going to come through.

105
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,760
As am I.

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,430
Let's copy refresh ammo out go back into play.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,160
And that's our string.

108
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,560
Now let's pass through em.

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,760
So whatever the value of ammo is that's what we're passing through.

110
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,510
Awesome.

111
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,270
Now there's actually make it work.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,200
So I won't count which is right here.

113
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,190
TEXT equals ammo.

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,390
However this text this text property of this AM account label needs a string so just like we did before.

115
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,080
I've got a class V integer value that passing through as a string and that should work fine as go back

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,620
into play.

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Remove this line entirely because that no longer exists.

118
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,350
And if I've done everything correctly the game should run exactly as it did before.

119
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,170
And it's all updating beautifully.

120
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,150
Awesome.

121
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:20,580
So it's updating beautifully but I've just made this rather lovely refl note right here and it's not

122
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,810
actually doing anything.

123
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,000
So we need to put that in.

124
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:30,960
Let's put in a new part of ongoing script some like a new function in those can be back here we go.

125
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,930
You function and it's going to be called the refill

126
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,690
and this is also going to take an argument right it's going to take some sort of melt coming through.

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,150
And if I take a look at it you can see the property end to change.

128
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,210
Is this one right here value.

129
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,650
So I grab this refill note and then give up its value and set it to the amount.

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,770
Okay.

131
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:04,260
So we have this refilm out so my do is go into the play script again and let's go up to process I'll

132
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,040
put one more thing in here.

133
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm going put a refresh refill count.

134
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,560
Copy that move all the way down to the bottom and make this function function refresh refresh refill

135
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,600
counter.

136
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,140
Well I don't want this to be refreshing all the time.

137
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:31,530
Only if the amount is going up so I say gif can refill.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,950
Then I want to do something right.

139
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:41,190
I'm going to pass through a value and that value is going to get tree dot whole group.

140
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm calling that gooey and I'm going to call this refill right here as a refill and amount so string

141
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,640
refill.

142
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,660
And here I need a new variable right.

143
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,690
And they call this refill time left.

144
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,820
OK.

145
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,870
So far so good.

146
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,650
Let's define that variable refill.

147
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,500
Time left equals.

148
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,920
So here's my challenge for you.

149
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,170
I want you to finish that line of code.

150
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,720
We have a refilm note in the going.

151
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,050
I want you to update the value of that refund note with the correct value.

152
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,210
Now we already have a time a..

153
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,870
In fact if I go back and take a look at it it's in my player scenes So let's take a quick look at that.

154
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,850
Here we go.

155
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,750
We already have a refill time so we can make use of this somehow.

156
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,450
But exactly how we're going to do it.

157
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,800
Well that's my challenge right.

158
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,260
So don't be afraid to look at the documentation to see if there's a specific property or method of function

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,970
you could use.

160
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,870
Also don't worry if you're a little frustrated give it your best shot and then when you've either solved

161
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,430
it or you're just bored of it come on back and I'll show you my solution supposedly.

162
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,640
Now give us your best shot when you come back Oshi my solution.

163
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,560
And welcome back.

164
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,150
OK.

165
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,720
The first thing we ever do is we grab this refill time and let's take a look at the documentation's

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
press classes and I'll type in time.

167
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,580
And the first thing we notice is there's something here called time left and that looks like deals.

168
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,830
I mean even that.

169
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,270
So back in to my play a script here we go a dot.

170
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,050
Time left.

171
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,720
All right.

172
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,380
So now this girl is going consuming the time left let's press Plie.

173
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,960
A couple of problems.

174
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,440
First my time left is one my steps is a hundred.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,890
So let's go back into the gooey ants into the gooey script.

176
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,850
Let's multiply amounts by a max value.

177
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,650
Right.

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,520
I could actually do by max value which can multiply by 100 for now.

179
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,610
OK.

180
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,830
Now my problem here is this is going backwards.

181
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,170
I want to go forwards.

182
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,740
Right.

183
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,370
I want it to fill up.

184
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,250
The closer we get.

185
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,890
Not until that looks and it anticlimactic.

186
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,620
So instead we're going to do is I'm going to go in to this variable here and grab.

187
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,160
How much time is there total.

188
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,550
Right.

189
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,290
What is the timer set to.

190
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,020
Let's give me myself a space here get a bit more rethel timer wrong's seen a

191
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,990
refill timer dot wait time which is the amount of time that it was originally set to minus timelier.

192
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,570
OK.

193
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,990
So we're now showing the opposite information.

194
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,410
And now when they go into it.

195
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
Look at that.

196
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,560
OK.

197
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,590
One more thing I need to do is when I leave this area I need to set that to zero.

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,660
I always could do this.

199
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,230
I couldn't else in here right else.

200
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,080
And then I'm just going to duplicate this line move it down.

201
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,590
And it sort of felt time left.

202
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,800
I could just set this to zero right.

203
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,250
The other thing I could do is put it here and refill it exited.

204
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,830
I'm minded to put it here as an elf because we're already running this calculation every frame any way

205
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,110
and adding an extra two lines of code isn't going make a huge about the difference.

206
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
But it's entirely up to you.

207
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,110
One more thing we need to do.

208
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,080
We need to add in the lives of or greasing for this.

209
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,390
I'm going to add an item list.

210
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,020
Okay.

211
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,710
Our item list is going to live in the top left over here.

212
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,640
And you know what it might give you the margin 10 from the left and 10 from the top.

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,350
That's it for now.

214
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,580
And I'm going to give it's three conn's for now we can make this bigger and this probably wants to be

215
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,580
a bit wider so to check it and then add some items.

216
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:51,760
So let's load in a tax load and we're going back to jefa X lotis Hutton and do this two more times.

217
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,980
Clearly way too small.

218
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,440
So let's make this bigger.

219
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,530
And I also only want the word item.

220
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't want any words on it.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,220
So let's get rid of the tax entirely.

222
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,690
It goes pretty good.

223
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,470
Well auto hide this so it should you know unset Max comps to 5 and just make this nice and big and it

224
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,510
will add small lies later like sir.

225
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,260
Now currently I don't want these in there somewhere to delete them delete delete delete they're again

226
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,650
deleted all three.

227
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:47,290
Instead let's call this all lives and make a function in the U.S. So that's going to call up day lives

228
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,780
and it can take an argument called Life's which makes sense right.

229
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,650
First thing to do is tell it what is this heart.

230
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:05,370
So variable heart equals preload this in drag that in done next thing to do is clear lives.

231
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,790
So I'm going to call the lives note.

232
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,380
Just to clear.

233
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,800
So every time the switch is run we're going to start from scratch and then it's simple fault for I in

234
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:23,370
lives and let's go to lives dot ad icon item.

235
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,190
Here it is.

236
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,380
And it's going to be hot.

237
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,510
Is it selectable.

238
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,290
No it's not so hot comma.

239
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,280
False.

240
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,010
Course we have an update lives.

241
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,180
But obviously this isn't being called anywhere.

242
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,200
So back to.

243
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,300
We need to make a function.

244
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
So here it goes.

245
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,810
Function update lives.

246
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,460
OK.

247
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,970
So I was going to have that day lives were going to get tree a whole group.

248
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,570
We've seen this before and in fact as we just have duplicated this but didn't get a call.

249
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,860
And we are calling up day lives.

250
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,870
Yes we are were passing in lives.

251
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,700
Update lives lives.

252
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,270
Now lives is not in this script but we do have lives.

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,980
Where do we have them.

254
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,290
We have them in character which is also where hurt is happening.

255
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,140
So couple things to check first.

256
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,210
Did I call it lives.

257
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,360
Yes that it's fine.

258
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,010
Secondly most of the time update lives is going to be called.

259
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,780
It's going to be in character and clearly I don't want this happening when robots are hit.

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,440
So I need to add an extra piece of logic here.

261
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,740
Right.

262
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,640
Just before we call this I don't know if.

263
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:43,530
Character type is doubly cause character type Scott player.

264
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,210
Then this should happen.

265
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,700
All right let's actually why this.

266
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,560
First in character under heart which is right here.

267
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,440
Update lives now it's initialise the players are back and the players get all went to the ready function.

268
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,800
And I'm going to play it right here.

269
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,250
Update lives.

270
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,780
So that's all going to work fine.

271
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:12,230
However I now have this method here that will call whenever a character is hurt the player will respond

272
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,680
to it.

273
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,010
But what happens when a robot gets gets hit right.

274
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:23,510
So I need to put an update lives method in the robot script so let's find my robot script which means

275
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,780
going in to my script a little robot.

276
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,560
So one thing to do is go a function update lives and fanelle pass.

277
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,500
Now it will do something later.

278
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,450
So I don't mind putting that in for now I just have to stop it from crashing.

279
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,630
I press play and see how this looks.

280
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,550
Big screen moat

281
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,390
Amy wants me twice.

282
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,160
And done.

283
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,250
Awesome.

284
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,490
And that is a fully functional going which means we're at the end of the video in this video.

285
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,970
Look at how to display how long we have to wait in a to actually progress note and we've made a gooey

286
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,140
for food fight.

287
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,100
How does your gooey look.

288
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,010
I'd love to see it.

289
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,960
Don't forget to share what you're doing in our various community sites.

290
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,830
Meanwhile excellent work and I shall see you in the next video.
