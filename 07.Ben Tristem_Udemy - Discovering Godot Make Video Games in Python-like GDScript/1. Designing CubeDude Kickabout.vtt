Hello glorious God people and welcome to this next new section would it to start working on.

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.970
Q Do you kick about now kudu kick about as you can see from the screen is a very silly simple.

3
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.120
Fun to play a multiplayer game with me working on 3D when me working with physics and would be working

4
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.430
with local multiplayer this is probably a lot simpler in terms of how much we need to write than heiss

5
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.510
Meister's But if we're going to move into a whole new access I figure let's get the fundamentals down

6
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.790
one making a fun little game.

7
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.830
I'm using the word lot.

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.370
Let's talk about what you do kick about.

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.500
Actually it is.

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.680
And as you probably know by now I like to start with essential experience.

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.290
That's what I like to design my game on.

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.930
So what is the essential experience of Cupid kick about.

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.160
Well to me Cupid kickabout is a fast fun playful local multiplayer game where two players try and compete

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.780
to score the most goals.

15
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.510
I don't know why I'm reading this out to you.

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.880
I'm pretty sure you can read but I've done it.

17
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.760
Let's pull out the key words fast fun playful local player and compete.

18
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.790
To me those are the words that really defined the experience.

19
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.350
In fact I'm going to remove one of those quick tips for you game designers out there.

20
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.500
Fun is not a useful word for Game Design.

21
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.960
Fun is way too context dependent right.

22
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.650
It means too many things and it's too vague and fluffy we can't really use it if we pull fun out of

23
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.010
here.

24
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:37.450
All we get is fast playful local multiplayer and competition all these things together say to me toybox

25
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.600
we've got a 10 shaded us thetic we've got lots of little toys in the background.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.580
We've got these two little wooden figures the very simplistic animation to match.

27
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.350
They're blocking us and we've got very simple physics that goes wrong very quickly.

28
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.440
I'm tryna control both players at once which is really hard to do but it's a very silly fun pretty thing.

29
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.370
That's what we're going for here.

30
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.200
Diminish a score right at the right time.

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.110
Look at that.

32
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.930
So that's it.

33
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.730
I'm going to put the assets as a link in the next video and we can download them all get the project

34
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.220
started and start working on a very simple play for all three local multiplayer game so I'll look forward

35
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.480
to seeing in the next video.
