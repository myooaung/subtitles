00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.500
Hello again fantastic God.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.900
People in this video are going to start making the guards move Now the guards won't actually be moving

3
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.800
by the end of this video.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.270
But we set everything up so they're going to know where they can move and how to figure out how to get

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.650
there to do that.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.100
We're going to be using a node called navigation 2D.

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.100
And that's going to handle all of our pathfinding.

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.540
Let's take a quick look at what needs to happen.

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.220
Our guards are going to have a list of possible destinations are going to be able to get as many of

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.320
these as we want and not change the code.

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.920
The Guard is going to pick a random designation and move there and I'd like them to move about half

12
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.190
a speed of the player when they arrive at the destination the Guard's going to wait three seconds.

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.520
You can change that if you like.

14
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.880
And then they're just to start this whole thing all over again.

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.820
So they're going to walk to a place wait and then stop.

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.810
Also if for some reason they bump into something they get stuck rather than just keep walking into that

17
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.350
thing that is going to pick a new destination.

18
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.670
Now let's say we want to move this guard over here in the white circle to this little diamond shape.

19
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.720
What navigation to do he's going to do is say okay you're allowed to move in all of these rooms.

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.820
You can't move through a wall.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.260
So we're going have to define the Eric move.

22
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.840
And then it's going to create a simple path.

23
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.350
Right.

24
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.750
It's going to say okay if you go here and here and here and look how it's hugging these corners right.

25
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.520
We're going have to make sure that the Guard can actually get through here.

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.870
This path by the way is actually an array of vector 2s this position zero position 1 2 and 3.

27
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.640
So it's just going to create an array of coordinates and then we're going to tell it moved to this one.

28
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.160
Move to that one to that one.

29
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.250
OK.

30
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.630
So that's how it works.

31
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.700
How do we set it up.

32
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.340
Well we got back into the engine and I'm going to create a brand new node and it's going to be a navigation

33
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.650
to download.

34
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.720
Animal leave the name as it is.

35
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.480
And for now let's hide our canvas modulation to make the navigation 2D work.

36
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.930
We're going to create a sudden node and that's going to be this navigation polygon instance navigation

37
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.050
polygon is an area we can draw in the same way that we drew collision and occlusion and auto tile that

38
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.040
tells godso anything that's using this navigation can calculate positions from within this area.

39
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.660
But don't look outside.

40
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.450
OK.

41
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.710
Let's set up a new navigation polygon and we can use these three icons we have ADD.

42
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
We have at it and we have delete.

43
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.870
We can also put this on the grid if we want.

44
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.920
So I guess that to grid and I'm going to configure snap to what is a 64 I believe by 64.

45
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.350
And just to double check.

46
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.950
That's right.

47
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
Let's show grid and look about right.

48
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.170
Let's find out.

49
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.310
Yeah.

50
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.580
So you'll see that right now.

51
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.440
Just finish this grid off like so.

52
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.660
So this looks perfect.

53
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.730
However there's going to be an issue.

54
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.600
The issue is if this guard wants to move a puff we said he's going to do this.

55
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.680
He's going to walk this way bump into the wall and either get stuck somewhere else to fix that.

56
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.270
What I'm going to do is I'm not going to snap to that kind of grit.

57
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.300
I can either do the whole thing and agreed now removal points like so.

58
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.940
So I just unsnap the grid and they just gave him a little bit of leeway.

59
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.430
And that's good tell them okay you can walk here which will always give him enough clearance to get

60
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.040
through doors or I can just draw the entire thing freehand.

61
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.510
I'm tempted to do the entire thing freehand So I'm going to clear my navigation polygon and I need to

62
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.680
set a brand new one.

63
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.080
Sometimes the actual thing bugs out is open and you see.

64
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.260
Let's go into security cameras and back in there agus and Atlas draw some points and I'm going to do

65
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.600
this off the grid for now not look as neat but it'll be fine so I'm going to define all the areas I

66
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.440
don't want the guards to go into I don't want them going into his bathroom.

67
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.950
If you leave in an hour from here they're never going into these corners and so on.

68
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.050
So one would do is I'm just going to speed up the video.

69
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.860
And then when I click on last point it will seal that off.

70
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.620
Now there's a few things I need to change.

71
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.830
Let's go try and go through these walls and these pillars.

72
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.520
You'll also notice there's a few areas I haven't put in my serendipities jazz a closet that's off limits

73
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.680
as a place to play can hide.

74
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.070
And I think this will be a fun little corridor where the guard can still see you if it goes this way.

75
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.680
He's not actually going to go in there so you can mark certain areas off limits.

76
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.540
Now this does look a little rough and ready but that's fine.

77
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.800
All we're doing is telling the guard don't walk in to this corner this is your pathfinding.

78
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.230
Guess how do we add in these extra areas.

79
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.010
Well I'm going to add in more points.

80
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.220
Like so.

81
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.840
Close that off.

82
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.450
And now this air is off limits.

83
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.070
So let me just do that again.

84
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.950
Sorry I told you does not have been in here I am tidying.

85
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.290
So new point and I'm going to mark these areas.

86
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.590
As part of this polygon.

87
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.610
A speed up as I finish them off.

88
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.830
And that's looking pretty good now.

89
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.170
Again you could do this very neatly with the grid and we just cut a worker how they had this corners.

90
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.060
It was also possible to put in navigation stuff in your auto tiles.

91
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.980
But again I'm not doing that because I don't want the guards to bump into the corner if they're going

92
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.060
with the shortest route.

93
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.630
They will take shortcuts.

94
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.380
We can set something in the script make them not always do that but just to make it as safe as possible.

95
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.400
I'm going to use these manually so we now have navigation polygon set up.

96
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.990
Now what I'd like to do is create a list of destinations we could do this in script right.

97
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.790
If a destination is just a position a quad and that's a vector to with the X being the first position

98
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.310
and the Y being the second.

99
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.410
However if we do that in script there's a number of limitations.

100
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.810
The first limitation is every time we change the level every time we want to move a position we're going

101
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.270
to have to figure out the coordinates.

102
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.370
So this is what is that levon 52 on the X and 760 on the Y.

103
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.430
And change them in script.

104
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.420
The other limitation is were going to have to have a different set of coordinates for every level we

105
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.050
make.

106
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.720
So instead let's leverage the fact that godso likes to use nodes as objects.

107
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.880
Let's create a new sub node in navigation to day and image can make a node 2D.

108
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.770
I'm going to call this destination's the solution is going be a folder and inside that Im going to put

109
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.150
a position to denote position to de only exists for leatherland.

110
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.600
Right for in the editor it doesn't actually do anything in-game.

111
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.890
It's just a position you can use this to do stuff.

112
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.930
Let's say I want this to be a pivot point or something like that or in this case I want this to be a

113
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.950
destination.

114
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.110
We call this destination one and was a good place for Destination 1 I feel like right here it's a good

115
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.090
place for Destination 1 and I'm going to duplicate that and got to automatically updates the number

116
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.130
and move that I've got move selects up here.

117
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.740
It's a little hard to see against the grain so let's hide the navigation polygon.

118
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.540
In fact they're just difficult to see aren't they lines move the floors as well.

119
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.790
No hiding the floors.

120
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.770
Now I could see these positions a little better.

121
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.430
I will put these back put one in here another one here and I could just put as many of these as I like.

122
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.040
Which brings me to the challenge of this video.

123
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.450
What do like to do is create your navigation polygon instance feel level and add in a bunch of destinations

124
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.880
and as many as you like.

125
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.210
Just wherever you put it.

126
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.890
That's where the Guard is going to go and wait it's pause the video.

127
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.300
Create the navigation for your level and when you come back I'll show you my level.

128
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.990
And welcome back.

129
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.480
Okay so let's add in some more destinations.

130
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.270
I feel like here is a good place here.

131
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.930
And you know I will put in a few in here because it's a nice big room and one up here and one down here

132
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.640
and maybe one in the centre and how I feel about one more somewhere.

133
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.610
Maybe down here there's nothing down here.

134
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.890
And one of the bathrooms needs to be one bathrooms.

135
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.720
And that's his looking pretty solid.

136
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:29.190
So I'm going to minimize that and bring back the floors and the canvas modulate and that's where our

137
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.250
levels can look like.

138
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.570
OK so we've now set up everything we're going to need to convince the guards to move.

139
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.500
All we need to do now is actually write that movement script that navigations which is what we might

140
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.690
be doing in the next video.

141
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.720
So just a quick refresher of what's going on here.

142
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:51.660
We're using a navigation to download and we're using a navigation polygon instance node to define where

143
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.600
things can move.

144
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.680
I will put the links to navigation 2D documentation in this video so feel free to read up on it.

145
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.120
But we going to be using something called Get simple path which is going to create an array of vector

146
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:09.090
tools then went off the guards move to the next place in the array and when you get to that point get

147
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.440
the next entry.

148
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.950
So in this video we've set up our navigation 2D and navigation instance polygons and use position to

149
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.450
lead to set ups and destinations were now in great shape to get these guards moving.

150
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.990
Some fantastic work and I'll see the next video.
