00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.120
Hello again you wonderful God people.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.410
And welcome to the wrap up of high slices.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.200
And we've come a really long way.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.060
We've done a lot of really cool work and a top down stealth game.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.750
Take a moment to think about what we've covered.

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.270
Right.

7
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.520
We've covered top down movement and looking at the mouse and rotating the character.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.260
We have looked at inheriting scripts so we start off with a play a detection script actually we start

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.430
off with a character script and as a player and a player detection script and then within that we've

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.120
got a camera and a security guard and that's all great.

11
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.930
We've got things like line of sight auto tiles alter tiles of collision.

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.150
We've looked at occlusion and light maps and all kinds of cool stuff.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.610
We've even looked at how to use has node and how to spawn a node within the tree and using that as an

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.980
ant as a form of inventories poster making an array or a dictionary lots of very cool stuff.

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.040
Before we move onto the next section and start exploring 3D.

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.310
I've got some challenges for you in case you want to go that extra mile.

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.240
Some things you might want to do.

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.720
You could put in extra enemy types.

19
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.930
Maybe I don't know a security dog that moves much faster but can't see as far or maybe some sort of

20
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.540
pressure plate or if you step on it the alarm will go off.

21
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.560
Maybe you want to put an alarm system in.

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.710
Maybe you want to put in some sort of score.

23
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.410
So depending on how much loot and what types of loot you got when you get to the exit or how long it

24
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.550
takes you to get to the exit or a combination of both.

25
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.330
That's the screen and get you could put in multiple levels.

26
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.510
You could have one level even to another level.

27
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.830
You could have multiple floors within a level so a level one floor one level one floor to move up and

28
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.390
then have to move down to the exit or maybe the exits on the roof and you have to go up a whole bunch

29
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.990
of fun things you could do here either way.

30
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.950
Excellent work.

31
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.190
And I'm really looking forward to seeing the heiss mice's games that you guys have done already.

32
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.410
Some people have already shared their work as have been here for the course.

33
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.990
Catching up with me as I've been recording them and I'll be looking at those on discord on the community

34
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.060
Facebook.

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.050
Yes the community Facebook group and on the forum.

36
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.280
See I'm giving these myself.

37
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.040
Community Forum community Facebook.

38
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.660
We have both.

39
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.210
And I've been looking at both and the memory call.

40
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.140
Next we'll start diving into 3D so I'm going to make a slightly simpler project.

41
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.470
But when you're up the stakes we've got a whole new axis to worry about right.

42
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.410
Going to have X Y and Z which some of you Causey and that's okay either way.

43
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.870
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next section.
