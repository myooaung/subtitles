00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.260
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.810
Fantastic.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.770
Got to people in this video, we're going to finish the tutorial and the game.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.710
Done Dun done.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.550
So what will it do?

6
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.840
We're going to animate that.

7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720
You toil gooey and then the game is ready to go.

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.130
So nice and simple.

9
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.280
Let's get into gutter and open our tutorial.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.930
La, la, la.

11
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.780
And we've got to let you go.

12
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.400
Where's my girl?

13
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.970
That's right.

14
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.380
And we've got this lovely little tutorial.

15
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.490
Gilliams can open that scene.

16
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.680
And at the moment it's just staying there and the text is just changing.

17
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.360
But the player might not notice that something changed.

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.810
So I'll give an example if I start the tutorial.

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.290
And then I moved to the next objective is the tax change.

20
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.780
It was a sound effect, but nothing to draw the eye of the player down to this box.

21
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.420
So that's what going to do to do that.

22
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.130
I'm going to use an animation player.

23
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.490
Now we use a tween last time we used an animation play this time.

24
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.580
I'm using an animation player because the values are always going to be the same with a tween.

25
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.910
I don't know the start and all the end values.

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.740
So I'm going to have to choose between.

27
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.910
I do know them here.

28
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.860
So I'm just an easy animation player and I would encourage you to animate this however you want.

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.420
I am going to get rid of the text, resize this box.

30
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.620
So make it shrink, make it grow, and then put the text back with brand new text.

31
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.550
How do you do that?

32
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.870
Well, first one, it's not the new animation.

33
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.090
This message change.

34
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.740
Message change, and we need to add some tracks.

35
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.720
So let's go over to the label.

36
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.190
Very first thing to do.

37
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.460
Oh, you.

38
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.340
It change the length of, say, a half a second is pretty good.

39
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.320
And I want very small steps.

40
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.270
So let's zoom right in.

41
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.050
Great.

42
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.810
OK.

43
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.400
So first thing I want to change, I want to get rid of this text and that's going to happen.

44
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.530
I'd say immediately actually.

45
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.760
Yes.

46
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.510
Get rid of the text immediately.

47
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.100
So get rid the label and it's going to come back right here.

48
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.920
So at zero, it's at a key.

49
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.030
At zero point four five.

50
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.180
Let's put the visibility back at the key.

51
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.410
Let's see how that looks.

52
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.250
Some surprise play.

53
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.480
Right.

54
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.670
It occurs to me that we might need to see the text straight away.

55
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.080
More about that.

56
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.420
OK.

57
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.940
Looking good.

58
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.400
Now I want to resize my nine patch rectangles.

59
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.690
Here's one patch rectangle.

60
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.810
Now, it's not showing the key straight away.

61
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.640
So I'm going to go back to animation pledges and add new track.

62
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.150
And it's really a new property track, which is why I discovered in my patch rectangle pattern, I want

63
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.310
to change the Recht scale.

64
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.800
So to do two right size.

65
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.400
Right scale.

66
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.750
There it is.

67
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.820
Awesome.

68
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.840
Insert key right here.

69
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.150
Simon, insert a key here.

70
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.920
And that's my value of one one.

71
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.520
Great.

72
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.310
This in says another key in the middle.

73
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.360
And then click on that.

74
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.200
Make sure that selected.

75
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.940
And let's change the value to zero zero.

76
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.780
How's that look.

77
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.610
Yep, it vanishes.

78
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.060
Great.

79
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.840
And then back at zero point four five, it's inside a brand new key.

80
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.190
Make sure it's selected and put one one.

81
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.790
And let's see how that looks.

82
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.340
That looks pretty lovely.

83
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.700
OK.

84
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
I'm gonna make sure I leave the castle right at the end so I can see the text of the game begins.

85
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.100
So we save that.

86
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.050
And now you're back into a tutorial scene and open the script and I'm gonna for the animation right

87
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.320
here.

88
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.580
So let's tutorial animation player DOT play and we're playing message change.

89
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.000
Okay, let's see how that looks.

90
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.680
Opening tutorial, doo doo doo.

91
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.870
Look at that.

92
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.210
That looks pretty awesome through here,

93
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.280
down here.

94
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.400
Excellent.

95
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.980
Now, we could change the vision mode here.

96
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.710
Let's do that real quick.

97
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.290
I want to put vision mode back to normal.

98
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.450
When we go here, and that's gonna be pretty simple.

99
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.550
So going to enter the night vision objective.

100
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.770
So when we enter night vision objective, which is to do to do right here, I want to change vision

101
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.020
mode.

102
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.330
That's simple group code.

103
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.540
Let's find out that group.

104
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.810
Somebody go into night into vision mode and open.

105
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.110
That's.

106
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.230
And ticklers groups, it's an interface.

107
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.780
Fantastic.

108
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.800
So I'm just gonna go get tree dot core group.

109
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.360
Interface and what's the what's the actual thing we're calling the script the script.

110
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.010
We are calling.

111
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.370
Doc mode, I was gonna copy that and back into my tutorial script.

112
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.240
And let's see how that works.

113
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.070
As you wander through here.

114
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.910
Doo doo doo doo doo.

115
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.140
To adult into night vision, most I can see this wax.

116
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.240
I look at that, and that is a tutorial.

117
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.250
Now, there's a lot more we could add to it.

118
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.350
But in this video, we have finished Heisse mice's, which means I can show you this graphic array.

119
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.490
We have done some great stuff here.

120
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.130
We've taken basic templates.

121
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.420
We've expanded on them and inherited them so we can fit in as many different levels as we want.

122
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.990
We can make more, more and pieces and threats, more types of loot.

123
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.020
We have shown you how to build the tutorials.

124
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.390
They can expand it to show things like how to use the boxes and stuff like that.

125
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.930
This should give you the tools you need to make your top down stealth game as awesome as you like to

126
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.570
play with it.

127
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.340
Explore the possibilities.

128
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.960
Really push yourself to the limits and see what you can create because it's a really good backbone of

129
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.390
the game here.

130
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.920
Meanwhile, excellent work and we'll see you the next video.
