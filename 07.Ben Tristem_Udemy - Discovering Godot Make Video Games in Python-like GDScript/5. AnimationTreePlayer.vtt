Hello inglorious God.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.090
People in this video were going to learn about the animation tree play a..

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.710
Which is a really cool noad when we're working with 3-d.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.930
We're going to do is I the play a character.

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.880
When the player moves ivie's P.S. further character on screen player is the person pressing the buttons.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.170
But we want the player character to move smoothly from one animation to another.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.410
And I'll show you what I mean.

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.970
So let's say I take this script and I'm going to open up the play a scene and access this animation.

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.600
So we've got this animation here like run right.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.560
So I could call run in scripts he's running he's running he's running and a stop on it.

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.620
And I'm going to call this one.

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.760
Now you run again.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.470
This is very fractured.

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.380
Right it's not a smooth animation Let's say I am working now now I am running.

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.090
What we want is a way of blending these animations.

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.550
And for this we're going to use a new type of note and that note it's going to be an animation trio

17
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.830
play and actually three players are rather different.

18
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.210
First off they are graphics space right it's a visual note.

19
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.370
And what we want is our final animation to come out of the output.

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.050
First we need to make sure we've set this up properly.

21
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.440
Okay so the first thing to do is not put this in this scene.

22
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.610
I need it to put it in the actual armature scene.

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.370
Let's make sure that the animation player is in there the base scene so any changes we make were going

24
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.350
to bring the animation tree player with us.

25
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.420
So new animation to play.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090
Okay.

27
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.810
To set this up correctly we need to look over here.

28
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.930
So we have the master player and the bass path first thing I need to do is point it to an animation

29
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.160
play.

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.220
It's going to access all of the animations and the animation player.

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.310
So let's do that.

32
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.210
Click on here and do a sign and just click on the animation player.

33
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.720
The next thing we need to do is make sure that the base path is the same as that in the animation player.

34
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.350
So the Amish play has a root node which is the armature right the skeleton.

35
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.340
And I know this because dot dot means go up one level it's the parent that animation tree player has

36
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.970
to have the same parent.

37
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.810
Right so the base path here has to be the same as the root node in animation player.

38
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.720
And here's why animation tree player is going to access the bones the same way that animation player

39
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.440
does.

40
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.290
So when it starts running these animations and blended together it has to have the same path.

41
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.990
If they're pointing different places it won't know what to do.

42
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.920
Currently these are set to be the same place so that's great.

43
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.720
Okay.

44
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.430
So have these as well the first thing to do is will add in animation and I can rename this animation.

45
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.010
I can rename this silts renamed this idle animation I'll add in.

46
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.320
Right.

47
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.620
And it should have access to all of the animations already in the animation player.

48
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.590
It's a little confusing talk about animation treat players and animation players but hopefully you can

49
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.080
get your head round it belt at night.

50
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.740
OK so this is my idol animation and I want to bring in a second animation and it's going to be my running

51
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.070
animation for now which can put these two together later are going to make this a lot more complicated.

52
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.840
Let's do run an.

53
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.740
And azman Expect going to load in my run animation.

54
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.760
OK.

55
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.250
So we have two animations and currently nothing is happening.

56
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.120
What we need is to go to the output.

57
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.600
So let's say I move run to the output.

58
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.320
OK.

59
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.130
Nothing is happening may get active.

60
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.500
The animation tree player is now active and whatever's on the output is going to be working and it's

61
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.600
going to override anything that's here if I pretend deaf the deaf animation is running.

62
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.710
But you don't see it.

63
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.890
If you want to see it you need to deactivate the active animation.

64
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.650
Go stop that and make this running an OK.

65
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.560
Well right now we don't actually have a blended animation what we have is an animation that overrides

66
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.140
animation play.

67
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.360
We need a way of switching between these two.

68
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.820
For that we've got these various blends options.

69
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.530
Let's actually stop him running for now.

70
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.940
These weren't options we have a blend to blend three and a blend four.

71
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.870
And I've linked you to the official documentation.

72
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.990
So one of the resources here is the got o documentation website where you can read about how these work.

73
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.120
But I'm going to run you through them very quickly.

74
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.200
Let's start with the blend to what you're going to do is when I have two animations and we can move

75
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.190
a slider between 0 and 1 and wherever we are on that on that scale zero point zero ones are a point

76
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.050
five point seventy five whatever you like is going to blend between animation a an animation B blend

77
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.480
three is a little different.

78
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.740
Negative One is animation B minus or minus be an image.

79
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.180
Point zero slider is animation A and plus one is animation B plus.

80
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.900
Now the reason these are called B minus and B Plus is a blend three will not allow you to blend B minus

81
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.440
and B plus together get up where she the note in a moment you'll see that a blend four is like to blend

82
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.130
twos added together.

83
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.890
So we have an eight and a b and a 1 and a B one.

84
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.740
They will blend together based on how they blend individually.

85
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.690
Let me show you what that looks like.

86
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.210
Let's say I can get run an idol here.

87
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.980
I'm going to put them over the output make this active again so here we have it nice.

88
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.750
I like the mission.

89
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.130
I also have a slider and as I move the slide it up.

90
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.390
You see the animation automatically Blands.

91
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.440
If we wanted to we could also filter out specific boland's So if you wanted an animation to bland and

92
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.710
just use the head or not include the feet or whatever it was you could do that.

93
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.580
So this allows us to blend two animations and obviously we control the slider in code right so that's

94
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.110
very useful as you might expect we have these other animations here.

95
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.440
We're going to make a more complicated state later in the section but this is the basics.

96
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.400
Now let's say we have a third animation.

97
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.450
So let's bring in a punch and we need a blend three.

98
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:29.150
I can blend in Idol run and punch and bring That's the output you'll see at point zero it's playing.

99
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.140
I can blend this.

100
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.590
So we're blending halfway roughly between idle and run or halfway between run and punch.

101
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.840
So you need to use a little bit of forward planning here which animations can go together.

102
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.180
Can I run and punch.

103
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.440
Can I idle and run.

104
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.190
Can I idle and punch can I.

105
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.930
I'll run and punch whatever are a blend for.

106
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.950
Let's bring in another animation.

107
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.760
How do you feel about working great.

108
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.540
Put you here.

109
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.820
Let's put these all together one that is drag that bit.

110
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.450
There we go.

111
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.240
So you're a zero.

112
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:17.100
You are v0 you are a one and you are be1 and it will connect you to the output.

113
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.570
OK so what it's doing is it's got two separate blends.

114
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.940
So the run an idler blended together.

115
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.330
But look what's happening here.

116
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.680
Right.

117
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.060
It's running working and run.

118
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.350
And it doesn't want to be doing that.

119
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.810
So let's blend that out.

120
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.220
And here is I don't even know what's happening here.

121
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.650
Punch is not running and it's is a little bit less blending four together like this can be very tricky.

122
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.430
I disconnect that for now.

123
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.190
I'm just going to run.

124
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.490
This blend to some to remove everything and not using when a right click on the top though.

125
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.480
And that's the answer I give to them and connect you back to the app.

126
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.070
You should calm down the an excellent.

127
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.730
And I can give myself a bit more space.

128
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.970
I was going to rename this blend too I need a better name for this up not remove.

129
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:23.240
I'm going to rename it to a and b come back again and let's rename you to move.

130
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.920
Put your knee up at.

131
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.950
So we now have something we can we can access in code.

132
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.200
Now you know there's a few other things here.

133
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.540
Time scale is very useful for any to speed up or slow down animation.

134
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.840
Transition time seek I'll be honest I haven't play with them a lot.

135
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:46.550
Mix allows you to just have a standard mix but what we have here is pretty good for what we need.

136
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.640
So let's save that for now and we go back in here.

137
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.690
And you should see that the animation tree player is now part of the ambitious.

138
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.840
Great save that Alright look.

139
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.710
His animation has changed and I want him to move him.

140
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.260
He's now facing entirely the wrong direction so I will fix that soon.

141
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.550
He's not actually animating right.

142
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.220
What we've got is override everything with default so we need to control this in code so let's do that

143
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.740
when we stop that.

144
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.110
Let's make this nice and big.

145
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.850
We need a few more variables.

146
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.380
In fact we need some constants.

147
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.640
Let's make this a little easier.

148
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.380
I'm going to split up my variables.

149
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm a call these movement variables.

150
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.160
And over here I'll have a section for animation constants.

151
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.250
We don't know what the going to be yet but we have a section for well I do know is that as well as moving

152
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.420
and facing forward I need to animate.

153
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.170
OK so let's make a function called element.

154
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.780
And again the substance room.

155
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.870
There we go to cook function.

156
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.700
And me it's very me.

157
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.580
The very first thing we should do is grab that armature right we need to grab the animation there so

158
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:13.110
let's save a variable animator and I only need to exist in this section in this function verrill variable

159
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.550
animate.

160
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:13.940
What is that.

161
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.320
That is an animation tree player.

162
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.900
There it is.

163
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.490
So now I agree you she's a word limit.

164
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.350
I get the first thing I need to know is are we moving.

165
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.940
Okay so the when to do that is a take this motion value which we are going to have to change later but

166
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.360
for now take set the motion value.

167
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.340
There was a motion and I don't want just the value I want.

168
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:41.820
I am moving so is the length of the motion that's going to tell me how much moving if that's greater

169
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.280
than some kind of blend M. so let's call this bland minimum.

170
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.820
That's going be a first constant this wants to be a small number.

171
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.920
So let's put you up here and say constant blend minimum equals zero point 1 2 5 a pulling up here so

172
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.040
can change it but it shouldn't change once we're running like this doesn't change a runtime set.

173
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.980
Now code.

174
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.980
If that's running I want to do something get in a moment.

175
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.990
I'm going to get you to fill this section out.

176
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.230
But before we do let's look at the node we need to be using.

177
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.860
Let's look at the function that's the word of the function.

178
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:29.000
It's part of the animation tree place the call ammit Dot blend to set amount lent to set amount.

179
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.780
OK.

180
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:36.300
So we need some way of moving the slider and this will allow us to change the slider if we open the

181
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.170
documentation for it.

182
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.950
You can see right here where it takes it takes an IED.

183
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.100
That's the name of the node and a value.

184
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.710
The value is going to be between 0 and 1.

185
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.260
So I have a slightly more difficult challenge than normal for you.

186
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.010
Let's see how comfortable you are with this.

187
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.240
If this is a little bit tricky or you get a little bit lost Don't worry give it a go.

188
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:03.210
I would like you to use blend to know a set amount to have the information blend from idle to running

189
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.460
when the player moves and back again when they stop.

190
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:12.420
So what we're looking at is a way of increasing from zero which is idle to 1 when we're moving and then

191
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.760
decreasing from 1 to zero.

192
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.510
And this can be decreasing over time.

193
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.570
We want to change over time.

194
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.030
So pause the video give that a shot and when you're either happy with your results or you're a little

195
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.030
frustrated you don't really want to do this anymore.

196
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.910
Come back and I'll show you my solution.

197
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.260
And welcome back.

198
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.060
So let's start with how blend to set about works and if can start timing here.

199
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.140
And I know that my animation tree player has this.

200
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.560
This is the No what move.

201
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.020
So that's a strength so we can bring that in as a string move.

202
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.510
Double check that I've capitalized that correctly because you know me in writing.

203
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.680
Yes I have.

204
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.160
And when he'd float blend.

205
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.400
OK.

206
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.030
So how much blending by.

207
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.660
Well I need a new variable someone to call this.

208
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:07.800
Or shall we call it let's call it move the ball end that way.

209
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.310
And that's going to go right up here.

210
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.650
So it's not animation.

211
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:17.050
Constance animation variable animation variables.

212
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.320
We call this like that and we need to start.

213
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.290
This is a basic value.

214
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.650
This is a dumb name isn't it.

215
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.200
Doesn't tell me what it is as you move state.

216
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.850
So animation variables you now move state let's comment out that it's this comment in what that is.

217
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.200
So move State zero is bydel one is run and let's change it here so move state is going to be what we

218
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.530
actually change.

219
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.420
OK.

220
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.880
So we need to change this over time.

221
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:52.210
So if we're moving this has to go up so move state plus equals and I need some sort of run blend about

222
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.890
sollis do run a blend amount.

223
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.160
And you know what that should be a constant because this won't change runtime run blend.

224
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.170
Matt Boop.

225
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.080
I'm right back at the beginning.

226
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.540
He's a troll at home to jump up.

227
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.440
See constant rumbling when Mt..

228
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:15.130
Let's have this very small point one and we're doing another one called bidle blend about so in all

229
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:21.090
land amount maybe we're going to slow down same speed we speed up but just in case that's have the option.

230
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.640
So if that's the case then increase this value by that amount.

231
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.040
OK.

232
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:38.090
So what if it isn't so else move State minus equals idle blunder about.

233
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.890
Now what I do need to do is clamp move state right.

234
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:48.210
And the reason is even if the slider can't go above zero can't go below zero and above one it can certainly

235
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.560
go above zero.

236
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.330
If I keep moving this value this amount is going to go higher and higher and higher.

237
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.680
So a move they could end up being 150.

238
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.360
And then I'm going to have to wait for it to go to zero.

239
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.660
So it's gonna take ages to stop moving.

240
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.710
So instead of doing that it's clampett.

241
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:10.800
So move state to state he calls a clamp.

242
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.140
And we've used this before right so we.

243
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.830
Why do we climb from having to move state.

244
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.590
What's our minimums evaluable can never go below zero.

245
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.970
We can never go above one.

246
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.170
And that should work fine so let's find out if I'd done it right.

247
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:24.870
It does.

248
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.590
Now I am facing the wrong way now.

249
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:33.450
A couple ways I could do this but I could do this in code and I could say okay so if you're going forward

250
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.380
then go back then look backwards all the rest of you know that might be the easiest way of doing it.

251
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:46.860
Let's just do that so I'm going to switch out of that and that and switch out left and right and come

252
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.910
back.

253
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.320
So I'll just switch the valleys around.

254
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.260
So now at Pressplay.

255
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.430
Fantastic.

256
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.810
Let's make it even easier for ourselves.

257
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.220
Let's put the camera as a child of play for the moment and I press play.

258
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.960
And look at that slows down now let's make the Idol even slower so we can see this working let's make

259
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.830
I'd went about 0.01.

260
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.750
So he's going to start running.

261
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.970
And then slowly come to rest.

262
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.040
Isn't that wonderful.

263
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.420
You can do all kinds of fun changes for that so I'm going to put this back to what's a good amount.

264
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.630
There zero point five four that feels good to do.

265
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.140
Yes.

266
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.020
That feels a lot more natural and his desk is way too big.

267
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.260
But I can fix that when we start putting furniture in because I feel like that's a really good place

268
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.160
to stop for now.

269
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.570
Which brings us to the end of the video.

270
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.090
In this video we've introduced ourselves to animation play or possibly introduce it to us.

271
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.010
We've learned how to blend animations which is really useful and you can go quite in-depth.

272
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.620
We will be going more in depth later on in the section.

273
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.420
But I think that's a really good start.

274
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.370
So how did you get on was the challenge you difficult.

275
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.030
Have you found funny other ways you can use an emotion player.

276
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.720
How are you doing with the section so far.

277
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.530
Love to hear feedback.

278
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.470
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
