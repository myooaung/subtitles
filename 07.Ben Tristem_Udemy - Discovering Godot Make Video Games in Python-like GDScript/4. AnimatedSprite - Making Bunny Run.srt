1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,800
Wonderful God the people who are wonderful in this video that take things a step further.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,340
We've got a simple left and right moving Sprite.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,110
Let's change that for an animated sprite in this video.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,830
We're going to make money not just move but run.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,540
So do we need to do it.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,640
Well the first thing to do is we have this Sprite here and I don't want it.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,220
Two things we could do we could right click on it and you change type and then pick an animated Sprite.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,100
However it's not going to rename it.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,720
And we have to go in and rename it so instead of that just delete this note entirely.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,920
And we're going to create a new child node animated sprite.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,020
I want to put it right here.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,250
Cook got an error and the error is there are no Sprite frames.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,570
So we have an animated Sprite and we can't do is just drag our.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,730
Where Well you go.

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,600
Money ready.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,000
There we go.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:02,800
We can't just drag it here so we make new Sprite frames and click on the Sprite frames and now we have

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,560
our Sprite frame animation.

20
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:10,840
First thing I do is I want change the word default to Idol when I'm not going to use capitals like that

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,520
and just do all lowercase as a good habit hit it too.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,900
And I'm just going to move my money stand over here and let's take a look.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,070
And the collisions should still fit because the same frame are used earlier but I'm also do is put money

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,930
ready right here.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,600
A quick Idol press playing hard look we have an animated Sprite.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Fantastic.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,260
I am noticing that the collision is going into the floor a little bit.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,860
There shouldn't be too bad.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,490
We go back into our Sprite player and we can slow things down.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,700
So let's say I want this are two frames a second.

31
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,830
Maybe 10 flavours that are.

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm quite liking three frames a second.

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,510
That feels good to me.

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,320
There's also a loop on and off so it just it wants then stop.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,720
It will keep going while I'm at it.

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,540
I'm just stuck at running for now so I can see what I'm doing.

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,570
Let's add in a few more animations when we want to make a run.

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,540
So back into the Sprite frames and let's make a new animation.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,230
And this was a record run.

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,060
Let's see.

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,460
I want one you walk one and Bunny walk two.

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,550
It's going to loop and it's going to loop at.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,070
Well I'll do the last one at three.

44
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,440
And let's see that running.

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,590
Whoops wrong thing.

46
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,260
Instead of play run and I want it to run oh maybe it's a little slow.

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,070
I think I might actually want a little faster.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,430
So see you at five every second.

49
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,420
Let's see you at 10 frames a second.

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,540
As you come tempting you know what I'll put it there.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,510
Although it's seven they're not 100.

52
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,920
Not a hundred are seven much more.

53
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,690
Okay.

54
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,150
So here we have a very simple animated Sprite.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,990
I'm going to put in a few more just to get them in.

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,060
Let's do a couple more on it because we will at some point get a jump we may as well do it now.

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,650
And jump is it could be a very simple jump.

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,560
One frame doesn't let me do this and let's do hurt.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,010
Or animations.

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,630
Now we need to do is switch between them.

61
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,520
So back to the script.

62
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,050
OK.

63
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,340
So how do we actually get the animated Sprite player to work animated sprites.

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,110
There it is.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,060
Don't play.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,810
And what's it going to play.

67
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,870
It's going to play animations.

68
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,640
So in this case it's going to play run.

69
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:55,230
I think we called it and we can just duplicate that and move it down here and down here with a playing

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,160
animator Sprite clay.

71
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,240
And does this work have that made a sprite move.

72
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,290
So does Bonnie look at that.

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,620
Are we here let's take a quick look at the animated Sprite note sup.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,260
We have the actual frames that's playing with the find our own which animation we're playing right now

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,330
would sticking with Idol is it playing.

76
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,110
Sure.

77
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,280
Which frame are we on.

78
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,990
Easy.

79
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,530
Is it sent it nice and simple.

80
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,280
Do you want the Sprite to generate at the zero point of the player or do you want to do it from the

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,840
corner offset.

82
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,690
Do you want it off to the side or above a blow flip horizontal and vertical horizontal just flips it

83
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,920
on the x axis and flip vertical on the vertical axis which in fact brings me to the challenge because

84
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,860
you'll notice that when Bunny runs loops as you press play you'll notice that when Bunny runs running

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,220
right is fine but running left.

86
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,510
But he's moonwalking Bunny isn't facing the right direction.

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,630
I'd like you to make bunny face the right way switch which way Bunny is facing the pending the direction.

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,820
Now we've actually look to something so he might look at Flip H.

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,070
Pause the video when you come back I'll show you my solution.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,090
So how do I make that work.

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,730
Well we can animated sprites just before.

92
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,360
Flip on a Scott H.

93
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,420
And remember if you're not sure what that is.

94
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,610
You can just go to the Sprite node and mouse over the property you need and its property.

95
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,580
Flip H all lowercase.

96
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,180
OK so when you moving right we don't want you to reverse.

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,740
I wanted that to be false.

98
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,610
Do NOT flip let's duplicate that and move that down here.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,790
And when you're running left I want it to be true.

100
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,670
Let's see if that works.

101
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,470
Phenomenal.

102
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,970
Now you will notice that the flower is moving left and right.

103
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:06,040
So what I can do is just when you're not moving and made a sprite dart's faculties doing flips underscore

104
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,120
H equals false.

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,690
Now that flower is always moving in the right side.

106
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,870
And there we have it.

107
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,900
Bunny can run left and right or stand still and catch its breath.

108
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,610
Perfect.

109
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,130
We then set up animations so he can jump and be hurt later.

110
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,120
So that is looking really good.

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,220
We're already there.

112
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,760
So look in this video.

113
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,450
Nice is short.

114
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,790
We've learned how to set up an animated Sprite how to call those animations in script and how to use

115
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,670
flip H and indeed flip the.

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,330
Which is great because it means you don't have to make art assets for every single direction you just

117
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,060
have to make it for half of them.

118
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,930
Great work.

119
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,790
Now there is one thing that I'm not too happy about which going to fix later on just to give you a heads

120
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,360
up.

121
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,310
Right now the play script is doing everything the player can do it's handling movement and animation.

122
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,480
Later on we're going to move the animation out of the script and put it into animated playlists have

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,740
the animation deal with animation and the player just deals player movement.

124
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,800
That's a little later.

125
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,720
But just a heads up.

126
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,890
We don't want this getting too crowded.

127
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,040
In fact we're going to do a lot of refactoring the next few years.

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,770
If you use different art assets and you've got them animating differently or you just decided to tweak

129
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,660
the sprites and do something else I'd love to see them share them the forums and the discord and any

130
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,060
other community site you like maybe the Facebook group.

131
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,260
And either way I see on the next video.
