00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,990
Hello wonderful God people in this video we're going to put the state of our game.

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,450
We're going to put a portal which if it touches will win the game and to make the portal really magical

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,500
wouldn't they put some particles into it.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,030
So before we get to it let's quickly look at the design here.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,340
I want the player to beat the level if Bunny touches the portal so that says to me Area to deep right

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,960
the portal floats.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,460
So when I give it a slight animation it should feel a little bit magical and it's going to have particles

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,980
to look even more magical.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,540
OK.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,190
Nice and easy.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,110
Let's get to it.

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,060
Okay let's make a portal.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,170
I want to make a tough map.

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,350
Let's make a portal.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,320
And to do that I need a new seat.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,990
So a new scene and a root of area to hoodie.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,940
Why.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,600
Because we're going to measure when Bunny is touching something and the easiest way to do that is with

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
an area today.

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,240
Good to rename this portal

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,890
and I dont need this animation window.

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,120
This is from my prototyping.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,770
Get rid of that for now.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,320
Okay weve done this a few times.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,830
Right someone make a Sprite and then a collision shape first thing spect.

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,340
If you look at the graphics under items there's a yellow portal or portal yellow.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,420
And let's give you a collision shape.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,870
This has to be a child of portal not of Sprite.

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:26,220
So collision segert Judy and then make a nice simple one a rectangle it be very forgiving with this.

30
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,940
It's going to be wider than this.

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,080
But it touches Anyway here you have won the game.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,990
Well done you've made it through these challenges.

33
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,220
He was and I know I've said this three times.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:42,160
Remember scale by the extant not by the scale handle good to hide that and make sure that when I move

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,500
the portal I move the portal and all children get again in a couple of things.

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,150
First thing I want to see this Sprite of the portals to actually animate.

37
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,360
So let's do that.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,550
Let's do animation player.

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,680
OK.

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,550
Where are we going.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,060
And then make the Sprite.

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,310
I'm not going to animate the area to.

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,050
Why.

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,950
Because I want to scale this thing right and make it float by scaling it.

45
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,770
If I scale the area too deep I also scale the collision shape and that way bugs can be.

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,310
We had dragon way of saying that but time here be dragons that seen scene formation portal float.

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,320
We have an underscore because reasons.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,700
There it is.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,510
And I think a nice two second animation and we will just do the scale key Sprite scale.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,330
Perfect.

51
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,260
And make this a looping animation.

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,300
And at one second I will change the scale of the spri economical a little bit wider you know what let's

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,620
change the scale this way.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,780
First thing is centred good.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,540
So now when I scale it it'll scale on the centre.

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,880
That's why I'm taking that scale that say one point to five on the X

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,920
and point seventy five on the Y.

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm going to play a key there.

59
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm not going to want the end because if it's looping it's already going back there so let's see how

60
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,060
that looks.

61
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay that's a little bit slower than I wanted.

62
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,450
Now I could drag this over here and shot the animation.

63
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,100
Let's look at another way we could do that.

64
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,640
If I go to animation player and I'm going to playback options speed one that shows that too.

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,710
And I want to press play.

66
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,670
It's now doing at double speed.

67
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,260
So if I don't want to be moving that off I just want to see what it's going to look like at different

68
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,620
speeds.

69
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,480
I could do that.

70
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,020
You'll notice.

71
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,710
You can also animate the playback speed so if you need to do slow downs and speed ups that's how you

72
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,650
could do that.

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,900
OK so we have our portal.

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,850
Let's save that other scenes.

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,210
I'm a put a signal in.

76
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,740
I'm going to do it right here.

77
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
So let's make our portal instance our portal in scenes portal.

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,550
No no no no no portal and let's do that on move.

79
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,120
There we go.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,130
Much more like it.

81
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,740
I will put it on a test it before I put it anywhere let's put it right here near Bunny.

82
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,330
I'll move it to another level.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,790
And make sure that I've actually got the animation playing.

84
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,420
Current animation portal float.

85
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,230
Great.

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,460
It's on auto load.

87
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
It's looping.

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
Looks good.

89
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,260
Okay.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,570
I want to connect this to a signal.

91
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,220
So let's do body entered and connect that to game state.

92
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,280
And we're going to leave it as on portal body entered.

93
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,100
Couple of things I could do here.

94
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,210
I could just tell it.

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,720
End game or I could make a brand new scene saying you win.

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,250
For now let's do end game.

97
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,730
So now when Bunny lands on this thing should have a nice easy game over go.

98
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,320
How would I change that.

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,740
Well let's go to the end game scene.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,200
As game over and what to do is make a new version of the scene.

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm going to do new inherited scene.

102
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,260
What scene we inheriting from was the basey.

103
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,900
We are starting from Game over.

104
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:26,500
And now in this new scene which I'm going to call victory.

105
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,740
I would change the text.

106
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,110
You'll see everything here isn't great out.

107
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,440
That's because this is the inherited value.

108
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,480
But if I change this to you win and save this scene you'll see it saving a brand new song.

109
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,800
So that means I can go into my games state script.

110
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,780
Here it is.

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,170
And I can have a victory scene so let's do right here function.

112
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,490
Win again

113
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,160
and let's copy this.

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,410
PACE it there.

115
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,300
But we're not going to do.

116
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,050
Game over.

117
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,260
Right.

118
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,250
We're going to do a victory.

119
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,820
So let's call this victory and we need to define victory.

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,930
So into.

121
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,760
Global.

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,110
Brand new scene and I'll put it directly on the game over hoops.

123
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,310
Victory equals right click on the victory sign.

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,090
Copy path.

125
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,290
All of this is a variation on a theme right.

126
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,520
We've done this before.

127
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,280
OK.

128
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,090
So now it's close as I can see you're doing.

129
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,930
So now we're in global we've got victory.

130
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,450
Let's actually make that work.

131
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,130
So on portal body Enter atlus gold win game and a.

132
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,720
When I put that function in there well ago function or win game.

133
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,170
And what are you going to do.

134
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,780
You're going to.

135
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,410
Let's duplicate this cannot be written down and you're not going to a global game over.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
Oh need you can't.

137
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,230
You're not going to Global Game over.

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,870
You're going to global victory.

139
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,390
That should work fine.

140
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,140
There it is giving a victory saying I didn't notice that this doesn't seem to be an amazing.

141
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,820
Are you in a meeting.

142
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,450
Yes you are.

143
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,290
Awesome.

144
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,540
Naphtali lightning.

145
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,820
Now we have one more thing I'm going to go back into the live portal scene and I'm just going to stop

146
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,580
it planning for now because my eyes.

147
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm going to add in a brenan note.

148
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm an add in particle to see if I can spell it.

149
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,270
There it is particles to be particles 2D.

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,050
Does some really cool things.

151
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,720
First thing I need to do says there's no material in order for this to work.

152
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,180
You need a process material.

153
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:51,020
So let's make a new particle material and you'll see it's just dropping standard blobs behind it.

154
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,090
I'm also going to put my particles above the sprite and that way you can see that in here.

155
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,440
Now I'm attaching a link to the documentation That'll explain everything that these particles do.

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,110
Right so you can play with them but very quickly let's look at some key ones emitting.

157
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,500
This is light enable America.

158
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,650
The default is on switch it off.

159
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:17,790
Now particles switch it on particles break out how many there are and what do 20 for the moment one

160
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,200
fades it gets respond case perhaps back to eight for now.

161
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,690
Time how long does it last.

162
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,590
So let's say last 10 seconds.

163
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,990
Why is it now dripping.

164
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,860
Because you can only have eight particles if I do 24.

165
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,800
And now we have water dripping on a stunt let's put this down see what's a good lifetime.

166
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
Two seconds ago.

167
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,640
All his other variables are a lot of fun to play with but most of them are actually in the particle

168
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,090
material.

169
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,160
This is where the fun stuff is.

170
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,940
So let's say I want things to orbit I want an orbital velocity of what's good 10.

171
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,320
Two right.

172
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:11,570
Gravity for example so if I move this to minus 98 gravity is now up right here it is back down.

173
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,740
One more thing then do let's give it texture material.

174
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,590
So in particles on the graphics thing you'll see we've got a portal particles just put that right here.

175
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,620
There we go.

176
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,380
OK.

177
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,730
So this brings me to my challenge.

178
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,530
I'd like you to omit some particles customize your particle to decode and a little something that you

179
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,040
like.

180
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,380
Don't be afraid to play with it.

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,190
It's going to look bad for a while then sun it's going to look good.

182
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,420
Just explore the options look through the documentation see what the various things do.

183
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,270
Suppose the video have a play when you come back I'll show you my solution.

184
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,770
Mike Mac.

185
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,270
OK.

186
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,950
Let's start at beginning some guy through these Wonder time missing.

187
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,240
I want that 24 actually feels pretty good to me.

188
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,140
Lifetime.

189
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,290
How long is going to last for.

190
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,150
Sounds good.

191
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,830
One shot one shot is interesting.

192
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,080
One shot means these file once and then stop.

193
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,410
Right so these are a one shot and I switch them on.

194
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,710
They'll fire and then they'll stop.

195
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,250
I don't want that.

196
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,440
Pre-process how many seconds have you calculated before you draw.

197
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,820
This is really useful for things like our flaming torches.

198
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,070
If you have a fire effect as a particle they only start drawing when the player can see them.

199
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,210
That means that you're into a room and then the torches flare up or maybe that's not what you want so

200
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,590
you use pre-process.

201
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,350
Let's go in to the material itself.

202
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,010
Now I kind of want these to rotate so what can I do here.

203
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,990
I can change this to a sphere.

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,950
Care right now is not doing anything.

205
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's change the sphere radius to 64.

206
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,250
Ah now we're getting somewhere.

207
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,210
Let's see.

208
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,780
I'm not going to change the alignment spreads.

209
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,430
Yeah what spread a foot five sounds pretty good.

210
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,610
Gravity well if we switch gravity off.

211
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay so now we have this we are twinkly star effect I quite like gravity so I put my gravity back on.

212
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,780
Okay I want these to rotate a little bit so let's give an orbital velocity and I'm going to say point

213
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,660
five.

214
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,580
K there looks pretty good.

215
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,010
What about my initial velocity and the initial velocity point five.

216
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,400
Not that another tug gravity back off.

217
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
I quite like that.

218
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,020
In fact I think I'm going to call that done.

219
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,760
So here are my particle so let's save that and go back into our scene.

220
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,690
And they're looking pretty good.

221
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,340
Look at that.

222
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,130
Let's move the portal to the envelope.

223
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,730
I have my move tool selected so I'm not worried about dragging the wrong thing.

224
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,290
And let's move this coin coin.

225
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:59,150
Let's move you to right there and portal.

226
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,020
Let's move you to here and let's see if I can get to the other level.

227
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,320
So money should she go.

228
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,390
Go.

229
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,060
Ouch.

230
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,120
Ready to go.

231
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,950
However I did manage to win a mug.

232
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,970
I did manage to get an extra boost thanks cloud.

233
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,180
I can't play my own game.

234
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm on Bonnie.

235
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,900
Did it.

236
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,980
Awesome.

237
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,330
And that brings us to the end of the video.

238
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,200
In this video we've had a really quick introduction to the particle system in God.

239
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,380
They're really versatile.

240
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,720
A lot of fun things you could do with it.

241
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,400
And particles are not the only ways we could do this effect but they're a great introduction.

242
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,190
So before I sign off of this video remember to share what you've got Show us the particles you came

243
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,890
up with.

244
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,120
Where else have got particles.

245
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,350
Did you use a different graphic.

246
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,290
Have you got yours sort of floating or being stars of the different colours.

247
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,570
Are they slowly rotating What did you create.

248
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,010
Im really excited to find out.

249
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,630
So share on the discord on Facebook on the forum.

250
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,660
Great work and I'll see you in the next year.
