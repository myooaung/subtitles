00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.240
Welcome back fantastic God people in this video are going to fulfil a lifelong dream that I'm sure you've

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.820
probably shared with me in this video we're going to learn how to sneak around in a box.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.350
What we have to do is give the player the option of disguising themselves.

4
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.260
Metal Gear Solid style as a box and sneaking around in plain sight.

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.960
Later were at penalties for doing that.

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.450
But for now let's just put the functionality in before we do that.

7
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.710
Let's talk about how this works.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.340
SPCS check if the player is in line of sight field of you and range.

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.600
If all three of those are true then it sends a signal saying play a scene.

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.910
We know that you're the player because we're checking against your collision lair.

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.010
Actually we're checking our collision mask to see if that matches your collision there.

12
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.210
But that's the same thing.

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.320
Okay so if the player is on a certain point in the collision layer we know you're the player.

14
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.290
So what happens if we move you to a new place in the collision layer.

15
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.480
That's not going to set up.

16
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.000
If we look over at the player and we go down to a collision on a physics knowledge hoodie collision

17
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.360
we can see the players on the player and we can mouse over it bit zero and value 1.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.950
Okay.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.360
So at touraine that's bit one value two security cameras I'm only reinforces the value at this point

20
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.660
four and guards are 8 so 1 2 4 8.

21
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.060
This one is 16.

22
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.520
What's happening here is that these are binary values right.

23
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.550
We don't need to figure out the numbers in binary.

24
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.690
We could just mouseover this empty box here and see that is of value 16.

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.420
Cool.

26
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.740
Let's make a new physics layer.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.680
And the project settings our scroll down to lay innings to do physics and lay a five is going to be

28
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.180
disguise.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.930
Great.

30
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.820
And just to double check disguise if a mouse over it is value 16.

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.410
Okay before we put this in code if we just change the player's collision there we're going to crash

32
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.280
again and I'll show you why we're going to open a script into scripts and let's go down to play the

33
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.330
action the bit that's going to crash us is right here.

34
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.740
Function player is in line of sight.

35
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.980
Why.

36
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.470
Let's go.

37
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.750
Happens we define a couple of variables with defined space and line of sight obstacle the thing that's

38
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.160
between me and where I'm looking.

39
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.920
Then we say if the line of sight obstacle Collider is the player.

40
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.950
If I change this collision mask there is nothing there.

41
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.400
Right.

42
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.390
So line a slight obstacle is a variable that will remain empty.

43
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.070
So when we check it it won't have a collider and this will crash.

44
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.380
So instead let's add an extra thing right here.

45
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.390
So and we're going to do diff s obstacle or what am I saying.

46
00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.400
If there isn't one so if not l'eau s obstacle return FALSE this return is going to stop this function

47
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.020
from running so I'll stop here on my line 38 and return the value phos.

48
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.820
And we're checking.

49
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.870
True and False CV places.

50
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.360
So if this is false don't even worry about what happens so it doesn't matter if there is no Minocycline

51
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.250
No we've already had time false.

52
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.510
Okay let's make this actually works.

53
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.070
Back into the play a dodgy and on ready.

54
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.430
I'm just going to add collision on the score mask equals 16.

55
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.670
Just to test it.

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.930
How do I know collision mask is a prop..

57
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.660
Well I got to play a mouse over collision lay up the propertys collision there.

58
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.670
I actually mean collision led not collision mask.

59
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.980
I keep doing that collision.

60
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.300
Leah is 16.

61
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.070
I'm really glad I showed you that.

62
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080
Okay let's Pressplay what I'm expecting.

63
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.550
I'm expecting no play detection surplus wand up to a light and hello see me.

64
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.750
Hello.

65
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.820
No play that actionless open a door.

66
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.610
I don't know the combination but yeah that's right.

67
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.130
So let's get rid of collision.

68
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.940
Exciting.

69
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.500
Let's carried the skies.

70
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.170
If we're going to graphics PRNG tiles scroll down there's some boxes.

71
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.580
I quite like tile one to night.

72
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.840
And let's open global GDP.

73
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.480
If it's not up here in as many for you we have to find it it's under scripts so to Scripps global genie

74
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.330
back into our tights I want to set up a couple of pages so astute variable box Sprite.

75
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.560
There is an equals and variable player sprite's.

76
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.470
OK what's the box right box right.

77
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.470
Is this once I move to right click on it and do copy path and just paste it in here.

78
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.690
And that's a strength as do the same for players as a finite player man.

79
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.310
Lou no one man.

80
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.500
There is a copy path.

81
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.680
Okay so we now switch between the box Sprite and the place bright save that go back into the place script.

82
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.700
I want to make a brand new function called disguise.

83
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.080
Function looks.

84
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.480
Mix of space or s he would a function discusses.

85
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.040
I also want the opposite of the skies I look pass for now just make a couple more functions this to

86
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.500
function reveal.

87
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.260
And I feel like we should have a function called toggle disguised because one be able to toggle between

88
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.530
them.

89
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.730
So function.

90
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.830
Toggle the disguise.

91
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.390
There's no pass.

92
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.950
Here's my question though.

93
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.890
Very nice.

94
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.690
So I know I have top disguise revealed in disguise.

95
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.690
Actually I move tugela skies up a bit so I'm going to highlight them on Windows and a barrow.

96
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.980
And that's all looking very shiny.

97
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.420
Okay so let's make toggled disguise work.

98
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.300
When I go into my project settings to input map I want to key or actually top of the disguise I'm told

99
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.520
the sky's on.

100
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.910
It feels a bit key.

101
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.720
So let's make an action called toggle disguise.

102
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.910
Add that and bind a key to it so Plus key press E done.

103
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.580
Just double check of using e anywhere else doesn't know what I am.

104
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:35.680
Now let's make the egie DO something we already have an input of and for measurement change so if inputs

105
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:47.380
dot is action just pressed and that's going to be toggle the skies which has my top one that's lovely.

106
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.250
So if you pressed I would disguise run toggle disguise.

107
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.520
That feels easy.

108
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.520
Let's just check that I've done that correctly by printing a very helpful message loop.

109
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.250
I can see my output console at boop boop boop boop boop boop.

110
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.490
OK.

111
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.500
So that's working.

112
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.960
I don't actually want to print boob every time.

113
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.650
So let's go back at the top of script.

114
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.900
Am I going to make one more variable this variable is going be called disguised.

115
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.730
And we've set it to false so go make a boulis invariably true false variable right at the top of script

116
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.620
and second check.

117
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.860
Are you disguised.

118
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.900
And now let's put some logic in if disguised.

119
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:45.450
So if you're already the skies reveal or else disguise and was put hide but hide is it different is

120
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.300
a built in function and we can't use that because oldest remove this from his ability.

121
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.000
That's not what disguise actually does.

122
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.650
All right so we have a reveal and disguise set in and actually put them in the same order that we've

123
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.820
put them here.

124
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.390
And let's see what revealed us will reveal.

125
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.850
Is going to set my place bright so we are in the play a script so that should work especially when the

126
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.620
play a scene that's open play a scene.

127
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.280
I'm doing this so that auto is going to work.

128
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.680
I'll go and change our sprite's so Sprite dot and we do not want the texture.

129
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.780
Yeah spike texture.

130
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.900
Equals global dot.

131
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.930
Play a Sprite

132
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.220
and the box is going to be Sprite.

133
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.370
Texture.

134
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.400
He calls global dot box right.

135
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.810
So let's run that and see if the disguise works.

136
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.340
And it's very excitingly not working.

137
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.090
Oh.

138
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.060
Because that's not a string that's an object so let's load that in.

139
00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.760
And now that should work lobal no global should really pay attention on typing.

140
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.920
And now I press E on the box.

141
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.910
I'm a person I'm not a person I'm just a box.

142
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.500
Why.

143
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:19.640
Because I'm not setting disguise as true or false so disguised equals false and disguise equals true.

144
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.980
So when you reveal yourself you're not disguised.

145
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.440
And when you when you describe yourself you are disguised.

146
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.470
Let's try one more time.

147
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.020
Great.

148
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.620
They'll notice that the player is still showing.

149
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.280
Right.

150
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.940
And the reason is this light is shining through.

151
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.160
We need to change this light source and this includer back in the script where we reveal ourselves.

152
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.840
I want the light to be dot.

153
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.090
And what's the light 2D prop. I think that's a texture as well texture.

154
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.010
Fantastic.

155
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.140
Texture to be.

156
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.680
It's actually exactly the same as this.

157
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.200
Isn't that because we're loading in that sprite.

158
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.980
Let's do the same thing for box.

159
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.030
This time I'm just going to duplicate this line which in Windows is control beep.

160
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.010
And instead of Sprite texture it's going to be light 2D texture.

161
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:18.880
Let's give that a shot.

162
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.160
Okay.

163
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.700
Now the inclusionist all wrong.

164
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.210
Right.

165
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:34.460
So if I wander up here look at the shadow on casting to see that actually click on light acclivity then

166
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.270
under a cloud it's as character as we inherit it from the character.

167
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:43.560
Let's say that this little disc I can save as and I'll put it in characters because that's fine.

168
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:50.900
And I call this character occluding Dottie Arias.

169
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.180
Awesome.

170
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.750
Now let's change the player's texture to be the box.

171
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.780
So do do do.

172
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.520
Where are you Sprite and just drag over file.

173
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.400
What time what want.

174
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.940
9.

175
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.670
We're not gonna get the light right now because if we fix that instead let's change the colours in shape.

176
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:16.580
So I made clear this a this character cleared great let's make a new one as you can see I've got my

177
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.520
grid set up and I've set my snap to 8 pixels by eight pixels.

178
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.140
Why.

179
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.270
This is a 64 by 64 image.

180
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.150
It divides nicely into that.

181
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:32.960
Let's make a new occlude a polygon and click on the pencil and you can click click click click click.

182
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.080
I'm going to close it.

183
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.840
I don't mind that it's not that it's close and there's no light coming in because we have light inside

184
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.840
it so that's going to work.

185
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.710
Let's save this include some.

186
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:49.570
Click on the includer and press the disk save as and this is going to be box a clue.

187
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.860
Awesome.

188
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.570
So now here's my challenge for you.

189
00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.340
I'd like you to change the players occlusion to match the shape of the box when the player is a box.

190
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.690
For extra credit try and change you back as well.

191
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:09.020
Pause the video give them a shot and when you ready come back and I'll show you my solution.

192
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.980
And welcome back.

193
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:21.550
Alright so the first thing I do is put these files in that same reference in the same global skeps so

194
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.960
into my script.

195
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:35.710
Couldn't find it and I make a couple variable so variable box occlude a spell of concluder looks good

196
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.940
and variable player.

197
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:52.630
Okay now let's find box secluding So that's going to be inside our scenes inside our characters and

198
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:59.200
this character occlude and basically and a right click on execute a copy path and pasted in and we do

199
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.700
the same with player player character occlude up that's what we call it copy path and put it right here.

200
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.730
Great.

201
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.330
So it is going to the script and under light to the texture.

202
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.990
I'm going to do like to clowder and I want to change a property mouse mouseover find the property I

203
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.260
want.

204
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.280
It's right here.

205
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.470
Clowder there it is.

206
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:28.210
So lot of clutter equals and then I'm going to load the resource in so I need to convert it from a string

207
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.060
which is where it is in the global file to have a file to an object load cos it as a file.

208
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:42.670
Google dot player underscore a cluster and then I'm going to duplicate this line controller B and then

209
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.940
move it down with old and down arrow and change it from player occlude to box includer.

210
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.910
And that should work.

211
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.830
So let's Pressplay.

212
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.280
I'm a box.

213
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.140
I'm a player.

214
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.770
I'm a box.

215
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.230
I'm a player now.

216
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.370
Right now I'm not disguised I'm just being a box right so we can put the disguise.

217
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.210
But look it looks great.

218
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.700
Let's actually reset this texture.

219
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.990
Because this is the wrong texture.

220
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:18.590
So let's put the Sprite back as it should be graphics PRNG and a drag member here.

221
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.450
Great.

222
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.050
Let's make the actual disguise work now.

223
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.830
So I need to do is I said collision layer

224
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:36.810
as one when you revealed how I know it's one guy look at the laser mouse over it value one.

225
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:37.610
OK.

226
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.750
And when you're disguised you're going to be value 16 so let's put that in duplicate that and move it

227
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.800
down.

228
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.470
And that should be good to go.

229
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.500
Let's find out.

230
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.480
So here we are square player.

231
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.000
And we could be seeing what we're seeing.

232
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.840
And I'm a box.

233
00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.760
You can't see me.

234
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.770
I'm in disguise.

235
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:01.870
Ha ha ha.

236
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.860
Now right now there's no penalty for this right so we're going to put some penalties in later.

237
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.910
You can only be a box for a set amount of time.

238
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.460
You move slow in your box and let's say you can only be a box as you can only be a box set another time

239
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.050
per level so you're limited by how many times you can be a box how long your box and how quickly you

240
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.410
can move.

241
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.800
But for now I'm a in a box.

242
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.060
One thing we haven't done is change our collision right.

243
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.330
We're a box but we are using the collider for a person if you want to go ahead and change that you should

244
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.680
have the tools available.

245
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.190
But if you're not too worried about it like right now I'm not too worried about it maybe later but right

246
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.120
now it's fine.

247
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.270
Leave the ISS.

248
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.200
And that brings us to the end of the video.

249
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.100
In this video we've looked at how a change collision layers in script.

250
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:52.210
We've loaded sprite's inclusion in script and fulfilled your lifelong dreams of being a box.

251
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.010
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
