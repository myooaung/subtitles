1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,000
Learning to code by making games is a great idea.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,430
Some game engines get in your way and some languages are a little bit hard to grasp at first.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,020
We've got the solution to that for you.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,430
My name is Ben tristam founder of game live TV with over 400000 happy game development students and

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,860
I've teamed up with I'm an old friend of Ben's.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,070
We've known each other for decades.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,610
I have a master's in science education and I'm passionate about teaching game design.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,800
Ben and I have discovered the God game engine an open source free versatile streamlined firm and easy

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
to use engine that can make amazing 2D and 3D games.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,120
And we think that you should join us on this journey to learn this amazing game engine.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,260
Ben who is this for.

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,130
Well if you're a complete beginner in coding or you're a complete beginner in game engines or both then

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,690
this course is ideal for you we're going to be teaching you game development and coding in a python

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,750
like language from scratch.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,110
And how are we going to pull that off.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,940
We'll pull that off by learning to code.

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,860
By making games godo is really fun and it doesn't get in your way and it shows you all the information

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,100
you need at that time and only at that time and g.d. Script the language I'll be teaching it in is based

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,030
on Python.

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,820
The world's most popular programming language which is incredibly fluid and very easy to use.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,210
So this is not our first rodeo.

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,280
We've taught hundreds of thousands of people how to do this.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,900
Just check out the reviews of the course.

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,730
The students are already taking it so.

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,150
Precisely how we're going to do this.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,490
What are the first three games.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,640
The first three games start with Luni lips fun simple word game to teach you the basics of coding and

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,540
how to use the engine.

29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,210
We're going to move on to our very personable and charming platform game 2D platform game lots of fun

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,210
very colourful.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,560
Great way to figure out how the engine plugs together.

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,080
Then tense top down stealth game.

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,770
Lots of sneaking around with lights and shadows and very advanced techniques and from They'll move on

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,720
to 3D.

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,740
Awesome and for the shop developers amongst you I'll be converting all of these projects to see shop

36
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,950
for you as well.

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,400
So this is going to be an awesome journey.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,370
