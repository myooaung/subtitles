Hello again you wonderful God people.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,700
And welcome to a food fight which is going to be a 3D action game based around the joy of throwing food

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,320
at robots.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,890
They don't hit you with food which is something they think we can.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,060
All right OK.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,530
I want to make a 3D action game.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,230
I didn't really want to use guns so were using food.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm really looking forward to this game as a lot of suffering to delve into here.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's take a look at our essential experience when I think about the word food fight.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,270
I'm seeing it a fast frantic and cheerful game about throwing food while avoiding being hit by more

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,930
food.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,390
Right.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,620
And the key words here are fast frantic cheerful throwing and avoiding.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,230
So if we put those together we get this.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,190
There's one more thing I'm going to bring in though and that's character customization.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,180
Now this isn't technically part of the sensual experience unless we make a special effort for it.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,440
But we do want to be thinking about this right at the beginning.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,590
Character customization is a lot like multi player in that it's a lot easier to put in if you're designing

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,060
the game from scratch with an in mind than it is to add in later.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,290
If we design the entire game and then cybernaut character customization to come in we're going to have

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,320
our work cut out for us.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,660
And from that beginning you can see that I've got this kind of game right.

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,630
We've got very cheerful wording lots of bright colours we're using lots of low poly high contrast or

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,720
high colour or Hillary and I describe these colours but they're fun.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,270
We've got current customization with two possible characters in here.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:32,670
Right.

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,470
With male and female and we show you how you can do that and find the appearance you want bring them

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,520
into the game.

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,960
And we've got these fun little robots that are throwing random food at people and we're dealing with

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,140
collisions for furniture food have already died.

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,330
And that's fantastic.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,160
And that's it.

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,190
It's a lot of fun.

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,320
There's a lot of cool things going to be doing here and some great God techniques including blending

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,780
animations character customization.

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,140
I'm really looking forward to that section.

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,580
So let's dive right into it.
