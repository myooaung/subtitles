00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.260
Hi folks welcome back.

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.780
In this video we're going to look at the Q free and reload current scene commands.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.700
And we're going to do this because there's a bug in our game.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.930
Let's take a quick look at what that bug is.

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.470
Before I talk about what we're going to do to fix it so we have our game hit run and just type in any

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.500
odd knots so a name is Sam.

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.990
A thing is a pencil.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.510
A feeling is groovy.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.790
Another thing is groovy.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.650
And some things are x box controllers.

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.140
So far so good.

12
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160
But what happens if I type more stuff in here.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.020
We get a crash and why are we crashing.

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.050
Well let's take a look.

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.890
Invalid get indexed 6 on base a race line 21.

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.820
Okay.

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.610
What's happening is right here we are trying to put more player words into the story than there are

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.570
gaps for them.

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.180
And God doesn't like that.

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.980
By the end of this video we're going to change the functionality of it so that when I type things in

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.360
here and I get to the end of the story the text box is going to go away me I can't type anything.

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.240
The button is going to change the word to again and pressing the button will restart the game.

23
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.470
To do this will do a few things first.

24
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.900
Were going to remove the line edit node when telling the story.

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.040
That text box.

26
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.470
I'm not going to let the player type at all.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.820
It's going to take it away.

28
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.350
Secondly that okay button would go change the functionality.

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.920
When the story is done when a story's been told if I press the button again don't try and grab text

30
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.040
just restart the game.

31
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.010
Which means we need to figure out how to restart the game.

32
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.610
So let's get into it.

33
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.800
Here we are back our script may go into a distraction free mode.

34
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.330
OK first thing I need to do is create an end game function like I probably do this in the tell story

35
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.580
but I like to separate these.

36
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.290
I can really see it one looks.

37
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.560
So here is an end game function and before everything else which can be tough to pass it doesn't throw

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.480
an error one on explaining it.

39
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.330
Agreed the function.

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.540
And now let's call the function call at the end of tell story.

41
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.650
The first thing I want to happen is I want to get rid of the text box node which is similar to demoed

42
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.000
this one here right where the player can write.

43
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.140
So first I need to select which not talking about.

44
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.980
So that's going to be do.

45
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.440
There it is text box dot Q underscore free.

46
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.160
What does Q freedom Q free says remove this node from the scene right.

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.070
By the way nice little touch.

48
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.700
In God we don't terminate things we free them run my beautiful text box.

49
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.580
You wonderful line and it noad your free.

50
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.240
Go with you.

51
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.590
Be with your nosy people.

52
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.460
That's what we're doing.

53
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.590
We're saying when you get to this remove this from the box let's just see how that works.

54
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.220
So name.

55
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.760
DUCHESS.

56
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.050
More rovi of cups.

57
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.100
Thing.

58
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.200
IPhone.

59
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.480
16 thousand 15.

60
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.200
I can't type a feeling squidgy.

61
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.140
Another feeling unwell and some things charger's OK.

62
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.150
And look.

63
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.240
The box is gone.

64
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.760
Now this button is still going to crash the game but we're making progress.

65
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.140
Okay so we've got an end state where we're just going to remove that text box the player can only type

66
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.030
if there is something to type.

67
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.400
So what's the next thing we need to do.

68
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.670
Well when this story is done we need to change the functionality so there's a few different ways we

69
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.560
can do this board.

70
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.430
I'd like to do.

71
00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.400
Function is story underscore done brackets and let's write pass in there right now when we talk about

72
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.970
it.

73
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.040
Okay what I want to do is call this function from other functions and see if it's true.

74
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.250
And I could do.

75
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.240
Is true and all the rest of it or I could use return return is a really useful command.

76
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.500
So return past the information that I'm about to state to whatever function just called this one.

77
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.730
So if we're in check play a word length and we check is story done then all I need to do is return it

78
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.230
information.

79
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.500
What information this information.

80
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.740
I'm not going to copy the if I don't need that just return play word size is equal to prompt size.

81
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.690
What is going return is a true or false.

82
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.020
It is throwing an error up because I don't need that colon there.

83
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.640
So this function does exactly one thing it checks if the story is done.

84
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.450
OK it's another I've got that.

85
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.130
I don't have to keep repeating this piece of code.

86
00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.320
I can just copy is story done and put it right and put it right here on the if statement.

87
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.380
So when you're checking a player word length check if it's story done tell story.

88
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.890
Now you can go equal equal true or if you prefer does not equal false.

89
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.120
But there's no need.

90
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.770
The if statement alone will do this right.

91
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.620
I'm calling this.

92
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.080
It's just going to return True or false.

93
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.960
So if you return TRUE tell the story and if you don't prompt the player and look how much more readable

94
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.690
this is right.

95
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.810
This is almost in English.

96
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.420
Check the player word length to do that.

97
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.840
See if the story is done if it is tell the story.

98
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.730
Else prompt the player.

99
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.140
That's the kind of code we want to see something that somebody else can pick up someone else on our

100
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.840
team or myself in 3 years if they ever picked this up again can look at this and understand what's going

101
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.430
on.

102
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.180
So let's make sure the button actually does the thing we needed to do but to go to the button and then

103
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.190
create another IF statement.

104
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.390
What do I need to do.

105
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.630
Well I need to check is story done so just like the other one.

106
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.050
Do a thing if it isn't.

107
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.550
Then take the information as we've been doing before.

108
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.330
So what do I need to do when the story's done.

109
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.370
Well I need to restart the game to restart the game.

110
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.460
All I really need to do in this case is restart the scene because we only have one scene in the game.

111
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.320
OK.

112
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.210
So how do I reload the scene.

113
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.820
We looked at how to manipulate other nodes in the seam tree.

114
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.200
Right.

115
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.160
And we can do that with get node which is what this dollar sign is a short cut for we can not only get

116
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.560
node we can get tree which is going to get the entire scene tree done just get one node get the whole

117
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.330
tree.

118
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.930
This is really useful.

119
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.530
And then what we need to do to reload currency reload currency does exactly what it sounds like.

120
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.250
Take this and reload it.

121
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.530
So let's see if that works.

122
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.780
Can I have a name.

123
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.520
Captain T rex thing a power saw.

124
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.870
I've been playing a lot of Arc recently so I have done stores and I had a feeling rexa licious totally

125
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.230
a word and another feeling confused actually a word webcams.

126
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.590
And when I pressed the button it restarts the game.

127
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.780
Fantastic.

128
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.360
Which brings me to the challenge.

129
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.760
I'd like you to change the button text so that instead of saying okay it says again when the story is

130
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.900
being told.

131
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.950
So that way the player will know by pressing this I can reload the game.

132
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.810
It doesn't have to say again because a restart or play again or once more Omar or whatever you want

133
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.060
to change the button text pause the video give that a go.

134
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.860
When you come back I'll show you my solution.

135
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.640
Okay let's take a look see.

136
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.880
So what I want to do is get this button label and change it again.

137
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.980
We've done this before it's exactly the same as it would be for a text box when we put text in there

138
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.590
or the story tax.

139
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.420
We're just going to find out what's the text called property is text and it's called button label.

140
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.180
I'm going to go into the script.

141
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.980
I'm going to go to tell story.

142
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.820
This is where I want to put it right.

143
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.700
And I'm going to grab it so blackboard story Button Button label.

144
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.640
That's the one I want.

145
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.730
Text equals.

146
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.370
Again and let's give that a shot.

147
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.900
One two three four five hour gap.

148
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.780
Okay good.

149
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.860
It's too big SUMPTION a wrist size that a little bit I can also change the font size.

150
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.010
Let's recite it.

151
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.060
So on to make this a little little bit smaller.

152
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.600
Billy Billy.

153
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.540
Billy am I going to move this over here.

154
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.620
That should be about far enough.

155
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.160
Thinking bigger again.

156
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.090
And now should expand the textbooks one more time.

157
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.590
And there it is.

158
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.940
Perfect.

159
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.230
Which brings us to the end of the video.

160
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.790
We've learned how to remove a node from the scene with Q free which is really handy and we've learned

161
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.040
how to reload the current scene with get tree reload currency.

162
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.810
These are really strong foundational things.

163
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.750
And when you've got hundreds of bullets flying around the screen we need to pick up coins in a platform

164
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.350
game.

165
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.550
Q free is going to be your friend.

166
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.820
So great work and I'll see your next video.
