00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.380
Hello again you're glorious God.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.260
People in this video we're going to do some nouse look which I found tricky because it always reminds

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.270
me about a song about a mouse on the stairs wearing clogs.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.390
But that's not all we're doing we are steering the character or changing where the is looking based

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.740
on how the mouse is moving.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.800
Now full disclosure I originally took the code from the god mouse sic example I've tweaked it a bit

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.350
some extent a more sense for me but this is not my original code.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.060
However it's going to be great for what we're doing if we're doing mouse look.

9
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.290
We should figure out exactly what needs to happen.

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.940
The first is that we need to capture the cursor.

11
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.320
That means we're not going to see the mouse flying around screen.

12
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.910
And here's why.

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.630
Here I am moving my character around and all I could see is the mouse must mouse Mercer mouse cursor.

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.360
Now obviously it's not actually going to be this red laser pointer effect but it's still very distracting.

15
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.870
So when they capture the cursor.

16
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.070
Second thing is we need to actually read the mouse movement.

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.220
This can get a little confusing it certainly confuses me because we need to remember that the mouse

18
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.780
is actually only moving in two axes x and y but the player can move in 3 x y and z.

19
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.440
So although we're measuring two separate axes they're not going to be the same axes for each one.

20
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440
Next we need to rotate the camera on two axes.

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
The x and the Y and not the Z relative to the moused movement.

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.420
Then we need to release the cursor when we leave the game.

23
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.400
OK.

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.820
Well let's start the catcher in the castle unto God.

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.740
Actually before I do that a couple of things.

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.680
One I realized when all of my animations were backwards for this character and the reason is the characters

27
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.640
face in the wrong way.

28
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.140
That is Ford.

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.680
So let's just quickly get my character and rotates on the y axis.

30
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.670
Fantastic.

31
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.190
Now this camera should be behind it but you know what.

32
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.530
I don't actually want the camera to be separate.

33
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.970
I want all player to have a camera as part of them someone put the camera with in the places where I

34
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.540
delete this camera and go into the placing.

35
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.720
Going to add a brand new camera.

36
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.950
Now my snap is on so that's good I want to go that many metres back and rotate by all while on ATC.

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.250
There it is and up by 2 meters maybe this the other box looks pretty solid.

38
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.740
Save that and let's see Eleanor Dixon editable children so I can see the camera and preview that yeah

39
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.010
it's pretty good and I I'm going back into the scene and just reverse those crevasses with it before

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.790
so this is zero.

41
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.190
This is pi.

42
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.320
This is pi times a point five This is pi times one point five.

43
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.600
Let's see how that works.

44
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.060
Left right forward backward.

45
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.420
Much more like it.

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.240
Okay.

47
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.530
Sorry desk.

48
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.320
Just go hide in the desk.

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.940
Come see me.

50
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.640
I'm hiding.

51
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.300
Great.

52
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.930
OK.

53
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.930
Step one with me the camera a script so klippel camera new script is going to be called Cameron dot

54
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.690
Judy.

55
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.150
There it is.

56
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.800
But it's not going to be in the character's folder it's got me in scripts.

57
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:18.020
Also the bit in the scripts camera Judy and it can just be empty.

58
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.720
The very first thing I need to do is hide the mouse.

59
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.740
I'm not going do this on ready.

60
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.010
I'm going to do this on Enter entry so funchal into a tree and a tree is the moment you come into the

61
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.360
scene tree run this function.

62
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.270
Don't worry about ready now.

63
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.690
Ready will happen when all child notes are done.

64
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.390
The reason I'm doing this is we're all going to run an exit tree function and it's going to be a lot

65
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.080
easier way to do it.

66
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.340
Go input.

67
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.450
Dont set mouse mode.

68
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.320
OK so I can set multimode and noun an input dot again and I want mouse mode catch and mouse mode captured.

69
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.820
Means forget what the operating system wanted to do with the mouse do what God wanted to do it's all

70
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.820
going to capture the mouse.

71
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.670
Now important point the mouse cursor is going to vanish and you're not going to able to close the window.

72
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.970
So you should know what the keyboard shortcut is to close this window.

73
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.980
If you want Windows it's ult and F for it from Mac.

74
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.110
I believe it's a command and W and if you're on the next I guess it depends on which distro you're on

75
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.380
but know Linux Mint is OK F4.

76
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.000
If you are not sure what it is you should put in an extra function something like.

77
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.990
If input event is help and make a key like escape.

78
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.200
Run that and release them.

79
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:45.710
It's fairly recent Elseworlds like this function but this is a tree as me exactly like this with a set

80
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.820
of Malapert captured it's going to be multimode visible Let's see if that works.

81
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.080
Ring game and I can't see the mouse.

82
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.360
The Mouse has gone which means I can't close anything.

83
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.870
So let's alter for a modem.

84
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.000
OK so step 1 make the mouse not work done.

85
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.690
Now let's make them work so we have what's happening with the enter and exit tree.

86
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.450
Now we need to know what's happening on inputs somebody use the input function which built in.

87
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.620
Not a capital idea.

88
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.400
Because its not the input method its the input function that returns an argument here.

89
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.980
And all I need to do is say okay I care about Mouse motion and nothing else.

90
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.840
So I have a diff event and I think this is a class that is if its a type of thing and what is it.

91
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.230
I always have to look this one up.

92
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.410
Input event mouse motion.

93
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.630
A mouthful.

94
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.350
OK.

95
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.870
If the event is an input event mounce motion difficult to say then you know what let's just have a brain

96
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.850
function and then pass that into it.

97
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.380
And I don't just want to run it.

98
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.380
I want to return it.

99
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.870
So if it's this then give me the result of that.

100
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.730
If we don't we're going to get all kinds of weird bugs.

101
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.420
If it's a mouse motion return event which means we need a mouse function which has an event in it.

102
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.480
Okay.

103
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.500
Two things we need.

104
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.430
We need to rotate left and right and up and down kurupt to axes.

105
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.130
But when we rotate left and right were actually can rotate the player Well we rotate up and down.

106
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.140
I'm going to rotate the camera not the player.

107
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.740
You don't have to do this but as this is a third person game or a first person game and going to the

108
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.110
reason why if I rotate the player up and down the play is going to tilt backwards weirdly and I don't

109
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.510
really want that to happen.

110
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.250
Player got set rotation

111
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.830
and so set rotation I could call this self-taught set rotation and were put separate action.

112
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.680
I only want the player to set rotation on the left white left right axis so let's make a new function

113
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.660
for that and I want to call it look left right.

114
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.990
Go give me a branding function and I'm going to copy that right now and make a new function so I don't

115
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.190
forget I do sometimes do that.

116
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.500
Look left and right.

117
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:19.190
Let's get a big screen motor because I'm going for now just pass it and then here do a look up down

118
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.830
add new function again.

119
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.110
So you function

120
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.680
and pass what we need is to take this information and figure out a couple of things.

121
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.590
The first thing is to figure out is where were you and where are you now.

122
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.270
Now the good news is input event mouse motion if we look at it actually has.

123
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.530
We can use here relative relative is great mouse position relative to the previous position that position

124
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.620
the last frame that is perfect.

125
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.480
That means we don't have spend time coding.

126
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.030
Here is your last position update your last position next Frank.

127
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:05.040
It does it for us sublimer do is negative event Y negative because of the way that to in three axes

128
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.020
and intersect.

129
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.270
It's annoying but I get it relative so.

130
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.820
Negative red dot relative dot checks the left and right on the x axis.

131
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.800
And this is the X axis of the mouse not the player right.

132
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.000
This is what gets confusing.

133
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.260
I'm setting 3D rotation by looking at 2D changes.

134
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.290
Now I don't just want to get the mouse position because if the mouse moves by three pixels or an inch

135
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.350
or whatever it is I want the player to move by more than that.

136
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:40.990
So one day it was on the Divide it by mouse sensitivity sensitive vixie.

137
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.000
We need to define mouse sensitivity as you can see it's ray on my screen.

138
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.720
It's not a built in function so there's going to be an export variable export variable mass sensitivity

139
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.980
is and this to be of value from trial and error.

140
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.430
I found that twelve hundred works well for me but the whole point is is an export variable we can change

141
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.490
that quite quickly now.

142
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.140
I will take this negative event relative x etc etc etc..

143
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:14.520
And I'm going to copy it and pass it here and instead of the x axis is going to be the y axis y x and

144
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.020
y because these are the axes of the mouse.

145
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.700
Not the player or the camera.

146
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.190
I cannot stress that enough right now.

147
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.580
These will be passed through as an argument so we need something here.

148
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.620
So expect an argument.

149
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.870
I won't call it rot.

150
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.280
I'm not going to call it rotation.

151
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.190
I can call rotation and it'll work just fine.

152
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:38.460
At least that would effect its forestation but rotation is a built in thing in God and if see rotation

153
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.040
up here it's going to confuse me is it getting that value from it.

154
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.760
I know that's a value.

155
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.950
I've given it.

156
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.490
So on the left right this is nice and simple.

157
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.330
I'm going to return about what value won't return.

158
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.160
Well player.

159
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.830
Now one of the do is get the rotational player.

160
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.830
So where are you right now.

161
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.140
Add in this new value which is vector 3.

162
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:07.350
If I'm rotating left and right and in 3D the axis rotating on the y axis I provided the set x to zero

163
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.580
y to rot and Z to zero.

164
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:22.170
One thing I have forgot to do by the way is actually told what the players do that now bar player equals.

165
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.430
In fact they should get on really varshney.

166
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.790
It's just my parents get to parent up.

167
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.540
I could just you get a parent every time the player is easy to read.

168
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.030
Now before I can check if this works or not I need to put the rest in because it is incredibly difficult

169
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:41.220
to move the mouse only on one axis so let's do a set rotation here.

170
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:51.290
This one is going to be so very similar as a return get rotation Plus what is going to use and give

171
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.790
That's a 3.

172
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.640
And here I care about the x axis it's me robt 0 0 0.

173
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.430
However I don't want to see the loop around.

174
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.090
I need to clamp this.

175
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:10.250
So what it would do is instead of return making you very awkward new rotation and set it to this family.

176
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:23.610
Then say new rotation equals another clamp fact that some clamping the rotation which have spelt wrong.

177
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.790
Yeah.

178
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:33.200
Do do do do do some climbing that I want to be to look up by a maximum of 90 and look down by a maximum

179
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.770
of 90 degrees so look straight up electric down.

180
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.370
But not all the way back and I want to start looping around the place if I want to be able to clamp

181
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.600
my minimum maximum value like that.

182
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:49.500
Hi divide a negative two because remember using radians here and it alone is pi divided by two.

183
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.200
And now I can return my new rotation.

184
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.070
Does this work.

185
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.710
And the answer is no.

186
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.340
Cannot convert.

187
00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.860
Arguable.

188
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.290
Ah ha.

189
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.100
I do this all the time.

190
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.870
Okay this is good for a float and really I only want to clamp one value.

191
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.590
That's right there's going to be rotation not x.

192
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.680
And obviously if I'm climbing that I have to climb it too.

193
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.460
Otherwise it goes with.

194
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.040
Let's see how that works.

195
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.570
So I will look left and right.

196
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.090
I look up and look down and move around the place.

197
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:30.720
Now the mouse is currently set to global x y z we are going to fix that later that's a lot more complicated.

198
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.260
But look I have mouse look I can look up look down look left or right and I can see that my feet are

199
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.180
actually a little bit off the ground here aren't they.

200
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:44.040
But I can fix that later do we have basic mouse movement has all lot going on here and it can be a little

201
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.490
daunting.

202
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:50.230
But the key is to remember that the mouse has two axes and the player has three.

203
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.280
And be very clear which one is X Y and Z.

204
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.550
Now if you get stuck.

205
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.830
My suggestion is to go into the inspector and play with them right.

206
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:07.110
So go to the scene and let's say I am going to take the player to rotate it so it's 180 by 30 degrees

207
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.860
on the z axis.

208
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.760
What does that look like that I guess that's my Z axis.

209
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.130
I know I don't want to rotate the play on that axis.

210
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.310
If this was a flight simulator I might.

211
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.780
But let's see what that would look like.

212
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.220
Oh God it's terrible.

213
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:20.650
Okay.

214
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.470
Come back.

215
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.430
I think that's a great start.

216
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.670
In this video we've looked at hiding and showing the mouse cursor and we've implemented basic mouse

217
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.250
click.

218
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.840
So excellent work and I'll see in the next video.
