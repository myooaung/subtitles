1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,310
Hallelujah.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,180
Glory is God's people in this video we look at a function called is on ceiling which is a function of

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,630
kinetic body 2D and is really useful.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,080
It's really useful because we have a little bug in our game.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,560
What happens if you jump and hits the ceiling.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,060
Do you keep going.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,660
Well Bunny does.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,150
Let me show you why I put a new tile in this plan and put tile right here so it's easy to get to press

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,630
play.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,090
I would expect that I could hit a ceiling and bounce off.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,210
But that's not actually what happens right.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,300
My motion continues until the jump wears off.

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,110
Well that's not ideal.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,920
So let's fix it.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,190
And to do that we should just take a quick look at our script.

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,990
I'm at the apply gravity function here which you can get to by clicking the shortcuts all the shortcuts

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,460
and methods you've made.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,260
And let's take a look at how gravity is working.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,110
If we're on the floor sets the vertical motion motion don't y to be zero.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,960
In other words don't go up don't go down.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,310
Otherwise apply gravity.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,600
Okay.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,970
So if we're not on the ground we're applying gravity.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,030
Cool.

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:11,580
However when we jump we're modifying vertical movement by jump speed which is right here.

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,610
I've said it to fifteen hundred.

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,820
So my motion why it immediate set to negative fifteen hundred.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,960
And then every frame is lowered by gravity times delta y times delta.

29
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,220
Moving slide uses Delta.

30
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,270
So in other words I have to wait for my jump speed to wear off.

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,550
That's no good to me I need a way of resetting it.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,050
So what I'm going to do is use is on ceiling which is just like is on floor let's remind itself how

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,560
that works.

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,500
Take a look at the documentation is on floor returns true if the bodies on the floor only updates when

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,180
we're calling move and slide.

36
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,160
Moving on is on ceiling does the exact thing same thing for the ceiling and everything else can be done

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,720
with is on a wall.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,080
Remember however that God only knows about floors and ceilings.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,000
If we tell it God is going to assume this is a top down game unless we tell you otherwise which we've

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,660
done.

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,940
If we look at move and slide the first argument linear velocity How far are you moving and in what direction.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Second argument floor normal.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,020
So we have a floor.

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
The perpendicular from the floor is this direction.

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,360
That is up with defined that right.

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,390
So if we look at our move in slide function first argument is motion.

47
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,360
Second argument is a constant called up which is right here vector to zero comma minus one minus one

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,980
is up in two dimensions and remember negative one and the Y is up.

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,330
Okay so now I need to do is figure out use is on ceiling.

50
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:44,260
So what we do is put an elusive Elif is on a ceiling and what do we want.

51
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,910
Well that's actually my challenge for you.

52
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,750
I'd like you to complete is on ceiling so that Bonnie doesn't hover.

53
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,990
Suppose a video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,300
Welcome back.

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,780
All right.

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,630
So clearly on asset set something with motion Dot.

57
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,070
Why.

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,450
Now I'm not going to go.

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
Plus equals or minus equals.

60
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,110
I'm going to set it to something not modified to something whatever it was before.

61
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,600
It's something else I want to hit the ceiling and bounce off.

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,010
I don't want it to be zero because that's going to let me hover again.

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,930
I want it to be one positive one is down just move down by a pixel.

64
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,410
Because if you move down by pixel you'll no longer on the ceiling.

65
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,050
Well let's see if that works.

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Boing boing boing boing boing.

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,530
Yes that's what I expect to see.

68
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:31,970
Right.

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,630
I expect to see Bunny bouncing off ceilings.

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,420
That's much more like it.

71
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,300
And in fact it's kind of fun when bling bling bling much more like it.

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,870
Bye Bunny.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Before we go any further let's do a quick quality of life change.

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,280
What if I open the game again.

75
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,950
You know I just want to get past here.

76
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,670
Bunnies get me in the set and scream but I want to see further to the right.

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,750
That's actually not that helpful for me.

78
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:04,030
So let's move the camera mean over the placing like so and I'm going to quickly remind you about how

79
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,990
properties work.

80
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,850
So camera 2D here's my transform under the no 2D properties 0 0 0 the x 0 the Y.

81
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,790
In other words you are in the center in the center of what of your parent all these properties inherit

82
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,360
from the parent.

83
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,860
This is not a global position.

84
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,340
Right this is the position from the parent.

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,320
So what I want is to move along the x with zoomed out quite fast.

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,100
I want to move by a thousand and to make this really work I'm gonna switch off my drag margins and make

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,520
sure that I've got smoothing switched on here and here.

88
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,120
So now in a press play and I get away from the edge the camera center is here.

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,350
Bunny is a thousand behind and look at that much more like it now moving backwards is more of an issue.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
I could maybe put a script in there but I don't really want to.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,280
I quite like it like this.

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,850
So quite short and sweet but I think it's enough for this video in this video we've looked at how to

93
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,900
use it on ceiling.

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,760
We've stopped bunny from floating and we've just checked that we're bouncing off things rather than

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
hovering on them.

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,550
It's a great work and I'll see you on the next video.
