Hello again you Gloria's go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,760
We're gonna make the player easier to see.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,780
You see we've got this lovely dark level with this beautiful dark vision mode.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,340
But I can't see myself properly and that's not helping gameplay.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,990
So to highlight the player.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,140
So what do we need to do.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,420
Well first let's think about like 2D nodes.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,600
We know that light two dinos can take a texture.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,820
So we could put the player texture on that is like to denote right so we could just very quickly take

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,780
the sprite where we have an overlay it has a light source and include it will take care of everything

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,890
else.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,620
We then have to change that texture in the sky.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,330
So all we need to do is add a light to denote but the player is a texture and then a little bit of code

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:49,060
to switch between the player textures light and the box sexual light and back nice and simple.

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,100
So let's jump in and get it the first thing we do is open the play a scene Hello play a scene you need

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,180
a light to Dino's troll eight and a..

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:05,410
Light 2D and with texture is going to be characters I know it's not going to be graphics it's gonna

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,550
be PMG Hit Man 1 There you are.

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,350
Boom.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,010
Now we don't have to have it quite that intense so we have an energy of five that should help and let's

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,240
just see how that looks.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,890
So in-game and seem a bit more maybe point five is a bit low.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,170
How about points several five it might go the way up to one but it instinctively feels should be a little

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,240
lower that's a little better isn't it.

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,830
So I can see that.

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,940
What would it look like with one

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,860
to break like I was right then at that point seventy five.

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,180
Great.

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,590
Now let's get into the script and I'm going to add a couple of more constants here.

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,830
So for somebody then a duplicate the play a sprite constant and call this play a light.

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,820
Now I'm not blushing caps now I could just reuse play a Sprite and just call this twice but we might

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,590
come to a point in the game where we want to change what the light source actually looks like.

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,980
I'm going to give myself that option and it's also good way being very very clear what we're actually

34
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,490
calling here let's do the same thing here with box white is not one could box light.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,460
So we have both.

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,370
Now just a quick Control B to duplicate.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
Let's split those up.

38
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,160
Now let's get down to reveal and disguise.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,680
OK so when we revealed our sprite texture is going to be the low the player sprite.

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:32,490
And now I want my light to D dot and this is texture again equals load and we call this player light.

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,300
Great.

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:42,900
And let's do the exact same thing down here disguise so lights to d not texture equals load box lights

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,590
OK.

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,190
Let's take a look.

45
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:52,210
So jumping game wait in line load and what time.

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:01,630
OK I can see myself nice and easily switch to be a box and jump in here I'm still nice and visible and

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,780
that works pretty well.

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,780
So in this video we've just made the player visible which just putting a light to the.

49
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,910
Just on that nice quick easy win adds quite a lot to the gameplay it's gonna make testing a lot easier

50
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,380
and you can see what I'm doing while still keeping the levels nice and dark.

51
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,340
It's a great stuff and I'll see you the next video.
