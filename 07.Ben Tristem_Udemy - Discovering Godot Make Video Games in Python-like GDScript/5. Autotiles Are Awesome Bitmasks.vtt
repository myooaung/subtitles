00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.530
Hello you fantastic go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.310
I'm going to show you why auto tiles are awesome and auto tile is a special kind of tile map.

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.270
You might rember timeouts from hoppy days when we made the level we as a time at Jesus paint the platforms

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.990
in this video on this show you can set up a special kind of tile map so that the tiles automatically

5
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.140
figure out or possibly even alter magically figure out the configuration that should be in automatically

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.160
is not a real word.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.790
But I feel like it should be.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.000
Now there's gonna be multiple parts of video.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
This video is gonna be about setting up a bit mask so that the tiles are set up correctly in a future

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.070
video will look at how to add collision to it and we might even have navigation before we go into any

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.420
further and she had to set these up.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.680
There can be a little fiddly.

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.570
Let's talk about the pros and cons of water tiles because they're not gonna be right for every project.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.320
Pros and cons of auto tiling.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.280
Let's stop the pros.

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.410
First it makes making levels much faster rather than drag in each tile individually and place them and

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.010
rotate them.

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
I could just paint I can tweak levels don't like the doors.

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.030
Move it done and I could set up collision occlusion and navigation in one place.

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.480
Collision.

21
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.310
The thing that stops things moving through each other.

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.010
We understand that occlusion automatic shadows we're gonna be using that a lot in this game navigation

23
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.490
we could put a navigation map directly into the tile map the auto tiles which would allow NPC has to

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.420
walk through stuff we might do that we might not.

25
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.990
I'm hesitating because I also want to put furniture in the game and the furniture is gonna get in the

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.760
way of the navigation but let's see how we go.

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.040
What are the cons called Number One.

28
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.570
Initial setup is fiddly and time consuming.

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.930
Getting these right can take a lot of time.

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.820
Con number 2.

31
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.580
Initial setup is you know what all three cons of the same but there are really good cons so I wanted

32
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.520
to drive it home by repeating it three times.

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.030
We also want to figure out what bit masking is before we get there before I start you know lecturing

34
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.570
for too long.

35
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.130
Let's get together and actually make an altar tile.

36
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.090
First you need to do is define my tiles so I'm going to add a new scene 2D scene and call this tile

37
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.340
sheet.

38
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.240
I'm going to add a sprite.

39
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.180
Now you might remember we did this in hoppy days.

40
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.310
Each sprite was a different platform committee something a little different here and you go into graphics

41
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
tile sheet you'll see what two they're actually identical.

42
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.210
This one is just a high resolution if you want to use it for retina displays.

43
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.770
I don't.

44
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.070
So I'm just going to use this one drag into texture and there is a single texture and I'm going to convert

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.500
it convert to tile set and you might be thinking to yourself yeah.

46
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.590
Why would you do that.

47
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.260
That's a terrible title which I say oh ye of little faith.

48
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.250
If you all say that yourself it's kind of weird.

49
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.250
The new folder I'm going to call this folder tiles and I'm going to save my tiles dot TR s in there.

50
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.020
OK.

51
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.210
We now have a tile a single tile that is a sheet.

52
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.510
Don't worry we can fix that.

53
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.270
Save my tiles sheet as well.

54
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.440
In the same folder so I can tweak it if I need to.

55
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.120
And now I don't need it let's close it and open a new scene as a 2D scene.

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.040
And let's rename the no TDM Nicolas template level.

57
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.440
The idea is we can work on this to make it right and then we can start inheriting from it and extending

58
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.080
it to make level so all levels will inherit from this template.

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.830
It's going to make things very easy.

60
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.220
Every level needs a tile map done and the tile map needs a tile set.

61
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.090
Two ways we can do this.

62
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.390
We can just drag it sucked in my tiles and put it here.

63
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.360
Other way to do it is like it load it like so and do the exact same thing.

64
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.550
Okay so you'll see something a bit like this.

65
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.220
If you've done it right.

66
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.650
If not go back into your tile sheet bought it and it should work.

67
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.560
I know that save template level while I'm at it and go back up a level New Folder levels and you can

68
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.470
call template level.

69
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.090
Great.

70
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.340
OK.

71
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.850
This is clearly not going to work.

72
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.430
I'm a click on a tiles at Yes and this will come up and you know what let's make this bigger and expand

73
00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.910
it.

74
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.280
There we go.

75
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.640
I can retract it again if I need to but that looks good and is going a few things we need to do.

76
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.050
The first thing is I'm going to rename tiles zero tile zero is in court walls and let's click on the

77
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.020
actual tile sheet.

78
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.470
Now I can make a new single tile which will just tell it.

79
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.950
Okay isolate one tile and add it just like we did with Happy Days instead of lots of different sprites

80
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.140
wouldn't have a single sheet and just take a little cutout of it.

81
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.160
The benefit of doing it that way is we don't have to load as many sprites into memories just one giant

82
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.390
asset as opposed to lots of little ones.

83
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.250
An Atlas is a way of setting up lots of individual single tiles in one go.

84
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.670
So I say make these into single tiles and say you have this many single tiles.

85
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.430
Happy birthday and I'll say it's not my birthday.

86
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.970
What I want is a new auto tile because auto tiles are awesome.

87
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.000
You'll notice it says what's your region.

88
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.370
Well let's click on SNAP and that's a problem right.

89
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.600
These squares are 32 by 32.

90
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.270
I don't want 32 by 32.

91
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.990
I want 64 by 64 to fix that.

92
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.020
I'm going to come out of the time map go back into it.

93
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.500
Click it again.

94
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.920
And now when I go to edit it I'll have a snap options right here.

95
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.830
So let's change the 64 by 64.

96
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.580
Great.

97
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.290
And now good to pick which walls I want.

98
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.010
I've got three potential ones I must stick with these orange ones for now.

99
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.670
I can always add the others in later.

100
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.150
OK there's my region.

101
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.630
Nicely done.

102
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.220
I have noticed that this is not an auto style.

103
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.040
So let's remove that and try that again.

104
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.180
New auto styles like my region.

105
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.600
That's my region.

106
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.090
How do I know.

107
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.040
No not at all.

108
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.520
There's no big mosque.

109
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.180
But yeah.

110
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.960
You say what's a bit mask.

111
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.680
You know I'm glad you asked.

112
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.380
A bit mask is the way that God is going to figure out what tiled to do in those two basic forms.

113
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.090
There is a two by two and a three by three.

114
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.960
And so what is going to do is say OK I've got a mask over it in these bits right so each tile has two

115
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.030
by two or three by three bits.

116
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.320
So let's say I want to extend this way I told the Wall is up here.

117
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:14.570
If that's the case I'll have painted a bit mask in the corner and I again here to my two there's less

118
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.600
information there are less possible tiles in a three by three.

119
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.700
There is more information there are more possible tiles she points out that we also have three by three

120
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.730
minimal three by three but mask need all possible combinations including diagonals but the minimal is

121
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.330
dumped.

122
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.280
We're going to be using three by three minimal.

123
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.510
Let's see what that looks like.

124
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.360
I'm impressed bit mask and then under here on the selected tile we've got some options.

125
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.790
And this is the one we want.

126
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.440
If we don't set this none of this will work.

127
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:49.520
So we want three my three minimal important three my three minimal if you do three by three you're going

128
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.700
to get weird results you're not going to like.

129
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.430
So you know.

130
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.190
Let's zoom in a bit on whole control and my mouse button and we've defined our regions.

131
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.890
If I try painting a bit mosque out here on work but if I paint it in here at will.

132
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.760
Right.

133
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.060
And let's just get rid of all these machines.

134
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.560
Press this erase button here and what I want to do.

135
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.340
Is paint like this anywhere.

136
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.450
There's a wall.

137
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.420
I'm not going to use.

138
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.120
So here is a wall there and there.

139
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.290
Each tile is split into a three by three grid.

140
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.330
So that's going to take me a little while and I'm almost certain to miss something and if I miss one

141
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.520
I'm gonna get weird results.

142
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.640
So this is the first part that's going to take a bit of patience.

143
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.570
It's the first time I recorded this course.

144
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.950
I just fast forwarded through this so people could watch me do it.

145
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.890
And as a result people were constantly frustrated that they're making little mistakes and did monies

146
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.400
or to tile.

147
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.050
So I'm just going to do it at the same time as you.

148
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.810
And if I make a mistake.

149
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.210
Great.

150
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.220
We can learn from it together.

151
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.020
La la la la what I'm doing.

152
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.000
Otherwise I'm left clicking to paint him and if I want to remove them just right click.

153
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.290
Nice and simple.

154
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.060
Great UI.

155
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:08.880
So what I want is to make sure that any part of the grid on the tile that has a wall isn't covered.

156
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:19.610
Like so and if I've set this up correctly which I probably haven't

157
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.420
if I've set this up correctly which I think I have but I probably haven't we should go to paint with

158
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.510
it.

159
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:36.010
Let's find out Tom up and I cannot paint my walls and look they're adjusting automatically right.

160
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:42.060
And I can right click to remove a piece of wall make some corridors hello folks Yan from the future.

161
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.940
Just a quick thing I forgot to mention you might be getting these weird little grid things when you're

162
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.370
not paying to the time up he pays the time up.

163
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.540
Don't worry about these floors.

164
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.560
It's a bit of a spoiler.

165
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.850
It's coming later in the video but you're getting these weird little lines in here and you don't want

166
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.030
them.

167
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.100
How can you get rid of the lines.

168
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.890
The answer is actually nothing to do with the tile map.

169
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.990
You've done nothing wrong if you're seeing this.

170
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:08.060
The answer has to do with how God is bringing in the tile sheet you see here of what you got selected.

171
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.600
Guns my graphics guns the tile sheet look at import.

172
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.530
You'll notice by default filter will be on or filter is doing is trying to sort out the edges that are

173
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.320
more real.

174
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.570
But in this case we don't want that when you precise edges not blended images.

175
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.560
So on a UN ticket and press re import and all of those will go away.

176
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.600
OK that's enough in the future.

177
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.680
Back to present day Janusz and greyhounds you'll also notice by the way it's actually very hard to see

178
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.970
the walls the floor.

179
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.180
That's because this grey color that Kenny is using is coincidentally very close to God as default background

180
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.450
color.

181
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.940
Let's fix that project.

182
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:50.640
Project settings and I'm just going to do a quick search for color and under rendering environment default

183
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.240
clear color.

184
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.470
You can be black.

185
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.310
There we go.

186
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.640
And now I can see the walls right now that they're the obvious.

187
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.360
OK so I currently have a pretty simple little level tool.

188
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.960
Let's make this more awesome.

189
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.870
Let's go back into a tile sheet and you know what.

190
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:15.870
Let's add in the new tiles on the click on this again and I'll make a new altar tile boot and from here

191
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.680
I'm going to find some floor sections I like.

192
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.790
We have these four sections up here.

193
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.530
We're using this orange one of you is a slightly different floor we used carpet or grass.

194
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.190
I'm going to use these floors here.

195
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.350
So let's make our region just still be set up correctly.

196
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.160
And the bit mask.

197
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.550
Now this time there's only going to be one possibility.

198
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.630
One two three muses horizontal floors.

199
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.410
And that looks good.

200
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:44.290
So let's tile is going to be called floor one and give it a name cool floor.

201
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.610
We can do some other stuff with it right.

202
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.170
Right now it's got an icon that we can set.

203
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.450
So it's set that icon.

204
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.020
We also as a priority if I click on one of them you have a one in three chance and see if two and three

205
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.120
a two and four chance of being that style a one in four chance of being this one and a one in four chance

206
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.490
of being that one.

207
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.070
OK so why is that awesome.

208
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.040
It's going to Tom map and I have some flaws and now I can paint flaws into the level

209
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.270
and if I want to I can overwrite floors with walls only one of these tiles can be in this position that

210
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.090
same time.

211
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:23.060
But look we have a nice simple way of making that awesome don't like this icon for the walls and the

212
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.910
tweak that let's go into the tile sheet again and we to edit it.

213
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.410
So let's get the right one.

214
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.590
We are on floors left arrow.

215
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.690
We are on walls.

216
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.470
Cook your icon is going to be this one that's your icon.

217
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.570
Let's take a look.

218
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.040
I've got floor 1 and walls.

219
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040
I can also make a floor too.

220
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.950
Let's make a full too real quick just for the practice.

221
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:54.030
So New Order tile and it's in the same regions before excuse me maybe Bobby big D did I ever see it.

222
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.440
There it is.

223
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.890
And this time it's going to be these vertical floors.

224
00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.700
So let's do that mask.

225
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:08.630
One two three and icon is this one that priority is going to be you have a two and four chance you have

226
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:15.590
one of four you have a one in full when you floors two or floor two.

227
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.840
All right.

228
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.580
And now we have a nice way of putting in different rooms right.

229
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.210
So that could be a little comedy bit and we could put walls around it.

230
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.510
Look how cool this is.

231
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:26.720
Right.

232
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.590
I can really quickly paint walls and I can just draw them out like this.

233
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.590
There's all kinds of fun stuff you can do.

234
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.640
Could even do bucket fill what's bucket fill.

235
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.320
I'll show you make a nice little region like this.

236
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.720
And a messy bucket fill boop boop.

237
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.670
And then back to Phil nice big room.

238
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.220
Which brings me the change this video.

239
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.000
I'd like you to practice alter tanning by making a small test area so make a few rooms and some chorus

240
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.420
link them or whatever you wanna make.

241
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.080
Pause the video give that a shot and when you come back I'll send this video out.

242
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.650
I'm back.

243
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.240
So through the magic of editing I've gotten rid of this but we can do all kinds of wonderful stuff here.

244
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.070
How high

245
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.380
P..

246
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.300
Pull.

247
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.380
And that's my level right.

248
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.290
That's not my level.

249
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.080
That's a terrible level.

250
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.160
I'm to do all of these.

251
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.060
La la la la la.

252
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.600
But we can make some really awesome stuff.

253
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.880
What you could do for extra credit is add in different walls and floors right.

254
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:38.120
So if I take a look at our top map we have all these different assets we could use so maybe part of

255
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.010
your level is these nice orange walls.

256
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.420
These wooden walls these concrete walls.

257
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.290
We also have concrete flooring we could use carpets we could be using.

258
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.780
You can make outdoor areas there's all kinds of amazing stuff you could do here.

259
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:58.140
I think these are even flower beds that combat edges yet these carpet edges either way all kinds of

260
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.770
fun things make parking lots and really randomize it.

261
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:01.980
Right.

262
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:09.810
So when I'm adding these floors and you'll notice because we set up the random chance it's deciding

263
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:10.920
when to use these varied.

264
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:17.220
So I don't have to looks a lot more random and that I feel is a great place to end the video.

265
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.660
In this video we've looked at how to convert a tarmac to an altered tile and looked at when to use two

266
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.200
by two three by three or three by three minimal bit masks.

267
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.940
There's still more to come but hopefully I can see the awesome power of older tiles.

268
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.650
Meanwhile excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
