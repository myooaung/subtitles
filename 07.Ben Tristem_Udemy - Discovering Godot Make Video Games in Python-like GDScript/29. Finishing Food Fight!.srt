00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,030
Hello lovely God people on welcome to finishing food fight which is a big deal because it's our last

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,640
project of the course.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,630
We've done quite in advance stuff so far in this video.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,810
We're going to create a start screen with an exclamation point because I'm excited.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,520
We're going to put music in with another explicit exclamation point which is now getting hard to say.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,950
And we can add more level details and then we're going to celebrate.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,900
Let's get right to it.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,440
I want a scene that we start with.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,810
We did heist mice as we put that splash screen in.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,620
Same deal.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:43,060
So put in a new screen and going to use the same viewport idea the viewport container we did with the

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,300
other screens the game over in the victory screen.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,840
So let's start with a simple control note.

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,790
And I'm gonna call this splash screen.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,570
It feels like gardening.

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,920
Technically is not a splash screen into a screen.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,030
A splash green is the screen that comes up before you do anything so interesting.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,160
And I want to make that fall rectangle.

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,850
That's give them ankit Full rectangles as well.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,440
And this is going to need a background so let's give the contract.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,850
And again that's going to be full rectangle but it's going to be black.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,820
I'm going to make this one pure black.

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,430
You're black.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,440
I do wop you're black.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,790
I can change it later.

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,050
Dont over think it.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,550
It's fine.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,750
I want everything here in the centre so let's go with a scented container.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,060
Done a few times now so it's getting a little bit easier right.

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,310
Nice full screen.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,110
And within that I want food fight round up here and then a subtitle the viewport and a couple of buttons.

32
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,260
So let's do that.

33
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,920
Let's start with the V box container.

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,930
And within that I mean put a label at this point I don't remember what I should have in the beginning.

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,690
Putting a theme in.

36
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's load the theme back up to the top theme load theme.

37
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,130
Put it in scenes default thing.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,290
Fantastic.

39
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,370
Let's call this food fight.

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,570
Awesome.

41
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,080
Nother label.

42
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,130
And this was for the music.

43
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,000
Now if you might remember that the music was a Creative Commons attribution licence only to people who

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
it's by.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,300
So let's go look at who music's by just in case you've forgotten music by metter regarding the copy

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,990
that again.

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,130
And I haven't included all the tracks.

48
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,880
If you want to I can link to this page again so it'll be up here in the available which you call them

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,840
the downloadable resources the available resources and go through this reading nice soundtrack.

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,760
And I'm going to put music by and place that.

51
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,850
All right so these two I think want to be aligned to the centre and I'm going to change the font sizes

52
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,420
here.

53
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,980
So label too.

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,850
Let's give it your start label one.

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,340
Custom fonts.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,440
Going to make a new dynamic font.

57
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,460
Click on that.

58
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,720
Good a font and load in.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Go back up a level fonts.

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,590
Kenny bold and let's make you 14.

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,160
ISOM big oh that's very dramatic isn't it.

62
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,420
And then too.

63
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,480
You know I go down a little bit with this one.

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,230
Maybe I think this is a 20 can't remember.

65
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,990
Let's take a look.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,370
So down to custom fonts load in a new dynamic font.

67
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,690
And just do the exact same thing.

68
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,240
So front load can have old settings 20.

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,380
That's what it was before isn't it 15.

70
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,650
Maybe you know what I'm trying to tweak this before I see the full thing but that's a good start.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,350
Next I want a viewport container.

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
So let's put in a viewport container.

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,330
That's me a child of the box container.

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,240
And I would put something in here so it's got to have a viewport and the viewport it's going to have

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,030
to have some sort of camera which will be active.

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,400
The someone to make this current and learn from my mistakes.

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Right now this has no size to it.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,890
I will fix that in a moment or put in a couple more buttons.

79
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,350
It's up to viewport container and put in a grid container.

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,200
Basically I'm remaking what I did with the other seats.

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,820
I could have copy and paste but I didn't want to mix a little differently.

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,940
And within that let's change the columns have two columns labelled button label button.

83
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,460
Now start with the label.

84
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:22,100
And then our play and then a button.

85
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:33,460
And let's give that a minimum size so wrecked minimum size 30 by 30 k grid container.

86
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,490
I think everything should be in the centre here shouldn't it.

87
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,060
So you know what.

88
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,250
We are back to the view full container of goodness sent to contain and put the grid container within

89
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,160
that March more like a grid container you get another label.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,740
And you should quit.

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
And then another button.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,130
And that's looking good.

93
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,360
OK.

94
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,890
I'm not a bully Texan these buttons but that's looking pretty solid.

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,540
Now the viewport container needs to be bigger.

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
You know I'm going to go look at the size that I put the other one on the keep this reasonably consistent.

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,370
So let's go over to scenes.

98
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,700
Gooey game over and cut up my game over screen.

99
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:30,340
The open container has a size of three hundred by 300 of so put container to give you a size of 300

100
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,820
by 300.

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,160
Now I come out of that scene and go back in it's reduced itself.

102
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,560
I should have put a mint size 300 by 300.

103
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,160
There we go.

104
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,240
Much more like it.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:41,960
All right.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,890
Viewport.

107
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,760
You are going to have a transparent background.

108
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,240
That's important.

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Before I go any further I'm a save this scene scenes Gooly and I put it right here.

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,260
Know new folder intro's screen and put it right in there.

111
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,650
And that has now saved.

112
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,110
Awesome result doing that.

113
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,280
Now is I mean let's change what my default scene is going to start with this.

114
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,940
Let's get project settings run.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,350
And I will go find that cilice that file scenes gooey intro scene into a screen.

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,530
Done.

117
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,430
Awesome.

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,910
So this is now where we'll start for best play.

119
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,720
This is our game now.

120
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,330
Boom boom boom.

121
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,400
These buttons aren't connected.

122
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,250
They don't do anything.

123
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,910
Let's give it some functionality.

124
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,500
Let's put a script on interest screen and that can live in the Scripps folder.

125
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,660
It's going to be called interest greenlight Judy and it's done.

126
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,670
And once that's done I can stuck in its these buttons rename these buttons so it's a little easier to

127
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:51,120
see a script play button and quit button and let's connect them a signal so node pressed connect can

128
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,470
connect it to the interest screen.

129
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,360
There it is.

130
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,480
And quits the same thing.

131
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,240
So select pressed connect connect to the into a screen and connect.

132
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,540
Awesome.

133
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,720
Quit is probably easier so get tree don't quit.

134
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,730
And on play button I want get tree dot change scene.

135
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,110
And I think we should probably get a customization when you think.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,650
I think customization is a good place to go.

137
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,320
Now if you wanted you could put another button in right so you could go straight into that where you

138
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,030
get to it you go straight into the game or you can customize or you can quit.

139
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,230
So that's absolutely doable.

140
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,300
Just had to put actual buttons in.

141
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,510
But for now I'm gonna go straight into customization.

142
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,220
So.

143
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,470
Well as in scripts that's what it was chase scene.

144
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,450
And I want customization.

145
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,670
Character customization.

146
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,490
TLC an awesome that there.

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,830
Let's see if my game runs.

148
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,540
That's how we do a press quit.

149
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,600
Quit works fine.

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,840
Secondly thing I do get to go in here and press play.

151
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,660
Play works great.

152
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,640
Let's pick Frey.

153
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,140
I've still got a print going on for debugging.

154
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,220
Awesome.

155
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,330
There he is.

156
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,870
Fantastic.

157
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,650
I should really get rid of that friction.

158
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,700
Let's do that.

159
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,600
Really quickly there's going to be an customization So in my script folder a customer character customization

160
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,340
had a look for print.

161
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,970
Where does it put you where you are.

162
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,560
There was a debugging between videos.

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,490
I apologize for that and clear that and pretend we never saw it it didn't happen.

164
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,000
You can't prove a thing.

165
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,090
Fantastic.

166
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,710
Okay now put something in here.

167
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,120
And at this point I'd like to challenge you now.

168
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,920
Draw on any of the things we've learned throughout the course and cast your mind back.

169
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,260
We've covered quite a lot from the early days of Luni lips through Hoppy days through heiss meisters

170
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,000
through kudu kick about into food fight.

171
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,560
Make this as fancy or as simple as you like.

172
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,780
So what I'd like you to do is make your start screen.

173
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,600
Customize it.

174
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,700
You want that view pull container.

175
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,890
Do you change the colours.

176
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,960
Is the button theme.

177
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,000
Remember to go to start game and equip button.

178
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,640
If you want you could put in other stuff as well maybe a character customization maybe a level selected

179
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,720
you get more than one level but really go to town this make it your game.

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,870
Suppose the video customize your screen and when you're ready come back and our customize my.

181
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,800
And welcome back.

182
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,840
Okay I want a screen full of food flying towards the user.

183
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,790
Some days I won't go into my viewport.

184
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm going to create a particle node so particle as they are.

185
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,760
And I got an error message was this error.

186
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,050
You need to put something in.

187
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,720
OK so what I'm thinking is one for each type of food.

188
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,280
While food is in scenes ammo models there it is.

189
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,170
So all of these sunlike one particle for each one of these.

190
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,490
So as you can see from this error message it's saying that we need a drop pass.

191
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,700
Start with a draw pass and then put my mention here.

192
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,690
Start with the burger boom there's a burger and then move it to snap on it.

193
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,350
One two three four five three maybe.

194
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,240
Take a look at that until it starts running it's going to be hard to see.

195
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,260
Start with a new particle material and now it's doing stuff.

196
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,860
Awesome.

197
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,480
These were some lights in here that I so in my view portlaoise Put in a couple of lights I'm thinking

198
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:25,360
and onlly light as a nice nice and right and let's put you over to the side and with a brightness and

199
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,510
energy of 4.

200
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,920
Wait you break three and you know what.

201
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,570
Let's make you orange feeling this orange and teal and we make a new light.

202
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,650
And this one is going to live over here and it's going to be teale.

203
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,420
So with an energy of four.

204
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,170
And let's bring you over that way a little more.

205
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,350
I may be slightly behind the particles.

206
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,970
Okay come.

207
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,050
How does that look.

208
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,300
Dramatic but maybe not quite yet.

209
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,790
Now I want to fiddle with these parameters.

210
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:09,650
I didn't go back to my particles and I'm going to first change how many see I was it 24.

211
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,320
Lots of them but I want them lasting quite a while so let's have them lasting for two seconds.

212
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,370
I think that's a decent start like a so everything else I need to do is going to be in this part or

213
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,190
material so I'm going to get a process matures.

214
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,380
Hit particle material and the most important things in the under gravity.

215
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,950
So right now I see Gravity is at minus nine point eight.

216
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,210
I wasn't going up.

217
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,440
Now what do I like this little lot.

218
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,200
Is it going to take this deep.

219
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,390
Ha ha gay wrong rotation.

220
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,060
So let's go back to the previous thing I should have done this time been.

221
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,210
But I was too excited on the x axis.

222
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,330
I'm rotating you by 90 degrees.

223
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,820
OK.

224
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,580
See how that looks in camera.

225
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,820
Cane not bad now now I think maybe put these a little bit smaller something back it was making me a

226
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,100
little bit noshes that's come in a preview.

227
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,970
Let's go back in to my.

228
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,800
Where do you go.

229
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,690
It's gone back in my part of course and scroll down to particle material.

230
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,700
And let's go for the top emission shape.

231
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,140
Point No no no no sphere airway go a sphere radius of one shot one up.

232
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,900
Now a line I want to align on the Y and rotate on the Y and that's going make them feel like they're

233
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,520
tumbling.

234
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm going to play with these and spread the spread.

235
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,880
Forty five yeah.

236
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,810
Feels good.

237
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,570
One thing I might do though is slow these down shrink these down so how's are point to five feet.

238
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,500
Way too small.

239
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,500
Had zero point five feel.

240
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,990
Not bad OK.

241
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,000
And now let's just lift you up.

242
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,360
Move you that way.

243
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,870
OK.

244
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,450
Somebody call this burgers.

245
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,770
And you know what I'm actually going to make a subfolder for.

246
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,020
So that's make a note and call this particle.

247
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,770
And now I'm going to bring particles in to your bergholz antiparticles.

248
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:06,470
I'm going to duplicate it and call this one cookies and change the metaphor cookie.

249
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
So I go over here and change that mash.

250
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,610
We've changed that match.

251
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,720
Now this mash is a little bit big but that's okay.

252
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,230
And I'm just going to fast forward while I duplicate these.

253
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,170
OK.

254
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,590
We have everything in and you know what.

255
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,820
That's actually way too much stuff.

256
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,810
One hand is my grab all of these and move them further back.

257
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,910
Such as drag you out this way and see how that looks in camera.

258
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,770
Preview that.

259
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,040
That's kind of dramatic and scary is that that's your the looks like a TV.

260
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,110
Are you active.

261
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,160
You should be.

262
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm not going to run again.

263
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,170
Don't see it when I see it because my view ports the wrong size of course is 300 by 300 straight out.

264
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,960
We've got lots of food.

265
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,300
It's actually too much food isn't it.

266
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,380
So let's go into any one of these particles and select all of them.

267
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,200
And I'm a switch for 24 to 12.

268
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,490
I'm a cat's going to sneeze in the background.

269
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,020
Less you caboodle.

270
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,770
She's going wild and running up and down the stairs by cat.

271
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,760
Awesome.

272
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,890
She's pretty excited by this interest group because let's face it that is pretty good.

273
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not sure why it's not showing here but that's fine.

274
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,690
Did she make this camera work.

275
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,990
I did.

276
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,640
You are current.

277
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,280
Fine.

278
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,660
Just be like that.

279
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:23,890
All right.

280
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,560
One more thing on it do I mean add some music to each of these songs.

281
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,070
So in every single scene I would put a music player let's put an audio stream player that's not 2D or

282
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,450
three auto play it and find some music so let's go get some music.

283
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,010
I put you on the sound effects didn't I.

284
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,630
I've got a handful of these over here.

285
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,540
I would actually have start with interlude got an auto plate.

286
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,520
Has that sound.

287
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,840
A little bit loud luscious.

288
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,900
Not bad.

289
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,070
I actually need to tell my speakers down.

290
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,040
OK.

291
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,270
Let's save that.

292
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,460
Let's go into the next scene.

293
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,660
So I'm going to go through these.

294
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,370
Now what I could do is have an audio string player as a singleton and then change it playing what seem

295
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:03,900
we're in.

296
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,100
But I'm feeling it this way it's having to do it this way.

297
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,410
I'll just go in to customization customization.

298
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,170
Seeing is also going to have a music class audio stream player.

299
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,250
You could just press enter could I.

300
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,930
And let's go to SFX which is back here.

301
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,610
And I think this was going to have intro like this one.

302
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,990
It sounds like this.

303
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,200
Yes very dramatic.

304
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,810
And again little out.

305
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,220
OK.

306
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,100
Now we've got game over.

307
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,210
We've got victory.

308
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,830
Let's start with the actual level segunda Scenes into levels.

309
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,100
Doo doo doo doo doo.

310
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,120
I mean put this in template.

311
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,620
All levels will have the same music.

312
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,670
If you don't like that you don't have to have it that's fine.

313
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,240
That's the wrong audio stream.

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
I wasn't paying attention.

315
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,850
Try that again audio stream player minus 10 seems to be what we're going with this.

316
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,880
By the way quick tips that I should have done earlier.

317
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,130
I'm going to sound effects.

318
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,790
And I'm going to add it to my favourites.

319
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,820
And now we're going to favourites.

320
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,680
It's right there.

321
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,870
A lot easier right.

322
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,040
OK.

323
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,960
Levels are going to have final battle.

324
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,110
Yes.

325
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,120
Get close.

326
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,270
That's close.

327
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,360
Make sure it's also play for that one.

328
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,720
And now I've got this one OK.

329
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,950
We got game over open so let's add in all your string player.

330
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,030
It's going to be game over right.

331
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:29,620
Let's put you at minus 10 and you're going to sound like this.

332
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,750
Very nice.

333
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,000
One more we need I need a victory scream.

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,550
Where are you.

335
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,200
So on to scenes.

336
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,050
Gooly interest screen victory screening.

337
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,810
An all your player.

338
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,170
You Stream player.

339
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,740
I am back to my favourites.

340
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,970
TAR should have been used that this entire time.

341
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,500
Should I give his game over again.

342
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,550
Pitcher minus 10.

343
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,510
OK.

344
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,850
We now have a game.

345
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,930
Let's see how that runs.

346
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,180
Nice comeback customization.

347
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,080
Losing Game 1 2.

348
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,790
3.

349
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,860
I surrender.

350
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,890
Really good stuff.

351
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,560
I get some more things I wanna do on the interest green and of playing quit.

352
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,340
It's really when I want it to say it it's less customizes a bit more.

353
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,230
Let's fight with food.

354
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,760
And on this one.

355
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,900
I have reconsidered.

356
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,570
Get Me Out Of Here.

357
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,390
Wait too long.

358
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,290
Was it put Get Me Out Of Here.

359
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,800
And you know what I want to align the text of the right sort of a grid container a great container of

360
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,130
my label a line up right there.

361
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,650
Awesome Now you Centre.

362
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,760
You should be centred not centred way not centred.

363
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,210
I'm going to put my grid container sentiment there and I'm gonna put the viewport as a centre to that

364
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,950
sort of container.

365
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,860
You will do a full rectangle when I leave and come back.

366
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,140
You should be much better.

367
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,580
OK fine.

368
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,910
Finally level 1 has some gaps in it so I'm going to fix those gaps really quickly.

369
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,270
I opened my waltzing and she'll copy some of these and fast forward while I do.

370
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,190
So here we go.

371
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
And there it is.

372
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,720
Moved the spawn is back I deleted the pieces we are using.

373
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,610
I just put those walls in and that's a level that looks like a real game.

374
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,060
One more thing I'm going to do is I'm handling this table.

375
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,190
This has been bugging me for a few videos now.

376
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,120
Someone to take this table this chair and just drag them over to this wall was just making a bit more

377
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,080
of an open space.

378
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
And you know what you guys.

379
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,380
You provide way too much cover.

380
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,860
So let's just take you like so.

381
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,770
Moving out of the way the door.

382
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,480
And you.

383
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,290
This area.

384
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm going back here a bit ago.

385
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,080
We think of that.

386
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,690
I think that looks pretty pretty shiny.

387
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,080
I think this is cause for celebration.

388
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,170
And that brings us to the end of this video in this video we're finished.

389
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,750
Food fight with design the perfect arena to fight rebels with food.

390
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,900
And there's a lot you could do with he you could add more levels you can make progressively harder you

391
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,310
could add different enemy types.

392
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,680
Maybe change the colour of the robot some move in one way some of another.

393
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,560
Maybe they fired from amounts of food you could add more player types more customization you could add

394
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,580
a story you could put in an option menu and lots of different sound tracks are some which you could

395
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,360
do from here.

396
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,450
Either way please share what you've got.

397
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,470
Because I think at this stage you've got the skills to make something really incredible.

398
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,790
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
