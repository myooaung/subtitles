00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,550
Hello again you delightful go to people in this video.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,580
We to start work on locked doors now are locked doors won't open by the end of this what going to do

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,640
is when a make a basic locked door and have the number pad pop up when you need it and close when we

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,190
leave it which I didn't mean to rhyme but it kind of did.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,650
So this is the first part of locked doors and to do this we're going to learn about extending scripts.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,390
We can extend the door script.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,910
We already have four locked doors script.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,520
We should talk a little bit about extending and inheriting.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,980
We've already looked at inheriting scenes which is when we make a simple let's say NPC script and then

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,230
the gods will inherit from that scene.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,610
We can add things to it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,600
It's one thing to note when we talk about scripts and scenes we extend scripts.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,320
We inherit scenes they broadly work the same way.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,530
It's interesting to note that scripting is just extending the functionality of a note.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,770
So if I make a Sprite and then I put a script on it it's going to extend that sprite no so anything

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,120
I add to it is sprite.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,710
Plus these new bits nodes extend functions from parent nodes.

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,600
So for example a let's say can somatic body 2D extends from physics body 2D which extends from something

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,930
else something else all the way up to basic node.

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,060
So it'll have access to all the functionality of physics body 2D which will have all functionality of

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,290
the next node up and so on.

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,510
So let's go into Gaza and I'm gonna make brain you see it do that.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,910
I'm going to open the original door scenes which I click here on Dorsey.

24
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,740
Here's my original dosing and I'm going to I want to make a new scene based on this.

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,420
I actually don't need to be in the scene I just wanted to show you the difference.

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,340
So going to a scene I'm going to a new inherited scene.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:46,760
Okay.

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,580
New inherited scene.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,990
We've already done this so it shouldn't be too difficult.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,680
I extend from someone to open the bass scene door and before I go any further I'm going to rename it

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,990
so I don't get confused on call this locked door.

32
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,690
You'll notice everything here is gray.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,980
This is what is in the original.

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,010
That hasn't changed.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,970
Let's say that in the doors folder and we've a brand new inherited scene cool.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,890
First thing let's give a different sprite.

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:21,420
So the texture for this is can be a little different on the graphics on the PMG under tiles is.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,790
Here it is this one right here tile for six three looks.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,960
Can I steel door that looks like a locked door to me.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,350
I think supposed to be a light I'm using as a locked door.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,690
I'm fine with that.

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:30,940
Okay.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,430
Now we want the pop up to be a child of locked doors so the pop up can come up.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,820
So using at child or I could use control.

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,390
A I'm gonna find my number pad right here.

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,070
I just type in num pad and there it is.

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,610
You'll notice right now it's below the door.

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,450
That's gonna be in a little bit of an issue for us when we put this into the scene.

49
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,320
You're gonna see this behind bits of scenery and that's no use.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,310
So what we did was save this and go back to level 1.

51
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,870
Now I want to add this to the template.

52
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,680
Remember level 1 is inheriting from the template scene.

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,100
So let's go back into the template and add a brand new category for locked doors.

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:14,860
So control a this time new node and when to rename that to locked doors.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,690
Great save that.

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,040
And here we are on level 1.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,330
Now on the locked doors I can bring in an instance of locked door.

58
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,220
And here is my sense of locked door and you can already see the number pad which currently is showing

59
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,180
it won't show when the game starts but it's currently showing and I can move this into position lets

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:42,460
you not only get rid of which door is that door three times and delete that for now delete note.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yes I'm sure of a locked door there and I'm going to rotate this by 90 so transform rotates 90 degrees

62
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,920
and look already you can see this is an issue.

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,020
So how do we fix this.

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,510
Let's save this.

65
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,270
I don't need template level when I close that locked door.

66
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,200
Control a and I want a canvas layer.

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,970
Interesting to note canvas layer is a direct child of node.

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,040
Node doesn't have positional information it doesn't have a transform It's a canvas layer doesn't either.

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,490
Another could see this is does not have a child no pet is if I right click on it and open the documentation

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,090
you can see right here inherits node so it has access to everything node can do but nothing else no

71
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,480
pad has access to a bunch of other things so if I look up in that documentation it inherits control

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:43,470
canvas item node control click here does have access to this information so I'm sure to close that window

73
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,210
we don't need it I don't need to pop up I don't need canvas layer let's just stick to the information

74
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,730
all of this is a way of saying if I put the number as a child of canvas layer it's now inheriting the

75
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,920
property for canvas land and canvas layer doesn't have the translation that we'd have from other things.

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,500
Right so we got to transform for x and y we have position information doesn't exist here.

77
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,510
That's important because it means that this is now going to be centred on the camera on the screen not

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,400
on the object.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,650
So I save that and go back to level 1.

80
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,580
There's a number of had is now here on the item so far so good but it doesn't do anything.

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,020
Now it's time to extend a script.

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,220
So back to look all I'm going to delete this script which can use this delete script button.

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,640
Easiest way of doing it and now locked doors don't have a script.

84
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,160
Doors do locked doors don't.

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,050
Not quite what I want this given new script I'm right here it says inherits area 2D.

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,900
So right now.

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,420
Doors extend the functionality of area 2D.

88
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,240
But if I click on this I can pick a scene like a script not a scene pick dodgy deals and now it inherits

89
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,350
resources.

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,020
Doors door G.D. I want to create it you can see that here in the extends that's what this line is telling

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,560
you.

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:03,610
So if I go to door this extends area to the area 2D plus these functions locked door is this plus whatever

93
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,510
we write in here.

94
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,900
So let's see how that's going to work.

95
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,440
What I would do is want to get a door and I'm going to take the.

96
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,810
When we click on it when we click on it's like it's going to happen.

97
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,480
Locked doors don't just open we have to put a combination in.

98
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,840
So I'm going to copy these three lines back to locked doors and put this function in.

99
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:29,240
This function will now overwrite the one in door so in locked doors until input does something different.

100
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,220
Was that something different.

101
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,120
Well we're gonna pop up the the number pad so I'm going to get the number pad types up typing number

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,440
pad.

103
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:43,510
There it is and it's a pop up so I can just use a pop up sent it will come back pop up there you're

104
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,630
sent it is a sense of that a screen.

105
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,890
OK so now let's see how that looks.

106
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,600
Here I am a level that it just gives us my screen like there's my locked doors in a locked door Now

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,160
the guards have to get through that nice and easy.

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,850
Perfect.

109
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,420
But when I try and get through this click on it and that's my number pad and look how that works.

110
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,730
Pressing locks it's not wired in right now so I'll do anything.

111
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,940
We've also got a bit of an issue.

112
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,540
If I click away from it it'll close but if I walk around it'll stay where it is.

113
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's make that a little bit easier.

114
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,520
Let's give me my challenge to you.

115
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,140
I would like you to get rid of a number pad when the player leaves the door area.

116
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,880
So we already have that detection area when the player leaves that detection area have the pop up varnish.

117
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,490
Use the hide function to make this easier is not the only way of doing this but it's the simplest avoid

118
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,360
using q free.

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,920
You don't want to vanish from the scene we do want to come back.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
So pulls the video give it a shot.

121
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,840
And when you come back I'll show you my solution

122
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,050
and welcome back.

123
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,330
OK so we've already got here this functionality.

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,080
So what I want to do is go back to doors and I want find a door exited and I copy that back to a locked

125
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,120
door and put this in here.

126
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,770
So this is saying on door body exited ignore whatever is here and do this instead.

127
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,210
Well we do want to do this right.

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,890
If body collision late equals one.

129
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,970
In other words if you're the player then we want to go to you can click.

130
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,730
We also want to hide the number pad.

131
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,310
And that's very simple we just go.

132
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,590
Number pad is there.

133
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,020
Not hide.

134
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:24,940
Okay.

135
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,350
Let's see how that works.

136
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,150
Get it again and make it nice and bright sexy we're doing get to the door.

137
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,000
We don't have any penalty being spotters on a care about that.

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,480
Let the guard go through first doesn't confuse things to make up your mind.

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,780
Thank you.

140
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,690
OK.

141
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,550
Excuse me.

142
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,710
This is my door.

143
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,430
Go away.

144
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,110
OK.

145
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,580
Click on it.

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,670
It's right there.

147
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,660
Move away.

148
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,520
It goes away.

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,720
So right there we now have a number pad ready to be wired into a lock.

150
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,130
Right now just a pretty UI element that doesn't do anything but it will.
