1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,220
Hello again you phenomenal go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,530
Let's add some guards.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,590
Make a brand new NPC and play with inheritance.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,250
So before we do that let's talk about what's going to happen with these gods.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,550
I'm going to instance a character.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,140
So we've got the character seem willing to make a new instance of that.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,750
We're going to extend the play detections script we finished on the camera going to change the sprite

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,860
and add a torch.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,090
So it's pretty simple.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,350
Before we go into that though we have currently been building this template level.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,980
But this is not a template if this is the template level every level starts like this.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,130
So what I'm to do is I'm going to delete the cameras from here because otherwise they can never be moved

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:49,280
and leave this note here for cameras while we're at it let's add in a new node which is a simple node

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,930
there it is.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,240
And I'm gonna call this gods.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:01,310
So every level must have a tile map a player a camera 2D canvas modulate the thing changes how dark

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,100
the level is.

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,890
And a place to put cameras in gods.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,750
We can instance them in separately.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,420
We can also start removing all of it.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,620
So let's move the plaque.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,050
Yeah we're going to the player W to get into move mode.

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,120
We could just press this button here and drag the player into this top left corner and now he'll take

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,060
my Tom up and make a little box of the player.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:33,560
Pick the right one your wall and I'm going to select with Control B do a nice big marquee selection

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,810
get the Tom up and erase the selection.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,920
I will do the same thing here.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,520
So go to select and erase.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,800
So if you want to know how to do fills in the races that's how you do it.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,100
You can also do fills that back to paint tile but that's not good.

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,960
So say that.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,760
Now I want to make a new scene that inheritance when you've seen new inherited scene and I'm inheriting

33
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,430
from the template right open based seat.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,530
So I don't have to type it in using to open that and here's my new one.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,320
I know it's the new one because as unsafe.

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,900
So let's save that safe scene as it's in levels and I'll call this level 1.

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,950
Now you'll see everything is great out right.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,900
These are the things that I cannot change but I can go to the tile map and start making changes like

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,140
this.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,810
So we have lots of new things.

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,540
So very quickly I want to make a very simple little level I will put a couple of rooms in this can all

42
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,270
be tweaked later.

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,910
But just something that works maybe a little corridor down there.

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,830
Zoom out a bit.

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,430
You know what that like that will there.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,280
And let's go to bucket fill and do some floors and some floors and you don't want be bucket filled in

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,750
oil your paint tile.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:58,590
How about some more offices put some over here it's too small but we're due to do that all and be a

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,180
nice big corner office here

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,120
keeping square for now.

51
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,410
So I look at and maybe a little I don't know.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,390
Server room thing down here old maybe that's a different office.

53
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,110
I haven't built this out.

54
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,290
I can work with that later.

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's put some more painted tiles in whoops bucket tiles that painted tile those two.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,080
And now let's connect these rooms.

57
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,650
So let's put a floor in here.

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,530
No.

59
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,690
Go back to pink tile.

60
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,060
I did it controls the or controls it there.

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,030
I think that's going to look pretty good.

62
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,520
You know what.

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,930
Let's do that.

64
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,070
Put the wall back right here.

65
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,000
So there are two doors in here one out here that's a little I don't know what that is.

66
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,000
You know what let's make a little broom cupboard Yeah.

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,720
And that's looking pretty good.

68
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,880
So there's my level one.

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,540
I'm going to rename that template level to level one.

70
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,990
And let's say that's safe.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,890
I also wanna make this my default levels now so back to Project settings.

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,850
Got to run and find Level 1 Now when I run the game.

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,620
It will run from this brand new level that we've just made.

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,730
OK good.

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,110
Nice and simple but I can tweak it later but it's good enough analysis close that window and put in

76
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,470
a couple new cameras just to show that we cancel instance and a camera

77
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,560
make sure I'm in move mode.

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,500
There's only one camera over here.

79
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,110
A duplicate that camera and get to rotate.

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,410
I could just type that in.

81
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:31,800
Can I

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,800
now.

83
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,780
I should have typed that I'm because look at this arm right here.

84
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,970
Should've been a factor of 90 degrees.

85
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,520
Not a factor.

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,540
A MULTIPLE OF NICE degrees but it isn't.

87
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,950
That is 90 degrees because the cameras don't start looking straight on.

88
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,210
So it's put you right here and camera one can be right here and one more camera.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,310
You think more camera.

90
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,100
Yeah I'm feeling one more camera.

91
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,780
I'm thinking a camera in this room.

92
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:12,820
It's kind of up here and then rotate to you by a runway 90 degrees.

93
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,360
There it is.

94
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,010
Great.

95
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,860
More cameras.

96
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,800
Okay so I'm going to check that runs or I'll check if it works well.

97
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,890
I have a camera here.

98
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,800
Chemicals Seaney.

99
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,820
I can run past it myself.

100
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,420
Tense I can maybe make it through this don't make it through the door.

101
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:36,180
Nobody can see me behind here you can't see me and into the room a little bit scary but they're gone.

102
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,420
All that's done now we have a level we can stop letting some guards into.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,440
So let's make a god.

104
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,570
So Peter the process unless a simple new inherited scene we've just done that.

105
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:52,660
Go back up a level the characters go into Templar character and there is in him my Sprite and I want

106
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,010
to find the correct scene.

107
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:00,270
So let's go to graphics and to PSG I've got him on a soldier and drag the soldier in here.

108
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,470
You'll notice the soldier is slightly wider than the man red.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,080
So his occlusion isn't quite cutting the front the body's not too big an issue.

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,040
But if you don't like it go to offset and we'll just move him back by couple of pixels left two pixels.

111
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,400
That's about gets a negative 2 on the X looks about right.

112
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,100
I have decided that every god and I'm going to rename it God is going to have a torch.

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm an instance in a torch

114
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,830
and I need to save this on a save to empty seas and call it God but we have an issue.

115
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,850
If you look at this script you can either open it or go to the inspector for a script.

116
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,250
It's the template current template character isn't what we want.

117
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,900
We don't inherit from template character someone remove that script to a new one.

118
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,010
It's gonna be in this scene and it's going to inherit from player detection.

119
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,230
Create that.

120
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,580
And that should work fine.

121
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,100
Let's find out.

122
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,270
Going to go into Level 1 and I'm going to add a brand new God.

123
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:05,000
So this instance in a god and just move my god of this and move over here and rotate.

124
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,990
Now you'll notice there's a torch.

125
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,260
But look what it's lighting.

126
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,770
Not a problem.

127
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,860
Going to God's and just make sure that the torch is outside of the exclusion mask.

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,680
This inclusion polygon right here will stop any light.

129
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,930
I will put it in his right hand just outside his body.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,710
Save that back to level one.

131
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,370
And he has a torch.

132
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,910
Let's put another guard in as well.

133
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,870
Right now they're not going to move in on or do anything.

134
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,570
They're just guards.

135
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,840
So a couple that got here and a guard over here so e each rotate W to move or you can use these handy

136
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,260
dandy.

137
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,850
And that looks pretty good.

138
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,440
Now the next two videos we can start moving them.

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:48,220
But first let's see how it works in game and my camera can see me and this guard can see me if I'm in

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,410
the torch but only if I'm in a torch.

141
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,320
The same is true here.

142
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,370
If I get my center on the torch which is weird.

143
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,220
Oh.

144
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,850
OK.

145
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,610
So normally I would edit this out but this is such a silly mistake.

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,130
The detection beam isn't actually in the torch when I move the torch his right hand.

147
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,510
That was the wrong thing to do.

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's move the transform here and on the why put that back to zero and instead I'm going to move the

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,170
torch beam out here and keep it on zero.

150
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,910
Why.

151
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,910
Because the detection script I mean let's take a look at it in the script.

152
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,430
Play detection is actually running from the origin of the character.

153
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:28,750
Right.

154
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,230
So if I look here where the character is this part here this node this kind of antibody not the sprite

155
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,080
not the torch.

156
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,940
That's where the line is being drawn.

157
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:45,000
So if I say that first play we should no longer have it to the right side of the guard is less sensitive.

158
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,930
So can see me can't see me see me can't see me.

159
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,160
Great and safety feature here.

160
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,900
Awesome.

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,330
So that's looking much better.

162
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,890
So now we have a couple of guards who admittedly don't do anything.

163
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,110
Just look at you and shine a red light.

164
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,970
And we have lots of cameras in the next couple of videos we can start moving them around.

165
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,090
Well that feels like a good place to end the video in this video we've made a new inherited scene and

166
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,360
we have hired some guards play some guards around your sound level one.

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,120
We're gonna redesign the level a couple of times as we add to this game.

168
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,750
But it's a good starting location.

169
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,570
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
