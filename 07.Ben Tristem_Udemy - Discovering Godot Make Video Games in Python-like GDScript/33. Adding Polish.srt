1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,090
Palo you brilliant got people in this video we're gonna make heist meisters more interesting to play.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,130
We're gonna add some polish.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,910
I don't have music playing throughout with this really nice piece of music.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,930
I don't want to play it from the moment game loads all the way through.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,980
We won't have a lobby.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,420
A nice little splash screen that allows players to either play the level with the game and when we make

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,060
a tutorial level picks the tutorial and we want to game over screen either when they lose or when they

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,710
win.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,840
Okay so let's get into it and this is looking pretty good so far.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,200
Let's start with the easy one to start with background music.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,820
Now if we go over the SFX and we get to the music we have this little stuff in the woods trying to open

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,110
that and just play it

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,660
nice and moody.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,360
Let's just check those imported correctly when import we do want this looping.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,600
Great.

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,820
Okay.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,770
So how do we get this playing no matter what scene we're in.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,060
Well we're going to do it and make a brand new scene.

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,400
And this is just a custom note and we just got the audio player audio stream player and I drag that

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,220
in and it does won't be particularly loud so it's a minus 10.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,150
And we want it on auto playing and let's say that I I'm to save it on a branding photocopied MUSIC AND

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,920
I'M GONNA CALL THIS BACKGROUND MUSIC

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,950
Hey you know what.

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,800
Let's rename the actual note to background music.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:28,800
Okay.

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,890
So we now have a note called background music.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,490
How do we get that play.

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,150
We want this to load automatically and because it's also playing it doesn't need any kind of script

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,210
it's just gonna work to do that.

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,570
It's got a project and project settings.

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,580
We're gonna go to auto load.

32
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,120
We've already got the combination generator in.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,950
So let's do it.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
Same thing with the background music.

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,100
So let's just go to music.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,420
Background music and attitude.

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,040
And now when we start the M

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,940
we have music does that change everything.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,160
Okay.

40
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,120
So we've got music done.

41
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,540
We can take that off the list.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,500
Now when I close my background music player and give us a small room we want to make a splash screen.

43
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,880
This is another brand new note and it's gonna be a user interface note and let's rename this to lobby.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not really a splash screen is it.

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,310
And we want there we go.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,110
Now I'm thinking these are metal panel make it nice and big.

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,820
Welcome to heist meisters stock game or quit.

48
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,180
So let's get started by putting everything in the center of the screen.

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,710
There's gonna be a center container and I wanna make sure that it's right in the lobby here.

50
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,550
Let's change the anchors of the lobby to full racks to make sure it's always in the right place.

51
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,610
And this is gonna be full racks on anchors and full rectal positioning so everything will be the center

52
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,070
of the screen.

53
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,700
Okay so we have a center container.

54
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,100
Now I want a 9 patch rectangle.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:02,010
As a child of center container so 9 patch and you'll notice it's got a size of a zero.

56
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,150
Now personally I think a size of 0 is too small so we give a minimum size of 400 on the X and Y.

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,850
Let's go to graphics then go into interface and go into PSG and down here we've got a bunch of metal

58
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,150
panels and I'm going to bring in my book.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,590
And let's give it the right match margin so it's gonna be twelve on each side except it's not twelve

60
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,630
at the top here total is it.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,980
So let's give 40 at the top.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,600
And that's looking much cleaner.

63
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,620
Look at that as looking all kinds of awesome.

64
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,530
OK.

65
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,370
So that's all.

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,030
Nice.

67
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,060
My patch rectangle that's our background let's call it a background.

68
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,140
Now I want everything inside of that to be split vertically.

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,590
And that can be a V box container.

70
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,570
So the box container and let's give that nice full rectangle.

71
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,510
That's good.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,180
But it's only going all the way to the edges.

73
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,790
That's got to margins and let's say twelve from the left.

74
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,290
Negative twelve on the right.

75
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,090
Negative twelve from the bottom.

76
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,930
And I want to go below this blue bar.

77
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,070
Let's say 30.

78
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,000
Look at that.

79
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,930
That's pretty good.

80
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,710
Okay it's time to add the theme so it's going to lobby and we're going to add our theme so load theme

81
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,980
and it's under whereas interface themes.

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
There goes.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,450
So now inside the box container we can add a label and let's write welcome to and the reason I can't

84
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,170
see it is we got white on white.

85
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,190
That's no good.

86
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,400
So let's do a custom color of black.

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,930
Okay.

88
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,700
Little bit better we can align this to the center okay.

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,280
That's looking pretty good.

90
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,130
Welcome to have a reason to use ways I want high spices in the different sizes on a duplicate with control

91
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,520
D and chase this one to heist meisters and you know what I'm gonna make this nice big song I write it

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,270
like this heist my sis and might give this a custom font new dynamic font click on that let's load the

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:10,940
font in so load and under graphics on the interface under fonts we have thin and feature and use the

94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:20,330
feature one and let's give this a much bigger size have a 30 about 40 48 years that's looking pretty

95
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,490
good OK.

96
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,500
So welcome to heist my says in nice big font and that's already looking pretty good.

97
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,420
Save my progress so far so let's save this and I think lobby can go into the levels because it is technically

98
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,310
at levels like this going in there now I want to have some buttons under here.

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,020
So back to my box container.

100
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,850
I'm going to use a grid box container.

101
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,610
We've looked at a smart grid container.

102
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,990
We've looked a grid containers.

103
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,270
When we did that the panels and this one I just want to button says have two buttons and right off the

104
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,250
bat you can notice this is really quite white.

105
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,710
It might be too white.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,700
We could fix that for now.

107
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,130
Let's give us a button and that button has no sides.

108
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,610
Let's change that.

109
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,120
How about 24 by 24.

110
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,630
It's probably a little bit small isn't it so let's try 32 by 32.

111
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,660
And you know this is way off the side here.

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,070
That's OK.

113
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,230
We can fix that.

114
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:24,870
Let's go back to the box container and add a center container and drag the grid container to be a child

115
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,400
of the said center container.

116
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,980
And I'd just like to make sure that my minimum size 32 by 32.

117
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,340
So now that button is going to draw.

118
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,210
OK.

119
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,310
So we have a button.

120
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,890
Let's give it a label so we're adding a label and we will need to custom color black for this.

121
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,690
Let's do start.

122
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,470
Mission pretty good.

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,780
Let's take both of those and duplicate them.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,790
We'll have to move the button down and this button can be called Quit game

125
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,990
now everything has gone a little bit skewed.

126
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,410
But if we leave and come back it'll it'll realign itself.

127
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,250
So don't worry too much about that.

128
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,400
One thing I don't like though is that these are quite close together.

129
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,940
I want some sort of separator.

130
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,340
Well here's a fun trick you can do the separators.

131
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,140
You'll notice we have these bars here and we've got a left center and our right.

132
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,010
I want to put some sort of split here.

133
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,170
So what I would do in the V box container.

134
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,580
I'm adding a new each box container and then we'll put it up above this center.

135
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,130
Let's make sure my shape the right ones are with the horizontal bars.

136
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,920
Try that again.

137
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,910
OK.

138
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,790
So underneath this each box container I'm going to add in a texture rect.

139
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,360
There he goes.

140
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,390
Let's start with the left duplicate that.

141
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:53,560
And this one's going to be the center and I'm the duplicate that and this was gonna be the right OK.

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,790
Clearly those don't work.

143
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,490
So let's go back to each box container and get a custom constraint a custom constraint of 0 looking

144
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,640
a lot better.

145
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,890
This center one needs to be a lot wider.

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,340
So let's give the minimum x all rethink.

147
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,320
One hundred two hundred yeah two hundred.

148
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:13,760
Good.

149
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,750
But you'll notice it's not a drawing it is.

150
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,430
Let's expand the texture now that expand needs to be checked on all three.

151
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,900
And let's start tweaking the sizes all three which means they're all going to vanish.

152
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:34,110
So all of them need on their rect a minimum size on the y of 12 medium size in the y of twelve and a

153
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,180
minimum size on the y of 12 the left and right need to actually be visible as well.

154
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,820
So let's give the M. x of twelve

155
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,030
and it's looking better.

156
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,360
Now one more thing I want the centered make sure we've got each x there.

157
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,650
Make sure you've got each box container selected.

158
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,920
Well that was hard to say.

159
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,900
And on the alignment just click center.

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,310
Look at that.

161
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,630
Okay.

162
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,340
Looking pretty solid but things are quite bunched up.

163
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,150
That's okay.

164
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,370
And the V box container custom constraints.

165
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,800
I want the separation to be a little bit bigger so let's say about there if we wanted to we could take

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:20,020
this H box container and rename it to split could duplicate it and just put one between the labels as

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,320
well.

168
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,750
That's right.

169
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,560
Where is it.

170
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,190
Right there.

171
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,580
Personally that might be a bit much for me.

172
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,350
But if you wanted to you could undo that.

173
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,810
And that's looking pretty solid.

174
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,430
Now let's make it actually work.

175
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,730
To do that we need to connect these buttons and to connect these buttons.

176
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,200
We're going to have to have a script so that's at a script to lobby and it's done.

177
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,760
Now let's rename our buttons.

178
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,950
We have a start button

179
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,740
and we have quick button which button.

180
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,500
Right.

181
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,830
And it's just why those in the stop button is going to be impressed.

182
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,410
Can you connect that to lobby and do the same thing with a button.

183
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,640
The best connects quit awesome.

184
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,400
So at this point it's nice and easy get tree dot change scene and we need to find that scene so let's

185
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,010
close this gap to levels that's my level one and I just need the string and only to load it.

186
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,250
It's expecting a string.

187
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,300
Now quick button isn't expecting a string so we get three dot quits and that's it.

188
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,910
However one tiny problem this lobby isn't going to appear at the start of the game.

189
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,660
Look at play the game.

190
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,790
There's no lobby.

191
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,050
How do I get it to do this.

192
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,920
We gonna go to project settings and go back to general and on the application you've got config and

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,790
you've got run.

194
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,870
And it's this one main scene right now is going to level one.

195
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,960
Let's change that main scene.

196
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:09,170
You go to lobby and let's press play and we've got buttons that are all connected through themes and

197
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,140
I can start my mission or I get a quick I look at that.

198
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,830
We now have a fancy pants looking start menu.

199
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,300
Okay.

200
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,880
So we can have our fancy pants start menu.

201
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,330
What about a victory screen or a losing screen.

202
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,690
So that's my challenge to you.

203
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,120
I would like you to add a victory screen.

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,340
Take the team we've got so far and tweak it to be the victory screen and then figure out how to load

205
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,680
that in when the player gets the exit.

206
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,680
Suppose the video give it a shot.

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,670
And when you're ready come on back and I'll show you my solution

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,230
and welcome back.

209
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,420
OK.

210
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,250
So let's make an instance of this.

211
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,960
Let's go to New inherited scene.

212
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,340
I'm going to inherit from lobby.

213
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,070
I'm going to call this one victory.

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,250
OK.

215
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,750
So we've got all of these and we can change the values.

216
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,610
What we can't do is actually delete stuff.

217
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,800
So maybe I don't want welcome too.

218
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,210
But what I can do is I can hide it and hide that.

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:27,080
And now on high spices we can say mission accomplished or victory is yours or yay.

220
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm to say

221
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,630
you are victorious.

222
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,810
And we can leave.

223
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,000
Start mission and quick game the same.

224
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,430
Some say that probably with the right name on it.

225
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,660
So victory screen.

226
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,180
Much better save that in the same place.

227
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,910
And where's that coming in that's coming in with the exit.

228
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:59,620
So let's open up all these exits and just open up the base scene and instead of get Tre quit we're not

229
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,340
going to go.

230
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Get tree dot change scene and I'm going to drag through the victory screen.

231
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,590
So let's just drop that in the and that should be everything we need.

232
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
Let's find out.

233
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,590
So here's my lobby.

234
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,950
Start the game.

235
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm going to type in 9 0 7 4

236
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,180
9 0 7 for the camera for the past.

237
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,530
I'll just duck down here.

238
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,500
Excuse me everybody

239
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,560
la la la la.

240
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,740
Difficulty Level nice and low which is perfect for testing please this stage of testing.

241
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,080
Got stop and look.

242
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,010
Probably time to use a box.

243
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,760
Who wasn't paying attention.

244
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,910
My suspicion meter the problem with this remote

245
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,510
and you are victorious not game.

246
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,110
Quick look at that we've now added a bunch of Polish and I am really happy with that.

247
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,790
So in this video we've looked at using a scene as a singleton and with polish up the game.

248
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,340
Next thing I have to add is a tutorial to teach players how to play the game at which point we're pretty

249
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,970
much done.

250
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,970
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
