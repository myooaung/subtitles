1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,560
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,260
Marvellous God.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,280
People in this video will make the background awesome.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,520
We're going to look at parallax backgrounds which are really fun and easy doing god.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,850
By the end of this video you're going to have self repeating textures that move at different rates so

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:26,740
that our background is not only awesome it makes us feel like we're going really fast before we go any

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,630
further let's have a quick refresher on what parallax means parallax.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,010
That phenomena where objects seemed to be in different positions based on our viewing angles.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,630
Imagine you are travelling you're in a car or a train.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,350
You're in the passenger window you can look up the side you go through the countryside and what you

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,780
can see is our whole bunch of green in the background.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,200
We can see lots of trees right.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,450
That would be a nice dark green here they are.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,340
In the foreground there are some bushes.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,230
The Bushes are going past so fast they're a blur.

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,090
The trees are hardly moving.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,000
This is parallax parallaxes really useful and some key concepts to bear in mind.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,500
First the close of play is the faster it moves.

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,390
So the background layers should move very slowly in the foreground as you move very quickly.

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,640
Secondly the faster player moves the faster the player will feel like they're going again.

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,810
If the foreground barely moves along we're going to feel like we're tiny in hardly moving but if it's

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,810
zipping past we going to feel like we're riding the wind in God so we're going to control the speed

23
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,380
of a parallax layer through scale.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,780
As a theory let's look at this in practice.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,940
You'll notice I've drawn in a few more platforms in here with my tile map I just went in here and drew

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,920
some in.

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,700
That's mostly just so I can play around.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,010
I was just thinking was a bit small.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,500
I wanted some more height to my level.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,480
Great.

31
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,660
So when do they open the camera scene.

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,040
And if you can't remember how to open a scene just remember this little film clack board thing whatever

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,960
it's called and within carroty I'm going to create a new child.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,540
Note that child note is going to be a parallax background.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,980
You need a parallax background before you put any parallax layers in parallax backgrounds.

36
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,880
If we take a look at the the inheritance inherit from canvas layers to canvas those are really useful

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,500
because they don't inherit position information which means if I need something to always be in a certain

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,490
position on screen it doesn't matter what the parent node thinks is happening.

39
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,560
It'll always be in that position on screen.

40
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,290
Well would making a background.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,240
So it always wants to be in that place within our palicki background were going to create a parallax

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,980
layer.

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,900
And we need the Panix to be displaying something so let's make a sprite.

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,320
OK.

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,020
What Sprite are we going to make.

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,990
Well that's good too.

47
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,410
Graphics into G effects and in the background.

48
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,230
The very first thing I would do is b.g. lay out one that's going to go into textures cover things I

49
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,470
want to do the first things I'm going to offset and switch off centreing centreing is on it's going

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,850
to find the.

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,500
It's going to find the transform the position of the Sprite and at the 0 0 it's going to centre it.

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,480
I don't want to centre some sound off and now it's going to start at 0 0 and extend down right.

53
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,060
The next thing I need to do is go into the parallax layer an open motion.

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,980
Now if I press play right now.

55
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,080
In fact I can show you if I press play right now what I have is a rather fetching blue square in the

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,300
background that stubbornly stops.

57
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,840
Well that's not really the effect I'm looking for.

58
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,040
I want this to repeat itself and way we would do that is with this mirroring her mouseover you'll see

59
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,830
if the axis is set to zero it will not mirror.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,280
Otherwise it's going to mirror every time we get to a certain pixel count.

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,880
So what I need is the size of this image.

62
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,920
Right click on it over here and the file manager do schadt show in file manager not shower and file

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,590
manager don't Sharon the fund manager is unhygienic.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
Right click on it properties and other details.

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,580
There it is 2048 by 2048.

66
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,950
I realize that's going be different on Linux and Mac.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
I apologize for that.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm pretty sure that you can find that but if you can't.

69
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,880
This image is 2048.

70
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,960
By 2040 it right.

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,370
So I want to mirror on the x axis by 2048.

72
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,430
I'm not just going to mirror on the X axis for this one because this is my pure background because if

73
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,810
I do then I suddenly have this transparent grey in the background so that's mirror on the Y as well.

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,350
And now we have is Infinite's blue plane.

75
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,690
We don't have a parallax background yet but let's face it it's already much better than that strange

76
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,520
grey colour.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Now one the do is of duplicate this parallax layer and then change the textures that for right click

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,720
on it.

79
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,410
I can see the shortcut is for that.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,480
And Windows as control.

81
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,390
The sun's going to control deep three times why three times I have three more layers on each Sprite.

82
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,550
I'm just going to.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,180
Also.

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,790
Well it looks like.

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,320
Remember.

86
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,440
Put it in texture.

87
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,840
Don't put it in a normal map.

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,480
Very nice.

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,490
Okay.

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,990
So if I go in here now I now have a much better looking background texture.

91
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,210
Couple of things will notice one I'm way too high on the map to all the layers are moving at the same

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,370
speed.

93
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,010
Well that's not ideal.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,110
It looks better but it's not parallax.

95
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,300
It's an improvement.

96
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,430
But what I want is for these things to move at different speeds.

97
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,050
That's where that parallax effect is going to come from.

98
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,330
And remember that that speed is controlled in scales on each parallax layer.

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,120
The closer it is the faster it is higher number as far as leave the front layer is one and the next

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,440
layer.

101
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,280
Two point eight.

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,480
And on behind that point six there's no point in doing anything to this layer because when look at the

103
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,040
Sprite.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,950
It's just a blue background.

105
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,250
It's not going to change.

106
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,880
Well first off there's something very odd happening up here.

107
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,470
Right.

108
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,780
But will now see that the various layers are moving at different speeds.

109
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,000
Awesome.

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,230
Why are we getting that would affect.

111
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,410
There's a couple reasons.

112
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,260
The first is I shouldn't be mirroring anything except for the background.

113
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,440
Right.

114
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,630
This blue line here you know just to make this easy.

115
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,700
It's ruining this background.

116
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,000
So now an easel a background that's one referring to palicki lair therefore is mirroring on the y axis.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,980
That means it's repeating on the vertical.

118
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,510
I don't want that to happen that's what it is.

119
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,870
Let's put that to zero and do the same for Panix Lear three and two.

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,220
Secondly they're all kind of low down.

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,430
If I press play again.

122
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,850
You see that that actually start until get way down here.

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,060
So let's move them all up by I don't know what sounds good.

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
Let's go crazy.

125
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:20,930
So palace to let you do negative 1000 on the y axis because negative is up.

126
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,920
And I'm sure I do that to all of them.

127
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,780
I'm using offset by the way.

128
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,850
That just means okay here's the location of the node.

129
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,910
Now just nudge it in this direction so I am using offset negative y 1000.

130
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,910
That means nudge this up by a thousand.

131
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,950
UPS 1000 not 100.

132
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,150
Now I said all of them.

133
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,500
I dont mean background.

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,060
Theres no detail there so wont look any different.

135
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,860
Okay much better and was a bit much wasn't it.

136
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,640
So let's tweak that down too.

137
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,200
I don't know 750 750 sounds like a good number.

138
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Negative 750.

139
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,470
Whoops I didn't actually do it.

140
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,870
Negative 750.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,490
And again over here.

142
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,540
Making sure the actually click where you mean to click.

143
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,980
Me with my mad mouse skills today.

144
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,250
And I promise I will never say the words mad mouth skills ever again.

145
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,060
Awesome.

146
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,680
So here we go.

147
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,430
And we are now moving and haven't moved vertically you'll see that this blue line here is moving faster.

148
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,760
We are gesturing a little aren't we.

149
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,270
Let's go to project settings and fix that project settings quality.

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,460
Pixel snap on.

151
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,640
And what to see and actually work a little better.

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,230
Yeah I have that weird juddering I was having just now.

153
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,130
Still not great.

154
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,880
We can fix the femora a little later.

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,050
But there we go.

156
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,720
We are moving now when we get down to here there's going to be a problem.

157
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,470
Now part of the reason that's happening when I get down here and I fall off the edge is because these

158
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,820
textures are moving quite fast repeating quite fast.

159
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,430
If I go and I change the Y scale to one on all the letters.

160
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,600
They're not going to get that huge movement every time I jump which I quite like.

161
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:39,680
And I'm also not going to see that big changing colour right there which make mcfall stratification.

162
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,940
I can't remember that weird thing a funny thing can do is on parallax background under scroll.

163
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,010
Let's take a ignore camera and see what happens.

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,430
You see this hard line over here as I move towards it.

165
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,100
Things pop into existence.

166
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,670
Why are they doing that.

167
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,330
Well with ignore camera switched off.

168
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,950
What it's doing is looking at the camera zoom in and applying that to the size of the texture which

169
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,750
means the size of the textures now wrong.

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,120
So we need to check it's on.

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,680
That means we can change the Zune to our heart's content and this will always look good.

172
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,470
Final thing I want to do is right click on this and do save brushless seeing what that's going to do

173
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,420
is take all of these child notes and move them to their own scene and turn this into an instance as

174
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,490
opposed to just part of camera today camera Judy uses the camera.

175
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,770
It's not really the same thing as Parallax background so right click on to save Brusher scene and call

176
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,540
it pollacks background.

177
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,760
And now the camera is a camera which instances in the parallax background that can move that and do

178
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
what I want with it.

179
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,280
And we now have a rather fancy looking background in our shiny shiny level.

180
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,470
I do feel like I should tweak some of these platforms because I keep falling and having to reshoot these

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,800
things.

182
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
But look we now have parallax.

183
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,710
Now we can change the speed of these tweets a little bit.

184
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,660
So let's say into character Deep Impact background.

185
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,790
You're not now going to scale up one you're going to scale at one point five not 15.

186
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,030
That's crazy talk.

187
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,540
Let's see how that works.

188
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,660
And you just zoomed past.

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,860
That's actually a fun little high.

190
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,830
But I want to call it one point twenty five.

191
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,540
There we go.

192
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,590
Parallax there behind it is going to be one and the one behind that is going to be point five actually

193
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,630
not just to the from one as one point five one point five one point five.

194
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,280
This is going to feel like we're just flying along like this and go.

195
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,910
There it is.

196
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
That's actually a little bit fast for me.

197
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,530
But tweet these values so that they feel good to you.

198
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,920
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

199
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,140
We've created a parallax background node and started using parallax layers on our parikh's background

200
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,180
to get that thing in there.

201
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,610
Now remember you can put anything on there you could just put little puffs of blue or even particle

202
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,530
effects and have really cool things.

203
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,190
Great work.

204
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,840
We now have a great looking background and our game is to look really completes a fantastic job not

205
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,910
seeing the next video.
