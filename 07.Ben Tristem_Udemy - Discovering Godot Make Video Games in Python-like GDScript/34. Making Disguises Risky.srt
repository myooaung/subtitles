00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello again you scrumptious got to people why scrumptious.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,430
I don't know.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm running out of wonderful adjectives but your wonderful adjectives in this video.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,260
We're going to take those disguises we made and make them risky.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,730
Right now we have a gameplay problem.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,770
We've created an awesome disguise that has no cost to it so there's no reason why you wouldn't just

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,720
go through the game as a box let's make disguises risky.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,660
I've got some ideas of how we can do that.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,320
The first is we're going to move slower when we disguise it makes sense right.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,370
Boxes are well known for not moving fast so we're going to be a compelling box.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,930
We should move slowly.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,950
I might be confusing boxes with titles.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,010
We're going to limit the amount of disguises you can't carry an infinite amount of disguise boxes with

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,360
you can only carry a set amount.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,280
We're going to put that as an export variable so we can tweak what that set amount is but let's limit

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,020
it let's also have the disguises only work for a certain amount of time.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,100
If you take the disguise off before then fine.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,460
But if you don't when the time runs out the disguise will just vanish.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,860
OK how do we do that.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,220
Well here we are in God.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,190
And what are going to do is I'm open for Play a script which for some reason is very small.

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,250
Zoom in so you guys can see what I'm doing.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,540
I'm going to start by putting some export variables.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,550
That way we can tweak them quite easily.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,540
And the first one I want to put in is disguises how many disguises do you start with.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,890
That's not how you spell disguises.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,500
That's a smart disguise.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,630
For now let's say three and I'm going to put a note in here.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,400
So anyone who looks at the script can figure out what we're doing.

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,270
How many disguises do you start with.

31
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,390
It's not a question Howie the size as you start with.

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,350
Next one I also do is export variable duration disguised duration I guess makes more sense.

33
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,700
And this is going to be a time in seconds.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,960
How long did the sky start.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,270
For now it's like five seconds and I'll make a note.

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,960
How long disguise can last.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm saying can last because you do have the option of taking it off beforehand.

38
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,160
That's a space there.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,620
Just make as nice legible.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,120
One more export variable I want to put in is how much work in the skies will slow you down.

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,110
The school is disguised slowdown and I'm put zero point to five.

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,110
When you wear a disguise you're going to go a quarter of the speed as when you walk around.

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,260
Right now we can change all of these as an export variable so if I open the player and take a look right

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,930
here the top script variables disguises your age so we can fix these very easily.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,780
However these are good defaults.

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,090
Let's start with the easiest to start with this sky slowed.

47
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,040
I need one more variable for this to work and I'm on to put it right under disguise because they kind

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,950
of grouped together.

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,690
Velocity multiplier and a default will be 1.

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,590
If we then scroll down to move and slide I'm going to multiply motion by velocity multiply.

51
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,030
At the moment motion times 1 is the same as motion.

52
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,310
But when we change velocity multiplier to zero point to 5 it's going to slow us down to a quarter speed

53
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,680
OK.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,500
So now we just need to switch velocity multiplier and the first somebody that is when you disguise or

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,860
when you're disguised.

56
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,900
Let's slow you down.

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,920
So velocity multiplier equals disguise.

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,880
Slow down when you reveal.

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,880
Let's switch it back and I want to keep these to roughly the same place if you know what let's put these

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,510
at the bottom.

61
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,610
It makes more sense.

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,400
Well maybe up I can't disguise trueness outs will put it right here up a little gap between them.

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,860
So after college allow one to put a velocity multiplier equals one because that's a default rate.

64
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,850
One is always going to be a default.

65
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,880
All right let's see how that works out.

66
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,830
So here I am as a person and I can spread it around the place very fast.

67
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,050
Here I am as a box and very slow.

68
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,400
Just like in real life boxes in nature as you know very slow.

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,710
I am as a human and I zoom around the place like a zooming thing.

70
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,900
Great.

71
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,330
Well that's the first thing taken care of.

72
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,530
So if I had a list in front of me I'd take it off the list.

73
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,050
I didn't make a list but that's okay.

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,360
We know what we're doing.

75
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,540
The next thing you want to do is check that we have enough disguises left let's close the outputs so

76
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,100
I can see enough the screen and go into big screen mode to do that.

77
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,040
Going to get a total disguise and I'm going to remove this.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,450
Else I should change it for an IF right else.

79
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,430
If so we know your not disguise so I don't need to pull anything the skies in here.

80
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,050
Why do I need to do is check that disguises is greater than zero.

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,270
So if you're disguised reveal itself if you're not disguised check that you have a disguise to wear.

82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,370
If you do you can put it on.

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,320
Otherwise you can't.

84
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,480
Awesome let's Pressplay.

85
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,800
Ellis checked once twice thrice and then I'm out of disguises at the moment.

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,150
We have nothing and the going to tell the player you have no disguises left but that's okay we'll put

87
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,630
that in later for now.

88
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,990
That's two of our main options.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,830
The next one is going to be the timer to make the timer work.

90
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,960
Let's actually put it in the player.

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,330
Someone open the placing arm put a timer.

92
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,880
As a child of player now let's connect connected with a signal.

93
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,100
Somebody get a node first time out and going to connect the timeout signal to player.

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,580
But I'm not going to use this method here on time a timeout.

95
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,920
Instead I'm going to use reveal

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:53,940
the moment this time runs out drop back into revealment Let's scroll back up because on ready I want

97
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,860
to make sure that the timer is set to this disguised duration variable.

98
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,780
So let's do that here.

99
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:09,020
Let's say a timer dot and asrs WAIT time equals disguise duration.

100
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,480
Now we actually need to start the timer.

101
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,540
Otherwise this does nothing.

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:22,400
So let's head down to the skies and get a print right here so timer dot stopped.

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,970
So when I press play when I'm expecting is I can disguise myself and then after five seconds I'll just

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,600
pop back and find out disguising myself not touching the keyboard waiting 5 seconds do do do do and

105
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,280
any time now I'm popped back.

106
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,230
OK so I didn't touch anything.

107
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,380
Now what I would like to do is put a label on the player

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,620
and put it right.

109
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,980
Let's move the label.

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,460
Let's not move the parent just gorgeous with the label over the label.

111
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,810
Right up here and the text is going to be zero point zero is zero.

112
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,730
Just so I can see what it looks like.

113
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:08,410
Why do we keep it in theme as well something else the theme in lote theme is my theme.

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,800
Awesome.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,860
So now it's infant and that's Infoline all looking good.

116
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,320
Let's get back into the script.

117
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,950
I want to go right here on function reveal.

118
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,100
We have to hide the label so label got visible.

119
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:30,310
He calls phos and when revealed let's do the same thing so the label not visible cause I say the same

120
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,230
thing it's the opposite right so I can see the label.

121
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,890
There's a slight issue that's going to happen here for Pressplay.

122
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,050
You could see especially in night vision mode.

123
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,150
The label is already there now where the skies myself and then come back they will vanish.

124
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,880
So ready.

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,860
Going to have to go into reveal mode.

126
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,780
That's okay we can do that.

127
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,280
Let's get ready.

128
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,130
Which going to call reveal.

129
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,300
Awesome.

130
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,660
Now before we start the timer actually working I have a challenge for you.

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,040
I'd like you to make sure that the label for the disguise timer is always the right way up.

132
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:13,560
If you look at what's happening when I move around the screen the label is wherever the boxes.

133
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:13,880
Right.

134
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,120
And that's not that useful I'd like it to be visible.

135
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,180
So see if you can get the label to always face the right way.

136
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,890
Now we have actually solved this before with doors computers so don't be afraid to refer back to it.

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,060
But pause the video.

138
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,860
See if you can find a solution.

139
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,360
And then when you come back I'll show you how I do it.

140
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,100
And welcome back.

141
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,820
Okay.

142
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,060
So what we need to do is on every frame and we do it right here on process.

143
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,180
I want to check the time as the way out a timer.

144
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,390
I don't mean time and do I mean label dot.

145
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,380
And let's find the actual rotation.

146
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,620
Now this is slightly different because this is a gooey element.

147
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,620
It's going to be rect rotation.

148
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,450
That's mouse over it regular rotation.

149
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,160
Awesome wrecked.

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,400
Rotation equals and this is going to be negative rotation degrees.

151
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,820
So whatever we're facing going the other way.

152
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,970
Let's take a look.

153
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,820
I hide myself and look at the timer who's just fine.

154
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,010
Awesome.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,060
OK.

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
Now let's actually display the timer.

157
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,010
So first thing let's go to the timer and make sure this is set to one shot.

158
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,310
Right.

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,070
It's going to run once and then stop.

160
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,230
I don't want it to keep running.

161
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,670
Now let's actually display how much time is left so still in process.

162
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm going to go label dot.

163
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,550
Text equals.

164
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:52,290
And I want timer dot time left and I'm going to have to parse that as a string because that's going

165
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,390
to be a float text requires a string.

166
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,260
So I'm going to cast time adult time left as a string.

167
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,610
That's going a little messy though because take a look.

168
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,110
Here I am ingame disguise myself and look at this timer.

169
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,670
Oh that's annoying.

170
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,910
I just want the first two digits if I want the first two digits.

171
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:17,930
I'm going to use a function within string and logo dot pad decimals and not iPad 2 decimal places.

172
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,990
Let's Pressplay.

173
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,570
I'm disguised.

174
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,680
And look at that.

175
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,270
Perfect.

176
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,810
Disguise.

177
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,640
That's really clear.

178
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,620
Lastly let's make sure we're only updating this label when we need to and we only need to when we disguise

179
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,510
sellers go off disguised

180
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,240
and then would tab.

181
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,310
So they're part of this type.

182
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,000
This code block so now if you're disguised rotate the label update the text and if not done.

183
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,700
Which brings us to the end of the video.

184
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:58,180
In this video we've learned how to display a set amount of characters or digits in a string using pad.

185
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,540
We've made risk match reward and we've added cost to using a disguise.

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,160
Now disguise has become really important.

187
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,560
We have to make sure that the player knows that they have a set amount disguises left but we can cover

188
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,580
that in a future video.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,790
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
