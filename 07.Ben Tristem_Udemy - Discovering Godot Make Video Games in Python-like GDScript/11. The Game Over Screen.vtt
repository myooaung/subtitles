00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.470
Hello wonderful people in this video we're going to make a game of a scream.

2
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.470
We need the game to actually be able to end whether we win or lose.

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.910
So what needs to happen.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.060
First thing we need to do is create a new scene called Game Over.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.480
Then we need a way to get to that scene and a way to get back.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.750
So we need to give the player a chance to restart right whether they win or lose.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.880
Let's begin by making a new scene that's going to be game over.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.940
We need the parent node for this.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.390
Now there's a lot of things we can't use but I'm going to use control which is the base note for any

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.510
kind of you are.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.810
That's why it's green not blue or red.

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.480
Remember blues for 2D Red is for 3-d.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.040
Green is for the user interface.

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.920
It's there's a lot of really cool features with this and we'll explore this in more detail when we make

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.300
the actual UI for the game.

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990
For now let's create a control note.

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.410
I'm going to rename this game over.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
There it is.

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.770
Let's click on this layout button.

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.110
What this is going to do is say okay I want you to arrange yourself based on the screen size of the

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390
four press full rectangle.

22
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.150
You'll see it's now the size of the screen.

23
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.500
Okay.

24
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.210
What do we want here in the background.

25
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.530
Well we have a couple of options.

26
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.830
We call it if we're going to control node you know want to go type in and we could use a colour rectangle

27
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.190
just a rectangle that we can pick a colourful.

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.340
So let's say I want.

29
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.040
It's nice.

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.420
What does that terracotta nice purposely colour whatever.

31
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.840
And that will work.

32
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.540
So you could use this colour rectangle make it black or grey or teal or whatever.

33
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.030
I'm going to delete this node and create a new one.

34
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330
There's going to be a texture rectangle.

35
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.790
And the texture I'm going to pick is the background.

36
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.030
Now even if I see a full rectangle lay up it's not going to go small in this size unless I press expand

37
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.100
the Expand checkbox a little misleading it doesn't mean just letting it go.

38
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.320
It also means let's get small.

39
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.060
Keep in mind by the way that these layout controls like full rectangle that's referring to how big it

40
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.070
is compared to the parent not to the view screen.

41
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.140
It just so happens that in this case we're also looking at a view screen because that's the size of

42
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.720
the parent.

43
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.680
And now press full rectangle it's actually the size of the view screen.

44
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.160
This is really cool because let's save the scene in scenes.

45
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.090
Game over scene.

46
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.930
Fantastic.

47
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.930
When I press run scene or play scene as opposed to play game I'm just going to play this game over scene.

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.380
And here we have a nice bright blue background that doesn't do anything but on every size it it's sizing

49
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.250
all the elements in control.

50
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.010
That's handy because it means that I don't have to worry about different screen sizes.

51
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.360
And and trying to align all the elements.

52
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.740
I just get it right the first time it should work for everything.

53
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.220
Okay what do we want next.

54
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.520
I want a big thing in the middle that says game over.

55
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.160
I want it in the middle.

56
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.320
That's my first clue.

57
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.000
So in the middle I'm going to create a new control.

58
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.660
I could just type it in under a container I want centre container keeps children controls centred.

59
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.740
Perfect.

60
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.710
Let's make you full rectangle.

61
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.480
So it now knows this is the size I have to work with.

62
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.590
Keep whatever's in you in the centre and I'm not gonna rename that but I am going to give it a child

63
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.180
that child is going to be a text label soul label not Texas label just label.

64
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.250
It's confusing isn't it rich text label and label.

65
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.960
So what's this label going to be.

66
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.680
Well right now it's not going to be anything because the minimum size is wrong.

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.080
Let's change the minimum size before we type anything under rectangle or rect minimum size let's say

68
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080
400 x y 200 Y.

69
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.540
So that is the smallest This element can get.

70
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.200
And I'm going to write the words game over and then they are in tiny tiny white letters that's no use

71
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.320
to anybody.

72
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.960
So we'll go down to custom colours and black do black for now.

73
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.420
You can pick whatever colour you like you want.

74
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.300
Nice.

75
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.850
What is this nice.

76
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.530
Whatever shade of pink that is.

77
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.480
I don't think it looks terrible on a big black

78
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.300
custom font.

79
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.080
We've done this before in Luni lips bless refresh our memory.

80
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.200
I'm going to create a new dynamic font.

81
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.830
Click on the font.

82
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.980
Click font from the dynamic font menu there's a lot of clicking this is apparently a change of three

83
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.030
point one.

84
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.560
And we've provided a font for you so if you go back to them the root menu Torres you'll see fonts that

85
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.690
just drag candles over there.

86
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.050
Can't see anything.

87
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.410
Why.

88
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.530
Because size has been set to zero.

89
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.620
What's a good size 50.

90
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.340
OK.

91
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.110
Let's go with the 180 has 180 180 feels good.

92
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.670
So make a brand new button.

93
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.930
And to give it simple I'm going to go with a texture button.

94
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.620
There is some very cool stuff you do with non texture buttons but that's kind of all themes are going

95
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.300
to come back to themes later in the course.

96
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.660
So for now it's like a text button and we have a text so we can use and hard let's use the little bronze

97
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.620
Bunny I come that's going to be our lives.

98
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.710
That feels sensible over to normal you go normal texture is a bunny.

99
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.750
Let's put you down here.

100
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760
It looks like a good place.

101
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.320
I'm going to change the size of this thing so right now the size is 52 by 71.

102
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.430
Let's double that so 52 to 140 and seventy one is our hundred and forty two.

103
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.350
I can maths.

104
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.990
OK.

105
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.980
I've change the size is not expanding so let's expand you.

106
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.710
Perfect.

107
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.720
Now that is a label as make a label

108
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.360
and the labels are going to say try again for now.

109
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.450
Let's give it colours and fonts and make you black custom font.

110
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.850
OK.

111
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.880
I can copy the font from here and put it into this label.

112
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.720
But if I do that they're both going to be the same size and for change the size in one.

113
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.500
It'll change them in.

114
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.490
But I want to see a different size.

115
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:26.230
This is a new custom dynamic font back into fonts strike candles not to spacing into font because that's

116
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.720
what it is.

117
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.320
And let's give you a size of one 20.

118
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.540
Do you pick your font of 80.

119
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.250
Yes.

120
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.090
Much more like it.

121
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.860
Let's move monita over here and move this over here.

122
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.400
OK.

123
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.380
That's looking good.

124
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.130
We now have a game over.

125
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.840
Try again.

126
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.260
We can move this to where we need it could be here could be done in the corner.

127
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.740
Find a place you're comfortable with.

128
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.370
And with that let's actually make a function.

129
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.760
I first want to save this check.

130
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.430
This looks good.

131
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.680
There we go.

132
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.740
The button currently not doing anything.

133
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.270
Can we go back to the root menu because of the need to navigate in a minute.

134
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.230
First thing I need to do is figure out where Bunny is so that's going to be position nice and easy.

135
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.360
No we to figure out what the end of the level is.

136
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.610
I'm just going to get a camera too deep and look what we put the limit.

137
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.400
I put my bottom three thousand.

138
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.320
Well cameras not going to be on there.

139
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.340
If the play goes beyond the end of the game.

140
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.700
Nice and easy.

141
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.390
Let's make an export variable a variable that's going to shop in the inspector and I won't call this

142
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.190
world all in it.

143
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.430
Equals 3000.

144
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.860
Save that.

145
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.700
And the reason I do this is now I can change it here.

146
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.100
Right so if I don't like it I can change that later.

147
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.510
We could get rid of this and just move it into the function for now.

148
00:07:51.560 --> 00:08:00.430
Leverage is so fall this big brand if condition if position dot Y.

149
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:06.280
Okay so if my vertical position is greater than the world limit

150
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:17.070
so position not why is greater than if my downward position is greater than the world limit.

151
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.230
Remember positive y is down.

152
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.250
I get the wrong so many times.

153
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.900
What do we need to do.

154
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.580
We need to make this call a function call a function called End Game.

155
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.860
Let's go into a big screen mode no a function and game.

156
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:41.580
OK we did this a lunar eclipse right so get tree dot change seen what seemed to need to change too.

157
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.840
Well if we go to our scenes folder and right click on game over we can do Cobie path.

158
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.350
Now we're going to need a string.

159
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:58.030
You can see that if I press control and do change screen change scene string path so what that means

160
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.500
is it needs to be in quotes.

161
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.000
This one like pastes in the reference and that should work.

162
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.180
Let's find out this Pressplay.

163
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.500
Here is Bonnie.

164
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.620
Bonnie is cute.

165
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.880
Bonnie will fall.

166
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.090
Game over.

167
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.240
Awesome.

168
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.530
Now we need to do is make sure that we don't just get here.

169
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.950
We make this button do something.

170
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.030
So that's my challenge for you.

171
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.440
I would like you to let the play a try again then have the try again button load level 1.

172
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.170
Pause the video give it a shot.

173
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.960
When you come back I'll show you my solution.

174
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.280
And welcome back.

175
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.510
I'm going to put a new script in game over and what I want to do is send a signal from the texture button.

176
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.000
Game over.

177
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.900
So first this needs a script.

178
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.600
You cannot connect to a node that has no script.

179
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.800
So new script let's put this in the right place.

180
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.950
This is scenes I don't want in scenes I want his scripts are going to call it game over for now and

181
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.880
create the script.

182
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:06.170
Alright now let's connect the signal on Prest is going to connect to that.

183
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.510
It can take on texture Prest great.

184
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.000
I don't need a radio function.

185
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.200
I do need extends control you can't get rid of that.

186
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.200
I guess what's going to happen here gets docked.

187
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.030
Tre Whoops no get under score tree.

188
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.610
So get tree dot change scene the same exact thing which you did.

189
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.390
What's my string.

190
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.850
I'm going to go to level one.

191
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.200
Copy path and paste that in and that should be it.

192
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.360
That should be all that needs to happen so as press play and check that.

193
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.010
OK Bonnie form bunny fall game over.

194
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.390
Try again.

195
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.250
And there we are.

196
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.900
And we're done.

197
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.470
Which brings us to the end of this video.

198
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:52.930
In this video we've created a game over screen and started looking at control notes and then we refreshed

199
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.740
ourselves on how to use signals and basic things like fonts and so on.

200
00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.150
And before we go why not share the game of the screen you made so take a screen shot of it and show

201
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.800
the community.

202
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.050
I'd love to see it.

203
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.090
So we now have an end game state.

204
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.070
Great work and I'll see you in the next video.
