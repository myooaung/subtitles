00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.210
Hello again you wonderful God.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.410
People in this video we're going to work on the locked doors.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.280
Probably not finish them in this video but we to make sure that the number pad works as we might expect.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.200
So let's talk about how the number pad is going to work.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
Specifically we're going to have a bunch of buttons and each button is going to do a different thing

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.250
so button five can't do the same thing as Button one.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.490
And the display has to update for each number button we press say no button because if we open up godda

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.770
and I go over to my locked doors and then I open up another pad you'll notice there's a button here

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910
that isn't a number that has to do something different.

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.860
So I'm inside my number pad scene.

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.140
What do I need to happen.

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.040
Well the first thing I need is a script.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.010
Let's put a script in number pad heads up do it in the number pad scene.

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.260
Don't do it here in the locked door thing if you put a scene here a locked door scene you're pulling

15
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.880
as a script on the instance of no pad not on the no patsy.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.120
I want this happen on every number pad just in case he's at somewhere else.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.340
So brainy script and put this in the scripts folder.

18
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.920
Nicole it no pad will get to go.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.500
OK.

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.630
So we now have a script and we want to do stuff.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.180
The very first thing to do is grab all of these buttons.

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.940
Now a couple of ways we could do this.

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.030
We could put all of the buttons in a group.

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.660
This is not I deal.

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.300
Here's why.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.490
If I put all the buttons on a group I call the group buttons.

27
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.220
When we instance a new version of a locked door every button one is going to trigger every single locked

28
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.510
door.

29
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700
And that could cause problems.

30
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.380
So instead I'm going to use a signal because that allows me to control exactly where this is going.

31
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.080
The next thing I could do is make a signal for Button one if I go into node and do button press and

32
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.800
connect it.

33
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.690
I can make a signal on but when pressed and I can do the same from button to on button.

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370
But this is really irritating.

35
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.770
So let's just get rid of the function I just made and instead I'm going make it brandnew function and

36
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.420
I'm going to call it connect buttons and what connect buttons is going to do is it's going to go into

37
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.890
this button grid.

38
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.930
It's going to grab all of the children and then connect them as a button.

39
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.180
And it's going to use the label on the button as a signal back into the script.

40
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.970
This means that whatever label with put on the individual buttons so for instance six eight okay will

41
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.290
be sent as a signal.

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.820
That's really helpful because it means if we decide that we need an alphanumeric system so we need a

43
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.070
quirky keyboard or as a T keyboard all we need.

44
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.350
I don't know strings.

45
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.850
Whatever else it might be we can send through the button and it'll behave logically.

46
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.690
So for that to happen we need to get to the button grid and we need to grab every single button and

47
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.480
then stop to do this with a new something called a fall loop.

48
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.800
Now this is the first time we've looked at a full loop in this course.

49
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.790
If you've done programming before you're probably familiar with the for loop.

50
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.880
But just in case let's go order fully up is and how it works so that everybody's up to speed.

51
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.580
What's going to happen is on button connect I mean go for Button in

52
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.170
button right.

53
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.740
This would button is kind of irrelevant doesn't it.

54
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.570
Would you put.

55
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.260
I for I am putting grid for child for mouse.

56
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.590
I'm on call button because it feels more sensible right now.

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.020
And what this is saying is iterate this button for every thing in this condition.

58
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.210
The condition is the second bit right in the condition in button.

59
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.940
Red means.

60
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.370
Within button.

61
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.200
Right now I don't just mean but from grid I mean get shelled.

62
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.990
So here's what they're saying.

63
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.670
Iterate button for every child of button.

64
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.250
Right.

65
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.780
OK.

66
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.790
So what I want to do is take this thing which is going to be a child right because that's what this

67
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.910
iteration is.

68
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770
And I want to connect it so button connect.

69
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.110
I'm doing button connect so that we know that it's the child that's connecting not to the thing calling

70
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.490
the script not connecting self and connecting button I'm connecting and script.

71
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.170
So I don't have to go through manually and connect them most signals connecting a script also allows

72
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.110
me to pass custom arguments through.

73
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.780
OK.

74
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040
So what are we connecting we're connecting the method Prest which is built into a button right and we

75
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.180
know it's built into a button because I click a button and there's pressed I don't need the brackets

76
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.170
because I'm using this as a string.

77
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.370
What are we connecting We're connecting to this script.

78
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.590
Right so the button is going to call a method.

79
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.140
In this script we called branding method and then they call it on button pressed.

80
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.270
Finally with a pass parson argument and the arguments can be passed in an array.

81
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.230
This allows you to pass multiple arguments in one place were only passing one argument and the argument

82
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.780
of passing is button the text.

83
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay so this will work.

84
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.830
It'll take the text property from every child and pass that through.

85
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.070
Let's make sure were actually calling this so let's put a ready function in.

86
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.230
And when a connect buttons there connect buttons.

87
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.170
Correct so unready is going to connect.

88
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.900
If I run this right now it's going to crash and let me tell you why.

89
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.350
I've told you that when I take the text property from all the children of button great but one of these

90
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.950
children is not a button.

91
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.450
It's a texture rectangle and textured rectangles dont have a text field so if I run this itll say wait

92
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.650
what's this.

93
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.220
Right here invalid get indexed text on time.

94
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.970
Great.

95
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.160
So somehow I need to put an extra condition in here to say only do this if it's a button to do this

96
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.110
family use and if condition we've seen is OK right.

97
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:06.500
So if button which is the thing we're iterating of whatever iterating is button with a capital B.

98
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.880
But some of the capital B as a class is a..

99
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.310
Right.

100
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.790
So if button is Button admittedly that's a ridiculous piece of code but it makes me really happy.

101
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.690
If you want this to be a little bit less silly that we could call this child the fourth child in there

102
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.990
and then call this child and just change all the lowercase buttons to child.

103
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.160
That's more sensible.

104
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.700
I quite like button this button.

105
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.970
But this is a more sensible way of doing it.

106
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.190
This will no longer crash.

107
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.060
It won't do anything but it won't crash.

108
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:46.920
So function on and I have to write this exactly as I put it in text on button pressed and we have some

109
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.120
text coming at right we have a button information let's say let's call this what have you call this

110
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.730
button the button with press.

111
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.690
What button did we press.

112
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.620
OK.

113
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.760
I need to check if this is the okay button because the okay button is going to be kept as a string is

114
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.960
going to special the rest of these are going to be transferred from strings which Text property is up

115
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.670
from a string to an integer.

116
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.750
So let's take a look at that.

117
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.110
If Button equals equals Okay.

118
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.710
And I need to write that exactly as written on the label.

119
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.290
So capital O small k..

120
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.660
Because I'm matching strings and if the string doesn't match this won't work.

121
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.820
Oh good I have a brand new function when I call this check.

122
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:37.370
Yes right now we don't have a check guess function else so if it's not the okay but if it's another

123
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.960
button that you've just pressed we need to enter that information.

124
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:46.710
So let's make a new function called enter and we're going to pass the button value through.

125
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.190
But we need to turn it to an integer So let's cast that as an integer.

126
00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:00.060
So just to quickly review what we're doing the moment this pop up is ready the moment no pad is ready.

127
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.710
It's going to connect all the hot buttons to do that.

128
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.780
It's going to say okay go through every single child of button right.

129
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:13.560
If the child has a button then connect it with a signal called Prest which is a built in signal so we

130
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:20.460
do have to wonder what it does to this script to the method on button pressed and passed through the

131
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.280
text of the child so won't try connect light everything else connect.

132
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.300
When you press the button if that button says Okay then go check the guess.

133
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.620
If it isn't enter something.

134
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.330
So we have these two functions let's put them in let's do them in order so function.

135
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.220
Check.

136
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.120
Guess what we're doing is really checking us the combination.

137
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.320
For now I'm just compile a variable called combination in the number pad.

138
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.420
We're going to move an hour in the next few videos but just so we can check if this is working variable

139
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.030
combination.

140
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.430
And let's.

141
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.560
This is going to have to be an array and I'm going to put a completely random combination that no one

142
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.080
has ever used before.

143
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:12.250
For 1 5 which means we need a variable combination and we need a guess.

144
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.030
I'm going to tell it straight off the bat.

145
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.760
You're an array.

146
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.260
That way if I do anything before this is initialize it already knows.

147
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:25.440
I can say if the guess equals equals combination and remember equals equals because we are checking

148
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.880
a value we're not setting a value.

149
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:32.130
And for now a check works print correct.

150
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.320
Else OK what happens if we get the completion wrong.

151
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.830
I'm going to reset the lock so let's do a reset lock function which will make us second.

152
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.290
OK so that's my check guess.

153
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.870
If the combination is right we shouldn't print correct to the console and if it's not let's reset the

154
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.910
lock completely.

155
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.780
Next where we need to make is enter so let's make enter.

156
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.770
Now enter is going to have this button coming in.

157
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:01.870
So let's say button and this is an integer y is an integer because were putting the numbers into this

158
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.940
array and then comparing them directly so this guess array has to be identical for combination in order

159
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.570
for the correct message to come up.

160
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.950
So what I want to happen while I want to append the guess.

161
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.290
And what about appending it with button.

162
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.940
OK so we are now just putting up a screen.

163
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.920
It's a bit they get though.

164
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:24.190
Make it easy to see what were doing so every time you enter a button the guess array is going to get

165
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.980
bigger.

166
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.530
We don't just want the buttons to be entered we want to be to update the display so let's update the

167
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.790
display.

168
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.420
And you'll get a bunch of new functions haven't we.

169
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.920
So just keep track of what we're doing I need a reset lock so let's make a new function called Reset

170
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.340
lock

171
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.110
and you can leave it blank for now.

172
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.720
And one called up update display you're at the wrong tab level.

173
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.560
There we go.

174
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.940
Anyone could object display

175
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.020
cause I'm making a bunch of functions and I don't lose track of where they can make some more spacier

176
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.730
the way the first thing I do.

177
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.820
The path that displays a little bit longer me Hutaree Let's put them on very variable so on reading

178
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:17.310
variable display equals and I just grab the display great.

179
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.820
So just easily with displays will be a lot smaller.

180
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.920
A display dot will not change the value of the beeby Kotex of VB Kotex equals.

181
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.520
And what's this going to be.

182
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.680
Well it's going to be what ever the guess is.

183
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:41.180
However I need to put a string in here and the guess is not a string.

184
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.980
It's an array not just an array an array of integers.

185
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:51.150
I need to somehow cast an array of integers as a string to do that.

186
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:59.540
I need to use pull string array and just to show that means it's an array of strings can only contain

187
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.640
strings.

188
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.370
What pull strings or am I using I'm using guess.

189
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.280
Now the problem with this is this going to return it as an array.

190
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.500
I need to join your array into a single string and to do that I'm going to use join.

191
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:21.980
Which is Bell O I N join that we can join left click on that is part of a full string array and returns

192
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.380
a string with each element joined with the delimiter.

193
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.980
The delimiters whatever I specify.

194
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.550
But if I specify an empty string it'll put it with no delimiter.

195
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.120
One more thing I want to do.

196
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.610
Forgot to do even you.

197
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.560
I want this guess that what's in text right now to be in the centre.

198
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.680
Somebody is beeby code to Centra it.

199
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.570
If you're not familiar with the code I will link you to a page that shows you common Beebee code commands.

200
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.040
But to like this square bracket centre.

201
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.000
Plus Atlas going to big screen loads of us who were doing and then over on this side.

202
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.310
Going do the same thing with a slash.

203
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.330
So what they're selling it is until I tell you to stop centreing centre everything should I close that

204
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.790
tag out here with Slash centre and open and centre.

205
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.000
Whatever the guesses.

206
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.720
Great.

207
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.320
One more thing I want to do.

208
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:21.860
Once you've entered the sex I want you to check is the size of this array is the size of guess the same

209
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.510
as the combination.

210
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.900
And if it is check the guess.

211
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.420
Otherwise don't worry about it.

212
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.720
I'm going to do that and it's a go.

213
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.760
If Guess what the size right.

214
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.630
How many things are in disarray.

215
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:32.990
Equals.

216
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.700
Equals.

217
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:40.050
I'm checking a value on not setting values of two equals combination size

218
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.160
and what you to do it we want to check the guess.

219
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.400
And that's our error because I want to make taps.

220
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.470
If the guest size is the same as the combination size.

221
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.700
If there's the same amount of values in this array as there are in this one check if the combination

222
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.900
is correct and if it is we can print correct.

223
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.460
If it isn't it'll reset the lock.

224
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.380
I don't need any kind of else here because if it's not just stop doing what you're doing great.

225
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.720
Next thing I need to do is put a reset lock and what this is going to do is say click the display so

226
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.750
display clear as nice and easy.

227
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.820
If you're not sure what that is by the way it's exactly the same as saying display Beebee code text

228
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.590
equals.

229
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.790
Mean these are identical cleary's just each other right.

230
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.450
And let's do a guess dot.

231
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.350
Clear.

232
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.010
So just to clear the display and clear the guess.

233
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.620
Let's see if that works.

234
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.180
Run up to the doors make a big screen there go right up to the doors because we.

235
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.310
I through press a button.

236
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.170
Oh wait I can't see big screen.

237
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.360
You can't see my guesses.

238
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.330
Aha.

239
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:51.200
So if I type 8 5 8 Nothing happens for one 5 should get correct.

240
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:51.760
Great.

241
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.210
That's now working.

242
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.180
So we have the beginnings of a working display.

243
00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.570
One thing I would like to do is get this light to change the game so if I show the light right now I've

244
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.150
got a red light kind of an orange red.

245
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.620
I want it to be green.

246
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:13.520
If the combination is correct I'd like you to see if you can have that light change green if the combination

247
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.640
is correct.

248
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.880
Quick tip you might need to use a Titan node because otherwise we're not going to see it later on.

249
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.490
The reason is this if you get the combination correct we're going to hide the pop up display automatically.

250
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.640
So let's put time a.m. So pause the video seething at the light.

251
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.620
Come on.

252
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.350
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

253
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.390
OK.

254
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.440
Mac.

255
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.860
All right.

256
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.850
Couple of ways you could do this.

257
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.500
We could do something clever with modulate and all the rest of it.

258
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:47.380
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my number had seen and I'm on the ADD a time note.

259
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.610
And I want to make sure there's a set all one shot.

260
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.690
I don't want this repeating all the time.

261
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.440
And I connect this as a signal to nap.

262
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.580
It's all the way down the bottom there.

263
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.330
So let's bring it back up.

264
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.510
So were the combinations correct.

265
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.140
We're going to start this timer.

266
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.300
Timer.

267
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.270
Start though again.

268
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.890
We know a couple of other things to change the colour of this light so we got the timer starting and

269
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.510
at the end of it which cannot print correct I should probably put that as a string because it's not

270
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.400
a variable.

271
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.180
Now let's actually set this line.

272
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.170
I would put this in global So let's find the Global script.

273
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:39.840
And underneath the sound effects I make some images so I'll see red lights and green lights.

274
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.590
Cool.

275
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:48.460
Let's go into our graphics into our interface Happy angie's and find out red lights and green lights.

276
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.290
If you know what you rent and green by the way.

277
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:55.300
Pick any colour you like and you can pick these two because you know the traditional certain a copy

278
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.350
the red light in here.

279
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:07.130
I might do the same with greenlights a copy parve equals and the path has to be a string save that OK

280
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.160
it's no bad.

281
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.920
So before we start the combination I'm going to set the light.

282
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.190
You know what we should probably sell white as an on read it very well.

283
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:25.420
So let's do that on really variable light because there is just to make it easier to read.

284
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.310
We actually get to this code.

285
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.280
OK.

286
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.190
So light dot texture.

287
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:41.510
He calls when we say global dot red light global dot red light is a string.

288
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.660
This can't be a string so ready to cast it in a load to make it a file.

289
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.190
Also it does look very silly.

290
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.020
I don't want the red light.

291
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.110
I want the green light.

292
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.570
There it is under reset lock.

293
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.210
I'm not going to put it as red just to make it nice and clear.

294
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.270
So light.

295
00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.580
Texture.

296
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:05.040
He calls load global dot red light.

297
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.630
And let's see how that works.

298
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.210
Rubs the door.

299
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.500
That nice and small so we could see that message and hope gives me God.

300
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.860
I was about to do that.

301
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.370
Four one five light goes green.

302
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.270
One second later we are correct.

303
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.110
Awesome.

304
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.720
Final thing I want to do if this guest is correct is one hide this display.

305
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.630
So do down here.

306
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.930
It's got frint correct and it's going to hide.

307
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.630
Let's get rid of print correct for now.

308
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.530
So let's see how that works.

309
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.370
Four one five green light displays up boy.

310
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.530
The door is open because the guard opened it for me.

311
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.500
We didn't do that.

312
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.330
But we were up.

313
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.930
Oh I need to reset the lock as well don't I.

314
00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:02.780
So hide and reset lock.

315
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.880
I should probably reset the lock on already so let's do that as well.

316
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.990
And then I think we're in good shape.

317
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.880
Why am I doing that because when I round the door it's a test don't say test.

318
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.790
That's not going to make sense and story so up to the door and it says nothing for one five.

319
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.240
Awesome.

320
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.010
And that brings us to the end of this video.

321
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:29.310
In this video we've looked at four loops we've looked at wiring multiple child notes checking if a node

322
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.420
is a specific type.

323
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:37.350
If Button It's button and using pull string array and join to turn an array of integers into a single

324
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.120
string.

325
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.970
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
