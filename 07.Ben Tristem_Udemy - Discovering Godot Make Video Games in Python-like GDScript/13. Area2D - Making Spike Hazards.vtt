00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
Hello again you lovely God people in this video let's make the level a bit more dangerous.

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.850
We're going to make Spike hazards before we go any further let's figure out what a spike is going to

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.570
do and again I would like Spike to have several effects first off and the plague sort of spike.

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.980
They're going to lose a life.

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.590
So we know bunny has a limited amount of lives you will lose one when you touch a spike.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.580
Secondly you are going to react to the spike.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.520
Jump up.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.690
And thirdly you cannot play a sound effect.

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.960
We're not going to do all of these in one video.

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.570
What I would do though is get that started.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.790
Let's begin by creating a new scene for us.

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.120
And I'm going to make a note.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.240
That's an area to deep.

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.170
I'm not going to make some sort of physics body right and not make a rigid body or a static body.

15
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.660
I'm certainly not an MC kinematic body I don't want my spikes to be moving around.

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.970
I'm going to make an area area.

17
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.180
2d is for detection and 2D physics influence.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.370
This is really useful for us.

19
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.590
We don't need to have the physics engine constantly calculate what's happening.

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.130
We just want when the player enters this area do something.

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.230
First thing you notice is that area to deep throws up an error.

22
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.060
It wants a collision shape before the collision shape would probably need a sprite.

23
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.500
There's a sprite there.

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.440
Now we could make the Sprite the parent and the area too deep inside the Sprite.

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.450
But I like doing it this way.

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.960
I'm in graphics on the environment.

27
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.720
You'll find a group of spikes arctic's Spikes top and you are going into the textures.

28
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.420
There we go.

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.150
We now have a sprite in our area today so let's put in a collision show.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.160
And we could probably get away with a rectangle here.

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Would he think less give a shot rectangle.

32
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.160
No extents not scale.

33
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.340
If you try and scale it views these outside boxes that won't work so the inside circle box things make

34
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.780
that nice and big is that going to work.

35
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.280
Not quite as precise as I'd like.

36
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.240
You know what I'm going for a collision polygon shape.

37
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.300
Must do that instead.

38
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Zoom in a little and let's start making our collisions shapes so we make sure we create new polygons

39
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.100
from scratch.

40
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.980
And I'm just going to click here.

41
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.460
Here onto the corner here.

42
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.280
One more.

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.970
And back here.

44
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.300
Right.

45
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.740
And I can drag this point all round a little bit get it as close as I can.

46
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.750
Okay that's now the collision shape.

47
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.740
Now this is an area of physics body so this isn't going to stop the player walking in.

48
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.160
What this collision shape is going to do is say when the player crosses the collision shape they are

49
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.860
in this area.

50
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.030
So to put this another way it's not like I've just built solid spikes.

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.270
I've created a spike that you can walk through but when you walk into it it'll know.

52
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.870
Speaking of let's go into collision.

53
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.280
Make sure on the right layer we are not player and we're not touraine.

54
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.640
We have a new part in our physics masks got a project settings down to 2D physics and we're going to

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.410
call this enemies.

56
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.410
All of our enemies would be on the same thing.

57
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.720
So you are on the enemy's lair and you can interact with the player.

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.210
Let's also why.

59
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.100
First off let's rename this to Spike's top.

60
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.660
Say that in scenes.

61
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.980
Let's make sure that the player can interact with the spikes.

62
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.770
So open up play a scene make sure enemies are selected and the player can interact with the terrain

63
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.870
and the enemies.

64
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.280
Awesome can save that and close this scene.

65
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.950
I don't need it right now.

66
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.550
I'm going to hide the collision shape.

67
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.130
It's not that necessary is a few things we could do to customize this.

68
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.000
First off let's make sure we're always moving all the child pieces.

69
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.660
We don't just want to move the Sprite want to move the whole thing and a couple of things we could do

70
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.680
if we were dealing with sound effects you could change to a different audio buzz here so when you move

71
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.930
in here there's an underwater sound or something.

72
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.270
That's not what you want.

73
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.610
What I do want to get a sprite's and we'll go to visibility and under modulate you can change the colours

74
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.950
you want.

75
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.210
Bright Future spikes.

76
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.890
Do you want black spikes.

77
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.630
Do you like girs sort of pasley Green spikes.

78
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.990
I'm gonna see what white looks like and I'm going to instance one in my scene and a level one I'm insisting

79
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.480
under the player scenes a spike stop and watch you're over here so let's move you to here.

80
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.180
So my problem with white and the reason I bring up the modulation is well look.

81
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.350
I can't see it against the clouds.

82
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.330
That's not fair.

83
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.890
If we play this game now now the Spike isn't doing anything as that's fine.

84
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.080
But look there is no way the player could be expected to see that high speed.

85
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.890
So I changed the colours on this.

86
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.300
Let's go back in the spike scene.

87
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.560
I'm going to modulate this to black.

88
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.600
The other extreme.

89
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.190
There's nothing in the game that's black right now so that should stand out very quickly.

90
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.200
Doesn't really look like a spiky go for a Golden effect or something like that but it's a good start.

91
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.460
Let's actually make sure that you can make this jump.

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.160
Could make this one year.

93
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.030
OK.

94
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.220
So let's put some functionality into this.

95
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.870
Like what does it need to do.

96
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.620
The first thing needs to happen is the Spike needs to send a signal when the player enters Let's take

97
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.290
a look at them.

98
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.910
That's what we want is not Area entered or area exited because that means if something else that's an

99
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.510
area to D comes in then do something we want one of these body things.

100
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.510
If something enters that isn't an area if it's a physical body what will I do.

101
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.590
We're going to create a signal from this node to itself.

102
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.020
Now I did say lipsey can't do that.

103
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.180
I kind of lied a bit but here we are into the deep the truth so let's create a script and Spike's top

104
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.260
and we're going to make sure it's in scripts not in scenes.

105
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.340
Call it spike stops good name and create it.

106
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.220
Now let's make that note body entered can next to me.

107
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.660
And there it is.

108
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.040
Okay.

109
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.590
So what needs to happen here.

110
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.710
Well we could detect that the thing that enters has the name player but there's an issue with that one.

111
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.620
Well there's a few issues one every time anything enters we're going to have to run this right.

112
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.610
And check is that the player too.

113
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.830
What happens if we decide to rename player.

114
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.800
In fact this is an ongoing issue with a with a language like Julie's script is very hard to rename notes

115
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.340
because you have to rename the script in a couple of videos or maybe next video.

116
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.330
Pretty soon we're going to look at a way around that but for now let's just be aware that this can be

117
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.940
an issue.

118
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.600
So we could check every time something enters get its name and if it's the name do that on the other

119
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.270
hand we don't need to because we are using collision masks and the only thing that can interact with

120
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.120
this is the player.

121
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.310
In other words the only time this signal is going to trigger is when the player enters it.

122
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.890
Awesome.

123
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.610
So the only thing that can interact with this is the player.

124
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.420
I don't need any logic right.

125
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.980
I can just make it do with things so one really could do for now.

126
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.860
It just print.

127
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.060
Ouch.

128
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.870
So if you enter this thing just print out to display later on I'm going to start connecting things like

129
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.490
lives and damage and all the rest of it.

130
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.300
Now let's just make sure it works.

131
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.980
So that's re size this side actually see the console webs not that much.

132
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.440
And there we go.

133
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.390
So I can see the card so now when I run to the spike we'll see.

134
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.940
Ouch.

135
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.880
But I only see it once because it's only returning this information as I enter.

136
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.420
I can be in here for as long as I like.

137
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.590
I have to leave it and come back.

138
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.730
This is awesome because it means that the players are not going to be continually losing lives I'll

139
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.310
lose a lifeline touch the spike and then I have to leave then come back in.

140
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.630
Once we put in the jumper things when you touch this you'll go up in the air again.

141
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.040
The players are going to notice that this isn't a physicality That's going do that which is great.

142
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.650
That's exactly what you want.

143
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.410
I'd like you to spike a new level go through a level add some more spikes if you want.

144
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.100
You can just use the spikes top of just made and duplicate them across.

145
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.880
Or you could do the press as you've just done and use the other spikes that you'll find in the asset

146
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.990
packs or we have one that can hang at the underneath of platforms and we have a couple of single spikes

147
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.890
as well.

148
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.300
You can make them bigger smaller really go crazy then test your level right.

149
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.050
You can make your level as crazy as you like but if it's not physically possible to finish well that's

150
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.580
not the best games like pause the video puts some spikes in your level make it crazy and exciting and

151
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.170
dangerous thing.

152
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.590
Give bunny a challenge.

153
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.920
And then when you come back I'll show you my spikes.

154
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.330
Okay let's add some spikes I've got here a spikes top.

155
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.510
I'm going to create a variant of this scene.

156
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.590
So one I do is I'm going to make a new inherited scene.

157
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.770
I'm going to inherit from Spike's top and I'm going to call this.

158
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.490
Spike's bottom.

159
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.120
And I take the spikes bottom image and I'm going to put it in the Sprite.

160
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.050
Whereas come back but in the Sprite and now was gonna make sure my collision shape works nicely.

161
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.220
And move my collision polygon like so.

162
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.380
It's pretty good.

163
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.030
Awesome.

164
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280
All right.

165
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:53.650
Save that spikes bottom scene the next thing to do is under a level one I want to create a new note

166
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.610
and no too deep area today.

167
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.390
I lied.

168
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.080
I still see that I want to create a node to D.

169
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.160
There it is.

170
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.940
And I'm going to call this spikes

171
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.320
with capitals in the right place and I'm going to move my mice.

172
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.380
Spike top

173
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.970
in2 spikes.

174
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:22.680
This is going to be a container so I can just do that and I'm going to incense in Spike's bottom.

175
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.690
And let's do something scary over here.

176
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.140
How's that look.

177
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.600
Can you go in there a little closer.

178
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.200
Yes you can.

179
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.030
It's back stop that break.

180
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:43.340
And now I can just duplicate these and put them wherever I want so I can go here spec's topton and I

181
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.480
can make a separate spikes top on spikes bottom if I want.

182
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.810
But let's just add a few more speed this up as the men.

183
00:10:59.330 --> 00:10:59.950
Okay.

184
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.340
Back to real time Miller see how that plays.

185
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.950
Now I haven't got any damage actually in the game yet but let's see.

186
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.480
Nope can't make that jump so that's get rid of that one.

187
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.910
So let's select this one and leave this note because I can't physically make that jump.

188
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.910
I also put on a platform but let's not.

189
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.320
Yeah.

190
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.110
Much more like it.

191
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.050
Man can I get down here.

192
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.320
Yes.

193
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.000
Have I received any ouches.

194
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.870
Yes I have.

195
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.100
How did you that.

196
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.540
There's double check my collisions.

197
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.950
You are correct sir.

198
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.730
You're correct.

199
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.140
I should not have received any collisions in a witness like that again.

200
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.320
I'm going to resize the screen so I can see this is says ouch.

201
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.560
What are you for ouches.

202
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.800
Why have I got four ouches.

203
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:49.280
Well let's just double check that my tynemouth is on the right collision.

204
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.220
Ah look at that time it was on the wrong collision.

205
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.800
So let's get to our tile map and put them on touraine not on player.

206
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.370
And now we shouldn't get any ouches.

207
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.610
Categories there with no ouches.

208
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.710
So that's where we're jumped down here.

209
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.420
And that's all good.

210
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.260
If I jump up here.

211
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.970
Ouch.

212
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.980
Oh that's a scary look at Level.

213
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.350
OK.

214
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.210
I've got something that's kind of workable for now and makes more enemies and some coins we can start

215
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.750
really controlling where the player goes.

216
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.040
Great work.

217
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.580
And that brings us to the end of the video.

218
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.980
So in this video we've looked at how to create an area too deep in way.

219
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.310
You might want to use them.

220
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.150
We've looked at how to making new inherited scene.

221
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.200
Remember when I took these spikes top and turned into a spikes bottom.

222
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.820
I've just taken the same scene and tweaked a few things and we've looked at how you can check vehicle

223
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.800
isn't there.

224
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.010
And we've checked our collision there and masks by realizing that the spikes were interacting with the

225
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.640
touraine and fixing that.

226
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.040
So great work and I'll see you in the next video.
