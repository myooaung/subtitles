00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.470
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.720
Gloria's got people.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.480
We're now ready to start polishing the game with feature complete We've got everything we need.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.770
Now let's get rid of some irritating bugs in this video.

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.790
I want to get rid of the jump ahead Buck.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.130
What I mean by that jump that book you might have seen already Bill show they were backing gameless

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.900
lunch again.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.440
OK.

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.620
When bonnin wants to get to the jump had everything's fine.

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.110
Look what happens now.

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.820
Jump ahead is triggered then go through it.

12
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.370
This is fine.

13
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.300
This is not what's happening.

14
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.570
Well let's look at the code.

15
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.350
When ingame they were Mplayer around as close all these things I don't need.

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.090
We have a lot of them are using controlled W to do this APC close all the scraps except for player.

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.690
OK.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.730
Nice.

19
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.880
If we look at the full function I'm sure.

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.940
Click here to get to what was the actual logic.

21
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.220
If you're on the floor or you're on the ceiling do not fall or jump so you motion.

22
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.600
Why is zero if you're on the floor.

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.060
If on the ceiling.

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.180
Else motion why is gravity times Delta.

25
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.150
The downside of fat is if I'm on the floor.

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.900
My motion why is zero.

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.370
Why does that matter.

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.770
Because that is going to get triggered every frame and boost is going to get triggered once and both

29
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.810
are setting my motion.

30
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.520
Why to jump speed times boost.

31
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.010
This is going to be an issue in a one specific circumstance which unfortunately is happening quite a

32
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.550
lot here.

33
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.170
I'm sure I mean here's bunny.

34
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.930
Bunny teeth.

35
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.400
OK.

36
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.170
Here's bunny bunny is forming while not on the floor so as long as you're not on floor.

37
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.630
The motion equals zero motion y equals zero.

38
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.780
Bunny.

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.220
And as a jump at lest you jump ahead in green.

40
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.230
I know I shouldn't mix green in red.

41
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.950
If you have that green red colourblindness what's it called due to anomaly.

42
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.770
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.590
Wrong colour choice.

44
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.830
But let's stick with it for now.

45
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.930
What happens if Bunny lands here.

46
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160
One glance here Bunny goes up.

47
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.680
What happens if Bunny lands here so fast the bunny actually lands through the object and onto the floor.

48
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.900
What's going to happen if Bunny is on floor.

49
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.910
Therefore motion y equal zero is going to get triggered every frame.

50
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.890
The Boost pad is going to trigger.

51
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.950
There's a bunny here.

52
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.450
Send the signal but he's going receive the signal.

53
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.520
I should jump up.

54
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.130
Oh I shouldn't.

55
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.630
I'm on the floor and nothing will happen.

56
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.960
Now there's a couple of solutions we could come up with.

57
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.940
We could do something clever with the ifs.

58
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.670
If you're on the floor and you haven't just received a signal recently but there's an easier way.

59
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.420
Let's limit the full speed to limit the full speed.

60
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.680
Well I'm going to do is use clamp.

61
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.880
So first thing to do set in motion.

62
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.530
Why to a new value my new value is going to be a clone.

63
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.130
What is time do.

64
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.950
It returns a value between a minimum and a maximum.

65
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.030
So if we look at the documentation of clamp here it is.

66
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.970
You can do it either way round but very quickly it's going to go like this motion dot Y.

67
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.940
That's the value returning.

68
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.630
So motion not why is the current motion not why.

69
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.760
Between the minimum and the maximum.

70
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.180
Remember negative.

71
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.220
Why is up so that is going to be my jump speed.

72
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.830
She's not my jumps but if that's my jump speed you can never go faster jumps as can be my jumps speed

73
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.200
times my jumpers so let's do that in brackets.

74
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.130
Jump speed multiplied by jump.

75
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.420
Boost.

76
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.480
No only the max value was the max value.

77
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.820
Actually I'm going to keep it simple.

78
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.310
I'm going to say you can't go far faster down than you would normally go up.

79
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.740
So my maximum value is going to be negative jumps speed.

80
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.900
Why negative because jumps speed is already a negative value so a negative of a negative is a positive

81
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.960
which means that you're positive y is going to be your maximum value.

82
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.980
I gave Bernie shanachie up to sneak past that.

83
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.710
Why the club that was working and it's still working.

84
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.030
And this should work indefinitely until it cloud ruins our day.

85
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.280
Look at that.

86
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.410
My hands off the keyboard and boost pad is working just fine so all I have done is we've made the max

87
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.090
more full speed the same as the jobs so jumping and falling is now a kind of value.

88
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.080
So a nice simple fix in this video.

89
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.080
We've looked at how to use clamp to limit value so I make sure it's between a minimum and a maximum.

90
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.830
We've had to do some slightly complicated things because the way that the y value works and got o is

91
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.150
different to how it works in my head.

92
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.910
But that's okay.

93
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.110
We've got a nice fix start going so great work and I'll see you in the next video.
