00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.390
Welcome back you wonderful God.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.210
People in this video are going to polish up high slices because we are almost feature complete.

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.620
There's a couple of things we can add after that.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.450
But before we get there we want to put some quality of life things in.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.220
First I want music playing throughout the game and I want it playing no matter what scene we're in if

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.750
we add multiple levels or we have a victory screen or game over screen which if you're reading ahead

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.130
you know we're going to have let's have the music playing uninterrupted.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.780
Second let's have a victory screen so if the player wins they can play again.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.720
They can see they win.

10
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.580
They can play again.

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.570
Alisyn of game over screen we show why game over screen is important right now if I play high my sis.

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.860
And I pick up this briefcase and I walk over here I can be seen and I make a mistake.

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.780
That's oversuspicious.

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.300
I drop out of game because our script is set to quit the game.

15
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.530
That's kind of graceless Isn't it very abrupt.

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.990
Let's actually give a player notification the game's over.

17
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.600
Would you like to play again or would you like to quit.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.190
Well let's start with music mogul a brand new scene and the root node is going to be an audio stream

19
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.270
player not only a string player to be not only a string player 3D.

20
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.830
Why.

21
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.160
Because audio stream was just going to play audio it doesn't matter where the the audio stream player

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.270
is located on the map.

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.430
It's just going to play it or his dream play to be in 3D have positional information.

24
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.930
So if I pick the two key player and the node is here.

25
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.640
My character is here God will figure out where the sound is in relation to my player and play it from

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.410
those speakers.

27
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.850
The same thing will happen with 3D.

28
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.090
Don't want that.

29
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.220
So let's pick all year string player.

30
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.710
OK let's pick some music.

31
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.960
Well we have some is going to sound effects music.

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.590
I'm going to drag stealth in the woods so g.g. to my stream there when here it just hit playing.

33
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.040
Yes very atmospheric.

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.200
OK.

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.080
Before going further let's set it to auto apply rename this node to bga music background music.

36
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:21.140
I call it music be doing music is oddly cryptic and save the scene and the scenes music done right.

37
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.160
So we now have a scene that has audio stream player that plays music automatically and does nothing

38
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.600
else.

39
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.060
How do we get that playing in the game and how do we make sure it keeps playing no matter what scene

40
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.450
we're in.

41
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.370
Well the solution here is autoloader going to make this a singleton.

42
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.700
A project settings and a go to autoloader.

43
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.740
Right now we've got a global script so right here global GDP is loaded as a singleton but we can load

44
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.480
a scene.

45
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.600
It doesn't have to be a script in fact the scene doesn't have to contain a script.

46
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.460
If we find our music scene so scenes music an ad that's.

47
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.860
When we play our game.

48
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.680
We have some very MS news and it a little bit loud but ildefonso.

49
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.060
Okay.

50
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.930
Music is done and excellent do a move this briefcase other way.

51
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.850
That's way too easy.

52
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.780
Let's move you to over here somewhere.

53
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.300
Let's move on and just drag you.

54
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.770
OK.

55
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.140
Next thing wanna do is make a game over scream.

56
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.910
So let's add a new scene and I'm gonna use a canvas item as my lair and that just tells it OK.

57
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.990
I'm just drawing on alair as a child of kansler.

58
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.500
I'm going to add centre contain whatever is in here will be centred as well as it can be on the screen

59
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.220
which is what I want.

60
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.700
I want me a menu to shop in the middle of the screen.

61
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.950
Let's anchor that as a full rect So it's going to anchor to all corners.

62
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.980
And let's put it on full rect itself.

63
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.930
So now the set extenet takes up the entire screen.

64
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.860
Whatever the child is will be sent.

65
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:18.360
And while we're at it in a renamed canvas layer 2 game over below the screen or right outside the container

66
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.870
is done.

67
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:28.410
Let's add in a menu only has a nine patch wrecked and are going to go into graphics interface kinji

68
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.100
and scroll down to get the metal panels.

69
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.450
I'm going to pick one of the metal panels.

70
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.900
I'm feeling like just the standard metal panel which has little screws in the corner.

71
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.500
You could also pick the plate that has no screws but I think these are screws and there it is and it's

72
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.690
way small.

73
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.500
That's fine.

74
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.740
Now get a rectangle and want to give it a size you have size us at zero.

75
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.720
Not a good size.

76
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.700
How do you feel about 400 by 300.

77
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.010
Pretty good.

78
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.930
However when I move on screen it comes back because I should set minimum size of 400 by 300 there.

79
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.120
And it sent it save the scene before I go any further.

80
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.380
All right.

81
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.300
It's blurry.

82
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.130
Someone give it some patch margins.

83
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.880
How do you feel about 12 pixels in each direction.

84
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.970
I feel pretty good about that so well because

85
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.890
we have some well maintained little screws in the corner and a nice panel.

86
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.860
So within this I'm going to add a V box container.

87
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.930
So the first I'll be at the top the next on the Neith.

88
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.550
Let's make this full rack.

89
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.920
So it takes up the entire position and let's put some margins in I'll say 20 on each side.

90
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.180
Nicked 20 from the right 20 from the top and negative 20 from the bottom.

91
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.330
Great.

92
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.040
We may end up making this a slightly different size but that's looking pretty good for now.

93
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.730
OK.

94
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.900
So we have a bunch of elements that right now don't do anything.

95
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.600
I'm also by the way going to align this to the centre.

96
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.590
Let's put a label as a child and in the tax right.

97
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.030
Game over.

98
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.560
And right now have tiny white font on grey and I've also put game over with raynham capital on the V.

99
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.960
Now let's fix that by loading the stylin slowly back up to centre container because that's the first

100
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.300
green node of the first container node.

101
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.500
So every child of that will inherit the thing.

102
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.250
Some go to theme load theme and there it is.

103
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.530
Okay better.

104
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.780
But now I have white on break and that's no good at all.

105
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.140
So one thing to do is go to a label and um override some of the settings.

106
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.480
Now it'll keep all the settings we don't overwrite.

107
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.390
So for instance if I go to custom colours and select a black font colour it's going to keep everything

108
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.020
else.

109
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.530
That's a good start.

110
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.720
I think it might actually change the font though.

111
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.850
So let's go to custom fonts and pick new dynamic font.

112
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.550
Now we click on the font first need to load the font in.

113
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:07.890
So let's go to font from data and load the graphics interface fonts on a pic Convector future.

114
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.820
Still can't see it because the settings have set size zero.

115
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.490
That's okay.

116
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.090
A strike 30.

117
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.250
That is pretty good.

118
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.920
Alright I want this sentence.

119
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.950
Just click on label right the top here says the line centre.

120
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.860
Good.

121
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.410
Now let's put a button.

122
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.090
It's when we go back to Velux container and add a new child which is going to be a button and that button

123
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.780
will go underneath.

124
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.290
And right now it's filling the space and I want to fill the space.

125
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.390
So let's go back to size flags.

126
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.090
Here we go.

127
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.890
Adam Scott until Phil but I am sick.

128
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.460
Expand search and be as big as it needs to be.

129
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.490
And inside I'm going to write this was going to be try again.

130
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:59.290
He could write restart do over whatever state was done and duplicate it which on the windows as control

131
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.120
d n and this button.

132
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.860
I'm jealous right.

133
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.330
Quit.

134
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.470
Let's rename these buttons.

135
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.920
Try again and quit.

136
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.470
OK.

137
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.300
Now these buttons are recycle themselves.

138
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.700
I really want that so let's give them a minimum size.

139
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.390
Try again under rect there is minimum size.

140
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:31.900
Say we think 125 looks pretty good by 30.

141
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.910
Awesome.

142
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.330
And I'm going to copy that down to quit so minimum size on quit.

143
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.070
125 by 30.

144
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.070
These two aren't centred which is a little annoying to fix that.

145
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.530
You have to do a little bit of work around under the box container and add a Santa container and it

146
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.770
will drag quit into it.

147
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.230
I will do the same thing try again.

148
00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.890
So child said to contain I am a drag self-contained in there.

149
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.640
You notice that quit and try again.

150
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.520
Now switch places.

151
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.490
But I can drag them into the order I want.

152
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.940
Okay now I'm thinking that my nine patch rectangle is too big so let's change the size on that minimum

153
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.620
size has four hundred three hundred.

154
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.160
How about 300 by 250.

155
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.310
I feel a bit better about that how I feel about 250 but 250.

156
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.560
That's too small.

157
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.310
I get 3 out of my 300 is good enough for me.

158
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.750
Feel free to add a like let's give this a script out and save what we've got so far.

159
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.470
I'm going to close this is going to get in the way and I make a new script for game over screen and

160
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.550
I'm going to put this in the script folder.

161
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.320
As you might expect but I'm just going to call it game over.

162
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.100
OK.

163
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.280
Now let's connect.

164
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.080
I'll try again and quit buttons some of the kit.

165
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:04.910
Click on try and get a node on pressed the Connect for that to game over screen and quit gonna do the

166
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.420
exact same thing.

167
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.860
So what do we want to happen on trying impress.

168
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.600
I want to let's get these scenes.

169
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.300
Levels.

170
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.920
Well what to do with load level 1.

171
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:28.380
So what I want to do is I want to go get a tree change sequence and I'm sure a drag level one into here

172
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:36.960
and close the bracket and quit is going to get tree dropped quite like a test that I'm just going to

173
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.070
run this scene.

174
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.620
We're on the scene because right now this isn't connected to the rest of the game.

175
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.010
There's no way of getting to the scene.

176
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.100
So let's test it.

177
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.560
And news is already playing our press try again wearing game in the music hasn't missed a beat.

178
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.620
Mike was awesome.

179
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.730
Okay so now we have to do is connect this scene now.

180
00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:01.620
We're running quit on end game an end game is actually in suspiciously to school Scripps and scroll

181
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.370
down to suspicion meet.

182
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.320
There it is.

183
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.070
Scroll down.

184
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.490
There it is.

185
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.970
End Game right here.

186
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.480
So instead of get tree quit.

187
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.840
What I really want is that game over so I'm going to just drag it in here.

188
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.440
I could put this in global.

189
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.810
Honestly I don't really want to I'm going to make it nice and simple.

190
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.690
So change scene

191
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.790
and drag that in.

192
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.370
Okay let's see if that works.

193
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.440
It's gonna get myself into trouble.

194
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.530
I'm in trouble.

195
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.380
Restart of the game.

196
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.880
Let's see if quit works awesome.

197
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.540
Everything went great.

198
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.720
Which brings me to the challenge.

199
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.360
I'd like you to take what we've done and add a victory screen now as a quick hint.

200
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.100
We've done most of the work we need to do here.

201
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.790
You could just make a new inherited seeing some positive to see what you can do about the new victory

202
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.940
screen and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

203
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.630
And we're back.

204
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.910
Alright so I want to make a new inherited scenes when I get a scene.

205
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.000
New inherited and I need to pick my bases.

206
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.740
Where am I getting from.

207
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.600
I'm starting from Game over sorry and what I do it's good to leave you.

208
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.670
When I renamed this victory spring

209
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.290
and save this scene.

210
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:41.640
Now I just want change this label right so I'm going to go to note instead of game over and say mission

211
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.880
accomplished.

212
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.190
Or you win.

213
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.490
Actually mission accomplished way too big.

214
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:57.740
Go back to how it was a type of victory lap which I've put at random space into.

215
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.790
There is victory.

216
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.330
Are you good right.

217
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:00.960
You win.

218
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.790
Mission accomplished.

219
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.760
Number four is mission accomplished.

220
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.290
You might want to make this font smaller.

221
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.400
Try again and quit or actually find what I need.

222
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.230
OK.

223
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.220
And that's it.

224
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.610
All I need to do now is connect it.

225
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.520
And where does that happen.

226
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.980
That happens on exit detection.

227
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.930
So let's get the scripts and find it.

228
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.240
And instead of print you have a briefcase.

229
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.310
I actually get three dot change seen.

230
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.220
Let's go grab the scene do the victory.

231
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.890
There it is.

232
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.010
You might be wondering why though why am I now using string references when we set up a global.

233
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.330
It is to show you the multiple ways of doing this.

234
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.350
If you're somebody who really dislikes using string referencing you could put this in global and loaded

235
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.220
in that way.

236
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.070
Personally I don't mind string referencing.

237
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.120
And for me this is easier.

238
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.670
But now I've looked at both ways of doing this and this should be everything we need.

239
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.190
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video we looked at how confused are seen as a singleton

240
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.540
so it doesn't just have to be a script.

241
00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.610
We can also use a scene with nodes that don't require any script and with polish up the game with the

242
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.330
game over screen and a victory screen.

243
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.950
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
