1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,630
Hello again, you superb got to people in this video, we're going to start adding a gooey we're going

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,200
to look at how to use Tudi in 3D.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,280
Now, this is one of the cool things about got it right.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,230
It has actual 2D and 3D rendering and you can layer them on top of each other.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,300
So in some engines, if you want to do that, you have to make a plane and it floats in 3D, but you

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,060
lock it so it looks like INTUITY and got a you can just have 2D and 3D elements to do that wouldn't

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,110
create new scene and are custom node is going to be a canvas layer.

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,160
And all this is, is just a layer on the camera, layer on the canvas.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,460
So in that let's make a nine patch rectangle nine patch there.

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,740
And you can see of what you got selected on the graphics on the interface.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,850
We've got banner hanging.

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,960
That's gonna be my texture.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,650
Now, this is too small.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,440
When it erect aluminum, it is less than big.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,210
What do you think about was my super size with about a thousand pixels on the X?

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,020
Is that too much?

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,950
I quite like it.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,670
Maybe it's too much.

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,150
I could do a thousand for now and 120 feels good.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,070
And we want our patch margins.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,980
So like here you go with 12 hotlist, 12 feet.

22
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,050
I think it might be a bit low on this.

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,020
Let's find out.

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,600
Well, that's not bad, is it?

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,990
Not quite.

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,440
They're still missing something so high.

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,300
How about 20?

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,870
Yeah, I think that's perfect.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,380
OK.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,630
So here is our banner.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,530
Nicole Banner.

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,640
And that's what else goes on.

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,660
OK.

34
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,340
So I'm to save this on a brand new folder called Gooey.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,110
And want to call it gooey before any further, let's see how that actually works in the game.

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:41,970
You know what?

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,810
I need to actually lay this, don't I?

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:50,260
So let's put you anchored to the top center, because that's what it does position it takes.

39
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,360
And, yeah, that looks pretty good.

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,350
And actually, let's do the layout to the top center as well.

41
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,190
So send a top.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,540
Awesome.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,320
OK.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,330
Let's see how that looks.

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,390
I gonna go in the game and I'm an instance in the Gooey.

46
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,760
OK.

47
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,730
Now, you'll notice I can't see here because we're in 3D view, like a press tutee, if you'd like to

48
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:09,940
see it.

49
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,880
But look what happens when we actually play the game.

50
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,310
Here's Albanna, right?

51
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,490
And it takes up the right amount of space.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
That's looking pretty good.

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,500
Now we can make it smaller, we could play around with it, but I'm pretty happy with that.

54
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,690
So all we've done is we've told it there's a canvas layer here, another rendering layer.

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,950
And in this case, we just want Tudi information on it so we can have both the same time.

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,670
All right.

57
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,210
At this point, I want to play around a little bit.

58
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,470
So I've got this nice font from Kennie that I want to use.

59
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,490
I'm going to put in each box container and I can make it look very pretty.

60
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,130
So let's start with our each box container, which I will put as a child of the matter.

61
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,470
Each box container ships are just.

62
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,100
And let's see, this wants to be a full rectangle.

63
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,270
And I think it can lead to margins, isn't it?

64
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm gonna stick with 20, see how that feels.

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
See me minus 20.

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,570
Minus 20.

67
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,390
Okay.

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,040
Looking good.

69
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,210
Now, we don't have a theme, and we should probably make one because I want to use these fonts.

70
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,620
We probably will be using them in other places as well.

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,430
Let's make a new thing.

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,320
And let's in our default font up sites like this default font.

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,130
So new dynamic font, no new dynamic font.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,490
There it is.

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,020
And let's see, we've got a fund, which I'm Lodin.

76
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,430
France can be bold and we need a good size for this, don't we?

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
So let's say 40.

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,970
Kate is big and chunky.

79
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,420
I like it.

80
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,990
Let's put on the filter and the Mitt maps make it nice and rounded.

81
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,970
And that actually feels really good.

82
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,580
That's gonna be very big for buttons, but I'm going for that feel.

83
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,770
Right.

84
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,330
Big, blocky kind of children's blocks, kind of a game.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,460
So let's put in some labels.

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,670
I'm going to put in three labels as a child of each box container.

87
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,610
So new label and this just duplicate that twice.

88
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,260
OK, so we have three labels in here.

89
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,370
And the second one I'm in, right?

90
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,130
Dude, kick about.

91
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,790
It's got to line to the center, and that's looking pretty good.

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,940
And I need the actual each box content on the center as well.

93
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,820
So click on the box container and can sense of that.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,420
And there we go.

95
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,230
OK.

96
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,960
So that is going to be my label.

97
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,620
I'm sure to call it a consulate label and call it title.

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,270
OK.

99
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,310
So this one one cool player, one school and this one I'm gonna call player to school.

100
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,080
Boop.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,830
That's pretty good.

102
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,090
Now, let's actually put these in as zero and zero.

103
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,640
Now, I do want to say zero cube do give about zero.

104
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,750
We need to split it up.

105
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,570
So it's got a plus container custom, Constance.

106
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,760
And I'm going to just increase a custom separation.

107
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,650
Separation.

108
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,590
Custom separation.

109
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,300
30 pixels feels a be good.

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,550
We could go a little higher, 40 maybe.

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,300
And I don't know how high we want the game to go.

112
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,760
I feel like three goals should reset the game.

113
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,780
But maybe you want higher.

114
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,030
In which case, you could go to your score and make sure that the right score aligns to the right and

115
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,680
the left hand score like the left.

116
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm thinking that's pretty solid.

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
And that is our basic goal.

118
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,620
Let's see how that looks in game.

119
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,800
Clearly is not working yet, but yeah.

120
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,490
Feels good to have the background in.

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,410
We move it down a bit if we wanted to.

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,620
But look, it's it's hanging.

123
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:30,930
Right.

124
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,510
Perfect.

125
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,180
Let's make it actually work to do that.

126
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,280
I need to give the Gooey was rename it Gary.

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,950
Whoops, not mine, I guess, a cool you UI graphic user interface.

128
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,840
Yeah, let's give it a script.

129
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,090
Obviously this empty template.

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,010
All right.

131
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,480
We are going to call this from the level itself, and the main thing we want is to update the scores

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,220
as we get a thing called update score.

133
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,890
And we need to know two things here, right?

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,020
We need to know which players score has gone up.

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,340
And what is the new school?

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's do that.

137
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,080
Let's say we have an argument call play an argument called school.

138
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,300
We don't really need to track what the score was before.

139
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,270
We're just replacing the information.

140
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,340
Okay.

141
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,010
We need the label.

142
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,760
So let's make a new variable and call it a school label.

143
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,930
And here we're going to use the same trick we did earlier with passing in the string, but I can't use

144
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,820
dollar to do that.

145
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,070
Which looks like that.

146
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,670
And then I do this.

147
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,710
It's going to cause errors.

148
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,440
It doesn't know that that exists.

149
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,240
She's gonna say there's no such there's no such note here.

150
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,140
So instead of using the shortcut dollar, remember, Dollar is alias Solnik.

151
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,070
Look for an alias.

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,470
Forget node, which means get node, because if we use get node, we have to put a string.

153
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,820
Right, a node path as a string.

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,280
So here I can drag in my play one score into the script.

155
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,040
I was gonna do that and drag it in.

156
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:03,940
Huh.

157
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,720
And instead of one I'm going to go for Santa Gests.

158
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,090
Now I can go percentage play.

159
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,520
So you gonna modula that in.

160
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,960
So we're gonna get play one or two from the from the main game function and it's gonna replace player

161
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,470
with that.

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,880
I also noticed that these.

163
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,170
How in the wrong place?

164
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,460
And that's looking pretty good.

165
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,050
OK.

166
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,170
Now let's update it.

167
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,570
Well, going to school level, which we've just defined, and we know which player it is because that's

168
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,040
what we've just looked up through the argument.

169
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,800
Now I'm going to change the text property and it's going to be the string or whatever the new score

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:39,890
is.

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Now, we have to change it to a string because we using a label.

172
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,200
Right.

173
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,690
So the score is actually an integer.

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
That's how it's held in memory.

175
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,780
But we're gonna be changing it to a string.

176
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,700
And that should work fine.

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,270
Now, we have to do is actually wire it into the main game.

178
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,880
That's got a little.

179
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,840
And in our main game script, we've already got something here that can detect when a goal is being

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,060
entered.

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,660
So we'll start the timer and we're going to update the score.

182
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,520
Let's make a brand new functional update school.

183
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,030
And update school just needs the goal I.D. They're going to bring that in.

184
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,920
Goal I.D..

185
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,570
We need to know which goal has detected the ball.

186
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,740
Now, we don't really care which player kicked it last because you can score goals.

187
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,580
So that should work fine.

188
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:20,960
So let's go.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Function update school.

190
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,850
We should not have a capital s. and it takes this argument here.

191
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,730
I'm a good player, remember, it doesn't really matter what the argument was called when it passed.

192
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,140
It just matters the order.

193
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,550
So there is an argument in position zero in here which is referring to it as player.

194
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,420
It doesn't really matter.

195
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,790
I could call this king, Bob, but I'm not going to, especially as King Bob is two words.

196
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,230
So when they call that player, you could call it go idea if you want.

197
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,530
But updating the school for the player makes more logical sense to me.

198
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,330
OK.

199
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,440
So we need a variable to know.

200
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,350
The new score is so new score.

201
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,780
Now, for this to work, we need to actually holding the score in memory.

202
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,070
So we need to make an instant variable.

203
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,150
So it's a new variable.

204
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,200
Michael's player.

205
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,080
One on a score score equals zero.

206
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,770
Duplicate that.

207
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,740
Now just change that, to play.

208
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,320
To score.

209
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,330
OK, so back to update school, OK?

210
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,940
So the next thing to do is to actually figure out who's scores gone up.

211
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,900
So if this player is one update, this score, if it's to up to this, I could use an if else.

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,950
I think I want to use a match which works in very similar ways.

213
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,540
A match player.

214
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,820
OK, so if player is one.

215
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,660
Then player one school, player one school.

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
There it is, goes up by one.

217
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,340
And new school.

218
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,750
Is equal to play player one school.

219
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,310
And I asked you the same exact thing again with two.

220
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:09,920
So if we've matched player to be the integer two, then player to score goes up by one.

221
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,020
Just make that neater.

222
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,690
And the new score.

223
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,390
Is equal to player to score.

224
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,010
All right.

225
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,950
So we're now tracking the memory now.

226
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,450
Let's actually pass that through.

227
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,990
We've called this function so we know someone has scored so we can go back.

228
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,710
This indentation level and all I need to do is go to the gooey.

229
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,170
Which isn't actually called Gleeks, I renamed it afterwards, isn't it?

230
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:37,890
Didn't I?

231
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,180
So let's rename you.

232
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:43,980
There we go.

233
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,190
So.

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,220
Let's go to the guri and we want to call the function update score.

235
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,530
Now we need two things, right?

236
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,510
We need the player and we need the new school.

237
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,200
And if I've done this right, and I really hope I have and I press play, which I've just done, I can

238
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,190
over here move the blue, play out the way, kick the ball and it crashes.

239
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,130
And that's because I've done a silly thing.

240
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,820
I put the bracket here, my bad black bracket should be there.

241
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,080
So I get my kidney function.

242
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,550
I need to make sure that I don't actually stop getting that out until I've brought in that player.

243
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,960
And that should work just fine.

244
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,890
Let's redo that.

245
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,470
And now I'm with the blue player.

246
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,620
Score a goal and the number goes up by one and a few seconds later that at that.

247
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,560
Boom.

248
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,220
Yep.

249
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,000
We now have a working school system.

250
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's just check the blues.

251
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,180
The blue-black do the same thing on a move.

252
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,250
You score a goal looking good and that is our working score system.

253
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,680
Now, the moment this will just take up forever and we don't yet have any fancy effects that are going

254
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,860
to happen when you score a goal.

255
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,780
But I think that's really good progress.

256
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,220
So excellent luck.

257
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,540
And I'll see you in the next video.
