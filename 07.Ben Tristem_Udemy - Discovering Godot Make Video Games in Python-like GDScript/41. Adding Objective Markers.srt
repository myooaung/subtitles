00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,170
Hello again you lovely God.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,890
People in this video will continue your tutorial.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,780
We're going to add objective markers.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,050
We're going to give the player a visual marker that's going to move to the next position when it's needed

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,400
to.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,880
OK.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,860
So let's go into God.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,540
And on the do go to scenes levels and I open the tutorial when levels which are up there it is.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,670
And you'll notice I've removed those lights I put in I wasn't really feeling those lights.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,500
In fact I've made a new light.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,600
So I'm like a light hoodie and I've uploaded a brand new PFG I made it just a simple thing I made in

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,110
GIMP.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,110
It's this radio pangia right here.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,670
I'm going to copy that and I've put this as a download.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,960
You can download it as part of this leches resources or you can make your own.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,890
It's pretty easy.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,200
Where there is more to go show and farm manager got paste in there and got a will import imported.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,050
Great.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,790
So now I'm just going to drop that.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,610
As the texture.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,250
And there it is as the tax year as enable shadows and move the whole light 2D issues and then move on

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,310
here to the right place and look at that.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,900
We have a beautiful light.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,670
Now it's up to you whether or not you are disable shadows.

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,170
I won't leave shadows on if he do disable shadows.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,820
It's going to go through the walls and a really want.

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,280
Another thing you could do is you can make this particular player not cast a shadow.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,720
Which to do that you would right click on a player go to Edit of all children.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,240
And under light occluding to be sure to move him to a different coalition mask.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,910
There is another player won't cast shadows but the background Well OK.

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,350
So that's one option we can do.

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,250
I'm not going to do that.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,880
I do want to as shadows as such a major part of our game play.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,720
The play should really get used to it and I make this none.

35
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,090
Ed wants to make this nice and tidy.

36
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,110
Nothing we could do I'm going to add a brand new like note in certain of the like tourie.

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,560
We could use this torch.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,360
In fact I've put this real wrong place have I seen a move that too light maps that's where there should

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,980
be.

40
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,420
And let's go to all that much.

41
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,640
Very much better.

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,820
I could just drag in this torch map.

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,060
So like to see texture torture map.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,670
Yeah.

45
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,360
Did you do transform.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,370
Scale zero point two five zero point five.

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,950
Smalls point five point five.

48
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,230
And this gives some shadows.

49
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,870
And with this one point this at the door.

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,590
And just do a little bit rotation before I rotate this.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,700
Actually remember we are casting from the centre not from the edge I should use the offset so my offset

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,750
is going to be 320 is that right.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,390
Yes.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,390
And move that.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,960
Now the shadow will cast here where the light is logically emanating from and that makes a lot more

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,090
sense to me.

57
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,640
And we've highlighted the door.

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,610
So now the player will be able to see the door.

59
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,730
So if I just play the scene.

60
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,980
Much better to have a nice dramatic light here.

61
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,410
And here now an argument could be made for removing the light completely because this is a weird effect.

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,150
So it is up to you if you want to remove the shadow.

63
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,550
That's how you do it.

64
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,030
But looking good.

65
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,190
All right.

66
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,190
Let's get into making some objectives.

67
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,000
The first thing to do is I'm going to make a lot of use of position to day.

68
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,490
I have a brand new node to make a node.

69
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,770
You know on a stick to no two weeks I've been doing it for this entire section and I'm gonna call this

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,470
objective marker.

71
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,030
Objective markers that we call objective markers.

72
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,960
The first chart of this is going to be a position to date.

73
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,210
And I'm going to move the position to Dee right here.

74
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,700
I want the player to get into this room and that's going be their first objective.

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,060
Let's switch off vision for now the players are going to get into here as their first objective.

76
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,840
So this is well going to point to well what's going to be pointing.

77
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,650
Good questions.

78
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,100
Back to tutorial and work at a sprite.

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,050
And now let's head to graphics and into interface.

80
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,930
We've got some we haven't been using on AP engy.

81
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,450
Scroll down to all these nice mouse icons.

82
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,850
Now I'm going to use this cross-hair.

83
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,040
You could use a hand.

84
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,160
You could use ways arrows.

85
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,330
Use whatever you feel fits best for your game.

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,100
So I'm gonna make my cross-hair bulloo outline.

87
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,830
So I got my sprite here and I went and changed the vision mode Denyer has been reset the script anyway

88
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,400
so I'm going to go back to vision mode and click on this reset.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,040
This is a reset it back to its default so that's fine.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,500
OK.

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,260
This Sprite and some blue bar.

92
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,090
It's got to be hard to see in the dark rooms so let's give it its own lights source so what's going

93
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,580
on light too deep.

94
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,370
And we use this trick again I'm going to give it its own light as a sort of fact.

95
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,050
Maybe that's why one would think that the light was too bright.

96
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's give it this blue one.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,580
Great.

98
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,600
There it is.

99
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,800
And it's going to loops back there.

100
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,880
That's sure it move the parents or the child.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,300
It's going to now show against the background.

102
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,460
If you don't have it showing make sure that you are not accidentally moving the child and not the parent

103
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,710
which I did earlier.

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,260
So I'm just going to lock that in and just pull it off screen for now.

105
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,510
OK.

106
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,900
So now I have the Sprite which I call objective.

107
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,520
Pointer it is.

108
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,380
And in a moment when I move the script get the script to move from place to place to place.

109
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,530
Let's put our positions at this position to day.

110
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,020
That's going to be for the room objective.

111
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,570
Some call that remained active.

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,710
Move objective is what it is.

113
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,640
The player has learned to move objective again and duplicate that and call this next door objective.

114
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,710
And the next one Lute object to night vision objective.

115
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,930
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,170
And maybe spot on vision correctly.

117
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,420
Do do do do it again.

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,450
And would you brigate And this one is going to be looped objective.

119
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,580
And finally exit objective.

120
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,970
Didn't rename that wanted I exist objectively.

121
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,810
Yeah.

122
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Now admittedly the only reason for me to name these right now is so that me as the editor I as the editor

123
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,720
can see where they are.

124
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,680
But that's a pretty good reason.

125
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,820
I'm a dork objectives and be on the door.

126
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,520
My night vision objective is going to be through this tunnel.

127
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,370
My left object was going the other loot and my exit objective is going to be right here.

128
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,280
What I'm doing is I'm setting these up so that later in a script we can move through these.

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,880
Remove the top one and then move the pointer to that top one.

130
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,810
I gave these pointers on their own needs objectives on their own aren't going to do anything.

131
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,880
We need some area today so let's put in some areas.

132
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,440
It is for this one.

133
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,670
I'm going to.

134
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,430
Make another note to Dee.

135
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,450
Just get these nice and neat and let's put that as an actual child childish tutorial just what I meant

136
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:27,170
to do and I would call this objective areas and let's move you downhill skis nice and close.

137
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,880
Which are alright.

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,730
First child area today.

139
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,950
And you need a collision.

140
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,320
So let's put on a collision shape to see.

141
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,060
And that's going to be a rectangle.

142
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,550
Okay let's move.

143
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,510
This shape which is going to live right here.

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,130
And when they entered this area that's going to trigger the next objective going to expand this using

145
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,430
the extents again.

146
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,570
So there's going to enter this area.

147
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't mind if I go through the walls because they only the plekanec to this to make sure that's true.

148
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,410
Let's go back to Eric today and actually set our collisions correctly so you are.

149
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,470
Let's say you're torain.

150
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,200
That's fine.

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,320
In fact you don't need to be on any leady but you do need to interact with the players.

152
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,160
The players are going to walk into here and that should trigger.

153
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:19,990
OK.

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,940
Let's give this a name.

155
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,230
You are objective.

156
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,100
Move.

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,970
Great.

158
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,270
And I'm going to do this again for the doorman of wondering if the door slips.

159
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,070
Let's make a brand new objective area so area today.

160
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,480
And you are going to be called objective door and you also syndicalism shape.

161
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,470
No I didn't duplicate this because if I did resizing one collision April races all the duplicate collision

162
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,150
shapes unless I clear out the ship and make a new one.

163
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,700
And frankly at that point I may as well make a new area so that's my new area.

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,140
And new college actually.

165
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:08,000
And you live where I do do your new rectangle shape and using the extents you might be wondering either

166
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,560
why they put scale ones on here if we have to use the expanse.

167
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,410
They're removing that three point one sir.

168
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,630
That's why I guess the play would kick on a door.

169
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,700
Which point they can get through here.

170
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,580
And once again I'm going to make sure on the right collision so take it off the player.

171
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,800
But it can interact with a player.

172
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,970
All right the next one is going to the night vision so that's going to be right here right where the

173
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,920
objective is.

174
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,850
So I'm just going to do the same thing.

175
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:42,590
Brand new erry today and going to call this objective night vision and give that a collision.

176
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,090
I could fast for this but frankly it's probably worth going through it step by step.

177
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,670
Any mistakes I'm making.

178
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,270
Move that to up here and move that to over here or else.

179
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,370
Make sure I've got the actual objective.

180
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,050
Doesn't matter too much but it's nice to move the whole object and extend the.

181
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,160
And go back and check my collisions.

182
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,800
Now the loot I can put another area tutees but I'm thinking it might be easy just to use the actual

183
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,940
briefcase signal and give it a second on body entered and send that to as well so I'm not going to make

184
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,770
the push for that for the exit.

185
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,910
The exit already works as an exit so we now have all these correctly.

186
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,550
Now let's Y them up so we need a script before you that the spec script is due tomorrow which I'm going

187
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,330
to put in these scripts folder go up a couple of levels to scripts and call it a trilogy and were just

188
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,730
going to go back into to TV mode.

189
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,810
And why in these various objectives.

190
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:56,770
So minimize those that were objective mode on body and touched and your connecting to tutorial and Sainting

191
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,270
for dawn on body entered connect to tutorial.

192
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,170
I'm not renaming anything these names are absolutely fine on body entered and as cases you troll.

193
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,180
We now have all these lovely objectives in here.

194
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,650
Now let's put the briefcase in so on body entered you are already going to the player but you're also

195
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,900
going to connect the same signals going to connect to that tutorial so that's fine on eggs.

196
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,260
I don't need to because when you exit you're just leaving level that's fine.

197
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,370
Great.

198
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,010
So now let's make this work.

199
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:38,560
When we're using this what I'm actually going to do is move the objective pointer to the area 2D.

200
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,100
Every time we need to see the moment we're ready we can move to it.

201
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,460
So very first thing I do when I make something the ready function.

202
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,270
What are we going to do.

203
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,380
We're going to move or update the objective point.

204
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,540
So let's come up with a name for this let's call it move pointer.

205
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,890
Think update pointer position is probably a better name

206
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,810
because that way when.

207
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,870
When I or someone else looks at the script in a year's time it's going to make sense immediately I don't

208
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,840
know what this is so.

209
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,540
Function update pointer position.

210
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,130
And that's going to happen on ready so let's make the function for it right now function updates.

211
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,120
Waiter position.

212
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:31,100
So let's get a variable for the point pointers a quainter equals objective point.

213
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,750
And I'm to do the same thing for this objective markers.

214
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,980
Falser marker equals objective markers.

215
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,520
Do do do.

216
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:51,450
But I don't want the folder I want the first child because I put these in an order so dont get child

217
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,380
brackets zira.

218
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,410
This is working the same way that it would work in an array.

219
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,900
Now in an array if that child was action right would use the square brackets but were using these subtle

220
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,630
brackets.

221
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,500
When I say its the same way I remember the one array the first variable the first value within that

222
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,030
array is object 0.

223
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,510
We're counting from zero not from 1.

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,270
Really what we're doing is we're counting the offset from the beginning.

225
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,630
So zero is no offset.

226
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,760
One is one offset but counting from zero is an easy way of thinking about.

227
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,060
So one doing here is I'm setting the marker to be the first child.

228
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:40,860
So let's get this working very simply by saying pointer position equals marker dot position.

229
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,940
This will only work once but let's see if the pointer gets to the right place that's run this thing.

230
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,780
There it is right there.

231
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,770
No it started down here and it's now moved up here and such to show that again in 2D mode is actually

232
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,960
here but it's spawning here.

233
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:04,330
OK so let's actually have this updating itself so after we get the position let's remove its objective

234
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,180
markers J.

235
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,530
For some reason I find it hard to write the word objective today.

236
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,270
Objective markers dot remove.

237
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,390
Child.

238
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,700
And what am I removing removing marker which you've already defined as child's error.

239
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay now if I've done this correctly if I copy.

240
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,000
Update point a function like so and put it into each of these signals where passes.

241
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,950
We should see that the pointer update that shown us find out that were in position 1 and we have here.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,350
Great many of them don't go through position to

243
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,370
position 3 awesome going again.

244
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,820
Okay so that's all working.

245
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,060
However I don't really want this to go.

246
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,880
When nothing else I want to mull things I a sound effect and I want a fancy animation.

247
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,840
Sound Effect is easy.

248
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,820
Let's start with some facts about options to tauriel when I add an audio stream player.

249
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,940
And if we go right up to the top and the sound effects message Stop day.

250
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,830
So this is my message and put this in here and let you hear it and make sure that this isn't looping

251
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,450
doo doo doo doo.

252
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,300
It is not looping.

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,390
If yours is looping unselect it and hit reimport because if that loops that's going to get annoying.

254
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:38,980
And let's put an update pointer position on the bottom yo all yo string player got play.

255
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,310
So now play the scene.

256
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,600
Every time this moves we should hear.

257
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,790
Great.

258
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:58,660
So this animation now up to now we've been using animation player animation player is really amazing

259
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,570
and godda right there's a lot of things we can do with it.

260
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,470
Any property can be animated You can even use the animation player to animate the animation player which

261
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,390
is some inception level weirdness right there.

262
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:18,530
However I want to animate position from here to here and then from here to here from here to here.

263
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,070
I don't really want to load in several animations I'd rather do this once.

264
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,210
So instead I'm going to do something called tween now Tweenies a node that allows you to interpolate

265
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,150
properties or indeed methods between two values in a variety of different ways.

266
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,050
Put simply tween is an animation technique.

267
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,960
We haven't been using it because it's actually more complicated to set up an animation player.

268
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,450
However this is the kind of instance where tween make sense over animation player with a lot of different

269
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,100
variables that we want to move between but we want the movement between them to be smooth.

270
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,470
So let's set up our tween so under a set up of the tween node.

271
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,430
What I did originally want to use a variable but the autocomplete wasn't working with variable so never

272
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,840
might not to interpolate the property.

273
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,830
Great.

274
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,200
So let's start from the beginning.

275
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,420
What property went uploading like a look at documentation in the first instance was the object like

276
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,680
the thing itself.

277
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,430
What's moving what's moving is the point.

278
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,360
So let's try again.

279
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,010
Pointer defined that.

280
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,260
Great.

281
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,600
What's the property as a string.

282
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,070
I will type position and how I know because I can go into the scene treat just like a real time click

283
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,840
on a pointer scroll down to transform and mouse over position.

284
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,000
There is little Tell me if the tooltip comes up there it is property position call.

285
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,060
So back into script view area.

286
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,840
OK so we are moving the position.

287
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,300
Great.

288
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,380
What's our initial starting value.

289
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,120
Well that's pointer dot position.

290
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,710
We ask.

291
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,310
We are starting from where we are.

292
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,550
Where are we going to.

293
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:06,210
Well where we're going to is market position marker position and at this point in money and space I

294
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,860
hit return and two taps the two tabs is a convention with and God.

295
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,760
Oh just to let you know this is part of the line above.

296
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,270
I float duration.

297
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,770
How do you feel about zero point five.

298
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,430
That's half a second.

299
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,840
What kind of tween effect we have all these different kinds of tweets.

300
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,920
I mean the link you to a short description of what these look like but really just experiment with them.

301
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,470
I haven't used all of these.

302
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,380
I want to start with a sign that something a fun animation what kind of transition type Do we want.

303
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,890
Do easy and an easy out and float delay is optional.

304
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,810
I don't need to put that in.

305
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
One more thing we need to do.

306
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:47,270
We've defined a tween we have an actually starts this lets go tween dot start he goes without that we've

307
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,720
just done maths for no reason.

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,390
Okay.

309
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,100
Move you all the way back here and see how that works.

310
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,010
Run the thing.

311
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,270
Look at that.

312
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,020
And now the objective markers moving.

313
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,510
One thing I have forgotten to do by the way I put a camera in.

314
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,130
I should do that put a camera on the player player.

315
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:13,370
You are going to get a camera camera today and this is current now.

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,850
Look at that.

317
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,550
Now right now this is just moving for no reason.

318
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,460
In the next video we can actually put in some text on this but we have movable objective markets.

319
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,560
Which brings me to the challenge.

320
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,020
I'd like you to explore the Twains find the perfect tween for your high spikes to play with the different

321
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,190
kinds of transition types play with the easing.

322
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,770
Don't be afraid to blow the timing.

323
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,580
Make this really fit your game.

324
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,420
Do you want a different sound a different mark.

325
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,720
Maybe you want a big pointy hand we're going to scale it up maybe.

326
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,340
I don't know you want a floaty ball of light or a particle effect.

327
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,300
Pause the video and find the perfect tween for your game.

328
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,280
When you come back are close the video.

329
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,280
And welcome back.

330
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,130
So in this video we have covered some pretty interesting stuff we've looked at tween notes and I'll

331
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,310
be honest tween nodes always make me need to go back to documentation that's always something I do wrong.

332
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,500
It's a lot of moving parts.

333
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,820
So don't be afraid if when you doing it it doesn't come across the first time.

334
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,360
Stick with it.

335
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,700
You'll get the effect you want.

336
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,570
If you are getting the first time fantastic you are better at tweens than I am.

337
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,600
We've also looked at using position to D to Mark positions our map and we've used apparent node in a

338
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,640
race rather than create an array within the script we're using Object orientation in creating an actual

339
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,350
array so fantastic work and I'll see you in the next video.
