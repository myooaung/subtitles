00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello lovely people.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,450
And welcome back.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,710
In this video we're going to start getting some actual gameplay going.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,660
We got to learn how to get text from the player using the line in it note by the end of this video.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,730
You can have this nice little text box here we can write stuff and then either press return or this

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,350
blue button and have the display text change.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,250
So in this video we're going to cover some basic concepts how to get text from the player.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,240
We're going to create a button so that the player can type things in and press enter or a term or they

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,950
can press an okay button.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,770
Now theoretically we don't have to do this but I think it's a good habit to get into when people are

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,160
using online forms or anything like that.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,790
They'll often just press enter but they might press a button to go forward.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,780
This is expected behaviour.

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,010
Well it is only a game we want to keep an eye on that kind of expected behaviour.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,140
The plan is to make the game as easy to play as possible once they're once connected.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,000
We actually have to connect to the script.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,740
So let's get started.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,450
And here we are back in our game.

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,730
There's a nice 2D thing there's the blackboard.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,830
Here's the story text area.

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,940
What do we need to do.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,670
We need to grab text from the player.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,550
So as you might expect I need a new node.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,360
I'm going to put it as a child to the blackboard node.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,500
I like having my you I elements in one place and this is part of the UI.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,550
So I want to select blackboard and hip plus.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,510
Now we have a couple of choices.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,690
We have a node called text edit text and it is a text box that players can write into and you can press

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,970
return and it'll go to the next line.

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,610
So really good for long pieces of text right.

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,230
Anything with multiple lines paragraphs whatever else it may be.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,410
If you're doing a big game and the players can keep a journal and you want to you want to write it they

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,870
want that's the note I would use.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,420
However that's not the node I want for this.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,170
I'm not expecting players to write that kind of text and I want the functionality of when they post

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,220
return it's going to send a signal.

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,770
So instead of text it I'm going to use the line at it.

38
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,590
Note that line at there it is.

39
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,280
Provides a single line string editing.

40
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,290
That's exactly what we want.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,530
Let's rename this one to call it a text box.

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,480
Yeah that's good.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,300
And let's make it a decent size.

44
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,900
Make sure my snap is on it.

45
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,040
Is that wide maybe and near the bottom.

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,970
And I'm going to leave a little bit of gap there.

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,700
You know what while I'm doing that.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,650
Let's actually see a little fake margin like so.

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,160
So now when we're writing our texts in fact let's show you what that does when we're writing our text.

50
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,530
We're not pushing the text right up to the edge of the play a screen is a little bit of a gap as you

51
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,330
might expect later on the course I'll show you how to make real dynamic margins.

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,590
But this will define it.

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay so I have this lovely text box and I'm sure the right text box in here when it looks like and let's

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,430
not put random capital Xian and again we have this font thing.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
Now you probably remember how to do this.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,400
You go down to custom font create your font drag it over.

57
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,420
But there's an easier way and one I would really recommend.

58
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,760
Let's go to the story text noad and go down to our custom fonts.

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,600
This little down arrow was going to hit copy.

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,910
Now back to a text box.

61
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,880
Got a custom fonts and paste.

62
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,760
Now this is really useful because any changes I make to the font here let's say I want to change the

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,400
font to 40 will change all instances of that font which means if I decide I want to change let's say

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,490
the actual font or the size or anything else the colour it'll work.

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,040
Every where I've used it.

66
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,900
Really nice piece of consistency.

67
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,060
So don't just like with variables don't make five or six or seven different instances of this font just

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,690
make one.

69
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,070
Let's get of the output box.

70
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,130
I don't need that.

71
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,060
And just so I can see what I'm doing.

72
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,910
I'm going to put this default text here.

73
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,300
Great to his story text his text box.

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,540
OK so we have our text box now.

75
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,460
I need to get whatever the player writes in here.

76
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,380
Into our script right now.

77
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,050
It does nothing.

78
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:26,940
Right.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Just the place where I can type.

80
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,730
To do this I'm going to use signals signals are a fundamental concept in God.

81
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,740
So let's spend a little time looking at them while I do some doodling.

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,210
So here we have got oh and here is a node.

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,340
This particular node is going to be our looney lips node and abalone lips node has a script.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
Almost fits perfect.

85
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,440
And he's very cool.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,780
So he has pink eyes and a lovely green hat.

87
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,560
Perfect.

88
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,360
Just what we need.

89
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,480
We have other notes here.

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,930
I'm doing all right Luni lips.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,380
As we have in the script we also have a second note down here.

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,520
And this one is text box which as you will remember is a line at it note.

93
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,350
Now I could.

94
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,630
Give text box it's own script.

95
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,500
And then we could write some code to get them to set send receive variable switch up and that all worked

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,870
fine.

97
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,390
But it's a little bit clumsy.

98
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:37,220
So instead I'm going to use a signal every node has a list of things that it knows how to do.

99
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,980
And what's going to happen is I'm a tell it when this thing happens.

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,840
Get your cellphone and send a text to lunar eclipse.

101
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,920
When lonely lips gets this text.

102
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,640
It'll get a little notification that that has happened and it'll know to update the script.

103
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,790
OK.

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
So how do I make this happen.

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,130
Well I'm a click on text box and by the inspector you'll see things saying node.

106
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,500
Let's click on vote.

107
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,210
Here are the built in signals.

108
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,670
Now we can specify and create our own signals in script.

109
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,280
But right now we don't need to do that.

110
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,960
I don't care about the control ones or the canvas items or any of those.

111
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:26,780
What I care about is the line and it's specific ones and I want text entered text entered is going to

112
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,380
be triggered whenever we press return.

113
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,520
Now if you want to find out what these signals do the way to do that is to get into the script for you

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
press classes.

115
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,050
And type in the type of know you're looking up so let's say lying in it.

116
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,940
There it is.

117
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,600
And other signals you'll find what these signals do.

118
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,990
I don't want it when the text changes there's going to be every time a key is pressed.

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,970
That's not what we want in this case.

120
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,930
If we wanted something like a sound effect every time you pressed a key.

121
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,350
That's how we do that.

122
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,910
What I want is when you press key to do a thing you know close this with control w and I'm going to

123
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,890
link it so select text entered and hit connect.

124
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,340
Down here the bottom.

125
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,660
And obviously yes there are ways to create connections and signals during the script but we don't need

126
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,040
that yet.

127
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,310
Now you'll notice that text box is raided out is read out a word.

128
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,230
It's a word now.

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,770
Text Boxes read it out.

130
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,100
It makes no sense to send a signal from itself to itself.

131
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,170
You'll also notice that if I try to send a signal to an any random note it's a blackboard it's going

132
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,970
to give me an error message.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,990
The easiest way to use a connection is to connect it to a node that has a script.

134
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,370
Now it's going to make a new function here.

135
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,770
We've currently got function ready and wants to make on text box text entered.

136
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,040
Now I can rename this to anything I want but for clarity I'm going to keep it as it is.

137
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,430
And here we are a brand new function.

138
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,350
So on ready it's going to do this.

139
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:13,930
And then a new function on text box text entered brackets new text this new text is going to be whatever

140
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,460
it is inside the text box.

141
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,330
When that happens so it automatically passes that information into this function.

142
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,470
So here we are.

143
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,640
And I want to make it do something just to check it's working.

144
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,750
Why don't we update the story text with whatever we've typed in we're just going to make it repeat back

145
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,500
what we say.

146
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,920
So blackboard.

147
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:43,750
Doree Text dot B code underscored text he calls or what does it want to equal the thing that's in the

148
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,040
text box.

149
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,150
By the way I'm not convinced we want to be using the baby code thing.

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,400
I don't see any value in it right now some as Switch it back to text.

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,630
Why use the code when we don't have to.

152
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,680
Well let's see if this works.

153
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:13,730
There once was a lonely pineapple whose brother was covered in jam.

154
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,030
He lived atop a ladder.

155
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,730
This poem was written by an excellent.

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,680
Not only do we have fully functional script I have written a hot new poem and am available for children's

157
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,550
parties of this teaching gig doesn't work out so the next thing I want to do is create additional usability.

158
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,640
It's all very well having this text box here but some people like to press a button.

159
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,380
So let's let them do that.

160
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,860
Always make it easy for people to want to play your game or if you release in commercial games.

161
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,890
Always make people want to give you money as you might expect.

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,090
This is a new node.

163
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,990
So back on my blackboard thing because I wanted to be a child of blackboard.

164
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,320
I want to keep everything in a nice easy defined place new node.

165
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,770
And we want a button.

166
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,910
Now we have a bunch of options here right we clearly don't need touch screen button because I'm not

167
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,930
making a mobile game and I don't have touchscreen enabled and here I am touching my screen right now.

168
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,190
Nothing is happening.

169
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,240
This is very exciting television.

170
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,740
The obvious choice would be button.

171
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,510
However I want to use text you button.

172
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,100
The reason I will use techy Biden is it's going to allow me to put a texture my own texture on the button

173
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,600
and I'm not going to have to rely on whatever is coded in currently for the theme for God.

174
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,140
So let's do a text about that.

175
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,300
And let's get off the signals list.

176
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,020
First thing I do is make it visible.

177
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,050
It's a texture button with no texture.

178
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,240
Not that interesting.

179
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,430
So here are textures and back to a graphics file on my normal texture.

180
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,860
I have the unpressed button.

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,130
And then pressed one.

182
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,540
I want this and all that's going to do is when the button is clicked.

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,770
It's going to change the texture.

184
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,320
Like so.

185
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,410
By the way these button textures are from Kenny.

186
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,620
I found his stuff on open game after all.

187
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
He also has his own website.

188
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm going to put the links in there.

189
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,170
Kenny releases a bunch of open source free to use note licence.

190
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,890
Otherwise I can say this game assets mostly graphics some sounds as well really good way of practicing

191
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,300
your games but just getting your own indie project going.

192
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,460
You don't even have to credit him but I'm going to because I think it's great work.

193
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,840
I so this is not why this buttony cilice So make sure my snap is on.

194
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,960
And I'm going to put it down here.

195
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,600
Looks got much better place.

196
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,180
And you know what I'm going to give it a label and I'm gonna put the label as a child of texture.

197
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,590
So let's find out.

198
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:48,950
Rich tax label and the tax is going to say okay and I'm going to give it a font.

199
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,620
And I'm going to paste the font because that's the last thing I did.

200
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,390
Let's just make that nice MC by the way.

201
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,440
You notice how on this text box didn't appear in the top left.

202
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,490
That's because it's a child of texture button texture but as a child of blackboard texture button takes

203
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:14,240
its position and all of the other attributes from Blackboard rich text they bought a medical label.

204
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,490
Takes its position and everything else its scale everything else you might need from the location of

205
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,170
text button.

206
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,950
This is a really good thing to understand early on because otherwise you're going to move things and

207
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,850
think you've moved the wrong thing.

208
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,630
Let me put that in less confusing way.

209
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,030
If I move texture button it'll move all of its children with it right.

210
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,170
If I move back to the label it'll just move bottom label because it has no children.

211
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,040
Now imagine will making a 2D.

212
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,470
I don't know platform game scrolling game the 3D game I have animated sprites I can see the player.

213
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,140
I have a collision but shapes so that the game knows where the player is and I have the actual location

214
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,620
of the player which is how it's going to calculate where it is in the game.

215
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,010
I have several times moved the Sprite to the player thinking I am moving the player and then everything

216
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,720
goes wrong.

217
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,990
Okay so make sure you're moving the right thing.

218
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,180
If I want to make sure that I'm not moving the children I can select the parent and then press this

219
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,340
lock down button.

220
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:30,420
And what this means is I can only move the parent I can't move the children alone and you can see it

221
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,710
right here.

222
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,940
Great.

223
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,750
So we have a button that currently does nothing.

224
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,300
And I wanted to do something.

225
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,770
Well this is another signal.

226
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
So back to Saigon.

227
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:47,490
And I want Prest I don't want to button down because that's while the button is being held down I want

228
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,960
Okay the button has been pressed don't count how long for.

229
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,640
It's just been pressed and I'm going to connect it to the same script.

230
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,800
Now.

231
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,600
What do I want to happen here.

232
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:09,390
You might think I'm just going to copy what's in here but new text is not Whoops.

233
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,730
The new text is not going to work here.

234
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,110
See my debugger.

235
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,790
I'm getting errors and the reason I'm getting errors is I'm calling you an enemy Magus.

236
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,610
I'm calling an argument in this case new text and it didn't want one.

237
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,990
You see the line edit node text box comes with this method built in button pressed doesn't suck.

238
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,500
What I need to do is tell it when this is pressed.

239
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,440
Go grab that text.

240
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,990
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to inside this function in only this function.

241
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,230
They give variable called new underscored text.

242
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,520
It looks familiar doesn't it.

243
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,550
But remember this variable only exists in this room.

244
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,530
It just happens to share a name and what is this variable.

245
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,880
Well it's whatever is in the text box.

246
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,580
So dollar sign or if before I get on the SQL node etc..

247
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,780
But I don't prefer dollar sign text box and it'll find it for me.

248
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,450
That's the one I want.

249
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,990
OK so what do I want to do here.

250
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,800
Now I can't just do equals because I'm going to set it.

251
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:25,260
So instead I want you don't get on the score text only to put brackets on that because this is actually

252
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,490
a method.

253
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,290
Then I need to call this function.

254
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,840
This function is on text box.

255
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,110
There it is text entered.

256
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,330
And I need to pass this variable from this function to here.

257
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,090
So what I'm doing is I'm saying if you press the button create a new variable and send it over here.

258
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,030
And this place is going oh I've just received this new variable.

259
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,210
If I'm not pressing the button I'm just pressing return then the signal is generating the same thing

260
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,200
so I'm circumventing the fact that the button can't do it.

261
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,540
Now this isn't that legible to me.

262
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,490
I would much rather put this about someone hynek the whole thing.

263
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,500
And I'm just gonna hold out and up arrow just logically for my own peace of mind.

264
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,390
I find that much easier to read.

265
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,730
So let's see if that worked.

266
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,800
Well that's like going to thing and press the button and there it is.

267
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,020
And now what ever I write.

268
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,780
Whether a press return

269
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,400
or press the okay button it will work.

270
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,050
However you know how saying make the behaviour expected.

271
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,810
Will we have unexpected behaviour.

272
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,740
Specifically I'm starting with a text box.

273
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,960
I need to clear that out and then when I enter it.

274
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,290
That text state and that's not expecting to happen so.

275
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:14,810
I would like you to clear whatever text is in the text box whenever we either pressed return or press

276
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,110
the okay button.

277
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,460
So pause the video and see if you can clear the context of text box.

278
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,500
Every time we enter a new text.

279
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Okay.

280
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,150
Welcome back.

281
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,370
How could we do this.

282
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,260
Well there are a few ways but here's how I would do it.

283
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,180
The first thing I may do is say I don't need to be doing this twice right.

284
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,560
Because no matter how I get here I'm going to end up on this text box text entered function so whatever

285
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,390
I want to do I can just put here.

286
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,590
So my plan is once we've done this function here once we've set the story text the new one.

287
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm now going to take the text box noseless to dollar blackboard text box there it is dumped and we've

288
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,390
done this before right.

289
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,880
Text equals and want set an empty string.

290
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm also in my text box node.

291
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,230
Going to get rid of this bit as text box.

292
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,910
I don't have to do it this way.

293
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,130
I could also do that in my ready function.

294
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,900
So I could do it this way.

295
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,150
And really that's down to personal preference.

296
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,650
In fact for now all that's wrong isn't it.

297
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,160
Lots of text there we are at for now.

298
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,360
Why don't we do it this way so that when I'm looking at the two day view I can very easily see what

299
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,150
the font is.

300
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,560
But when I press play.

301
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,920
It's going to be empty and we should see this work well.

302
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,210
There it is.

303
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,100
Which brings us to this video in this video with learn how to use both line edit and texture button.

304
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,980
But more important we've learned how to connect and use signals and how to how to create and move between

305
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,860
