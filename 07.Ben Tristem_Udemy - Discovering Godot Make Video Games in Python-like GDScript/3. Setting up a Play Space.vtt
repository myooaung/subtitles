00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.910
Delightful God.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.510
People in this video we're gonna to set up a play space that's going to be a basic level because we're

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.370
going to be using a lot of physics here and there's some stuff we need tonight to have ready to make

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.080
that happen.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.090
Well not only that well we're going to need a floor because if we've got a bunch of rigid bodies that

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.650
those are going to have gravity automatically assigned to them the less we tell them otherwise.

8
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.430
If there's no floor they're just going to fall before we can do anything.

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.310
We also only the camera we are using 3-d.

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.890
If we don't set a camera we won't see anything in 2D.

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.800
You'll just get the full view of it in 3D.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030
We must have a camera while we set in that we may as well check our environment settings because those

13
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.070
are linked to the camera.

14
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.330
I'd also like to put some lighting in.

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.500
Let's make this look good but if we're lighting things we need objects light someone to get into God.

16
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.680
And the first thing we do is make a basic node so let's make a spatial node so spatial though because

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.410
it can be a very basic 3-d no what shall to call this level one.

18
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.570
Now later on we may decide to make this a template and then a rename it and resave it if we do.

19
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.210
So if we want multiple levels and all levels must have some things in common and they all inherit from

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.010
a template we could call this basic fact.

21
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.620
I could just call this level templates.

22
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.320
Must do that now level template much better idea.

23
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.810
So we have our level template mode node mode we dont have a mode we have a node forget our models and

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.910
its architecture.

25
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.350
You'll see we have a floor.

26
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.510
Now these are all made by Kenny and they're pretty high quality there but lovely textures.

27
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.520
So what I do is Im going to do drag the mesh in its cone to create new measures.

28
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.150
When they click on the measurements and rename it floor.

29
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.100
We've now got something called floor mats at the transform because right now it's just wherever I happen

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.560
to place it that's not that useful.

31
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.070
So on a translation that is 0 0 0 you know just by the way I've already set gritz lapping up right here.

32
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.320
So when I move things they will move to the grid.

33
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.420
One more thing I notice the origin is not in the centre right.

34
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.470
This thing here this is where the floor's position has been calculate.

35
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.080
That's because Kenny likes to put his origins in the corner.

36
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.430
It's very useful in a lot of cases it's actually not always that useful and got out and is going to

37
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.130
be copper cases where it will cause us problems.

38
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.180
Normally you would fix this in blender but I'm going to show you what these problems are and how we

39
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.230
could fix them if we get assets like this.

40
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.850
So what I want to do is make the floor and nice big size and go down to scale and transform.

41
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.470
Making sure I've got my floor selected not my lot.

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.140
I'm late and I'm going to give this what he think 15 by 15 we leave the wires one floor.

43
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.650
These are meters so 15 by 15 on the horizontal is great.

44
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.890
I don't need a 15 feet tall floor.

45
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.160
If you don't speak madrick I'm sorry that I'm sure you get used to it.

46
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.020
OK.

47
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.820
So we now have a mesh called flaw.

48
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.190
It won't work as a flop if we have any rigid bodies that just fall straight through it.

49
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.810
So we need to give it collision.

50
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.760
Easiest way to do that is go to the match button.

51
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.030
We're going to add a convex collision static body right not the ceiling.

52
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.310
The static body and there it is you can see the collision is all around it.

53
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.660
And our floor is off to the side because this is the origin This is where God is calculating its position.

54
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.960
It's very difficult to change the origin of an object within God.

55
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.590
So instead I'm going to move the entire floor over.

56
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.410
And now when things spawn in the ausborn in on the flock Let's move it down one as well.

57
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.170
You know what let's get a translation.

58
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.310
I believe I'm looking at 42 should be about right 42 by negative 42.

59
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.600
And I was going to move it down by one.

60
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.740
Let's move it back up by one.

61
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.500
Having the grid above it is actually little annoying.

62
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.170
How's that look.

63
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.660
That's not quite Santa.

64
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.370
I was wrong.

65
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.310
It's not 42.

66
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.000
It's.

67
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.890
Well it's that.

68
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.270
That is sex.

69
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.430
Doesn't actually matter too much but looks good.

70
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.610
Okay.

71
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.440
Right now we have a level.

72
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.920
We only with save this that save really good scenes.

73
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.290
And I make a new folder let's create a folder and call it levels within which were put level template

74
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.370
dot T.

75
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.010
CNN So there is.

76
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.670
OK.

77
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.860
So we have this level and if I press play right now then we select this is our default scene.

78
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.760
We can change that later.

79
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.790
Fine grey screen Why no camera.

80
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.820
Back up to a level template it's not a child a floor.

81
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.900
It's a child of the root node.

82
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.200
We make a camera.

83
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.670
And let's just see you were in the floor.

84
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.330
That's terrible.

85
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.590
He says Move it back in it and up by to meet us about the height of a human one point six is an average

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.150
height I think.

87
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.930
I don't know I forget.

88
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.950
Click on preview.

89
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.490
Lots of floor press play.

90
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.810
Great.

91
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.170
Now if you want to this is where you're going to change your environments of clicking on the camera.

92
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.760
You probably remember this from cubed to kick about four go up the ruffolo there's a default environment

93
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.140
we can just drag that in.

94
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.190
Any changes we make to that will change every single scene.

95
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.910
If he don't want that to be true you're going to need to make a new environment for the scene and use

96
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.070
that right now ambient light is set to bloom.

97
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.570
And we're taking all of the light from the sky anyway right.

98
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.310
So we've got a very blue sky with a slightly blue sun and everything is going to have this blue tent.

99
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.120
Let's make the ambient colour slightly more orange.

100
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.230
That's not going to be how the actual objects going to be lit.

101
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.640
We put some lighting in it too.

102
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.290
But just to see what we're doing you can also go over to Sky.

103
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.180
We using a procedural skywrite now.

104
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.580
And if you want to you can change these values.

105
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.220
I'm actually okay with them as they are.

106
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.160
But if you want to to your top colour could be bright pink.

107
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.850
It looks ghastly and a rising colour could be this horrible burgundy colour.

108
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.210
Wow.

109
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.730
You know I don't miss the 1980s.

110
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.310
Let's go back a little bit.

111
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.990
That looks much better doesn't it.

112
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.480
If you want to change them this is where you do it.

113
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.030
I'm going to go back.

114
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.310
We could also put on reflections and also exposure I'm not going to mess with those yet.

115
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.260
Let's have some objects first.

116
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.030
OK.

117
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.560
We need an object first of all do good models and into furniture and we have a bunch of objects here

118
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.710
and what we want to do is bring one of these in as a rigid body then bring it in as a rigid body because

119
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.310
it will automatically have gravity applied and that's perfect.

120
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.510
A quick warning.

121
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.290
I'm going to use this desk corner and if I start running it again it's going to behave very weirdly

122
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.740
so yours does that.

123
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.720
Don't panic when you come back after we pause it.

124
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.150
I haven't seen a test like that.

125
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.810
When you come back us show you how to fix that but for now my challenge to you is to bring in one or

126
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.880
two items of furniture.

127
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.720
Create one or two rigid bodies and use those furniture mashers.

128
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.600
Don't worry feel a bit confused just get familiar with making things in 3D to pause the video.

129
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.200
Pick one or two items of furniture bring them in and then when you come back I'll show you my solution.

130
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.840
I'm ok Mac.

131
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.480
Alright so I'm going to bring in desk not unlike a..

132
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.220
Just a basic node and call it furniture.

133
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.520
Organize these things.

134
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.950
Great.

135
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.330
I had to check my spelling.

136
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.500
My eyes are going weird now.

137
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:41.870
I'm a drag in this desk and I going move it up a little bit and look where the origin's see that at

138
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.950
the moment this is just a mesh.

139
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.020
If I press play nothing will happen.

140
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.050
Right.

141
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.070
Desk just hovers there.

142
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.070
Very boring.

143
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.160
Rotate it a bit.

144
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.260
We actually see whats happening and move it back that way.

145
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.880
OK.

146
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.860
So we have a boring desk so very badly lit.

147
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.870
Then we fix element to make this into a rigid bodies a couple of things we could do.

148
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:09.520
But what I'm going to do is actually make the rigid body and drag the mesh instance in to the rigid

149
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.390
body and nothing to reposition the rigid body to that no.

150
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.040
I'm doing this this way round because it is a mistake I made a lot right.

151
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.950
I would drag the mesh into its rigid body and then not notice that the positions are different.

152
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.680
So let's put it back to where it was.

153
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.250
So you are at 0 0 0 and your rotation is 0 0 0 0.

154
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.030
Fantastic.

155
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.210
So now you're back to where I expect it to be.

156
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.330
Let's rename this desk.

157
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.430
And back to the mission instance meche instance.

158
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.380
It's hard to say.

159
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:48.760
Let's give you here we go a tri mesh collision sibling because we have lots of little details let's

160
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.790
follow it around because we want the play to build a jump on it.

161
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:57.920
We don't think big underneath and we should now have a nice little desk get a back up to the desk itself.

162
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:03.680
Dont move the child move the parent rotated a bit and just move it back up.

163
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.620
Great.

164
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.140
Look what happens when a Pressplay.

165
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.090
My God my desk is possessed.

166
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.330
Why is this happening.

167
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.710
It's happening because the origin is right here.

168
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.960
Let me show you what that means.

169
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.780
Origins matter.

170
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:29.240
The origin is the position of an node is where God is going to put all of the calculations.

171
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:36.740
Right so if I say the desk is a 0 0 0 what I was doing is looking at the origin of the desk is not looking

172
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.800
at the mesh and getting an average.

173
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:45.300
You've seen when I had this meshes since over here somewhere.

174
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:53.100
That is possible to have the mesh in the wrong place but the other side of that is the origin is where

175
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.640
the physics will be calculated from right.

176
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.260
So we're applying any kind of physics calculation.

177
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.750
It's always going to be from where the origin is and that's important because that means the origin

178
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.550
is the centre of gravity.

179
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.860
Look at the desk our centre of gravity is right here.

180
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.750
And when we press play the desk will try and get to a centre of gravity.

181
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.100
Which is there.

182
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.240
That's not what we want.

183
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.500
So how can we fix that.

184
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.930
Well first off let's put some light in here because I can't actually see the desk.

185
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.570
Don't worry.

186
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.610
We will get to it.

187
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.820
I make a directional white like the sun and it's going to be nice.

188
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:40.550
Go nice and high and pointed in the right direction and down like so how's that.

189
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.850
That better.

190
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.130
So a little bit better.

191
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.180
Point you this way.

192
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.350
Let's actually point this out over that way.

193
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.000
It's getting a bit lower.

194
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.180
Another desk is of course the same colour as the floor because I wasn't paying much attention but we

195
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.040
can fix that.

196
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.710
Okay.

197
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.740
So we have a desk issued custom shallows now.

198
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.120
It's not cussing Challis directional white.

199
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.070
You need to cast shadows.

200
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:10.430
There we go.

201
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.820
Let's go labella now.

202
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.690
A Pressplay.

203
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:14.800
Great.

204
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.550
So it's trying to right itself so how can we fix it.

205
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.710
All we do is select both children.

206
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.740
The meche instance and the collision shape.

207
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.310
And here is the origin.

208
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.780
So I'm going to move them like so.

209
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.410
Looking a little bit better.

210
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.600
And I am eyeballing this.

211
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.040
I will admit that.

212
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.560
But I mean move them a little bit further.

213
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.870
I may be down one.

214
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.630
So now when I look at the centre of gravity is in a slightly better place.

215
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.170
In fact the centre of gravity wants to be here does that because of the physics of this.

216
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.020
So let's go even further in that direction.

217
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.070
So you two can go.

218
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.680
Like so let's switch off grid for now.

219
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.980
And how's that.

220
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.290
It's looking better.

221
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.250
Making sure the desk is selected now because I want to move the entire object not just the mash.

222
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.350
Move it up a bit.

223
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.420
And what I'm expecting now is a desk to slam down maybe down some little and not do anything else.

224
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.990
Much more like it.

225
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.070
And you know what let's make the desk heavy.

226
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.050
So these are all ing in grams I think they are.

227
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.980
And I happened to look up how much a desk would weigh.

228
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.400
So I say 270 How's that.

229
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.070
Bonk much more like it.

230
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.300
In fact that's the mass not the weight.

231
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.780
The 270 should be here.

232
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.170
I just made the world's heaviest desk so if you working removals I'm so sorry about my desk one more

233
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.300
time.

234
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.990
Fantastic.

235
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.050
We have a desk with a centre of gravity correct.

236
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.850
It's a little bit of a hassle right.

237
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.040
But if you import an object and it's working great and then you apply physics to it and it starts flipping

238
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.580
out like that check where the origin is.

239
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.940
And that brings us to the end of the video.

240
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.140
In this video we've set up a basic play space so we can play with physics and build levels and we've

241
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.420
looked at how to fix centre of gravity problems in rigid bodies.

242
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.120
So an excellent start and I will see you in the next video.
