00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.560
Hello again you awesome got to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.760
Let's add some quite the level let's help Bunny get rich.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
We learn about animation plan notes but before I get too ahead of myself let's just talk about what

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.380
adding points to level is going to entail.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.260
So what are coins going to do in Happy Days.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.880
Well first they're going to spin gently around the place.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.480
I want to really encourage players to pay attention to them.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.560
And it's a gentle spin animation is a great way of doing that.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.290
We're also going to have them shrink and vanish when the collected.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.680
We're not just gonna have them vanish in the scene with no no effect.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.240
Let's have a nice little effect that helps them shrink and vanish as I'm repeating this.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.590
I realize that this is kind of redundant but you know we're going to have a shrink vanish.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
Let's also give Bunny extra life and enough of these coins are collected what enough means is up to

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.410
you.

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.970
But let's say every 10 coins every 20 coins you get your life.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.680
Which means we need to update the gooey the player should know how many coins they've got so they can

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.940
make decisions.

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.520
Okay.

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.980
So let's get right into it.

20
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.090
First we need to do is make a brand new scene.

21
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.880
And this is going to be a 2D scene so I'm sure to click on 2D and I'm gonna call this coin as a child

22
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.560
of coin.

23
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.360
I'm going to put an animated sprite.

24
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.470
I could have made the animated sprite the parent but I'm fine with the no 2D being the parent.

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.140
Okay.

26
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.700
So here's our animated sprite.

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.730
There's no sprite in it under graphics under items you'll see there are four things called bronze one

28
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.360
two three and four.

29
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.100
These are the coins.

30
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.530
So let's make and use sprite frame and click on that.

31
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.250
So make sure this Sprite frames open and I'm you to rename this spin and I'm just going to select all

32
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.420
for these helps shift and clicked 1 and 4 and drag them in as looking pretty good but it's suddenly

33
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.310
snapping right.

34
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.780
So it goes from full on to sideways and it's snapping back full on.

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.480
That's okay.

36
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.540
All I need to do is repeat this one which is number three.

37
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.990
Whoops.

38
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.790
Cancel.

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940
So select my three and bring that in.

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.080
And then number one again which is bronze to and now it looks at the entire thing is spinning.

41
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.980
Actually it's not.

42
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.160
But it's what it looks like.

43
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.790
And we could probably speed that up a bit.

44
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.650
When you think seven 10 too fast I quit like ten but that might be too fast for your game but looks

45
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.620
good to me right now this is just an animated sprite.

46
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.950
Okay.

47
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.920
There is no way for this to interact with money in order to interact with money.

48
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.440
We're going to have to detect when Bunny is entering the area and that's our clue.

49
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.200
This is an area 2D problem so area 2D and that's going to need a collision shape.

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.440
Right.

51
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.460
So let's add a collision shape patootie if you got a sudden cut in the video that one of my cats kaboodle

52
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.420
has decided that now is a really good time to explore the cupboard is next to me.

53
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.330
We just moved house.

54
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.980
She's very excited.

55
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.420
This is the cupboard I'm keeping all my lighting equipment so she's making an incredible noise.

56
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.860
No that's interesting to you right now.

57
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.480
But I'm interested.

58
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.820
OK.

59
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.730
We've got a collision shape.

60
00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.440
Let's get an actual shape that's into a circle shape and zoom in and just bring the extent out to it

61
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.640
looks pretty good.

62
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.880
Great.

63
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.100
Now you'll notice that if the bunny isn't now you'll notice there are frames where the coin is small

64
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.140
the collision shape.

65
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.920
I'm not expecting the player to ever notice that it's going to look much smaller than this.

66
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.880
However I want to get a collision and make sure that we're on the right one.

67
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.410
So a coin is an item and not a player.

68
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.910
Let's take it off the player layer and put on items and it can only interact with player.

69
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.800
It cannot interact with terrain hazards or items.

70
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.640
This is important.

71
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.840
We don't want the coin to be picked up because it's it's touching on the coin or because it's touching

72
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.520
the screen.

73
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.770
OK.

74
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.250
So I want to hide that collision shape.

75
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.890
OK.

76
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.700
That's looking good.

77
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.100
But I want to stop the coin from spinning while I'm working on it because it's distracting me that way.

78
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.820
OK I can minimize area today.

79
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.780
We've got a collision shape.

80
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.850
It's done.

81
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.390
Next up I want a sound effect so I gonna put an audio stream player to Dee Why 2D.

82
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.420
Because position is going to matter for this one.

83
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.490
And if we go into two to do SFX there's coin SFX we have that in there and let's listen to it.

84
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.000
If it's too loud or too quiet we can make this quieter.

85
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.730
Minus 15.

86
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.210
Very quiet.

87
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.880
I won't keep on at zero but if you need to change the volume that's how you can do it.

88
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.950
So far so good.

89
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.530
Let's give coin a script and it can be called coin G.D. but this should go in the items folder.

90
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.190
So item coins they've got.

91
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.870
And you know what we should probably save the scene as well so let's save the scene in items as coin

92
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.090
awesome.

93
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.400
The reason we're doing this is we want to send a signal when Bunny enters here we're gonna send a signal

94
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.920
to the script.

95
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:45.750
So let's get a note on body entered connect that to the coin should double check that the only thing

96
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.530
that can interact with it is the place you're an item and you can only interact with players.

97
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.670
Great.

98
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.760
Now when to fill this in in a moment but first there's one more object I need in here.

99
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:04.080
One more note I need an animation player animation player container and player of animation resources.

100
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.280
OK.

101
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.770
That doesn't sound very helpful.

102
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.550
What can animation player actually animate.

103
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.150
Well we've had a slight for that it can animate basically anything.

104
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.430
What is it basically anything.

105
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.070
This is actually pretty much anything animation players are incredibly versatile.

106
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.820
Any variable any function any property that you could change the inspector can all be triggered and

107
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.450
animated and changed an animation player which is incredibly useful.

108
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.920
Let me show what I mean.

109
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.150
So here's my animation window and right now it's telling me it's not playing an animation so I've got

110
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.230
two animation and I'll make a new animation and on a call this die.

111
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.040
This is.

112
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.900
This is what's going to happen to the coin when it's being collected.

113
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.400
Now we'll see here with a timeline and we can change the length of the timeline.

114
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.620
We've got snaps at the moment we are snapping every zero point one seconds.

115
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.940
But if we wanted to we could change to zero point five seconds which means we could only interact with

116
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.030
the animation at those steps and put it back to zero point for now.

117
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.330
And we've got a bunch of tracks.

118
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.060
If I add a track it says OK this a property is the transformers it's a method.

119
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.450
Is this audio playback.

120
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.320
There's a lot we can do with this.

121
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.270
Well first thing I feel like this animation should be pretty quick.

122
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.230
I changed the total time here to zero point five and I don't want this looping.

123
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.570
It's all on your own once and it's not going to auto load auto it is this arrow button here.

124
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.790
OK.

125
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.260
So right now we have a half second animation that does nothing.

126
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.090
I'm going to hold control and scroll in so I can actually see the points when we connect to the coin.

127
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.200
The coin is going to change sides.

128
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.360
It's going to change the scale and we could just do it here in this no 2D.

129
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.640
So if this changes scale everything but it will change scales to right that's what we want.

130
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.590
Now I could go add track got a property and then tell it which note is gonna be animated and make the

131
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.460
coin and what's property going to change.

132
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.300
I would change the scale cancel that because I could also just go to coin and you'll see there are no

133
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.920
keys.

134
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.160
Well I would chase the scales.

135
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.070
I would put a key here.

136
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.030
Are you creating a new track.

137
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.370
Yes I am.

138
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.190
And this is a key frame that tells it that on this frame here is the information.

139
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:19.830
Let's say on this frame I want this to be zero point zero one in both directions.

140
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.840
Now the key here when I scroll this back look what happens.

141
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.280
In fact we go a little bit fancy let's say at zero point two.

142
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:36.780
You're actually going to be at one point five and put a key in there and then I press play because this

143
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.640
isn't exactly center this bit and this bit are different speeds but look at the dramatic change which

144
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.980
we're going from one to one point five and then from one point five all the way down to zero point zero

145
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.860
one.

146
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.450
OK.

147
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.540
So I'm gonna see what that looks like in the animated sprite.

148
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:59.380
Put that back on playing go back to my animation player and press play right now we don't have this

149
00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.770
looping.

150
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.640
If we did it would look like this looping on.

151
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.800
That looks really trippy.

152
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.190
So let's actually make this work.

153
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.920
Somebody go into my coin.

154
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.250
All right.

155
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.150
Very first thing I want to do.

156
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.350
Let's just check this work.

157
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:19.600
So on area 2D body entered and I'm just going to go animation player dots and I can look up all things

158
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.440
I can do by press control and open the documentation in but I happen to know that this is command called

159
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.020
to to do play and I just want the string name great.

160
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.180
So play and it only has one animation so I was going to pick the one it gives me.

161
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:39.360
Okay let's put a coin into my level I'm going to put another of these nodes in as a organization tool.

162
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.150
So just a basic node and you're gonna be called coins.

163
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.970
I'm going to drag it to be underneath has it's just a little bit of organization.

164
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.990
And let's instance in a coin

165
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.940
okay it's gonna come in at 0 0.

166
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.140
So let's move that and for now let's put it right here.

167
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.170
So let's first play and want to touch the coin.

168
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.620
Now a couple of things one coin is still there.

169
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.390
All right.

170
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.720
So every time I enter it that operation is of some.

171
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.740
So I need a way for the coin to vanish.

172
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.110
Okay.

173
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.400
So let's make any function.

174
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.030
And I mean to call the function die.

175
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.850
Now I'm calling the function die and the animation die.

176
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.360
These are two different things.

177
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.840
Okay.

178
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.710
So we're gonna do is the cue free.

179
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.990
Great.

180
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.180
So how do we call that.

181
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.170
Well let's get to the very last frame we couldn't change right sir.

182
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.630
Zero point five seconds out of track and hit.

183
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.150
Call method methods and functions are largely interchangeable.

184
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.870
What no m8 coin.

185
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.400
And I can.

186
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.370
And now I can enter a new key I'm sure.

187
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.710
Right Click here to insert key and here all the different things I could do.

188
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.010
Well I happen to know what is called dice which would type it in script methods.

189
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.670
Di it's now gonna call that right here.

190
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.050
So if I press play the coin is okay the coin is there.

191
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.370
I've done it stupid.

192
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.330
In case you do this too.

193
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.350
I'm not gonna edit this out.

194
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.270
Got a coin.

195
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.240
Hit the animation player and just bring this all the way back.

196
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.180
We could do some function ready as well but make sure the animation is at the zero point.

197
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.310
Otherwise this is the property we'll show you.

198
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.770
So let's press play into the coin and leave and come back.

199
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.260
There isn't a coin I could even take a look at the same tree.

200
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.440
If you look at the scenery while the game is running remote this is what's actually in the game right

201
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:36.680
now.

202
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.210
So here we go on the coins.

203
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:44.200
There is nothing if I reload the level press remote coins.

204
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.510
Here's a coin.

205
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:45.940
Watch it.

206
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.240
The coin is gone.

207
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.540
This is a great way of seeing what's happening life in your life.

208
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.360
OK now let's have the coin make a noise.

209
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.990
So back into coin and we've got this audio stream 2D player.

210
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:04.800
Let's go into here and audio stream 2D player dot play one more time.

211
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.510
Back in the game there it goes.

212
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.620
Now maybe I don't want this in 2D maybe I actually just want to send the audio stream player.

213
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:19.100
So what I could do is just right click on it and you change type and the audio stream players the video

214
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.260
stream play today.

215
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.570
If I do that I just have to make sure this name still matches.

216
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.200
So I'm going to call this audio stream player because maybe I don't want positional information on the

217
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.220
coin.

218
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.800
Make sure that's the same name.

219
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.500
Press play another coin comes through both ears which great.

220
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.720
All right.

221
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.860
So that's looking pretty good.

222
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.630
However now let's update the actual game state so game state as we know is part of this group.

223
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.910
I'm sure I copy this name here go back into coin would be a brand new grip call so get tree do love

224
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:58.880
using group's core group and pace that game state and win the call one called coin up and we don't need

225
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.060
passing in their arguments every time this goes it's going to chasing other coins Great so now let's

226
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.980
go to game state and start putting coins.

227
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.160
So I need a variable called coins and it's going to start as zero.

228
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.710
Let's make a brand new function.

229
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.740
I'm going to put it above and gain because I don't I'm psychologically I feel like any game should be

230
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.920
last coin.

231
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.070
La la la la la.

232
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:33.320
Awesome coins plus equal one and now I want to update the gooey right 7 1/2 make a new function in the

233
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.820
gooey as well so get tree core group

234
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.210
gooey

235
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:53.440
update coins and a pass through the coins as argument great just exactly like update lives with some

236
00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.350
updated information let's open the gooey scene so I can actually see what this is called I've Got a

237
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.320
coin count right.

238
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:08.120
So that's the bit I'm going to I'm going to be changing so I've got a brand new function and a brand

239
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280
new pair of roller skates and you've got a brand new.

240
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:15.470
Now I'm sorry update coins coins.

241
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.720
Okay so we're going to be updating the text value in coin count.

242
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.130
Great some Italian coin count.

243
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.560
And there it is.

244
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.100
Dot text equals string coins.

245
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.130
Why string.

246
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.880
This is an integer text box needs a string.

247
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.250
So I need to cast this integer into a string.

248
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.330
Well that should work.

249
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:38.770
Let's find out.

250
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.050
I have zero coins.

251
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.990
I have one coin.

252
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.910
You might also notice I got 30 lines.

253
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.610
Why do I have 30 lives.

254
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.470
Honestly I was trying to do some bug fixing and I put the lives up like a contestant I forgot I've done

255
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.650
that.

256
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.140
Let's get rid of that and pretend nobody saw it.

257
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.100
So game states lives equals three.

258
00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.900
Don't tell anyone.

259
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.490
Okay cool.

260
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.480
So here's an interesting bug we've just created.

261
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:10.560
What happens if I leave the coin and come back in really quickly one coin just gave me three.

262
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.770
Why.

263
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:18.140
Because every time I enter this coin while it exists this function can be triggered.

264
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.750
That's a real problem because if I'm if I know that's there I can cheat the system especially if we

265
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.170
stop putting extra lives.

266
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:31.640
So before we go any further let's get rid of that bug and we'll put a new variable in here called taken.

267
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.770
He calls false.

268
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.890
Set it up as a boolean with a default value of false.

269
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:43.030
And now what if not taken which is another way of saying if taken not equals true.

270
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.960
And I'm just going to hide these numbers tab and bring them all in.

271
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.030
Taken equals true.

272
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:58.250
So if not taken set taken to true and now played and the moment this happens this coin can't be collected

273
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.490
anymore.

274
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.900
So let's go back to the game and try to try again great.

275
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.670
I have one coin.

276
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.570
Okay.

277
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:09.480
Next thing I want to do is I want make sure that if we collect enough coins the lives will go up.

278
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.130
This is gonna be a little bit sneaky.

279
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.620
Let's go into here first.

280
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:20.540
I need to set targets number of coins.

281
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.490
It's hard to find a good name for this isn't it.

282
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.680
Okay so this is how many coins you need for new life.

283
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.590
And let's start with 10 to get 10 coins.

284
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.710
You got the life.

285
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.220
Okay.

286
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:39.550
So now when we get a coin up we need to check to create a brand new variable called multiple of coins.

287
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.660
Do you have a multiple of this many coins.

288
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.330
Okay.

289
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.090
Doing it this way means I don't have to set the coins to zero.

290
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.050
So if you collect 10 coins or 100 coins whatever it is you don't see your coins vanish.

291
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.160
Which is great because seeing your coins vanish doesn't necessarily feel good.

292
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:54.450
Okay.

293
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.370
So what I want to do is set this is a true false value.

294
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.960
Do you have that amount of coins.

295
00:15:59.020 --> 00:15:59.370
So.

296
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:08.140
So my sneaky bit is this is coins modulated by target number of coins.

297
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:14.710
Okay so what this means is what's the leftover from here.

298
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:22.570
So if the left if I need 10 and I have 11 the leftover is one and I want this to be true with the leftover

299
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.980
is zero.

300
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:33.130
So let's talk about this is the variable multiple of coins is the same as the amount of coins left over

301
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
from the target number being zero.

302
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:44.320
So every time this value here coins has none left over from the Target line of coins every time it's

303
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.250
10 20 30 40.

304
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.160
This will be true any other time it'll be false.

305
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.800
Why am I doing that.

306
00:16:51.850 --> 00:17:01.800
Because now I can go if multiple of coins life up which is going to be a brand new functions for that

307
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.350
function.

308
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.750
Life up should probably put my coin up shouldn't I was coin up.

309
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.570
Oh it's right next to it.

310
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.010
Perfect.

311
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.380
I did put it there.

312
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.600
I'm a professional.

313
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.940
Okay.

314
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.730
Lives plus equal one.

315
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:22.020
And to do this we just need to update the lives so we get in fact just call update Gary because that

316
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.740
does update Gary and that update the lives.

317
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.470
It occurs to me update lives up there.

318
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:34.300
Gary should be a single function so let's call this update gooey and is recovering and lives and coins

319
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.830
and now this could be update Gary.

320
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:47.180
And let's go back to the gooey script and here under update lives let's rename this to update.

321
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.390
I put capitals there.

322
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.260
Doo doo doo doo doo.

323
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.160
No I didn't.

324
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.660
That should be capitals subject gooey.

325
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.200
And it's to come with one argument of lives and another of queens are those in the right order.

326
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.510
Yes they are great.

327
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.100
So now I could just move this up and I can delete that line entirely.

328
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.970
So we have one function updates the gooey.

329
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.000
Okay so we now have a single update you either can bring lives and coins and a lot plate them each time.

330
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:19.300
And I have a life up there and update the gooey I've got a coin up the complete gooey it's looking pretty

331
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.570
good.

332
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.230
I think we'll get to go.

333
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.870
Let's test it out

334
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:31.180
please wait please wait please work my extra life.

335
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.050
Look at that.

336
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:32.480
Okay.

337
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.210
I'm feeling pretty good about that.

338
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.150
So I think we're in a good position.

339
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.800
I'd like you to make money rich please.

340
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:44.110
Coins aren't a level you can lead the play it's cool areas or show them risky things that they could

341
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.290
try out with coins so give that a shot you can use clusters with single coins in but post the video.

342
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.380
Make this your own.

343
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.930
And when you come back I'll do the same.

344
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.830
And welcome back.

345
00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:02.130
So before I place them I'm going to switch off spinny and save that just so I can actually work with

346
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.960
it first and make sure that I've got a coin selected and I'm in move mode so she will get a coin and

347
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.220
let's move you over here

348
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.330
and what I'll do is once I've got a few here

349
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.730
I'll save make sure I not lose that well at work and you should be up here and you should be up here.

350
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.660
So that's get the play down here.

351
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:36.540
And down here as well and occurs to me some of these are not very easy to escape but that's all right.

352
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.870
And let's put some by these bouncy things that's gonna be fun.

353
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.360
And some of it here and safe

354
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.010
and he got this area.

355
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.020
This can be hard to spots on the show the play this is a secret.

356
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.670
Like so

357
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.540
and you know let's put a jump at there.

358
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.500
So back to my jump pants

359
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.660
duplicate that you over here.

360
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.990
Perfect.

361
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.070
And just in case that's not easy.

362
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.190
I'm going to add a new tile here.

363
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.190
So let's put my small tile light.

364
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.320
So let's see how it's looking so far.

365
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.070
And before any further let's go back to the coins and switch on the animation and press play

366
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:42.710
OK.

367
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.790
These coins are way too loud.

368
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.830
So let's do minus 15 and try that again.

369
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.370
I forgot from pick up 10 coins at once.

370
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.880
I won't hit a sound ten times

371
00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.400
though.

372
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.610
Awesome.

373
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.250
So so far it's looking pretty good.

374
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.690
I'm actually pretty happy with that.

375
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.570
I'm a stop here for now.

376
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.490
So in this video we've looked at the animation play an ode which is a really powerful note and a brief

377
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.960
introduction to key frames.

378
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.990
We've also looked at calling functions and animation player which can do all kinds of cool stuff.

379
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.010
So how's your level looking where do you put in a bunch of coins are you even more generous than I am

380
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.500
with my coins or are you a little bit more realistic.

381
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.280
How's it looking.

382
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.870
Is it too difficult too easy.

383
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.020
Show your progress and fight.

384
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.940
I'm really curious.

385
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.180
You guys have got meanwhile great stuff.

386
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.390
And I'll see you on the next video.
