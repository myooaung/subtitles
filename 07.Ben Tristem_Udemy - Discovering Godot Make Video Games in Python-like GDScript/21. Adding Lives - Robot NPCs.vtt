00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.530
Hello again you glorious God.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.820
People in this video we're going to put life where life previously did not exist were going to add lives

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.310
to robots.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.870
Here's what I'm thinking.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.440
Robots are a kind of character we need to remember that because they're going to inherit a lot of things

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.180
so when we start adding lives to robots a lot of the work can be done in character and player can you

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.460
know get the same information or characters are going to have limited lives.

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.100
I'm going to make this simple for myself and say that robots and players all have the same amount of

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.080
light but we don't necessarily have to do that because I've made that decision.

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.970
I know that the life count can just go in the character script and then I don't have to put it in robots

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.510
and players.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.890
But if you wanted them to be different you would have to split that between the robot and player scripts.

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.720
I also want to make sure that a character hit by food is hurt if that food was fired for a different

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.810
character type.

15
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.800
In other words if either player fire food at the wall and bounces back and hits me I won't take damage.

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.660
More importantly the robot at the back of the road who fires at me and accidentally hits another robot

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.280
won't damage that robot.

18
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.660
That's key.

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.110
That means I'm going to need something called a character type.

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.470
So let's get started with the.

21
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.910
Actually before we get started this is looking a bit too gloomy for me so I know I certainly get started

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.990
but instead let's go into the template level just right here and it's directional light.

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410
I'm actually just going to make this a little bit brighter.

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.600
How about one point five.

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.080
See how that looks on a save that and go back it's my level.

26
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.510
That's looking a little sunnier.

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.470
I'm happy with that.

28
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.680
So now let's get started with the simple stuff.

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.240
If I'm going to put most of these changes in a character script I'm a start and character script I make

30
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.180
a new variable and it can be called lives.

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.070
And what do we start with three.

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.400
I'm not going to make this an export very well.

33
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.050
The reason why is character dodgy is not access directly at any point.

34
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.620
Right we never see any room scene so there's nothing I can click on to see any inspector.

35
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.120
So what variable would be a complete waste of time.

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.330
Admittedly the only time I'm wasting is explaining it.

37
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.370
But that's why I'm not adding it as an export variable.

38
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.230
It won't actually export.

39
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.680
Okay so we now have lives.

40
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.360
Now if you remember in any of my scripts folder and get my robot script as well.

41
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.410
We put our hearts function in here it is player and another one in Robot.

42
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.530
I actually don't need to do that.

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.460
I'm going to delete both of these.

44
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.240
And actually if we run the game right now it won't crash because enough reject our script.

45
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.220
We're checking does the thing I'm hitting have this method.

46
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.560
If it doesn't that's right nothing will happen but I want all characters to be able to be hurt so they're

47
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.200
going to have the same method.

48
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.230
Going to have a function called.

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.370
And let's start with something licensable like it's minus equal 1.

50
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.780
Now this is the simplest it can possibly be.

51
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.880
I also want to put in a couple of other things.

52
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.450
Let's open the actual character sees and click on scenes to get the characters and click on characters.

53
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.590
This is our basic character and I'm put in a new node is going to an audio stream player 3 similar call

54
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.000
this hurts.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.540
As you can call it hurt SFX because as if x is a sound effect and that's just a little clear in my head

56
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:34.440
open SFX and in here we should have something called hit hurt an I you a play that make sure this isn't

57
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.110
looping.

58
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.200
It is not looping.

59
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.960
Fantastic.

60
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.930
I guess go back into scripts and for some reason it now exists in two places at once which is very helpful.

61
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.800
I'm on a close one of them just to make sure that I'm not saving on place not the other.

62
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.860
And I want to play the sound effects are gonna go hurt.

63
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.930
SFX not play so right now we have a variable called lives which is just going to decrease by 1.

64
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.840
Every time any character is heard and we can hear that if we want to play the game.

65
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.390
And again nice and big screen for you can hear.

66
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.140
Admittedly it does nothing right it's just a variable that goes down nobody can see it and it doesn't

67
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.810
do anything so we can have to add a couple more things first thing to do is check lives so back into

68
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.800
full screen.

69
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.510
Give myself some room seeker see what I'm doing a alesia going to make a new function called check wives.

70
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.110
So let's make that rate here.

71
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.350
I like a function check and lives.

72
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.290
And what does this do.

73
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.500
It's just going to check right so if full lives is zero.

74
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.030
Die now.

75
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.890
There is a possible edge case in theory if two pieces of food hit a character at exactly the same time

76
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.680
we would actually go past zero not his zero.

77
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.410
Honestly the odds of that happening are so small.

78
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.780
It's pretty much impossible.

79
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.450
But it is theoretically possible so what I could do is just go if it's less than one.

80
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.170
So if you have less than one life die that way if we jump immediately negative one it'll work.

81
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:30.930
Clearly we need a dye function so for now I'm going to put dye as it's not fi die as a simple q free

82
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.360
again.

83
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.950
Now if I press play.

84
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.020
And I'm very careful.

85
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.270
It grabs grab ammunition.

86
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.390
I get it if I hit the robot's enough time scope's without getting hit by self I might actually not make

87
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.940
it.

88
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.740
Yeah.

89
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.280
OK.

90
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.420
So what happened here is I died.

91
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.970
I as the player died and there is nothing to have left so I Q freed.

92
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.220
It's that I've got the camera on the player sort of like you freed.

93
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.940
There's no camera scene a storming.

94
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.210
So that's working.

95
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.670
However friendly fire is still on now at the moment the projectile is said to ignore myself so I can't

96
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.390
shoot myself.

97
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.580
But the robots can shoot each other which is a little tricky to actually make work but it can happen.

98
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.320
I'm going to stay in the middle here and try and avoid their food.

99
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.430
There it goes.

100
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.190
So in your way of making sure that doesn't happen.

101
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.250
So what I want to do is edit the bullet so let's get out of distraction free mode although I don't need

102
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.530
this bit and it's go back into the scenes and into ammo and open projectile.

103
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.640
And his projector script.

104
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.040
I want a variable here.

105
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.790
It's going to be variable fired by.

106
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.070
What I'm going to do is mark the bullet with who fired it.

107
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.710
OK.

108
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:58.430
So save that and go into character and I can add something right here.

109
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.510
So bullets got fired by.

110
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.440
Equals.

111
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.010
Equals what.

112
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.970
I mean I could do equal self.

113
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.500
But that doesn't actually solve my problem because the robots are going to be different nodes and if

114
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.000
I have a low level in say six robots or if I were to turn this into a multiplayer game I didn't want

115
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.590
players to shoot each other.

116
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.950
That would be an issue.

117
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.060
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a different kind of variable.

118
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.180
And in none.

119
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:31.390
So for now let's comment this out so God stops complaining and let me tell you about oenomaus enaam

120
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.040
stands for enumerator.

121
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.950
It's a specific kind of variable that has a list of valid States which I'm going to define a boolean

122
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.970
could be thought of as a very simple name it has to states.

123
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.070
True or false.

124
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.750
But we could make a specific in some chord.

125
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:52.940
Is this true and have yes no maybe and banana and those are the valid sets we can have.

126
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.300
So arms are a variable with a limited range of values.

127
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.690
If I set character types and I say play at an NPC a valid character types and then I write bystander

128
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.660
and it's not in that limited range of values.

129
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.820
It just won't work.

130
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.980
We're going to write like this in um the name of the variable and then curly brackets value one value

131
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.290
to and we can keep going.

132
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.680
So in our specific case I'm going to make character type my name so in some character type and then

133
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.930
in curly brackets player an NPC.

134
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.560
Then when I want to use it to set the character type to character type in caps dot whatever it is when

135
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.530
I put it right here on the table are my constants.

136
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.840
Because reasons um and calling it character types which I'm going to put in caps because this is a constant

137
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.270
We're not going to change this at runtime and then akali brackets.

138
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.620
I'm mean right player and NPC.

139
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.580
Each value is separated by a comma.

140
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.020
Now we have curly brackets but it's not a dictionary.

141
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.340
How do I know if it was a dictionary.

142
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.470
It would have a key.

143
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.940
This doesn't have a key.

144
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.860
OK so we have this in um but I also want a variable called character type.

145
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.990
This is going to be in some in lower case small case lower case because these will be changed at run

146
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.210
time and character types to indicate this is a plural.

147
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.940
So I'm going to make this as unconfusing But as readable as I can.

148
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.190
I want to save that and go into a robot.

149
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.450
Dr. Judy and right here and ready.

150
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.010
I'm going to go character type

151
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:34.200
eagle's character dot helps underscore types dot NPC.

152
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.230
And we now know what kind of character and pieces let's let's the same employer.

153
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.210
Now we don't currently I believe have a ready function and we've put one in right at the top.

154
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.610
The function underscored the ready.

155
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.210
And you can set character type

156
00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.690
equals character types got player.

157
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.130
And if I've done this right I think I have we should be fine how on evidence right.

158
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.070
I press play and it actually runs that throwing up an error.

159
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.710
Great.

160
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.200
So now I'm back to my character script and I'm giving you this bullet fired by.

161
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:20.400
So uncomment that bullet fired by calls character type.

162
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.050
And double checking my projectile that I've actually got the find by value in there.

163
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.810
Awesome.

164
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.520
OK.

165
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.320
So far so good.

166
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.360
But if I look at hurt fired by isn't actually passed from the projectile.

167
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.870
So I wanted to come in as an argument fired why.

168
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.130
So let's go back to projectile and bring it through.

169
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.690
Save that.

170
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:49.440
So now hurt is taking this argument fired by it which means we now know who threw that piece of food

171
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.210
that hit me which brings me to the challenge.

172
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:58.170
I would like you to disable friendly fire change character dodgy so that characters can't be hurt by

173
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.860
food fired from the same character type for pause a video.

174
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.520
Give that a shot.

175
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.290
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

176
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.630
Mark Mack.

177
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:10.840
Okay.

178
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:16.560
So what I'm gonna do is I'm sure to put an IF condition in his I'm alert take all these press tab which

179
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.240
don't move one by one.

180
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.890
And now at my death in here.

181
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.740
So if character type.

182
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.960
Does not equal fired by.

183
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.200
I've also realized that fired by is a little disingenuous here.

184
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.840
I want to change the name of the event as it comes in just to make it more readable hurt by now this

185
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:43.320
will work fine because remember the way that Python like language is work it doesn't actually matter

186
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.630
what this value is called in any other script or in any other function.

187
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.400
It only matters what we're calling it here.

188
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.260
So now robots can't hurt each other.

189
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.610
Now this is going to be a little bit hard to tell right.

190
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.420
It's very hard to see the robot firing at the best time.

191
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.620
So what I'm to do is I will remove this bullet ad collision exception itself.

192
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:06.090
So one thing to do is I'm a check can the player hurt themself.

193
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.520
So I mean here.

194
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.630
Fire some food

195
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:21.120
and the food is being is colliding with the players so it's not actually leaving but the player isn't

196
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.220
taking damage.

197
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.600
So I can uncomment this line so that the projectile will actually leave this collision volume.

198
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.420
And I think this is a great place to stop this video in this video we've looked at making and using

199
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:39.600
enough variables or even arms with given life to robots and we've disabled friendly fire.

200
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.590
We're getting close to a fully functional again.

201
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.020
Excellent work.

202
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.390
And I'll see you in the next video.
