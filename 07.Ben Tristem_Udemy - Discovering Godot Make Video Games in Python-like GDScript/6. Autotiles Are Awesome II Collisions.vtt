00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.880
Hello again you Gloria's got to people in this video we're gonna continue talking about auto tiles specifically

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.860
working with collisions working with collisions in auto tiles is not too different from working with

3
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.060
bit masks but there are a couple of important differences.

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.370
First you need to know is that you need to set up every tile individually.

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.440
Now the bit mask we painted the bit mask on to the tiles as one image.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.510
But here we need to select the tile you want put the collision on and then select the next tile.

7
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.400
Second thing you can set the whole tile or part of the tile to have collision.

8
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.850
In our case pretty much all the tiles me the whole time which can save time.

9
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.220
But I will show you how do part of the tile.

10
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.030
So first I want to get into my game and I'm going to over levels and open up template level.

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.200
Here I have an empty thing and I could just test it by drawing some stuff.

12
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.120
Here is a floor here some walls.

13
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.440
Great.

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.110
So still there.

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.910
Now let's take a look at our tile map.

16
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.370
What TILE SET rather want to make this nice and big.

17
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.540
Click on the tile sheet and make sure we're in the right tile the press right.

18
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.170
And which one are you.

19
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.550
Those are the floors I'm pressing bit mosque which they should show up on the right.

20
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.450
But I'm actually doing it.

21
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.540
OK.

22
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.450
Here is the one we want.

23
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.640
So what I need to do is add collision to this.

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.650
Now if I press the collision tab up here and I can press the little name so we can see these are the

25
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.100
walls.

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.440
These are the floors.

27
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.740
I know I'm dealing with these areas.

28
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.860
Let's zoom in a bit a little tricky because my cat is on my hand while I'm on the keyboard.

29
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.330
Thank you caboodle.

30
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.800
You don't want to ever do that name gets in the way.

31
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.960
You'll notice that most of these walls are solid all the way through.

32
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.860
So here we have a half full.

33
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
Here we have a round wall that's gonna be a pain but most of these are sort of the way through which

34
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.790
means we can actually just set up a full collision.

35
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.610
So if I select the tile I want and then press this square and click it.

36
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.210
We don't have collision on that tile but only that tile so I need to click each one that I want which

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.600
is going to be a little bit time consuming.

38
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.910
So the tile press the thing.

39
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.770
Press it again.

40
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.540
Tile per square press.

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.710
Again this is much better than it was in 3.0.

42
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.660
It's still a little fiddly a little time consuming but it doesn't really want to automate it too much.

43
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.920
Now what happens if I don't want to use the whole square.

44
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.630
What happens if I want to use part of the square let's say I'm going to have both of these as possible

45
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.350
pillars.

46
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.690
But this one isn't the full system first thing to do is set my snap options so it's going to hit a snap

47
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.890
options.

48
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.420
And right now we're at 64.

49
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.780
I want to make sure that my grid is as big as it can be but as small as it has to be.

50
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.060
So let's bring you down to a start with eight eight is actually pretty solid isn't it OK.

51
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.700
So that's getting most of it.

52
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.500
It's not all of it.

53
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.040
So try for and you can see even four isn't doing and I do want to keep it snaps if I didn't care about

54
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.550
the outside red line of this let's move up a 64 so now she's up to about this outline it wouldn't matter

55
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.540
too much but I do.

56
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.190
So you know what let's just put it all the way to one which is a terrible zoom level but it is what

57
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.120
it is.

58
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.850
There we go.

59
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.310
OK.

60
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.510
Little time consuming now I'm going to click the polygon and I've got to add these in just the right

61
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.140
place.

62
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.360
So let's let you first.

63
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.630
Now at the polygon One two three four and close.

64
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.250
Now if I need to move any of these I can I can drag them around as you can see not ideal so it's bringing

65
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.230
you back to 64 by 64 and zoom right out.

66
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.650
There we go.

67
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.720
It's a little easier with these half holes now as it happens these hopefuls will never happen because

68
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.610
our tiles are 64 by 64.

69
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.000
There is no instance where our Tom map is going to let these ones happen but just to show how that work.

70
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.310
Let's do a slightly easier version so let's do a 32 by 32 tile map.

71
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.010
Select this one polygon and now it's a lot easier right because I can only place these polygons where

72
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.910
the grid will let me.

73
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.780
That's nice and quick.

74
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.510
I mean I say nice and quick I still have to do it manually.

75
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.070
Why do I have to do each one manually.

76
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.820
Because God doesn't know which part of the tile I actually want to have collision which one I don't.

77
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.540
So it's just gonna assume everything needs to be done manually.

78
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.360
So let's just zoom for these and you know I might actually fast forward this one

79
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.300
OK so that's what I'm really looking at right now at the moment I met you in the lead this collision

80
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.670
course I'm not using that time like to click my bit mosques.

81
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.890
I'm not using any of these three if I want these circle ones.

82
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.170
I've got a much more difficult problem right.

83
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.360
Because assuming I don't want to see a square collision I want a square collision.

84
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.280
This is easy.

85
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.440
Whoops was given to you go back to collisions forswear collision.

86
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.030
I could just do what I've been doing right.

87
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.560
This whole tile is now colliding.

88
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:40.470
But what if I want a more precise than what I need to do a switch snap off and try and match this as

89
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.340
well as I can.

90
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.380
And frankly this is no fun at all.

91
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.100
I just dislike this intensely so I'm not going to use this.

92
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.760
I'm not going to.

93
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.700
But if you want to.

94
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.560
That's how you do it.

95
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.760
Let's zoom out a bit.

96
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.410
I'm not sure why zooming out like that.

97
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.610
OK.

98
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.020
So now we need a way of testing this.

99
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.120
Now I'm not just testing that the tiles can be placed.

100
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.020
I know they can be placed.

101
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.420
I need to test that they stop the player to do that.

102
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.340
We need to bring the player in and that's really be my challenge for you.

103
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.260
I'd like you to prepare to test the altered tiles.

104
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.580
Bring an instance of the player into the template level seen every single level is going to have a player.

105
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.660
So let's add it to the template that's going to allow us to test the collision and the alter tiles.

106
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.590
If you want to you can also add a camera to denote as a child of the player so that the player will

107
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.970
always be in the center of the screen.

108
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.950
So post a video give it a shot.

109
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.660
And when you come back I'll show you my solution

110
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.600
and walk back.

111
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.800
OK.

112
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.220
So let's instance in a player.

113
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.450
So here's my template level.

114
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.990
I'm going to press instance which is this chain link.

115
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.730
And right now we only have foreseen.

116
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.890
So player and there is the player.

117
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.950
OK.

118
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.420
So the play is up there.

119
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.230
That means when I play this scene from the Dubai play scene up here players on the top left corner.

120
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.860
That's not useful so I need the play to be the center.

121
00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.580
So I'm going to add in a child note and that's going to be a camera 2d to make it current.

122
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.000
I'm not going to set it is rotating because it makes me dizzy.

123
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.730
But now we have a camera and the player is roughly in the center.

124
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.910
We can't really see what's happening because I mean I'm still moving when to the edge here but it's

125
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.770
roughly working.

126
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:25.600
If I put it is rotating the player is always me facing the same way not what I want.

127
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.170
OK.

128
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.200
So how do I know that's working.

129
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.470
Well let's put a level so let's make you nice and big and zoom out.

130
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.640
There we go.

131
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:43.950
Let's put in a floor so Libertyville buddy Billy Bob and I'm going to do a bucket fill.

132
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.510
I didn't realize it would finish that.

133
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.230
That's handy.

134
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:55.070
And now I'm just going to make a little wobbly section let's put a couple pillars maybe a pillar of

135
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.850
here and

136
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.230
a little running around a bit.

137
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.580
OK.

138
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.430
Test the same.

139
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.130
So now I make this nice and big.

140
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.740
The camera will follow the plan once the play gets the edge

141
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.850
and you can see the walls are stopping the plan and that's everything we need.

142
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.960
Now their mind if you want to add different order tiles you see the same exact thing.

143
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:30.590
So let's say we want to go back into Tom apps let's say we want to add these walls here all these concrete

144
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.490
walls is that concrete.

145
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.260
I think that's concrete.

146
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.040
We'd have to repeat the entire process over again.

147
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.770
In other words first making you oughta tile then we define our region then I'm going to put in our bit

148
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.730
masks then we're going to put in a collision later in the series we'll also be adding inclusions had

149
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.400
these walls who cast shadows and we might want a bit of navigation.

150
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.370
So the more these we add in the more work it is.

151
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.230
But once it's there we can make levels very quickly.

152
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.860
Right.

153
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.070
So I can make a little shed like make an outside section and the tile map would actually let you do

154
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.310
that.

155
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.400
I look at these sprites again we have outside sections we have parking lots or it could be a research

156
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.570
Bay or whatever you want.

157
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.860
Lots of office bits the furniture can come in later the lighting can come in later.

158
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.020
Not entirely sure what the deal is with this concrete wall but it's kind of awesome and I think really

159
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.220
that's everything I to cover so let's add the video there.

160
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.950
In this video how to add collisions to alter tiles nice and simple which just builds upon what we already

161
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.910
knew and we're now going to go with him.

162
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.230
So excellent work and I'll see you on the next video.
