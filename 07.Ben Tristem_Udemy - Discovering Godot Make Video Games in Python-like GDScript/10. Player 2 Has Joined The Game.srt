00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,040
Hello again wonderful God opiate or in this video we're going to bring player to into the game what

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,630
we want is to be able to control both players on the same keyboard in one script.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,070
I don't want to second script.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,470
I don't want to inherit from a script that has all the movement.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,810
I want both players use the same script and nice and simply decide what key it has to use before we

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,360
do that let's bring the play in.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,880
So I'm actually gonna start with that challenge list mix things up.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,340
I'd like you to bring player to into the scene and the real challenge here is not instancing a player

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,600
that's easy.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,770
The real challenge is remember that one of the players should have that blue material.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,520
Unless you've made a material that's a different colour in which case they should have that.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,200
So pause the video give them a shot and when you happy with the results come back and I'll show you

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,000
my solution.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm ok back.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,670
Okay.

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,450
So the first thing we can do is we can just instance in a scene.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,990
There's actually an easy an even easier thing we can do even easier.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,030
It was an easy thing to say.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,320
We can just duplicate the player so there is another instance of the player you know to have player

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,690
one facing the right direction so scana does a rotation usually at 90 degrees.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,310
Great.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:14,880
OK.

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,430
So I've decided that this is my blue character in order to make that happen.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,540
There's a couple of things I could do.

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,850
I could do this in script that is possible right.

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,390
And to do that I would put in the ready function if your play a one how the defining play a one change

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,260
that that's doable.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,330
However there's an easier way of doing this.

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,170
We have to edit all children.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,160
And that allows me to edit all the children of the instance right so it's still the same instance I'm

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,840
just editing the instance itself.

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,970
I'm not editing the scene.

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,960
So now if I go into cube doods the actual mash and I find the material I can drop in the material so

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,150
let's go to models.

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
Cube dude and there's my blue material.

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,620
Areas.

37
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,850
Now this will remain true while editable children's open.

38
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,770
If I make this non-adaptive or children it's not going to get rid of the information but when I press

39
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,590
play.

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,630
He's green and I don't want to great.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,750
I want to be blue.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,260
Let's make him eligible children again and press play.

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,860
And now it's checking for the differences.

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,450
A case of soliloquizing got.

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,200
If you're changing something an inspector of an is an editable child of an instance.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
You need to keep that innocence editable.

47
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,820
OK so right now we have two players.

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,820
However this ball bounces a little bit crazy isn't it.

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,130
However they're both using the same control.

50
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,360
So what I've got is a glorified foosball table controller right there.

51
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,600
They're effectively the same character in two places.

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,510
Which is kind of weird and slightly awesome.

53
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's close this window because the bouncing ball is making me a little bit dizzy and I'm going to just

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
turn the Bout's down.

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,970
You can have a bouts of zero point to five for an hour.

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,860
What we do is we can take out the keybindings and say and make a variable called up verbal could down

57
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,970
etc. and then we could bring that script out of here and extend that script to play one and it sent

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,500
a different script and play it too.

59
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,660
But I don't want to do that.

60
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,620
I want to get this very simple.

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:22,710
Instead we're going to just slightly alter this part of the script Take a look at how input is working.

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay so input.

63
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,860
That's a you know basic function is action pressed and then there's a string.

64
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,310
Let's go to the slides.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,630
Input is action is action whether it's pressed or just pressed is checking for a string and that input

66
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,070
not the node but the actual key binding or the joypad direction whatever it is.

67
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,840
We can give that any string name we like.

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,940
Okay so it doesn't have to be y up there.

69
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,130
The default one for if you're using UI elements.

70
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,710
If we wanted to we could call it use we could call it high.

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,040
We did that before right used disguise whatever it is we can call that string anything we want.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,920
And we know how to can catinat strings because we did that a lot in luny lips that was what that project

73
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,420
was.

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,790
So why don't we can castigate the players number in.

75
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,920
We just have to create a variable called something like play idae make an export variable so that we

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,340
could just change it the inspector and then do something like this.

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,740
Input is action.

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,150
Pressed up can cat an 8 player idae.

79
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,830
So let's do exactly that.

80
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:34,500
First I need to go into project settings and into input map because I need to put those in right because

81
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,910
right now we're using these you line up down left right.

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,970
I don't need to delete those I don't need to touch them I'm just going to new you once gonna start with

83
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,620
them up one and then up too.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,990
All I'm doing is typing in the action and adding it and it's showing up here got no keybindings yet.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:05:00,900
I'll do that the Second I've done up let's do right it's going clockwise right 1 right two down one

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,480
down to

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,110
left 1.

88
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Left to great.

89
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,220
So now let's put the binding since I on to press the plus sign.

90
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,220
It's a key.

91
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,460
My left hand side my player ones can have the B C D.

92
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,670
My pleasure to have cursor so pesky B.

93
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:31,120
Let's be up a while ago a guy looks at the right one.

94
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes I have right.

95
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,340
Writes

96
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,690
down.

97
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,650
Do do do do.

98
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,080
I could fast for this but frankly it's actually pretty quick.

99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,950
It's probably worth it just to show you the entire process and that's it that's all process.

100
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,570
Now we need to replace some strings and this is the bit that gets a little bit tedious because we're

101
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,650
using a dynamic language right so we can't just say okay renamed is variable.

102
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,670
So what I do is I go instead of you I up.

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,460
This is now Karpe underscore and then the plate number.

104
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,570
So percentage desk's I am congratulating a string and what string I can catch and eating while going

105
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,340
to make one let's make a new export very we'll put it right here.

106
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:20,330
But the speed export variable where I d and the default value is 1.

107
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,350
Okay so let's can kasak that in clear eyed.

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,710
And you know what there's up so let's just copy that and put it on the next line as well.

109
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,440
Unless you doubt something over here go down a scented show.

110
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,810
S close the string concatenates and play out.

111
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,560
I did.

112
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,950
But another one of those fellas just can't do this.

113
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,210
It's really readable.

114
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,840
I should probably put a space after the percentage because you know it's a little bit easier.

115
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,250
And same thing here.

116
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm on the pace that just get myself started this is left.

117
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,490
And let's copy that.

118
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
And same thing here.

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,120
But now we're doing right.

120
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:29,150
Now when I run this you'll see that I've missed the crucial part but the expert variable in let's actually

121
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,710
play to play areas.

122
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,310
So play ready to weather.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,980
I'm calling him because his name is cube dude and dude is normally male.

124
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,310
I haven't checked the gender preferences and now wct will control one character cursor errors or the

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,000
other.

126
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,510
And we have kaleb's isn't correct.

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,970
We have a to play game wasn't correct.

128
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,900
Probably because they didn't bind that correctly is going back to project settings.

129
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,380
What's up to you.

130
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,490
Is the wrong key I was wrong.

131
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay so it's now up.

132
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,650
Perfect.

133
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,060
One more time with feeling.

134
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,640
Curse.

135
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,110
There is a deep to play a local multiplayer game now.

136
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,540
As yet there's still something is missing we don't have a sound in the game.

137
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,960
We don't have any way of scoring.

138
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,440
We don't have a scoreboard.

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
We don't have actual games script but we do have the fundamentals in place.

140
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,770
We're off to a great start.

141
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,540
So in this video.

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,470
Nice and simple note quick when we've learned how to can catch any strings in order to make local multiplayer

143
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,390
controls work in one script on one device.

144
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,460
So excellent work.

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,820
I'll see you in the next video.
