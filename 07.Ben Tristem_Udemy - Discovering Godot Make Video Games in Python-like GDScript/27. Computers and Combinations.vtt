00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.370
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
Delightful God people in this video were going to make computers and make them use combinations.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.870
And when I say we're going to make computers we're doing it in-game.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.690
I'm not coming around to your house to build you a new policy.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.290
All right.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.810
So what needs to happen with these computers.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.870
Well I want the player to be in range to use the computer.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.970
Just like we did with doors and focus a lot of similarity here.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.660
You need to be with in a certain range to use the computer.

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.570
You can't just click on it from across the screen.

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.060
The computer is going to request a combination from that new combination generate a note from it and

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.920
that computer is going to then display the combination to the player and then transmit the combination

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.170
to relater locked doors.

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.560
Now that last bit we're not doing in this video which going to grab a random combination and show it

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.660
to the player.

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.350
So let's get started.

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340
First thing we need to do as you might expect is make a brand new scenes.

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110
Let's make a new scene.

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.560
My parents give me an area hoodie

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910
and I call this computer.

21
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.780
Let's give it a sprite So we know we're looking at an under graphics and PRNG tiles right down the bottom.

22
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.230
You'll see these two monitors.

23
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.520
I'm going to use this second one tile 5 3 7 because I feel like tar 5 3 6 is about 30.

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.740
So that's a nice flat screen watch that's going to be a computer.

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.320
Great.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.930
And I'm actually going to rotate this by 90 degrees because this right has been forward for everything

27
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.220
else.

28
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.900
So let's keep that you know nice and consistent.

29
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.630
Give me the computer an area to D.

30
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.200
Because we actually want it to work when the player is in.

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.010
Rachel It's make a collision shape.

32
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.690
Gleision shape to and I make a new rectangle shape.

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.400
Now remember this is an area to d not a physics body this collision shape is going to tack when people

34
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.770
enter or exit it.

35
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.330
Not going to stop people from entering next day.

36
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.540
Let me get my Some big I'm not going to centre on the computer and actually move it over this way.

37
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.390
So if the player is anywhere in this region it big they can use the computer.

38
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:19.130
Let's stop guessing at numbers and let's see I can make it at 32 on the X and zero on the Y.

39
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.640
And the extant is going to be 32 across all extend a little bit.

40
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.690
Now let's make it 48 across.

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.320
Great.

42
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.010
The reason I wanted this wide is there's going to be a desk here too.

43
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.890
So I want the player to have enough room 10 doesn't feel big enough so let's make it 64.

44
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.460
Hi Robert a bit too high.

45
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.250
Forty eight 32.

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.230
OK.

47
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.330
The plan needs to enter this area.

48
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.800
I also feel like when a player uses the computer that should be a little light that comes on I feel

49
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.840
like there's gonna be a fun little tricks so let's under a computer make a light too deep.

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.570
Then the like map and I'm going to use one of these to see the 599 or four six foot.

51
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.650
Let's go with 590.

52
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.650
And now I need to actually make sure that this light map is in the right place.

53
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.550
So to do that I'm going to transform it by 90 degrees.

54
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.960
It's face the right direction.

55
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.240
And then offset it by 32 a writer rotated it didn't.

56
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.090
So it's gone be zero on the X area and on the Y 32 maybe.

57
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.580
Let's take a look at that.

58
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.180
How's that textualist up.

59
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.870
Probably minus 30 to them.

60
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.480
Yes that's very great.

61
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.740
Now what I did there was a highlighted the note the like to denote so I could see exactly where that

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.930
offset is.

63
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.860
All right.

64
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.180
So now we have this lovely light coming in.

65
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.850
We have a couple more things.

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.860
First off I need to connect to this collision shape to a script so let's give computer a script actually

67
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.780
before we do that let's save the computer so into scenes computer save great let's give computer a script

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.660
and just like get real time to put it in the scripts folder.

69
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.560
There it is.

70
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.060
Let's give it a ready function so function ready.

71
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.620
There it is.

72
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.710
And I'm going to go dollar light to deal with that the today and go.

73
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.100
Enabled Eagles false.

74
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.290
So that moment you start switch the light off.

75
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.560
I also might change the colour a bit so let's make it a nice electronic Blue's thing.

76
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.220
There we go.

77
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.610
What I'm not gonna do is give this monitor an occlusion.

78
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.120
I'm not giving it light occlusion because it's going to be on a desk and I will give the desk what occlusions.

79
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.460
That's not going to work just to see what that looks like.

80
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.420
I'm going to incense that in to a desk.

81
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.550
And you know I'm on a make a desk so I can go play with it so it's make a nice piece of furniture and

82
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.860
pick a nice glass or wooden desk.

83
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.370
What do you think.

84
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.880
I'm thinking a wooden desk and I'm going to instance in a computer performance and sit in.

85
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.390
Let's make the no too deep.

86
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.010
But I mean organize them all by call them computers

87
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.420
and put it right the furniture.

88
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.530
And within that instance in an at will is new computers.

89
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.640
So that's a computer that's the right place.

90
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.000
And rotates.

91
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.290
Make sure everything is in the computer not the node lepidus.

92
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.190
Let's move that at it.

93
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.650
Okay.

94
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.030
What I can't see is where we a walk and to send us unhide the collision shape.

95
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.080
So the player has to be here.

96
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.300
Now I am also in a chair in here.

97
00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.870
The office chair the player can still get to the monitor and look it really tight so let's widen the

98
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.480
colours and shape a little further to the extant.

99
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.380
Let's actually not make it 32.

100
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.720
Let's make it 64.

101
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.810
Has that luck and that's often get to me.

102
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.440
All right so country we have a computer.

103
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.090
Let's go into the script and get some more functionality.

104
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.910
Now I know that I'm going to have a few more variables.

105
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.340
I'm going to have a can click.

106
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.620
I know this because we've already solved this problem.

107
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.300
And as can be said to FOSS I also know that we can have a combination.

108
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.790
Which at the moment I dont need to set.

109
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.890
By the end of this video we're going to have a computer that I can click on get a pop up window with

110
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.470
the combinations at the for that to work before we even grab the combination.

111
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.820
Let's make the pop up.

112
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.930
I will take this as another new scene.

113
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.530
In fact you know what let's not make it as a new scene yet.

114
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.320
Let's make it as a child scene and then I'll show you how to make that amusing.

115
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.220
So let's make a child of computer and we've got to make a canvas lair.

116
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.530
Why.

117
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.540
Because I want the window in the centre of the screen.

118
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.890
I don't want it in the centre of the computer.

119
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.520
And as a child of canvas where can you pop up.

120
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.970
Well of course this computer pop up

121
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.070
and to make the new scene I'm going to go save branch as seen and give this brand name computer pop

122
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.750
up there goes in scenes.

123
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.290
There it is.

124
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.150
So let's go to the computer pop up.

125
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.250
If you didn't see what I just did.

126
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.690
I went to the node I want to make a new scene and then I scroll down so I saw make branch you seen it.

127
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.870
Now it's a scene.

128
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.070
Right so we now have a pop up we can make an rabbit pop up will be hidden by default.

129
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.030
Let's start just like we did before with a nine patch texture rectangle.

130
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.070
Now that's rectangle.

131
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.750
I'm going back up to my interface folder.

132
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:52.180
So graphics interface pge and I'm feeling a nice metal panel buttons of will vanish Well there's one

133
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.990
metal panel.

134
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.650
You'll do drag you over the texture that's come with a better size.

135
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.030
So it's a good size so I want wider and wider on the excellence.

136
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.190
Call you 600.

137
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.290
And how about for 80 let's actually use real sizes.

138
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.110
Saving that now rectangle.

139
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.650
I need you to on the layout to be a full rectangle.

140
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.270
Awesome.

141
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.600
I'm now thinking this isn't the right thing because I don't want those little bolts in it so let's change

142
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.340
metal panel to the other metal panel.

143
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.740
Yeah much better.

144
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.360
Alright patch margin.

145
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.050
How about this.

146
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.140
Twenty one all callers.

147
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.620
That's pretty good.

148
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.470
I like that.

149
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.680
Let's give it an another layer.

150
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:47.220
This was going to be the actual screen so let's make a child of sent to pop up in another nine patch.

151
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.550
And this was going to be glass panel.

152
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:56.300
And just like the Lawrence can be full rectangle and then give it 12.

153
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.850
That feels good 12.

154
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.280
And now let's make it look more like a scream.

155
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.540
Going to margin and just giving a margin of 12 in each direction.

156
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.630
Why messing with 12.

157
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.480
I'll be honest.

158
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.490
Not entirely sure.

159
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.970
The 12 the left sort of the top.

160
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.650
How about minus 12 to the right and minus 12 from the bottom.

161
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.600
I think you should do more than that so let's change that for 20.

162
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.200
Okay.

163
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.220
Looking a bit better.

164
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.430
I actually think that's right as well let's make this look much more like a monitor.

165
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.960
And that's sprite's going to be this nice green dot.

166
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.800
Shows and texture and green dot you can live over here.

167
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.060
You probably need to be a bit smaller aren't you.

168
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.640
So let's make you point five by point five.

169
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.450
And it's on display.

170
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.810
One more thing we need I need actual rich text labels so let's put that in.

171
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.910
And same as before what would make it exactly the same size as the second line patch rectangle.

172
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.050
In fact well should do is just copy these parameters.

173
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.630
Copy these parameters.

174
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.800
And paste them right here.

175
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.150
And I now have a rich text level final thing.

176
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.940
Let's go to the root node and give it a theme as load the theme of theme.

177
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.580
Yes because now when I type any text into my rich text label and going to be code so enable my baby

178
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:31.560
code and I'm going to write test and you can see we've already kept those words okay back into our computer.

179
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.530
How do I make this work.

180
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.100
Well we've got computer pop up right here.

181
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.990
What I need to do is just like you did with the door in fact let's open the door and take a quick look

182
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.990
at the back of the scripts take a look at the door.

183
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.710
We have a function on the door body entered.

184
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.730
It's the player.

185
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.620
Then you can click and if the player leaves phos I'm actually going to get rid of some of these conditions

186
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.080
by making sure that I set my collisions.

187
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.160
Let's go back to the computer and on the computer.

188
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.230
Let's take a look at our collisions.

189
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.730
I'm going take it completely off any layer and it can only interact with the player and that's going

190
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.640
to make that much simpler.

191
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.210
So let's make a signal.

192
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.580
On body entered and connect that to itself.

193
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.930
So on body entered do a thing we also want to do the same thing with one body existed.

194
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.580
And what's going to happen when you enter a can click gl's.

195
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.700
True.

196
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.550
And when you leave it's fossey and

197
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.280
I also want to switch the light back off and it's false.

198
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:45.220
If you leave the area and the light happens to be on that set it to fog so light to dot enabled people's

199
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.620
false alright on one thing to do.

200
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.920
What happens when you click on it.

201
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:57.610
Well this can be an input event is less a function inputs event input underscore event memory because

202
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.100
I'm not measuring is there input I'm saying is there input on this object so input.

203
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.360
Okay so I need to make sure that being clicked on and you can be you.

204
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:17.690
So if input dot is mouse button pressed and which mouse have any read button left there it is.

205
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.550
So if the left mouse button is pressed and can click I don't need to say can click is true because that's

206
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.670
implicit.

207
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.640
Then what do we get to do we're going to do pop up.

208
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.820
We use pop up centred.

209
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.370
Amber also turned the light on.

210
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.720
In fact there is a small thing.

211
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.700
I do need it to actually be part of a layer.

212
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.980
Someone put this on the torain layer So computers are now part of the train.

213
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.680
We can make a new furniture layer later if we want to but that's fine for now.

214
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.950
Okay so what I'm expecting is the place to have to walk into this area.

215
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.320
Click on the computer or let's find out.

216
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.770
Down here sneak past the guard.

217
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.780
Come see me.

218
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.370
Great.

219
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.300
Click on it.

220
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.000
Fantastic.

221
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.270
I make this nice big you can see this nice light right here.

222
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.020
I mean that the way it goes.

223
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.450
Okay so what you need now is for the monitor to disappear when I move out the way.

224
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.290
Back in the script.

225
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.440
When you exit.

226
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.500
I need to make sure that's computer pop up.

227
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.830
Hide.

228
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.190
Okay.

229
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.190
It's all we have now is a computer that'll bring a pop up.

230
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.540
Let's grab the combination and pass that down to the screen.

231
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.490
To do that we're gonna need a function called generate combination or maybe get combination.

232
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.960
Let's see.

233
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.430
Yeah generate combination.

234
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.890
No other combination can be varying lengths.

235
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:04.870
So let's put a combination length in as an export variable so export variable combination or late.

236
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.020
Some of the default form.

237
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:12.320
Okay let's take a look at level 1 and explore this scene tree.

238
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.430
What's going to happen is this computer.

239
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.840
Is going to ask combination generator for a combination but to do that it has to find it.

240
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.370
Now previously we've been using the global script to keep an eye on where this thing is.

241
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.380
That's really us working around God.

242
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.050
Instead let's use God knows functionality to find this nut.

243
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.600
Let let's not work around God.

244
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.970
Let's embrace it.

245
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.310
So back into the computer and back into the script.

246
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:45.910
What I'm going to do is make a variable called combination generator.

247
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:53.050
And that's going to be get tree and from the tree Let's get root.

248
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:58.260
So it's going to get to the root of this scene if you're interested what the root of the scene is.

249
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.430
It's the bit just the bulb level one so get root.

250
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.010
And from here let's find a child node with that name.

251
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.940
To do that I'm going to use find load

252
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.420
what's find out find node is a bit like get a..

253
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.830
But it's going by location go by name so you can only find one child node.

254
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.600
But we're going from the root so find the child from this root.

255
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.880
It takes two arguments.

256
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.690
The first argument is recursive.

257
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.600
Are you going to look at children of children or just direct children.

258
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.430
We want to look at children of children.

259
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.980
The second argument is is this old.

260
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.410
In other words do I need to check that you are owned by this node.

261
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.530
In this case that's false.

262
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:47.220
So to make this work we need to go in the name of the node we're looking for which is a combination

263
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.200
generator.

264
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.630
It didn't actually type of that unlike like me.

265
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.060
Is it recursive.

266
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.160
Yes.

267
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.170
Is it owned by me.

268
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.600
False.

269
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.380
OK.

270
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:04.460
So now we have that we can go combination equals combination generator.

271
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.080
Combination underscored generator.

272
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.070
And then we can call the function with in combination generator.

273
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.610
So let's go look at that function.

274
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.170
Combination generator.

275
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.780
They are.

276
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.710
You want a real script that's really you.

277
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.680
Combination generator What is it.

278
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.220
Generate combination or length.

279
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.520
You're going to copy that and paste it in here.

280
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.340
But rather than length.

281
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.500
I'm going to put in combination like.

282
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.490
So here's what's going to happen.

283
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.330
We were telling godda.

284
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.950
The combination generator is the node called combination generator somewhere within this tree.

285
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.050
Go find it.

286
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:55.580
When you found it set our combination to combination generator don't generate combination.

287
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.810
So the function we made in a previous video and we're telling it with this link.

288
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:06.440
Then we look at coblation generator that function will take that length to generate accommodation and

289
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:14.400
then return the combination that returned value is going to be set as combination.

290
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.660
So combination will become this return value.

291
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.160
To demonstrate that let's have it actually pop.

292
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:29.300
Well you know for now let's pretend print combination and just to be very sure there is no print in

293
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:29.540
here.

294
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.710
So when this if this works it will show up in the output.

295
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.640
Reasons not working.

296
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.870
I didn't call it.

297
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.130
I do like to forget to do that.

298
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.880
OK so let's call generate combination right here.

299
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.440
Let's try that again.

300
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.570
2 0 6 7.

301
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.610
Fantastic.

302
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.900
Now that we have that let's set the pop up text to be that.

303
00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:01.280
So we'll put it right here and generate combination right is going be part of the same function.

304
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:07.010
In fact you know what let's make a new set pop up text.

305
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.590
So let's make set pop up text.

306
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:20.760
Function you know small spaces so we could put in the middle spring set pop up text.

307
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:26.060
Well it's going to do is it's going to call a function within the pop ups solaced go canvass letter

308
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:31.980
pop up where they are a function called Set Tex.

309
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.830
And I'm in a pass you the combination.

310
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:38.850
Alright.

311
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.130
Right now this is going to have a major crash because there is no script in the pop up so let's put

312
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.700
one in.

313
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.200
So let's make a new script called Computer pop up.

314
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:54.840
And as you might expect it goes in the Scripps folder helps repel a fantastic function of set text and

315
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.740
that takes an argument which I'm going to call combination.

316
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.480
Okay so what's this going to do.

317
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:07.750
Well it's going to grab the rich text label and it's going to take the big hold of that.

318
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.880
And it's going to set it to something.

319
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.900
I was going to sell it to it's going to say something like let's make this some big again.

320
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:25.850
Will you stop for getting your access code.

321
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.210
I've set it to.

322
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.880
But this is the last time.

323
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.800
Now here's my challenge for you.

324
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:47.110
I'd like you to have the combination display in the rich text label of computer pop up so we've passed

325
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.870
the combination through can you get that combination to shower quick tip.

326
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.640
We've solved this problem before.

327
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.060
We're bringing in an array of integers.

328
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.580
We need this to be a single string.

329
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.000
So you might have to look back at some of these notes see if you can remember it don't work you can't

330
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.830
but pause the video give that a shot.

331
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.690
And then when you're ready.

332
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.430
Unpause and I'll show you my solution.

333
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.220
And welcome back.

334
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.780
Okay so what I need to do is I need to take a combination.

335
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.140
And pass it through as a string.

336
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:27.030
So when another plus here pull string array.

337
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.020
And what does the pull string array it's combination.

338
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.970
This is getting a bit big now so women do is to go to the next line and just tab twice.

339
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.980
That's our convention to say this is part of the same line.

340
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.320
OK.

341
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.590
And this all needs to be in brackets doesn't it.

342
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.590
Let's put some brackets.

343
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.890
Let's join them.

344
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.270
We're going to use our empty string so the delineator is going to be empty.

345
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.440
So now.

346
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.940
When we go to the computer and we sneak behind this guard and around this light excuse me like will

347
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.570
you stop forgetting access code.

348
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.570
I've set it to three three to seven.

349
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.950
This is the last time.

350
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.310
Now we can put in some marginson things.

351
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.100
Give the text a bit more space.

352
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.580
But already this is key functionality that's already in there.

353
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:24.560
So in this video we've looked at how do you find node to get a node by name anywhere within the tree.

354
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.190
If we were to extend this into a very large complicated scene that's going to be inefficient but for

355
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.920
our purposes that's fantastic.

356
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.400
We've also used a return value from another function in this script.

357
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.620
Look at that.

358
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:41.630
We have randomly generated codes that can be put into a computer and then sent out to lock doors.

359
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.800
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
