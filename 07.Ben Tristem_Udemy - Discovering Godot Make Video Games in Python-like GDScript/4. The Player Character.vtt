00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.050
Welcome back wonderful God people in this video we're going to get to play a character made and moving

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.490
so we've got a good start with a sort of template a resting place.

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.030
Let's actually get something happening when we pressed buttons.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.370
So what do we need to do.

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.290
We need to instance a scene based on the character sing.

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.610
However that's not going to be enough.

7
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.490
We also need to instance a script based on the character saying if we just insist the scene it will

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.510
by default use the same script so we need a second script that inherits off the character script.

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.160
We want to create top down movement and we're going to steer with the character always looking where

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.430
the mouse is on screen.

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.220
And when you say detre movements are the players have the option of either using the mouse and cursor

12
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.290
keys or mouse and ibsa Deep.

13
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.500
So that's nice and simple.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.570
How we get started.

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.150
Well first me to do is make a new scene.

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.550
But this one's going to be new inherited scene.

17
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.790
We're going to inherit from the character scene.

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.850
So open bases which scene my inheriting from.

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.860
And this is now a brand new scene.

20
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.100
So if I call this player and say that we still have character players is new seen anything with his

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.540
greyed out is inherited case so the current Sprite is the original one.

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.300
So I mean go into graphics in two pages into Hit Man 1 And I'm just going to replace that sprite.

23
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.880
The collision ships going to say and that is the scene itself set up.

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.480
OK.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.590
So we have the scene.

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.960
We don't have the correct script right now.

27
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.300
Player is using character dodgy.

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.910
Any changes I make here will change character dodgy deal.

29
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.840
There is no play a script to change.

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
I need a script that extends character Didi.

31
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.190
Something to detach the script and then attach a new one and put it like place.

32
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.670
It's going to be called player.

33
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.900
However it's going to inherit character and now whereas it would normally say extends kinematic body

34
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.350
to do.

35
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.930
It now says extends and then the path to the character does Judy.

36
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.850
This means that this script has access to all functions and variables within character Judy.

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.810
So anything I write in here is on top of character dodgy but it doesn't go the other way round.

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.680
Anything I write in here is not X accessed by character but Tweedy unless I tell it to access it specifically

39
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.830
so let's make a function and I'm going to use the process functions so every tick every frame.

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.850
What are we doing.

41
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.710
We are going to move and slide now move and slide is a function of kinematic body to day player is a

42
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.010
kinematic want it to be and it's inheriting from kinematic what it Judy.

43
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.590
Note by the way if I change player to a different type.

44
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.610
Let's change it to.

45
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.450
I don't know rigid body a static body a sprite whatever other note I change it to.

46
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.770
I would then not be able to use the script because it's extending McCain mattick what a chiddy script.

47
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.110
OK.

48
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.760
Move in slide take some arguments as you might remember.

49
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.010
If you forget you can look at the documentation inside the engine.

50
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.250
I'm on Windows and pressing control and clicking on it and move and slide.

51
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.330
Where's it gone do to do.

52
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.070
Here it is.

53
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.030
First argument takes is linear velocity.

54
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.790
So that's going to be motion.

55
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.220
So let's define emotionally OK so variable motion and that's a vector too.

56
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.830
Now what I want do is create a function that updates motion and I'm going to call it update motion and

57
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.950
I'm in a past Delta into it.

58
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.990
Okay if I'm going to be updating the value of motion that's a really important thing to do.

59
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.970
So for now that's everything that's going to happen.

60
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.940
All I need to do now is actually create this function so the function update motion and that gets Delta

61
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.510
for further on a map in W say D.

62
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.910
So project settings put that case on these and you are left right up and down so it can add left which

63
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.750
is a key and right to press on the plus press key up.

64
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.230
And down.

65
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.490
So once we're here we can start writing the movement code before we any further.

66
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.760
I'd like to see how much you can remember about this.

67
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.940
So I'd like to challenge you to move the player set up basic movement for the player see what you can

68
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.630
remember.

69
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.260
Don't be afraid to look at the documentation if you get stuck it's quite normal.

70
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.750
And remember that we don't want to prioritize one direction or another.

71
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.140
In other words if I press up and down at the same time the character should not move.

72
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.280
It shouldn't just go up or down because that was first in the queue.

73
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.230
So pause the video give that a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

74
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.540
And welcome back.

75
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.770
Okay so what are we to do.

76
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:19.870
Well we do a condition if input Dart is action pressed.

77
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.440
Okay.

78
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.110
Now I don't want just breasts because that means I've pressed the button don't track of I'm still holding

79
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.980
it down if it's being pressed what's being pressed.

80
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.790
It's going to be you.

81
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.960
I will stop with up and not.

82
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.940
And then copy this and who.

83
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.990
And let's put a coal on there.

84
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.650
So we're going to move up and do that well motion dot Y.

85
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.530
And remember.

86
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.380
And I'm saying this because I'm forgetting as I say this negative y is up.

87
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.240
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to limit the speed.

88
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.750
OK.

89
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.720
We have Max speed defined here so I'm going to use clamp so I'm say equals clamp.

90
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.870
And what are we going to clap.

91
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:17.340
Well the clamp value is motion dot y minus speed.

92
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.240
And I need my minimum value my maximum value.

93
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.550
My minoan value is negative max speed.

94
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.750
And you'll see auto completed whereas in the variable it's inheriting from here it's extending.

95
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.930
Character Judy.

96
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.430
Great.

97
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.690
And what's the maximum.

98
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.720
Zero.

99
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.750
OK.

100
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.920
So now when you move up the screen you cannot go faster than max speed and you cannot go slower than

101
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.620
zero.

102
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.570
And nowadays it's going to take all this and duplicate it.

103
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.680
So let's control be on Windows.

104
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:59.040
And I'm glad she has this for down and this one for up topes you UI underscore up how lame is that.

105
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.140
It is quite more much more like.

106
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.620
I mean it's big screen so I can see everything.

107
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.030
Great.

108
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.810
And that's just going to be a plus speed.

109
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.710
Zero max speed.

110
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.200
OK.

111
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.910
Well we do is check that works before we do that and I make a brand new scene and I'm going to look

112
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.660
into hoodie give it a Node 2 D is a route I want to call this level one.

113
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.420
So these are the precursor of my number one.

114
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:37.100
And in that I'm going to instance the player that way I can set this is the default see my try and run

115
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.000
it and I don't have to worry about changing it.

116
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.290
I can change it if I need to but I'm not going to so have characters plays I mean I will change it later

117
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.920
on in a series of videos but not right now.

118
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.500
Let's move the player to the middle screens I can see it.

119
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.860
OK.

120
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.820
Let's save the scene.

121
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:57.420
Were not saving the characters we are saving it into a brand new folder called all levels.

122
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.330
OK a level one scene.

123
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.250
There it is.

124
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.540
Let's give that a shot.

125
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.460
Yes.

126
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.090
Level 1 is my scene.

127
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.520
OK.

128
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.210
Moving up works and moving down works.

129
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.730
However I let go the key were still moving so we'll have to set stay still thing.

130
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:23.880
So what we do is I'm going to ELSE motion dot X equals and is a new thing then use Lerp linear interpolation

131
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.970
What does this do.

132
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.660
It moves from this value to this value over the amount of time.

133
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.230
OK.

134
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.920
So that's going to be motion dot y to zero over friction.

135
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.610
That's why we put the friction in here.

136
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.310
So let's give that a shot.

137
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.390
Pressing deep breaths in that now somehow I've set this at Motion X..

138
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.370
That was very clever of me to try that again.

139
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.550
Moving up.

140
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.260
Letting go.

141
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.090
Moving down.

142
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.660
Let it go.

143
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.250
There's a very slight skid there.

144
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.900
Awesome.

145
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:08.450
All I need to do now is just duplicate all of this and now change these ups and downs and lessen rights

146
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.770
to work with motion and with speed this up a little bit so you can see what I'm doing but not have to

147
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.490
sit there through it.

148
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.660
So.

149
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.890
And welcome back.

150
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.160
A couple of things I've got to make sure I change all of the motion wise in this section to my next.

151
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.420
I've split it.

152
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.230
I should also change these they're elfs just because it will work with an F as you're seeing but it's

153
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.470
better to have one if there's an ellipse unless there's a pressing reason not to.

154
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.420
You might be wondering why.

155
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.440
By the way why don't I just have one else at the end which I could do right I could have motion equals

156
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:49.610
linae interpret interpellation from motion to zero over friction because friction to be applied on either

157
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.240
axis.

158
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.110
If I stop moving that axis in other words I could still be moving right.

159
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.140
I've stopped moving up so slow down on the up but keep moving the same speed right.

160
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.460
If I were at the bottom then friction won't kick in.

161
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.990
I won't slow down I won't stop until I take my hand off the keyboard.

162
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.000
That's not what I want.

163
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.910
Okay so we should now have four dimensional movement not one dimensional four directional actually eight

164
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.810
directional moving the diagonals.

165
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.930
What I can't do is turn and that's really key.

166
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.290
Now I could set rotation keys right.

167
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.890
I could do left and right rotate and forward and backwards is move forward backward depending which

168
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.820
direction you're facing.

169
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.040
But what I want is I want to look at the mouse cursor to do that.

170
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.360
I'm going to use a look at function.

171
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.990
Put it right here at the top.

172
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:38.570
Look at what I may look at when I need godso to get the mouse position.

173
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.060
Well that's what I want right.

174
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.710
Get global House position.

175
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.460
Well that is as easy as that.

176
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.560
Quite a Yes I think it might be.

177
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.650
And here we have the beginnings of our game.

178
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.970
We can move.

179
00:10:54.670 --> 00:11:02.240
In all the directions we skid slightly It's not that noticeable and we can look at the mouse.

180
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.060
Awesome and that is everything for this video.

181
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.370
So in this video we've looked at how the instance and use scene and script how to inherit functionality

182
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.070
from existing assets.

183
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.830
And we've had a quick peek at how do you look at.

184
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.700
In this case look at global mouse position.

185
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.400
So great work and I'll see you in the next video.
