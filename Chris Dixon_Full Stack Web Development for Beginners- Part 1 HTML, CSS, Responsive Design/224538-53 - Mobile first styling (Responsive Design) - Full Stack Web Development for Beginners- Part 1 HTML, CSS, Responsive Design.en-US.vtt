00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.155
Now we know a little bit more about using media queries.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's see how they can benefit our projects.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.995
I'm going to be doing this with a mobile first approach.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.610
This means designing for small screens first,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.705
then change in layout as more screen space becomes available.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:23.835
To do this, we need to shrink the browser down to a small screen size.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:30.645
Let's go to the browser and then shrink this down to a small mobile device.

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.995
This is how a user would see our website criminally on a phone.

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:39.030
It looks pretty bad, we need to go ahead and fix this.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.880
I'm going to change the styles we currently have in

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.870
the styles.CSSfile to make this look better.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.945
Then we can add a media query to change things for larger devices.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.050
Let's begin up at the top with the header.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.790
As a general rule,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.880
if you are unsure of how to style for small screens,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.985
a good starting point is to often make the content for width and also centered.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:07.835
Let's go up to the header section here.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.630
We can shrink the browser down so they both fit on the screen.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.750
Let's start by targeting the body.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.330
At the bottom under the color we can add to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.435
the text-align and set this to be center, give a save.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.975
Now pushes all the content to the center of the page,

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:34.115
then make the body the full width for the screen by commenting out is

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:38.510
80 vw and then refresh.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.965
Now this stretches to be the full width of the mobile device.

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.570
Any styling rules which you want to remove,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.715
such as this maximum width.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:49.040
I'm just going to comment them out for now.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.350
This is because we want to reintroduce them

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.254
later inside a media query for larger devices,

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:59.805
then to make the search the full width too and on its own line.

00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:02.950
We can make it the width of 100 percent.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.010
Let's target the inputs under the header and footer.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.360
Just like we looked earlier,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.190
we can use the square brackets to talk of the input with a type of search.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.110
Then we can set the width to be 100 percent to make it the full width of the container.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.730
Refresh, and now it's on its own line too.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.960
We still would need header section,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040
if we go ahead and widen this browser.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.405
We can see the site title and the links and no longer on the online.

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:45.085
We can fix this in the header H1 section.

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:50.660
Let's scroll down a little to the header H1, which is just here.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.335
Then let's comment this line out and change the width to be 100 percent.

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.795
Save and then reload.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:03.470
Now moving down to this main and side section,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.975
if we take a look at what we currently have,

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:10.390
is side section is currently set to be 27 percent of the width.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.390
This is why it looks so narrow,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.670
and the main section is said to be 68 percent of the width.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.025
This is why it doesn't look very good.

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:23.915
All of these sizes inside the main and the aside section,

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.275
are all relating to full desktop view.

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:30.290
We can comment out all the section for now.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.755
In fact, we can remove these calculations before and then comments on the aside section,

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:41.585
and also the same of the main section too, give that save.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:45.400
Looking at these back in later inside of a media query,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.760
then reload the browser.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.520
Now, our site looks instantly better,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.740
now down to our products.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.220
We want these products to span the full width of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.395
the screen so in line block is no longer needed.

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:03.200
Let's go up to the product section, which is just here,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.415
and then comments out this inline block section, then refresh.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.470
This leaves now on the own separate line,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.320
because we've got a width of 30 percent at the moment,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.075
they still look really narrow.

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:20.530
Let's comment out this section from before.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.720
We can then set the width to be 100 percent,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.350
and save that, reload.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.055
Our product is a 100 percent of the width of the screen.

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:37.580
This is now looking a lot better and with just a few small changes to our CSS,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.880
it looks a lot more suited to smaller screens.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.014
Remember though the site is for learning purposes.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:45.770
If I was designing this site,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.920
I would generally built for the mobile view first,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.640
rather than altering the CSS, which you've already added.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.700
With this now completed, in the next video,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.980
we can begin to widen the browser and then add the CSS for larger screens.
