00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
The next type of style sheet we can add is internal stylesheets.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.410
This is a way to add all the styles we want to apply to a single web-page.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
To do this, we can add the style tags in the head section.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.175
So let's scroll to the top of our index page,

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:20.420
and then just after the title,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.040
we're going to add the style tags.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.955
Let's add the opening and closing tag inside this head section.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:34.380
Then just like we've seen in the slides at the start of the section,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.985
we can then add the name of the elements we want the styles to apply to.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:42.205
I'm going to begin with this header area,

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:46.325
followed by the opening and closing curly braces.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:48.484
Inside of these curly braces,

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:51.410
we can add the same styles as before.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.630
So we add the background,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.980
the colon, and we had the Hex code value of 333a40.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.935
When using these styles we also still needs to end each property with the semicolon.

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:16.660
Then we also have the color which applies to the text which was white.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.050
Then if we go down and remove the inline styles which are already

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.125
before to the head elements, as you move that.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.255
Then also rather than duplicating codes,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:34.165
these styles can apply to multiple elements by separating with a comma,

00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:35.670
so separate it with a comma.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.515
We can also add the footer inside of there too.

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:45.430
Then of course we need to go down and remove these styles from the footer area.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.265
Right down at the bottom, let's remove this inline style section like that.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:55.260
Then give that a save,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.655
and then if we go over to the browser and then refresh,

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:03.020
we can see that the styles that were added are exactly the same as before,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.480
but this time we have them in one section at the top in the head.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:16.115
We can also add some styling to the root HTML elements and also the body section too.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.715
Back in the style tags at the very top,

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:23.220
once again with the HTML elements,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.695
let's add a background color.

00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:30.580
Add Hex code value of f7f7f7.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.470
I've added this HTML elements at the top as it is a root element.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.035
So give that a save then refresh,

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:45.455
and this is small but subtle difference backgrounds.

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:50.550
Now with the body, which I'm going to add just after the HTML.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.405
Let's add a background of white.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:58.695
It stands out with this background of HTML.

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:01.500
The maximum width of the body section,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.169
I'm going to change this to be 1,000 pixels,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.710
and then we want to add margin zero and then auto.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.515
Margin is the value of spacing we add outside of the elements.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:21.175
The first value of zero represents no spacing on the top and bottom,

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:25.020
and the second value is for the left and right.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.030
Send the value to auto,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.745
mean spacing will automatically be applied equally to both sides,

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:35.360
effectively centering the body to the middle of the page.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.055
This is a common trick and we'll learn more about marging in a later video.

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:43.070
Don't worry if it doesn't make sense at the moment.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.930
You can probably see this in action better if we save and then refresh.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.850
You can see straight away that the body is now slightly narrower.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.200
You can see this HTML color we added in the background,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.535
it's slightly different to the whites that were added to the body.

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:04.115
The body section is this 1,000 pixels wide section,

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:09.265
which goes from this left edge here to the right-hand side here.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:14.040
The body is now restricted to 1,000 pixels wide and centered in

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.560
the middle because we added equal margin to the left and right hand side.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.680
Any extra space which is available after this 1,000 pixels

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.480
width will be automatically applied to the left and also the right.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.535
This is because we've added an internal stylesheet to this index.html page.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.920
Internal stylesheets work great,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.075
but there are only useful for styling this one page which you've already to.

00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:46.970
For example, if we select the Contact link from the menu at the top,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.345
which is this third one here click on that,

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:54.470
and the style in which we've added doesn't take effect on this page.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.100
This is often not the behavior we want because we want

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.505
consistent styling for colors and also this header and footer section too.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:07.070
Again this is something which can be easily solved using

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.610
our third and final type of stylesheets, which we'll cover next.
