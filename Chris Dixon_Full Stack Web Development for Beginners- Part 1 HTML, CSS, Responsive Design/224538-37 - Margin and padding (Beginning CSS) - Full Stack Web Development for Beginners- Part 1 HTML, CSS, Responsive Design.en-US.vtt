00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.900
Margin and padding are both really important CSS properties to understand.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.890
They both are basically a way of creating space.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.275
If we look at this diagram here,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.675
imagine this was one of our products.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.945
We'll probably want it to appear something like this,

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.855
with a little bit of space in around it,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:26.054
invalid though this is how it would appear by default.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:29.580
Placed in the top corner with no spacing.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.260
We see this in action in our current project where

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.175
the product default is at top left of the available space.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:43.685
To fix this, we can apply margin to the outside of an element to create some spacing.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.525
Margin can be applied to be the same on each side,

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.650
or you can add a different amount on each side if required.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.155
The same thing happens when we add elements inside of this productive.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:01.505
The element, such as this image or even any text,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:03.860
is placed in the top corner.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.915
Just like before, we may not want the image to be tied to the top corner.

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.260
For this situation, we have what is called padding.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.810
Padding also adds spacing,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.935
but this time, inside of the elements.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:24.270
Margin is outside of the elements and padding is applied to the inside of the elements.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.210
The darker green border highlights what the padding actually does.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.310
It acts as a cushion,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.045
keeping things away from the sides.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:41.615
We can also set this equally on all sides or have different values on each side.

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:45.560
As we see here, both margin and padding can both be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.235
set for each side individually by setting top,

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.840
right, bottom, and left values.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.875
Thankfully, there are some shorthand versions too.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:59.870
Taking a look at these two examples on the left,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.620
we can set margin or padding with four values.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.715
These four values are clockwise, beginning at the top.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.735
So top, right, bottom and then left.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:16.640
Here we have both the top and bottom values set to ten pixels,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.710
then the left and right values,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.515
the same two are five pixels.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:25.055
For this case, we can also show this even further.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.215
As we see on the right-hand side.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:29.795
The first value is at top and bottom,

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.720
and the second is to the left and right.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.720
We have already seen this in our project when we centered

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.680
our website using margin zero auto.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.070
Zero tells the browsers to add no margin to the top and bottom of the body section.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.425
Then the additional space on the left and right can be divided up equally,

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:55.070
leaving the body section centered on the page.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.945
Enough of this theory,

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:00.150
let's give this a go inside of our project.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.615
Starting with the margin.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:07.460
If we go over to the styles.css and up to the product,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.784
we can add some margin to this product section of five pixels.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:14.975
Because we've only added one value,

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.155
this will apply to all sides of the product.

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.720
Let's see this with a reload.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.375
Now we can see five pixels of space

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:26.630
and this has appeared around all sides of the product.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.095
Then go ahead and add some padding too,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:35.150
also a five pixels, and then refresh.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.875
Now we have a five pixel cushion on the inside of the div.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:43.400
Also, another important thing to note is

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.095
a browser's often applied default values of margin and padding too.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:52.280
This means sometimes it may want to reset the values back

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.985
to zero and unordered list is a common one,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.045
which is often applies to.

00:03:58.045 --> 00:04:00.075
Let's go over to the CSS,

00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:02.635
and we can reset these values.

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:05.765
If we go just below the header and footer,

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.045
let's tag at the UL.

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:12.270
Then we could set the margin back to be zero.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.145
If we watch out for this when we refresh,

00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:21.770
we see everything move up as a default margin was removed.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.365
We can also do the same too to remove any default padding.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.225
Again, back over to the unordered list.

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:31.565
Then we can reset the padding back to zero.

00:04:31.565 --> 00:04:35.029
If we keep a close eye out for me when we refresh,

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:39.695
we see all the unordered lists are now moved over to the left hand side.

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:43.790
This is something to bear in mind if you're wondering why something looks a little

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.085
different than expected due to the browser adding some default values.

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:52.595
Also, just to make things even more confusing,

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:56.495
different browsers often have different values too.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:05:01.579
However, a few resources to help us with browser defaults.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:07.850
If we go over to Google and then do a search for CSS resets.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.710
The top link I want is Meyerweb.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.350
Click on this. This is a style sheets.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.695
If we scroll down, we can see the code just here.

00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:25.040
We can use this inside of our project to effectively

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.910
remove any default styling provided by browsers.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.330
This thing gives us a blank canvas to start with.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.495
Alternatively, we can use another CSS file called Normalize.

00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:44.400
Again, let's do a Google search for CSS Normalize.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.840
Its top link is what I need. Click on this.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.635
Normalize work slightly differently to reset.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:57.380
Rather than remove any browser defaults,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.960
you provide styles to make our websites

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.985
display more consistently across arranged browsers.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:05.955
You just decide now however,

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:10.335
and something you may find useful to include this in our projects.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:15.155
All you need to do is to download the file and add it to our projects,

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.545
just like we have done with our own custom style sheet.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.020
This is it now for margin and padding.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.230
Next we're going to dive into using different display types.
