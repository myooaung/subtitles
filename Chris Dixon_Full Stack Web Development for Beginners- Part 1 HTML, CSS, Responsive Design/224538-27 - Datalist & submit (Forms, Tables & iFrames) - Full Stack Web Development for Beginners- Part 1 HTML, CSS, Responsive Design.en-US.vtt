00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.285
I want to now show you datalist.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:07.680
Datalist is one of the newer form elements available.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.830
Because of this, browsers ports are present is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.235
a little bit more limited at the time of recording.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:19.750
We can see this by going over to a site called caniuse.com.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.765
All I need to do is type in the datalist at the very top here.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.635
Then scroll down and you can see a list of the supported browsers.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:41.270
We can see by the color that the later versions of Chrome are green,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.430
and it's fully supported.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.725
However, some of the early versions of Safari and also Safari on iOS, it's not supported.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:57.440
If we take a look at Internet Explorer and also Edge and Firefox too,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.535
we can see that the light green indicates some partial spots.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:04.925
So we need to be careful when using datalist.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.360
However, it is useful to know as it will be

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.190
a good option to use once browser spot catches up.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.850
Datalists can be used in place of a select box from the last video,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.325
where the select box is a drop-down to select an option.

00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:25.730
Datalist is more of a text box where the user can type into.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.465
Then we can see some suggestions below it.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:34.400
If we go over to the finished version and into the contact page,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.695
this is a datalist here.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.840
If we click on the drop-down,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.070
we still have all options that we've seen in the last video which you can select.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.010
Or we can use this as a search box.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.650
We can filter down if you have lots of different options.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.515
Let's begin over in Visual Studio Code.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:59.405
I'm going to comment out this full div that we create In the last video.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:03.275
This is a div which surrounds all the select box.

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:05.780
If you're using Visual Studio Code,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.565
you should be simply able to highlight and press "Command or control",

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:14.885
press "Forward slash" and this will comment out the section photos.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.735
If not, we'll just need to type in manually

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:21.670
the opening section and the closing section below it.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.935
Then let's go ahead and construct our div,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:26.930
just like we did before.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.850
Then we can add a label.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.150
Label again is going to have the four attributes of subjects,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.940
and then subject inside here.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.555
We're basically just construct in the same thing as we did for the select box.

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:54.030
This time we add an inputs with the type of texts.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.915
The reason we're adding a text input is to display the section here,

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.490
the user can type into it.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.190
Let's give this an ID of subjects again to much these attributes here.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:19.305
Then the placeholder at the very end of enter your subjects and close up.

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:22.880
This is just a simple text input to begin.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.660
The user has a text-box to type in.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.525
Then below this, we can add

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:34.720
our data list with opening and closing tags for these elements.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.255
Then we can add an option inside here.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.985
This only has the opening tag,

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:45.540
and we'll also add a value attributes of returns.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.650
Then let's copy and paste the same a few more times.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.780
Next, we can add the faulty item.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.060
Faulty item and then the third one is delivery,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
before four was order trucking.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.850
The fifth one was advice and the final one was other.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.620
Over to the browser. It reloads and go up to the subjects.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.135
Lets start to add some text inside here.

00:04:40.135 --> 00:04:43.204
If we type inside the inputs,

00:04:43.204 --> 00:04:46.460
we don't see any of the options appearing below,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.785
like we've seen in the final version.

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:55.220
This is because we have a plain text inputs and also we have a text list below it,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.905
but we've not yet linked them together.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:02.855
To link them, first needs add an ID to the data list.

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:07.530
Just like all IDs goes in the open inside.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.180
We'll call this the subjects.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.610
Then text inputs above,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.560
which lists connects to with the list attributes.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.605
Of course this needs to be subjects matches ID below.

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:31.230
Give a save and let test this.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.505
Hit "Refresh" and we also see this drop-down arrow appearing,

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:45.985
it looks like it's working as I trying to leave advice and that all seems to work in.

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:48.425
This is how we use the data list.

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:52.790
Again, do be careful when using a check browser compatibility.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.380
If you were looking to include this inside of a project.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.730
Both unknown thing, it's a nice form elements are especially useful,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.559
to filter down a large group of options.

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.240
This is all the form inputs now on display in our website.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.845
We just need a way to submit this form and as you may guess,

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.215
we do this with a submit button.

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.480
Submit is also an input,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.330
but this time we ask the type of submit.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.215
Let's add this right at the end of our form.

00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:28.035
Just above disclosure form tag.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.675
We can write this in a div 2,

00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:36.400
then add our inputs with the type of submit.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.420
Give that save and let's check this out.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.635
Of course this is right on the bottom we have our submit button just here.

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:53.165
This is a bomb which will actually submit the data in the form to the server.

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:58.690
Remember all this will not work at the moment because HTML just display the content.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.665
But we'll come back to submit forms later in the course,

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:06.189
when we're more familiar with back-end web development.

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.385
But one thing you will notice once we click on the "Submit" button before,

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:13.050
we'll take him back to the same page.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.504
If you look at the ends of this URL,

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:19.220
we have name equals unblank,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.330
and email equals no value and message equals no value.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.625
This is because we added the name of name,

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.555
email, and message over in the HTML.

00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:36.690
This was just here,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.375
name, email and message.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.780
This is why we're added the name attribute before,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.120
and this is the data which will be sent to the server.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.165
Let's just give that a quick trial,

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:49.410
if we added Chris.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:58.140
Then test@test.com, then message here,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.670
if we go down and click on "Submit",

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.070
will then see this information is now in the top bar.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.035
Our name equals Chris,

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:12.790
email equals test and message equals to our text, which user added him.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.075
We'll just leave that for now and of course we'll come back to that later on.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:20.590
What we know more about how back-end development works.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:26.345
We could also replace this button with a HTML button elements.

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:30.200
This also takes a type equals submit.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.175
Down at the very bottom.

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:35.580
I'm going to put this here.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.310
We're just going to comment this out.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:46.640
Then we can add to the button elements just like that with the type of submit.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.950
This is something which you'll see quite often to.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.160
Since has the type of submit,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.095
will also submit the form just like this input will do above.

00:08:59.095 --> 00:09:02.690
It was same and check this out in the browser.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.085
It looks a little difference.

00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:09.000
We just have a plain button with no texts.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.595
We see no text of submits this because

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:15.805
like over elements with an opening and closing tag,

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.820
we need to add our text inside.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.970
Between these we can add a text all of submit.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.950
I now will see the text inside the button.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.085
This is actually one of the main differences when using an input or a button in this way,

00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:36.740
inputs have default text of submit,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.110
but our buttons, you're in control or the text inside the button.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.110
So it can be anything which you want.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:50.365
Chat has send message and you'll see that reflected in the browser.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:53.950
For now I'm going to comment out these button and keep in

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.835
place the inputs which you had from the form.

00:09:57.835 --> 00:10:03.180
Again with command or control and a forward slash to common data out.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.275
You may also come across a reset button,

00:10:06.275 --> 00:10:09.360
placed next to the submit, like this.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.335
Rather than the type of submit.

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:14.540
You may also see the type of

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:21.695
resets and this is used to clear any of the text from the inputs which we add.

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:24.935
We had some text inside here.

00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:27.250
You could click on "Reset".

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.055
This will clear all form inputs back to how they were.

00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:34.790
This is the contents of our form now completed.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.020
But in the next video, I want to show you a few more useful types of inputs.
