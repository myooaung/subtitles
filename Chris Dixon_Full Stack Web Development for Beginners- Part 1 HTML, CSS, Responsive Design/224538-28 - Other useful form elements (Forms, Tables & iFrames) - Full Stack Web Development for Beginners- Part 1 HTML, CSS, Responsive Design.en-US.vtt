00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.185
Although our form is now complete for these projects,

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:08.305
they still some other useful input types which you want to show you.

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:11.760
I'm going to add these as a new form elements,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.269
to keep them separate from what we'll keeping from the rest of the project.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's go down to our close and forms site here and then,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.480
let's open a new set of form elements here.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.080
So some other useful input types include number.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.840
This has the input elements and this time I'll add a type of number.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.275
One of the benefits of using the number, if we refresh,

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.820
we see it appearing here,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
is that it restricts the user's input to these numbers.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.645
If we click on this and we try to add some letters or words inside here,

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.835
these aren't taking any effects,

00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.330
but we can of course add some numbers, which you can see here.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.580
There is also the up and down on the right-hand side,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.820
which we can use to go up and down through numbers.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.130
Next, if you want to ask for the user's password,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.840
it makes sense to do this with a inputs with the type of password.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.310
This has the benefits of staring out the password.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.310
If we type in our password inside here,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.605
we see that we can't see any of the characters which you've entered.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.210
This is useful for if somebody is behind you,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.180
or walking past, so nobody else can see the password which you enter.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.535
There is also a input type of dates,

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.270
which we also have access to and as you'd expect,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.835
this is the input type of date and this is obviously for all date fields.

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:56.950
Let's take a look at this in action.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.615
This could be used to when asking for a user's birthday, or for example,

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.645
selecting the dates, we want to stay in a hotel,

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:07.540
on a travel website.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.090
If we click on this, we have the dates, the month of the year.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.445
We can also control this with the keyboard,

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:16.455
by typing up and down,

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:19.715
add tab also switches between the day,

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:21.860
the month and the year.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.710
We can also click on this drop-down arrow and we have

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.330
a date field where we can select different months of the year.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.690
Then all we need to do, is click on one of the dates and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.540
the field is automatically populated with the date we clicked on.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.635
[inaudible] these inputs, it is quite a few more too which you can look up online,

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:48.410
but I will show you a few more of the common ones, such as color.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.055
Change the type to be color.

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:55.985
You've probably seen this one before on various websites,

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.600
where we have a color picker.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.485
If we refresh, we see the color black is default.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.200
This looks different on different browsers,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.440
so if you're using something like Edge or Firefox,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.330
you may have a slightly different looking in inputs type here.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.530
If we click on this we get a nice color picker,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.580
this of course, is the apple one and yours may look a little bit difference.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.660
We click on various different values and choose our color from that.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.545
Another useful one is range.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:35.830
So inputs with the type of range,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.490
back over to the browser.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.420
Range gives us a slider,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.130
which a user can move across by clicking on it and dragging it to the left and right.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.120
By default, the slider is in the middle,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.920
but there are also some attributes we can add to change things,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.365
we can change the minimum and also maximum.

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:04.785
So if we set the minimum to be one and the maximum to be 10,

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.680
this gives us a range of 1-10,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.700
which we can drag between.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.555
Now we can control the starting position of the slider.

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.500
Currently, as we said before,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.120
it begins in the center,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.605
but we can change the starting position by setting the value attributes.

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:24.440
So if we set this to be one,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.820
it would appear at the beginning.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.815
Let's give this a go and we now see the circle right at the very start,

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.785
if we change this to be a value of 10,

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:42.740
it would appear right at the very end and this is useful input type,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.305
particularly when we start learning about JavaScript.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.430
We can use it for things such as setting the volume on a music player.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.520
So it goes up and down as the user of drags.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.950
The final input type I want to show you in this video is search.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.285
I'm sure you've all used it before to search for items on a website.

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:06.620
This is something which could be used on our website, in the header section.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.915
If you look at the final site here,

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:10.355
look at the very top,

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:13.360
we have a search field just here,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.490
I'm going to now remove the second form,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.360
which I have been playing around with it and bring

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.890
it back up and then we can add a search to the header.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.580
So if we scroll back to the top of the page and into this header section,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.985
we can add this just after our navigation.

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:41.360
We have an input type equals Search and we can also add

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.420
a placeholder attribute to Search then close off.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.315
One of the differences between this and a normal text input is,

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:54.725
after we type something,

00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:58.465
there is an x which appears to delete the search term.

00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:03.270
So I'll show our main now, if we refresh,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.800
then go back to the top,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.650
then we start typing in,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.125
we see this x on the right-hand side,

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.680
to clear the form inputs.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.165
Also, as with other form elements,

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:18.650
the HTML only provides a visual search box.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.235
Searching for anything at the moment will not work,

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:24.250
just with HTML alone.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.770
We also need to add the search box to the header,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.730
in the index page 2 and also the product detail.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.425
If we click on the home,

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:36.350
we don't see this added inside of here.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:43.345
Let's copy this inputs from the contact page,

00:06:43.345 --> 00:06:50.920
first let's update in the product detail in exactly the same location, close enough.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.330
Then if we open up our sidebar and go into the index.html,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.940
we can do the same just here.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.215
Let's try this out. On the Home,

00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:10.650
the Contact Us and also for click on one the products,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.930
such as the game controller.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.120
We've seen the product detail will also have the search bar there.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.330
So now we should have a pretty good idea,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.280
of the different ways we can gather information using forms and inputs.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.210
I hope you found this useful and I'll see you in the next video.
