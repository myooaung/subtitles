00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Looking at our project so far,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.515
there are a few issues relating to the list items we need to address.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:10.635
This list of on the left inside the sidebar.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.305
It still have the bullets on the left-hand side.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:18.120
We can also look at adding some more spacing to these items too.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.005
First let's get to work over in the CSS file.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.150
We can do things such as changing

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
this bullet to be a circle using the list-style property.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.590
We apply this to our Li item.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.530
Let's scroll up to the unordered list and then we can try and get the Li.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.205
Then after we add the list style property,

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:45.570
and then we can change the value to be circle.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.325
Give that a save, and then reload the browser,

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:55.235
and now these black bullets on the left-hand side are now hollow circles.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:01:01.875
Currently the circle is outside the floor of the content and this is a default setting.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.220
If we make the browser a little bit wider,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.430
we can see this is the edge of the body section and the circles outside of this.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.380
This can be changed to be inside of the document by adding the inside value.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.820
Just after circle we can add inside,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.314
and then go to the browser.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:30.550
This now pushes over our list items to now include a circle inside the body.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.570
There is also the square option too.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.795
Let's change circle to be square.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:40.700
This will give a square on the left of each list item.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.290
There are also many more but a lot of them and not used often.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.000
You can of course, check these out with

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.145
quick Google search If you're interested in find out more.

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:55.340
We can even add our own icon or our own image in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.620
place of this square too by adding the image URL.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.790
So let's remove the square and just after the inside,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.015
we're going to add the URL,

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:11.450
and then inside the bracket we can add the file path to our image.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.085
We can go for one of our existing images inside the images folder.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:20.585
Let's go for cables.jpeg,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.610
and let's see how this is looking.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.470
So it's looking a bit of a mess at the minute because the size of our image.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.900
Obviously this image is far too big but you can

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500
see how this can be used if it was a small icon instead,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.885
and this is repeated for each list item.

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:44.690
The inside and outside rules still apply.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.915
So if we were to remove inside,

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.180
and then replace this with outside,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.260
our images would now move outside the document floor.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.785
We can't really see without zooming back out.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:06.000
There we go, says our cables on the left of each list item.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.670
This is a behavior we had right at the start

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.550
this video at the beginning with the bullets.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.100
All I want to do though for this project is to remove these markets completely.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.850
This can be done by adding the value of none,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.315
s rather than this image.

00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:29.970
We can also remove the outside and this simply changes to be none.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.765
Then we just have a standard set of list items on the left hand side.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.500
Then the item spacing between these links on the top and bottom,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.870
we can increase the line height.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.770
So within the list item we can go ahead and add the line height.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.190
The value is up to us, but I'm going to set mine to be thirty pixels,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.205
and see how floor this is looking.

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.899
Good now increased the line height to be thirty pixels,

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:58.035
which has added some more spacing in between each item.

00:03:58.035 --> 00:04:00.215
The last thing I want to do is to add

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:04.490
some spacing to keep the text away from the edge of this container.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.720
This can easily be done with a little padding on the aside section.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.145
So over to the aside section of the CSS,

00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:20.550
and then go ahead and add some padding of 10 pixels, then refresh.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.020
Great, so the spacing has now been applied to the aside section.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.960
But in this padding it has also caused a shop by

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.560
section to be now lower than these all items section on the right.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.430
To make this more even we just need to add the padding value to the main section too.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.770
Just above, we could do the same with the padding of 10 pixels,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.260
and let's see how this is looking.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.105
Great, so now the shop by,

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:54.965
and all item section now line up better with some padding around the outside.

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:59.670
Next, we'll move on to styling links and pseudo classes.
