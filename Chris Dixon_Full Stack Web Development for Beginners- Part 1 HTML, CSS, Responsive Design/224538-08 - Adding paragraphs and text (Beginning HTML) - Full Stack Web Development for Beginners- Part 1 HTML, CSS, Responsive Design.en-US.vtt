00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.230
Now it's time to look at adding text to our website.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.994
Technically, we already have texts in the form of headings,

00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:12.585
but we are also provided with the P element for standard text.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:14.790
P stands for paragraph,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
although it is used for any amount of text from a single letter or word,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.915
right through to a paragraph.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.155
Looking at the product to see on the finished version,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:30.045
there are some block to text we can add such as the description,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.635
which is just here, the price on this line here,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.680
and also the title of each product.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.240
Let's head over to the text editor and begin to add this in.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.260
So let's close this down back over to the index.html page.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.250
First in one's create new div just below all items.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's create a new div just here.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.865
Make sure this is still nested inside this main div.

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:05.485
Again, this is going to be the container for all of these products section.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:07.240
So we'll have the title at the top.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.935
Then this div is going to be the container for an individual product.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:14.920
So inside of this tube will have a product image,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.875
a title, the description, and so on.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:22.190
First we can undertakes the title, price and description.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.685
So open up PP tags,

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:28.390
inside we can have the text of Game Controller,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.310
which is the first product.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.410
Saying just below, we can add in a price, let's say $79.95.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.300
Then a third line with a description.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:55.185
So once I've also game controller for Xbox, save that.

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:58.340
Head up to the browser and then refresh.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.305
And there is our three lines of text at the very bottom.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:07.880
One of the things you'll notice here is that each P elements is on its own line,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.135
just like we looked at in the last video.

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.790
This means that it's a block level elements,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.580
which is ideal because you want them to be stacked, like we see here.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.265
If the text inside of the P times gets a little long,

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:26.455
we can also add a line break which should remain in text onto a new line.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.350
We do this with a break elements.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.230
So if the description was a little bit long,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.750
we could go over and adds pr, put a break elements.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.465
Break time do not need a closing time because there is no content added inside,

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:45.340
it's simply putting place where we want a new line to appear.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.575
Say that, then refresh the browser and now the words for Xbox,

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.240
appear on the own separate line.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.775
I think its product title too of game controller will be better inside a heading tag,

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.715
such as a H4.

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:03.165
Let's make this small change.

00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:07.950
So again controller, we can delete P and at H-4,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.110
same for the closing tag,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.570
Save, and then refresh.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.100
So the title doesn't look a lot different,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.220
but there is a small subtle difference at it.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.165
You can see it's a little bit bolder to.

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:25.105
So this is a now for adding text.

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:29.880
Next we'll look at how we can add some basic styling to our text.
