00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.600
Now we've covered how to apply style sheets in different ways.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.135
Now, let's move on to using fonts.

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:13.130
Adding font types to our websites are really important to define the look and feel.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.390
If we take a look here, I'm over on the W3Schools website in a section called CSS fonts.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.625
If we take look here, there is two main font types.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:28.655
One called Serif and one called Sans-serif.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:35.055
The Sans-serif fonts on the left are much simpler and have straighter square edges.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.560
Serif fonts on the other hand have these extra detail on

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.690
the edge which you can see highlighted in red just here.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.590
A little bit further down we can see there are two types of font families.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.890
On the left of the table we see we have Serif,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.065
we've Sans-serif and also Monospace.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.260
These are all examples of a generic font family.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Each one of these generic groups also has many font families too.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.110
Here we see at the top we have Times New Roman

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.160
and Georgia and these are both types of the Serif family.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.465
Then below we have Arial and Verdana which are font families with a type of Sans-serif.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:27.305
We generally want to add both the font family to our CSS along with a generic family

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:30.380
such as Sans-serif which acts as a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.835
fallback if our first choice is not supported by the browser.

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:38.390
To avoid fonts which are not commonly supported,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
we can use what is called web safe fonts.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.060
We're just going to go over to Google and do a quick search for these web safe fonts.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.370
Now, let's go onto the W3Schools' website just here.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.535
We have the Serif versions and scrolling further down we have the Sans-serif fonts too.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:07.970
This has a list of common font combinations which are wildly spotted.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.430
Most have a stack of three fonts like you can see here.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.590
We have our first choice as an example, we have Arial.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.695
Our second choice of Helvetica and this is used if the Arial is unsupported.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:30.230
Then at the end we have a generic font family such as Sans or Sans-serif.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.275
This is used if none of the others are available or supported.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:40.815
Similar font family names here with spaces between are surrounded in quotes,

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.735
just like you can see here.

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:46.150
This is recommended but not required.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.865
I'm going to go ahead and copy one of these fonts, stacks.

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:53.030
Let's say Comic Sans.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.245
Let's copy this section of the website.

00:02:56.245 --> 00:03:03.335
Then let's head back to our styles.css file and we can add a font family to our project.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:09.085
Let's close the sidebar and open up the styles.css.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:15.290
We can add this to the body since all the HTML content is inside of our body text.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.035
Let's go down to the body and add our font family

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:23.390
and then we could paste in our three values which we just copied

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.720
before with a semicolon at the end.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.600
Save that and then back over to the project in the browser and then

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.960
refresh and you can see all the font type has changed to be this Comic version.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.615
Another way to include fonts is to include a font library such as Google fonts.

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.370
Let's do a search for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.300
Google fonts and what

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.180
we need is fonts.google.com.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940
Let's open this up. We can see right

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.940
away that there is lots of different fonts to choose from.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.450
We can even filter down on the right-hand side by

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.755
the different types such as Serif or Sans-serif.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:17.945
You can even look through and choose one of these fonts on the home screen if you prefer.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:22.230
I want to do a search and choose the one called Barlow.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.885
So under the search bar and this is the one I'm going to use on the left-hand side.

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:34.200
If we want to add this we just click on the plus symbol here.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.830
Then we can go down to the bottom and expand the selected family.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.390
This is how we get the instructions on how to add this to our projects.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.540
First of all, at the top we have a link which

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.720
is just like the link we used on our own style sheets,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.755
but this time it links to the style sheets Google has provided.

00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:57.860
Let's copy this link,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.870
go over to the project and in the index or HTML,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.995
we can add this just below our title.

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:10.595
This link also needs to be added to all the HTML pages too,

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:14.330
so let's add it to the product detail just below

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.620
the title and also to the Contact Us page.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.195
Make sure we save them. The placement of this file is important too.

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:30.310
We should have our own custom CSS file last.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.005
This ensures any changes you make as

00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:38.300
a custom style is loaded last and will override any of the defaults.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.905
We will look at this in more detail later on though,

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.460
but back to Google fonts for now.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.675
Next we need to go down and copy the font family.

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:52.640
So copy this line of the CSS and then back over to our

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.235
styles.css and rather than a section which we added in before,

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:01.980
we can paste in our new Barlow version

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.500
and click that "Save" back over to the project and then refresh.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.630
Now, all fonts have taken effect on the page and we should

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.199
see them being consistent through all our different pages.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.940
All these forms visibly look different,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.305
we can confirm if it's working by going to the developer tools.

00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:33.065
Right-click "Inspect" and then over the right-hand side under the body,

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:35.465
we can see Barlow which you chosen.

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:37.115
If we uncheck this,

00:06:37.115 --> 00:06:42.890
we can see a change with the font family on the screen as it goes back to the default.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.695
We can clearly see that these Google Fonts are now working.

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:48.870
I will now see you in the next video,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.630
we'll take a look at classes and IDs.
