00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
If we go over to our finished "Contact Us" page,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.390
and scroll down, you'll have no waste.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.025
In its finished version, we have a location map on this "Contact Us" page.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.485
This is provided by Google,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.210
by accessing the Maps API.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.850
We'll cover APIs in detail later on in this course,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.770
including building our own,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.490
but for now, just know that the Maps API will

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.990
allow our website to communicate with Google's map information.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.735
You may be wondering what this all has to do with the HTML section of the course,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.680
well this API is included inside of an iframe,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.055
also it's really easy to implement.

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:47.550
Let's begin by going over to Google,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.630
and let's do a search for Google Maps API,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.570
and normally to go to is developers.google.com//maps,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.145
so select this, and first let's click on the "Get Started" button,

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:21.390
which is just here, and then let's scroll down.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.425
The one we need is the Google Maps embed API,

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:27.270
so let's scroll down,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.105
and this is under the Web API section,

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.560
so click on "Google",

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.150
and we're at Google Maps embed API.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.335
Then select maps, and we can see this

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:47.490
integrates based maps on indoor floor plans to our site,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.020
so click on this link here.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.445
This is pretty simple to get started with.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:56.840
All we need to do at first,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.080
is copy this iframe section,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.140
which you get it just here.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.910
Copy that, and then we can go over to our contacts.html page,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.920
and replace our YouTube version with one which we just copied.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.530
Now we head over to the browser,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.245
and see our "Contact Us" page,

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:22.695
hit "Reload", and we can see a problem.

00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:26.650
The provided API key is invalid,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.850
so as the error message says,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.965
we need a API key.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:36.140
This is how Google can keep track of who is accessing its map data.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.465
We can get a API key from the menu,

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.060
back over in the Google website,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.640
on the left-hand side is an option to get an API key.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.890
Before we go any further though,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.255
I just want to point out,

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.130
that websites like this,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.695
often change layouts over time,

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.350
so if you're version looks a little different,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.135
it's usually just a case of a NavigationLink has moved,

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:04.550
but you should still be able to find your way around.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.240
Then we need to go down and select "Get a Key".

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.870
If you're not already logged in,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.910
we need to log into Google,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.530
so I'm going to login,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.990
then click "Next", and then we need to add our password.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.350
Okay, good. Now we're logged in,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.630
we can click on "get an API key" again.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.300
First need to create a project,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.020
so I'm going to create a new project.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.905
Click on this "Create New Project" link,

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:47.740
and one's user name of "Tech Store", and then click on "Next".

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.620
This should then give us our API key,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.835
which we can copy by clicking on this icon here.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.120
Go over to our project,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.520
and then if we take a look at this iframe, which we copied before,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.465
we need to scroll across to the section which says "key equals",

00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:09.295
and then where it says "Your API key",

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.925
delete these three words here,

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:15.885
and then paste in the API key, which you just copied.

00:04:15.885 --> 00:04:21.755
Give that a save, and now if we go back over to our contact page and refresh,

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:26.285
we should now see that we're presented with this Google Maps image,

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.700
instead of the error message.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.930
Now we'll have a connection to the Google Maps API.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.325
Now we just need this map to be at the location of our business.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:42.865
If we go back over to the Google website, and I click "Done",

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.385
we can see a Quickstart from the menu,

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:50.460
which is right at the very top, so click on this.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.245
Here we can build our own custom map.

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.605
We can search for places or a city.

00:04:57.605 --> 00:05:00.420
Let's say New York,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.220
then click on that, and then scroll down,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.440
we can see we have New York appearing on the map there.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.660
We can also search for the Apple address, for example,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.450
so let's search for "infinite loop",

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.745
which is just here,

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:25.260
and then scroll down, and we can see the new location just here.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.080
We already have our API key to construct this map,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.500
so we could just paste this inside of here, and then once you done that,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.625
you click on "Done", and then we're provided with a iframe,

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.065
which we can copy,

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:42.210
and this has this new location,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.215
which we searched for before, so let's copy this.

00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:49.610
Then if we go over to the project and replace

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.360
our iframe with the one which you just copied,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.040
and then if we go back over to our contact page, hit "Refresh",

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.855
and we're now taken to the address which we added in before,

00:06:04.855 --> 00:06:08.610
so of course, you would need to change this to the location of your business,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.785
and this is how we do that.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:16.250
Now we have successfully integrated Google maps into our project.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.595
This is it now for the HTML sections of this course.

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:21.425
Well done for getting this far.

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:25.560
Now we can move on to learning all about CSS.
