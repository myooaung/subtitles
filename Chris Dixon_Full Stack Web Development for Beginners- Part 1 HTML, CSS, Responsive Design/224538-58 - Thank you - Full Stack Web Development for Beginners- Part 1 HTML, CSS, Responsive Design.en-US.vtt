00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.885
I hope you're now a lot more comfortable using HTML,

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.945
CSS, and with responsive design.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:13.470
We started at the very beginning taking a look at

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.145
what HTML is and also a little bit of history.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:21.075
Before moving on to setting up our very own project,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:25.035
we covered all the major elements such as added text,

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:29.295
images, forms, and links, amongst others.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.490
Next up, was the styling using CSS,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.015
where you learned all about how to style,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.080
position, and layout our websites.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.255
Finally, we ensured our website looks great on

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.855
all size devices by covering responsive design,

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:48.965
by creating fluid layouts combined with media queries.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.465
Remember, though, this is just the first part of this course,

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:55.820
so be sure to check out the next Part Two to gain

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.310
a deeper knowledge and then everything you need to know to build full-stack applications.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.580
So bye for now and I will see you in the next part.
