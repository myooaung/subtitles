00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.115
Early in the course when we're looking at HTML and the problems which it solves.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.280
We mentioned, the hypertext is the text displayed on

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
a computer which links to other texts or documents.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.015
These links are called hyperlinks.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.105
We already have our menu items,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.980
just like the example here.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.645
But we need a way to change them to the links to other pages.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:29.565
To do this, we have a element which stands for anchor.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:32.205
We can use it to link to other pages,

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:34.620
different locations on the same page,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.335
or even other websites too.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:42.120
Let's get to work by adding links to our menu items.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.035
Let's go over to the index page,

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:49.145
and let's go over to our header, up at the top.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.600
These three links here,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.125
first links adds the a element around what we want to link.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.445
In our case, we want to link the text here.

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:04.530
I'm just going to cut this out and then open

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.550
up the a element which is opening and closing.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.100
In the middle here we can paste in our home link once more.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.345
This means our text is going to be clickable.

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:19.520
Then we add the location we want to link to,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.815
by adding the href attribute,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.740
which stands for hyperlink reference.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.050
Inside the opening a tag, href,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.965
just H-R-E-F. Then inside this href,

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.735
we can add a link.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.585
Let's link to a random website,

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:42.740
let's say the Mozilla website which we visited earlier,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.080
so http://developer.mozilla.org,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.960
and save that,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.445
over to the browser, refresh.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:01.835
Then back up to the top of the page.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.410
We can see instantly that there's a change with the home link.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.955
If we hover over it, we now see a different cursor.

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.780
It's also a different color with the underline,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.655
which shows it's a link.

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:16.450
Let's click on this and see what happens.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.630
Then we link in to this developer.mozilla.org website,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.880
that's all working fine.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.745
We hit the back button were taken back to our index page.

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:33.220
This is an external link because we are linking away from our own website.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.975
We can also create an internal link to link to another page in our project too.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.795
Let's create some more web pages to link to.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.645
Back over to the project.

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:48.735
Let's go over to our text tile,

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.645
make sure you're not clicking on the images folder.

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:55.995
We'll click off this and then click on new file.

00:02:55.995 --> 00:03:03.160
Make sure this new file is outside the images folder and alongside this index.html.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.380
Then let's save this contact with the dot HTML extension,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.720
just like the index page.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.300
Then let's just add some simple text of contact us page, save that.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.490
Then let's do one more too, new file.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.350
Then let's call this the product-detail.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.400
Again with a dot HTML extension.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.625
Just add some text or product detail page.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.010
This will be the page which will link to,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.395
or click on one of the individual products

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:45.485
to get some more information about that individual product.

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:47.985
Now we'll have our new pages,

00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:51.015
let's go back over to the index.html.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:55.190
Instead of this external link, we can remove this.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.390
We're going to create an internal link to link to these two new pages which you created.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.265
The first one I want to do is link to the index.html page.

00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:09.275
Because this is the home link,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:12.900
we want this to link back to this index page.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.675
You give that a save and then we click on this.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:22.955
We can see nothing changes because it's still link on to this index page,

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:29.235
and of course we still taken this index page. Now for the shop.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.750
If we cut out the shop texts looking as the link with the a tag,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.585
and paste this in the middle.

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:38.420
We don't have a shop page just yet,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.780
so we can leave an empty href attribute.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.365
This means it'll still be styled the same as the rest of the links.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.680
But it just won't link anywhere when we click on it.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.810
Then the contact us page,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.480
which is one of the pages which we just created.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.135
Let's open up the a tags.

00:04:56.135 --> 00:05:02.250
Paste contact us inside the middle, the href attribute.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.630
This time it's contact.html.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.205
Save that, just like when working with images,

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:15.055
this file path is relative.

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.130
This means it's relative to the current location.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.470
We're currently in the index.html page.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.830
The contact and product detail page is alongside this page in the folder structure.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.615
Therefore, we can just add the name of the file.

00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:34.835
If it has one of these files inside of a folder,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:40.355
would also need to add the folder name just before, like this.

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:44.855
But we don't, so we can just leave it as contact.html.

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:47.775
You can give that a save and let's try this out.

00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:51.290
Refresh, we could try the shop and we don't

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.270
have a link to anywhere so this is just staying on the current page.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.330
We have a link to the contact page,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.425
so once we click on this,

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:01.275
it will then take to this contact us page.

00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:03.615
We can also see up at the top,

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:06.495
we're currently in the contact.html.

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:11.850
If we click on the back button on the browser we're then taken back to this index page.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.620
Another type of link we can use is a link to different parts on the same page.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.100
To do this, we need to add some more temporary content to this page.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.760
We can click on a link and scroll down to the part we want.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.240
I'm going to copy the image and paste it down at the bottom,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.495
to create some more content.

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:36.300
Let's look for the images which we added before.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:43.200
This, let's copy it and all we're going to do is keep copying and pasting this in.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.985
Just give us a more content on the page and give that a save.

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:51.650
Then if we refresh the browser,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.865
we now have some content we can scroll down to.

00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:58.130
This will allow us to click on a link and

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.520
then the page will scroll down to the section of the same page.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.645
This is possible by adding a ID,

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:07.365
so lets add an ID to one of these products.

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:12.025
At the very start an ID is just an attribute like we've seen before.

00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:14.830
Let's call this a ID of link.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.320
We can then scroll down to the section when we click on the home button.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:28.780
Let's replace the href here of index or html with the value of a hashtag and then link.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.860
The hash is used for working with IDs and we'll see this a lot

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.925
more later on in the course or working with CSS and JavaScript.

00:07:36.925 --> 00:07:43.575
Now give that a save then refresh and now if click on home,

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:47.805
you see the page now skips down to the first product on here,

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:50.450
which is the one we added the ID to.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.665
Also, it can link to other pages when a user clicks on one of these images.

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:57.905
First, let's reinstate the website to how it was.

00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:03.100
Let's remove this link here and back to index.html.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.950
If we scroll down,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.620
that should remove this ID attribute.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.775
Then we can also remove all the extra images

00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:14.250
which we added in to give us the extra height.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.555
Remove all these extra images,

00:08:17.555 --> 00:08:21.330
leaving just the first one which we had originally.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.590
Now we can get to work on linking when a user clicks on this image.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.875
For this, we can link the product images to this new

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:34.775
product-detail.html file which we created.

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:39.690
All we need to do is surround this image with the a tags.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.085
Lets open up the a tags.

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:48.510
Then inside we paste in the content such as the image which you want to link.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.380
Then inside the opening side,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.065
we add the familiar href attributes,

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:58.350
which is going to link to product-detail.html.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:05.430
Product-detail.html and give that save.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.710
We can also remove this width attribute too,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.025
we'll size this later using CSS.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.990
Remove that and give it a save.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.610
Now over to the browser, we can reload and now we can see when we hover over the image,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.745
the cursor changes to show this is a link,

00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:26.300
and click on this, and then we're take into

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.105
the product detail page which you created here.

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:32.150
This is how we can add links to our website.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.630
The final thing I want to do before finishing off is to

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.645
copy these three links from the header section.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:43.265
Remember these are the same links which are down in the footer.

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:46.955
Just copy these, and then we can replace

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:51.960
these three list items in the footer with the ones which are links.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.145
Give that a save, refresh,

00:09:56.145 --> 00:10:00.670
in fact we need to go back to the index.html.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.740
Then down to the bottom we can see the footer section now has three links too.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.980
This is how we can use links inside our web pages.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.055
They're other really useful and important parts of building websites, as you can see.

00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:19.280
We'll use them a lot as we progress throughout this course.
