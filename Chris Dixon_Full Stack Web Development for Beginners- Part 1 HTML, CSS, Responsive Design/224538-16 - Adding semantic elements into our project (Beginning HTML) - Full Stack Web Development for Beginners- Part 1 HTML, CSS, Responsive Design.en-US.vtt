00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
We've all just learned about semantic HTML elements.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.170
We can now apply these to our project.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.100
As it is, this will not change the appearance inside the browser,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.795
but instead it will add some meaningful structure to our web page,

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.290
which is great for the browser and over developer too.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.020
In the index.html page.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.380
Let's begin from the very top by adding

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.295
the header elements in place of this surrounding div.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.090
Opening tag just put the text of H1,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.165
can be replaced with header.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:38.809
Then at the bottom of this section,

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.655
just below the unordered list,

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.705
we can then close off this header section 2.

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, a web browser or developer can clearly see that this is the heavy section,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.405
rather than just a generic div container.

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:56.225
If we would save that and then reload,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.940
we don't see any difference inside the browser.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.805
The same goes for the sidebar.

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:07.970
We can replace the div element with the aside elements, which we seen before.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.810
Scroll on down below the header, above shop buying,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.440
we can replace this div with aside,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.825
and then down at the bottom,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:23.830
below the unordered list for the prices changes too with aside.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.730
Inside of this aside section,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.885
we also have two sections next to the aside.

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:33.230
One for this category list,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.170
which is this section just here and then one section for the prices.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.605
I'm going to separate these by surrounding each with a section elements.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:50.950
Just below shop by let's add a section elements.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.700
Then let's copy the level three heading of category.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.455
In fact let's cut this out.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:02.170
All the way down to the bottom of the unordered list.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.140
Command or Control X to cut this out and then we'll paste this inside of this section.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.890
This is our first section here for the categories.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.105
Then below this, let's add a second section,

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.990
which is going to be for the prices.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.690
Again, we can copy the Level 3 heading right down to the end of the prices on our list,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.525
Command or Control x to cut this out.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:33.065
Now paste this inside of the section.

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:38.375
Now we have our two sections inside of the sidebar.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:42.950
Give that save, and check if everything is okay in the browser.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.030
We see no difference, so that looks all fine.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.655
These sections we've just created typically contain a heading.

00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:54.020
We already have these h three headings in place here.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.495
So it could be for this moving down outside of the sidebar.

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.410
So let's go below disclose and aside section.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.980
The products will be the main section run from our last video.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.430
We also have these main elements which we can add.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.955
This will replace this surrounding div elements

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:17.335
which goes around the one product we already have.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:22.355
So the open inside of div come replaced with main.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:25.355
Then down on the very bottom,

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.590
close the main section off.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.720
At the very bottom of the page,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.895
we can also make use of the footer element 2.

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:37.790
This is the last div section and page which is the footer.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.425
Let's simply change this to be the new HTML-5 footer elements,

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:50.160
and give that a save and over to the browser reload.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.560
We don't see any difference,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.135
but now we have the semantic tags in place.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.725
We also said in the last video,

00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:59.960
there is now a nav element.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.745
This is used to represent major navigation areas.

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:08.240
Our header and footer menu links to other pages on our website.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.570
This could be a good use case for the nav elements.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.370
First, let's add this around the footer area.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.380
Just after the footer opening tag,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.980
you can add our opening nav and closing tag.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.970
Let's cut this out a little bit,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.875
and then paste in the closing nav.

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.850
Make sure yours looks like this.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.365
We have the footer area.

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:38.840
Next inside, we have the nav,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
and then we have our unordered list with our free links.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.700
Then we can also repeat this for the header section 2 of the top.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.530
Just after tech store,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.795
we can open up the nav.

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:54.230
Then we can cut out the closing tag,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:02.075
which has been automatically added in pharos at this under the unordered list.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:07.930
We can also adjust this a little so that it's more readable.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.375
Save and just refresh and check this is all looking fine,

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.830
which it all seems to be we still have our links in

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.990
place and nothing looks any different,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.305
but we now have more descriptive or semantic elements.

00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:24.120
Now, structure in our web page.
