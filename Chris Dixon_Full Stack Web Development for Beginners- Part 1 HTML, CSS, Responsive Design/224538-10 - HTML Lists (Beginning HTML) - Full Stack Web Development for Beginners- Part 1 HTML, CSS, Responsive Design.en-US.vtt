00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
We're now going to take a look at HTML lists.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.010
Lists as a sound,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.725
is used to display a list of items.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.905
Looking at these finished version of the project here,

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.950
we'll make use of lists in multiple areas.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.395
We have them in a side bar over on the left-hand side to display a list of categories.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.900
Also for the price ranges below too.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.480
Also, we use them for the menu inside of the header and footer.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.010
For these links at the top,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.875
the menu may not look like a list at first glance,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.980
but most menus are created with a list and then

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.069
styled or changed to be in lined by using CSS.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.550
So let's take a look at how we can use them by creating our header list,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.380
with the three links of home,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
shop and contact us.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.630
Back over to our text editor.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.690
First we set what type of list we want to use.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.270
I'm going to begin with a unordered list,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.675
which uses the UL tags.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.940
So just open the top,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.835
inside this first div,

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.985
I'm going to create an unordered list,

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.875
below the tech store.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.290
So open up the UL tags,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.020
which is again opening and closing tags.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.755
Unordered lists are basically a bulleted list.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:21.370
So we see a black bullet or circle to the left of each item by default.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.890
This bullet can be changed or removed too inside

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.520
of CSS and we'll see how to do this later on.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.915
Then we add our list items between LI tags.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:38.485
Let's add our first list item, which is home.

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:44.240
Then just below this we can also add a second list item and this one is for

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.870
the shop and then the third one at the very bottom is for contact us.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.820
So there's our three list items and make sure

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.715
all three items are nested inside these UL tags.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:04.380
Once that's done, we can give that a save and then test this in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.285
the browser and there's our three links at the very top.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:11.225
You can also see the three bullets on the left-hand side,

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:12.860
which I mentioned before.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.980
We can also create a numbered list too by changing UL to be OL.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.710
So let's change U to be O.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.915
Give that a save, reload,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.585
and by default have the numbers 1,

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:33.380
2 and 3, and so on for each list item.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.520
We're not limited to just numbers though when using lists,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.695
we can add a type attribute to change things around.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:44.150
Inside the opening OL tag.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.585
We can add a type and set this equal to various characters.

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:53.650
So first of all, we change this to a lowercase a,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.890
save that, refresh, we now have lowercase letters of a,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.385
b, and c. If this was uppercase and lowercase a,

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:10.565
these three letters would now be uppercase too.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:17.100
We can also apply roman numerals with a lowercase i.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.710
Give that a save, reload,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.650
and have the lowercase roman numerals on the left-hand side.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.360
We can also do the same if we wanted these roman numerals

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.515
to be uppercase this time with a capital I.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:34.940
Let's see how this is looking.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.040
Now they're all uppercase.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.505
We also have the number one too,

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:42.155
but this is a default,

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.410
as we've seen right at the start of 1, 2 and 3.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.320
So we don't need to add this in.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.905
Lists can also be nested too.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:55.385
For example, if we wanted to add some list items set under our shop link,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:04:01.570
we can add a new UL or ordered list inside, just like this.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.650
So just below our shop,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.370
in fact we'll remove the type first and then just

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.945
below our shop we'll create a new unordered list,

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.485
exactly like we just did before.

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:17.685
So the opening and closing tags.

00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:20.105
So I'm list items.

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:26.220
So let's say nested item and then one more,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.090
nested item two, give that a save,

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:42.245
hit refresh and now we can see our new nested items message just below this shop link.

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:46.250
This is how we can add list to our websites.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.570
Next, we'll add the rest of the list to our project in a little challenge.
