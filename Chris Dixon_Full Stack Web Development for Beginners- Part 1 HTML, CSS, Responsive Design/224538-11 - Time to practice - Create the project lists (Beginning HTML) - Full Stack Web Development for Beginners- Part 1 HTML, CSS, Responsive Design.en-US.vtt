00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.835
Now we know how to create lists.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:07.170
I would like you to go ahead and add the rest of the lists for our project.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.890
As a guide, they all need to be on all the lists.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.685
We already have the header items in place of home,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.980
shop and contact us.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.335
We just need to change this back to

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:24.315
an unordered list and make sure we just have these three links which we see here,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.080
rather than the nested one which we added in the last video.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.260
Then we'll have two more lists in the sidebar

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.485
to the place under the headings we already have.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:41.830
This section here is one list and then below we have a list of the prices too.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.330
Finally, down at the very bottom,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.790
we have a footer menu too.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.415
This is just the same as the one we added for the header. Give it a go.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:56.724
It's a great way to learn by repeating and getting some practice.

00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.780
If you still don't feel confident enough to give us

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.510
a go by itself, that's completely fine.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.085
Just follow along with me,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.420
and we'll now do it together.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.675
Let's close this and go back over to Visual Studio.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:21.220
First makes you our header menu is back to an unordered list. Give that change.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.370
We also have this unordered list nested in the middle, remove that.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.940
Then we have the list that we seen before underneath the category header.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.705
First I'm going to go ahead and add a horizontal line.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.525
We can do this with a hr element.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.610
This is also a self-closing tag,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.465
meaning no closing tag is needed.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:48.635
Taking a look at the finished project once more, go to the sidebar,

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:51.755
the horizontal line is just this one we see here,

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:57.960
which separates the header from the list items and the same for the price too.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.865
Let's take a look and go over to the category,

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.265
which is h3 tag here.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:10.110
Then we can add our hr.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.320
Below it, we can start to construct our own ordered list.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
Inside here, I will first list item which we have,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.435
is all items and this can be anything which you prefer.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:26.915
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.590
Remember this is all just to practice.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.200
So cameras, then laptops,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.890
after laptops we have phones,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.890
accessories, and the final one was for other.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.400
Give that save, go to the browser and refresh.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.270
Our top menu is now back as it should be and below category,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.230
we have our line which spreads the full width of the page for now,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.175
but that's nothing to worry about.

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:18.490
Below this we have our list items in an unordered list.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.875
Then we have the second sidebar list for the price ranges,

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.940
which we're going to add just blow this price heading here.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.505
Back over to the text editor,

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:33.590
we'll add these in below this h3, the price.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.900
Make sure that this unordered list again is still between this div section.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.079
Remember this is the full container for our sidebar.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.770
All the content of the sidebar needs to go between the opening and closing tags.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.460
Let's start again with our horizontal rule and then our unordered list.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.960
Inside here, I will list items,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.880
you can add the price, let's say 1-9,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.670
the second price range was 10-29,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:24.600
then keep going 30-59,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.690
let's say 60-99, and the very bottom one can be 100 plus.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.685
Then save, reload, and then we have our second unordered list below the price.

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.470
That's looking okay now.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.040
Finally we have the footer menu.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.370
First we need to create a footer div section to add these inside.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.730
Remember we've got the div section for our header.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.260
We've got the div section here for our sidebar and then down at the bottom,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.000
we've got this div section for our main content, which includes the products.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.935
Just after this section and also still between the body tags,

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:18.460
we're going to add a new div and this is for the photo section.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.025
All we need to do is just add a new unordered list with a new list items.

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.710
This is exactly the same as the header section.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.090
So we have home,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.280
we have shop and then finally we have contact us.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.685
With that in place, give that a save.

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:47.820
To see this in the browser, we'll refresh.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.645
We now see this down at the very bottom.

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:52.460
I will have these lists in place.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.850
Next one to move on to taking a look at adding images.
