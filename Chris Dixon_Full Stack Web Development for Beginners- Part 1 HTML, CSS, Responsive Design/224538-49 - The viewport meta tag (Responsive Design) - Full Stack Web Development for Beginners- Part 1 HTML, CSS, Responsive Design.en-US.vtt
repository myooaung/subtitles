00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.895
In the last video, we took a look at

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:09.015
the Chrome Developer Tools and how we can preview our website on different size devices.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:14.040
Currently if you take a look at our website in a smaller smartphone size,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
we can see the it looks just like a normal desktop view.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.285
But zoomed out to fit all the content on the screen.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.425
When we covered the basic structure of a web page earlier in the course,

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.855
we talked about using meta tags.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:33.885
Which we can add in the head section to add some additional information about our sites.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:39.220
In this video, we'll be looking at a new tag called the viewport meta tag.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.430
This is important for responsive design.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.830
If you don't have this viewport meta tag in place,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.860
as we've seen in the last video, and just now,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.165
smaller devices will render our page at the desktop size,

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.270
but then scale to fit the screen.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.345
This is so users do not have to keep scrolling across the page to see all the content.

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:07.640
This viewport tag gives us control of how we want our pages to appear.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.550
We added just like any of a metatag which we've used.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.790
Just under this first metatag,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.785
we can open up a new one,

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:23.415
but this time give it a name equal viewport, and then close off.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:28.595
If we give that a Save and then go over to the browser and refresh,

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:33.865
we see our preview doesn't look any different than it did before we added this tag.

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:36.245
For any changes take effect,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:39.655
we need to set the width we want our content to be.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:44.540
Let's go over to our metatag and add the content attributes.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.085
Then we can set the width to be equal at say 300 pixels.

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:55.275
Now if we save that and then reload.

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:58.880
We can see by this white browser section from the left to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.910
this right part that this content is now been set to 300 pixels.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.180
We can also see that after this right-hand side,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.295
these products outside of this width.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.770
Because they got a fixed size and they can't

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.585
stretch or shrink depending on the screen size.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:19.645
The browser will still need to zoom out to fit in all these products.

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.810
Scientific size like this is generally

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.070
discouraged because of the many variants in screen sizes.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.510
Therefore, we can go back over to the metatag and then change this.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.480
Rather than having a width equal a fixed size,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.070
we can set this to be equal to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.220
the device width and make sure that these all between the quotations.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.615
Doing this not only causes four different screen sizes,

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:50.335
but also fall when a device is rotated to.

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:53.150
Also if we do not want the browser to zoom

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.870
out to see the rest of the products which will flown.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.370
We can set the initial scale to be equal to one.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.509
Still in between a quotation,

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:11.330
you can add a comma and then set the initial scale to be equal to one, give that a Save.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.975
Reload the browser and if you don't see any changes you may need to close

00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:21.075
Developer Tools down and then go back in to this take effects.

00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:25.610
There we go. Now the content is cutoff the edge because

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.185
the browser is no longer zooming out to display all contents.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:32.180
Also, as a side note,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.980
some phones will keep the same width when rotating and zoom out,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.000
rather than allowing the content to re-flow to the new size.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.510
Suddenly initial scale will also help this,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.380
is set zoom level when the page is first loaded.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.115
But we'll still allow the user to zoom if required.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:57.740
The main thing to remember is that we should always include this tag in our projects.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.000
This is because if we do not set the consent width the more of our browser,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.595
will assume that you have a desktop screen size somewhere around 980 pixels wide.

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:13.475
Depending on the device and that you want the full page to display.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.170
We will zoom up making things look really small.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.585
Inclusive viewpoint metatag will also allow

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:25.145
our media queries to work correctly to later in this section.

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:30.680
We still have this problem of the product cell because the [inaudible] using pixel sizes.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.750
Which is a fixed size,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.750
meaning they are cut off the edge of the screen.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.170
But we'll begin to look at relative sizes in the next video,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.370
which will help with this.
