00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
We're now at the end of this responsive design section.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.965
Now will be a good time to get some more practice on your own.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:13.995
We have added media queries to change the layout of our homepage of these projects.

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:17.010
Also, we use relative units such as em,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.075
and percentages to make our designs more fluid.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:26.810
As a challenge, I would like you to now go ahead and do the same for the contact us page,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.830
which you see here, and also from the homepage,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.660
if you go down to the product detail,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.700
by clicking on this first product.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.580
I would like you to also add some media queries,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.285
to make this section look a lot better.

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:44.135
Remember, though there is no right or wrong way to do this.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:49.460
Just follow the same steps as we've taken during the section and apply the CSS,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.550
which you think works best.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.860
Good luck with this, and I'll see you in the next section.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.155
We have got some really good stuff lined up.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.720
We'll start to look at the flexbox and grid.
