00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
I now want to take a quick step back from adding to

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.355
this website and take a moment to look at what we call semantic elements.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:13.815
Semantic elements are simply elements which clearly describe their contents,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.260
not only to tell the internet browser but also

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.215
other developers also looking at your code too.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.185
This is a diagram of a typical website.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:28.050
The body contains all the contents which we see on the screen, as we already know.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.300
Here, we see some typical sections of a website.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.820
Each section has a div elements.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.195
A div is a section or division used to group together content.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:44.630
We've already done this in our project by grouping the header section,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.420
the sidebar, and each product.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.335
This is how things have been done in web design for quite a long time and still are.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.135
Div elements are perfectly fine to use.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:00.010
In fact, we'll use them during this course quite a lot.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.760
Often you will see an Id attribute added to each of these divs.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630
This allows you to select a certain div,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.620
we want to apply styling or layout to use the CSS.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.789
Here we also add some more div elements,

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.285
this time nested inside of existing ones.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.515
Again, this is fine and very common.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:26.510
We've already done this in the project by having

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.010
a surrounding parent div for all of the main content,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.135
then nest in a div inside of each product inside this main div.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:40.265
Since HTML version five,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:45.935
we now have some alternative elements which we can use just like you can see here.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:48.425
Rather than using a generic div,

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.915
we can now use a semantic or more descriptive elements.

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:57.125
Both the div and all these new elements we see here,

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:01.750
still have an opening and closing tag to surround the content too.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.530
We have header elements which we can add to our project in

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.945
place of the div surrounding our site title and navigation menu.

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:12.675
There is also main,

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:15.645
which contains the main content of the website.

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:18.530
This is not to be used for any content which is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.550
repeated in other pages, such as sidebars.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.960
For example, the side elements we see on the right is often

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.565
used to sidebars and is usually repeated across the website.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:36.505
Therefore, it is best to be kept separate from the main content.

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.695
We also have a sidebar footer too,

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:44.750
so we can make use of all these new elements here inside of our project.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.540
This is the example we've seen earlier,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.370
well this time with the newer, more semantic elements.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.150
Here you can see an article element which is ideal for uses such as

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.600
a blog post or a widget which has self-contained content.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.850
There is also a section element below two.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.500
This as it sounds,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.800
defines a section of our web documents.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.875
This is to group together related content.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.605
We also now have the nav element,

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.940
which you can use to surround our navigation links.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.585
We don't need to add these to all navigation areas of our site.

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:28.465
It's only intended to be used for major blocks or nav links.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:32.570
Note that we've placed this inside of the header for this example.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.610
However, this is not required.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.915
It can be placed inside or outside of the header or even nested inside over areas two.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:47.060
We can also take things even further by reusing elements such as

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.830
the header or footer to define the header or footer section of an article,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.365
for example or even play sections inside of other elements,

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.450
such as the sidebar.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.590
Remember though this is just one common way to use these.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.360
You're not forced to use in any particular way.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.460
Their use will also differ depending on the style of website which you're building.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.145
Now we know what is available to us.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:20.370
We can now move on and these to our project.
