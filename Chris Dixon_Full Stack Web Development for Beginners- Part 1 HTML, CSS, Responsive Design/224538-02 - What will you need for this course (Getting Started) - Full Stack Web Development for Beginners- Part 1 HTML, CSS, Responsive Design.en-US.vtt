00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.905
For this course, you will only need a few things to get up and running.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.725
First, we need a text editor.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:12.120
You may already have a preference or one you already use.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.825
For this course, I'll be using Visual Studio Code,

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.165
which is ideal for JavaScript coding,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.655
and also has a built-in terminal,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.265
which we can use later in the course.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.335
You can use any you like.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.640
But here are some popular text editor options such as Atom,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.675
Brackets, WebStorm, and of course, Visual Studio Code.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:37.840
If you already have one of these and a web browser,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.580
feel free to move on to the next video.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.160
If not, I would recommend you go to code.visualstudio.com,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.870
and follow the download instructions for your platform.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.690
Finally, you will also need a web browser.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.070
I would recommend Chrome by Google,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.575
but you can use any which you prefer.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:01.955
During the course, we'll be using the developer tools inside of Chrome,

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:05.360
but other browsers do have these built in too.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.765
It may just look slightly different to I'm doing.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:11.105
This is now all we need to get go in.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:16.050
Next, we'll take a little look into what HTML actually is.
