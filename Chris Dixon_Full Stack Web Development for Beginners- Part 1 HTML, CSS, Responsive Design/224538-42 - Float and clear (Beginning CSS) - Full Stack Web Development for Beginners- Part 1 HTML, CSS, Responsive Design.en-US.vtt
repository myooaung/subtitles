00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.565
Welcome back everybody.

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.760
We're going to take a look at floats and clear in this video.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.645
Floats are a way to position our elements on a page.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:13.500
For example, we could float an image to the left,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.810
and then the rest of the content will wrap around in the rest of the available space.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.570
This is probably best seen to better understand exactly what it does.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.690
So on this homepage, if you click on a Game Controller,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.110
and then let's go over to the product detail.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.770
I want this image which is just here to appear on the left-hand side.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.480
We have all these product texts and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.990
the information over on the right-hand side of the image.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.935
We have already seen this can be achieved by using inline and inline-block display types,

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:48.485
but we're going to concentrate on floats in this video.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.390
If we go over to the file,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.285
which is the productdetail.html,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.854
I'm going to add a new class to the product so we can select this in CSS.

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.880
So just after the class of product,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.865
we can add a second class inside here,

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.680
and let's say product detail,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.035
and then back over in the CSS,

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:17.095
the following styles are applied specifically to this Product Detail page.

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.640
So let's add a comment.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.215
So a CSS comment is a forward slash,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.945
a star, then our text.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.675
Let's say product detail page.

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:31.540
I'm going to close this off with a star and a forward slash again.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.390
Then I'm going to make the product div a little wider so it fits

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.380
the image and also the text side by side.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.160
Let's target this product hyphen detail

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.010
class and then we can set the width to be 660 pixels.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.645
So let's save and see how this is looking.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:58.400
Reload. Okay, so the image is a little big for now,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.115
but now we have the container set to be 660 pixels.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:05.130
Now onto floating.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.295
We want the image to float to the left-hand side,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.725
or in fact, we can float it to either side.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:13.675
But in my case, I want it to be on the left-hand side,

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.505
and then the text over on the right-hand side.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:20.300
So therefore, we can select the product detail image inside

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.220
the CSS with product detail and then image.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.890
So to begin, let's set the maximum width of the image to be 50 percent,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.205
and that's 50 percent of the container.

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.520
Then we can float this to be on the left.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.320
In fact, before we do that,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.985
we'll just leave that empty and refresh.

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:47.975
Now, you can see by default,

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:53.350
we have the image and then the text which is block-level on its own separate line.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.510
If we then go ahead and add a float and we float the image to left,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.870
let's see what effect this has. Okay, good.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.545
So we've now restricted this image to be 50 percent or half the width of the container,

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:13.600
then floated the image to the left of all the rest of the content.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.025
This means the text now occupies the remaining space on the right-hand side.

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.500
Now, I'm going to add some more text to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.405
this product to fully show the effect that the float has.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.425
If we go over to the Product Detail page,

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.695
and then at the very bottom of the Add to Cart,

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:35.265
that just opened the p tags to add some text.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:38.900
If you're using Visual Studio code like I am,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.140
we can simply type in lorem, and then hit "Tab",

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.715
and then we're given some sample text which will go between these p tags.

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:50.195
If not, you can simply write any content which you want.

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.955
Order a Google search for Lorem Ipsum,

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:55.160
which is these two words here,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.700
and then you'll be able to copy and paste some sample text.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.535
Click on "Save", reload,

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:06.605
and we can see straight away that now there is more text available.

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:11.794
We can see a lot better now the image is floating to the left of the rest of the content,

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:16.190
and then the remaining text is wrapping around the rest of the space.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.860
We can also float this to the right instead of the left.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.560
So let's give this a go.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.830
Refresh. Then the same happens but on the other side.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.560
We can also set this to be "None".

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.155
Now, we're back to where we started with no float taking place,

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:42.905
and then the block-level text will appear on the next line.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:46.370
So floats are really useful for this kind of thing.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.840
But like most things,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.820
there are some drawbacks.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.845
Before a lot more recently other techniques were created,

00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:59.029
floats were and sometimes still are used to lay out a full webpage.

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.490
You would often see the main content float is to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.955
the left and also a sidebar on the right.

00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:07.850
This does work, but when we use these floats,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.255
something weird can appear to happen.

00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:11.790
To show this more clearly,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.705
I'm going to set up a simple div just above the footer.

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:18.740
We have an image and some text inside.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.209
So let's go to the product detail,

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.200
and then down to the footer area.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.765
Just scrolling down to the bottom.

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:30.215
So just between this main and footer,

00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:32.570
let's set up a simple div.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.920
First of all, with an image and the source.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.550
This can be any image [inaudible] use one from images folder.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.530
Now, let's say the controller.jpg.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.845
Then the text in the p tags of 'Hello'.

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:55.605
So let's go over to the Product Detail page in the browser and then refresh,

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.325
and there's our image and the text there on the bottom.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:03.110
So this looks as we would expect inside the browser.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.040
So let's go back over to the text editor and add a float to this image.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.980
So inline is fine.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.560
For this example, we'll set the float to be on the left.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.100
Now, let's see how this looks when we refresh.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.005
So we can see straight away that something strange has happened.

00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:31.380
The content below, which was a div for this footer area,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.565
now moves up alongside our image.

00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:38.530
But we want this to be right at the bottom of the page as it's a footer.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.080
If we go over to the Developer tools, right-click and "Inspect".

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.780
Let's take a look and see what is happening.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.740
If we go ahead and click on the arrow and then select the parent div,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.565
and this is the div which we added for the image and the text of 'hello'.

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:58.010
So let's go to the image,

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.725
and this is the parent div here.

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:05.345
We can see if we hover over this div appearing just here,

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:07.285
we see some dimensions.

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:12.480
So the div is 1,000 pixels wide by 19.2.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.240
So this shows the div as only having the same height as

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.845
the text of this 'hello' text here inside of the container.

00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:25.165
It doesn't seem to take into account the height of the image.

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:31.225
This is because floated items do not affect the height of the parent container.

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:35.290
This means this footer area below basically

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.360
ignores this image and is pushed up to the height of the 'hello' text.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.895
We can fix this by setting the overflow to be auto on the container.

00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:51.360
So let's go over to our div and we can set the "Style",

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.720
and then add in the overflow of auto,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.590
back over and refresh, and scroll down.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.865
Now, our footer is back at the very bottom.

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:09.395
If you go back into these DevTools and go down to the div,

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:12.745
which we've seen before, give that a click.

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:16.870
We can now see on the screen, let's scroll up,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.050
that the height of the div is now 425 pixels,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.875
which is also accounting for the height of this image too.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:29.660
Solution to this floating problem is called the clearfix.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.340
This overflow property will fix the problem in most browsers.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.890
You can also do a Google search for

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:43.145
the micro clearfix and you'll find small CSS solutions to this problem.

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:47.240
This will also become less of a problem to you when we start looking

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.380
at the CSS Grid and Flexbox later in the course,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.270
rather than using only float for layout.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.260
So let's close this. Just to recap,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.180
when we use a floated element,

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.485
just like this image,

00:09:00.485 --> 00:09:03.020
the height is not taken into account,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.975
which is why this footer area was pushed up below this text here, which wasn't floated.

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:13.450
So that's something which is really key to understand when using floats.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.120
Also when working with floats too,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.880
there is also another CSS property to be aware of,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.520
and this is called clear.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.645
Again, this is probably best seen in practice to understand.

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:33.500
I'm first going to modify this example to have a left and also a right floated element.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.225
So at present, we have the image which is floated to the left.

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:43.820
Now, let's go ahead and open up the p tags and float this to the right.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.540
So Style, float to the right,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.095
semicolon at the end.

00:09:52.095 --> 00:09:56.085
Then let's add a third element which is not floated.

00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:59.120
So some simple texts will do for this.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.575
So let's say not floated and "Save" that,

00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:07.995
go to the browser and then refresh.

00:10:07.995 --> 00:10:12.615
So at the moment, we have the image which is floated to the left,

00:10:12.615 --> 00:10:17.355
the text on the right and a [inaudible] just to make this simpler.

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:20.210
We'll add 'Floated' in there.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.040
So we have the floated image to the left.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.380
We have the floated text to the right.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.915
Then the not floated text in the center.

00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:31.425
This not floated text is alongside the image,

00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:34.645
and also on the same line as the floated text.

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.710
Clear let's us specify

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:43.235
this non floated element can be placed alongside these floated ones or not.

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:50.175
If we go back over to the p tags and then also add a style property.

00:10:50.175 --> 00:10:54.550
We'll say, clear the left float,

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.235
over to the browser and refresh.

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:02.170
The not floated text now appears below.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.315
This is because we are basically saying

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:07.480
this non floated element is not allowed to

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.410
be placed next to this image which is floated to the left.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.230
We can also declare that we don't want it to

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.395
be positioned next to the right floated element too.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:21.380
We can change this by clearing the right.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.385
Now it's alongside the floated text both on the next line.

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:34.015
So this tells the browser not to place this alongside any right floated elements.

00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:37.695
This is why it appears below on its own separate line,

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:43.120
or we can go ahead and clear both the left and the right together by

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.495
setting this clear value to be both, and then refresh.

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:53.560
Now, the text is below both the left and right floated elements.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.945
So now I'm going to go ahead and remove

00:11:55.945 --> 00:12:02.485
these extra div section as we don't need this inside the project and then "Save" that.

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:07.720
We could also make sure the product detail image is floated to the left,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.105
and then our project is back to normal.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:15.125
Also, we can remove this extra Lorem Ipsum text.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:19.070
So let's go back up to the product and remove
