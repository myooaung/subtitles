00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
I'm going to begin by looking at one way of adding styles,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.035
which is to add them in line.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:12.600
In line basically means we add them inside of each HTML element.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.170
This final version has a gray background color for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.700
the header and also the footer down at the bottom.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.040
Let's begin by adding a background color to the index.html.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.965
Let's go to the head element,

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:33.915
index.html, let's go to the top of the page.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.255
Here we have our header elements.

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:42.970
Alpha can use the style attributes to add inline style inside here.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.124
We can then select the background property to add a color, add a colon.

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:53.185
We can use a coolers name for most values,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.955
such as red, blue, or yellow.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.290
Let's start with red.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.145
Each CSS property needs to end with a semicolon and give us save.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.915
Then reload the browser,

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.750
go to the index.html.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.005
There's a pretty terrible look in red header,

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.480
but the star property is now taken effect.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.079
We can also use colors in other formats too,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.030
instead of just typing the name,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.215
such as RGBA and hex.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:33.070
If we go over to Google and if you search for a color picker,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.080
is various online tools we can use for a color picker,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.065
I'm going to use the W3Schools version,

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.815
which is the top link on here.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:48.900
Here we can select a color from this picture on the left.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.925
Let's let any color for now. Let's go for blue.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:58.000
If we scroll down, we can see this is a different formats here.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.690
The first one has a hash and this is a hexagon value.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.465
Hex stands for hexadecimal color and has a hash prefix,

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:09.825
it's made up of six digits.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.125
The first two is red,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:17.605
the second two is green and then finally the two blue values at the end.

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:23.790
The hex color combination I have chosen for the header is 333A40.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.680
Let's go over and replace this red value.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.125
Let's add the hash,

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:38.355
then the value of 333A40 and give us save. Let's take a look at this.

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:43.505
Now I have the same dark color which you see in the final version just here.

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:48.635
If we head back over to the W3Schools website and then refresh,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:57.330
this also a RGB value just below inside the brackets we add the value of red, green,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.300
and then blue as a number ranging from zero to 255,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.129
zero being the least intense and 255 being the most intense.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.525
If we wanted a red color,

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.235
just like we see on here,

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:17.305
we see the first value of reds as 255,

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:22.920
zero for the green and also zero for the blue, which makes sense.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.150
Then below the color becomes more orange.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.025
This third one for example,

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:30.260
we see we can add more green.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.375
255 for the red,

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:36.115
128 for the green and zero for the blue.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.840
You may also see a fourth value too,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.715
which is called RGBA.

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:47.730
If we also do a Google search for RGBA.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.390
Again, I'm going to go on this W3Schools website, for this link here.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.765
Here we can see RGBA value and the four values inside the brackets too,

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:05.495
this is just like an RGB color,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.420
but with a fourth value of alpha.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.315
Alpha is used to set the opacity and is a value between zero and one.

00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:18.980
Zero Is fully transparent and one is a solid color.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.284
If we go back over to our index.html page,

00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:28.655
the default text color we see on the page here is this dark black color.

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:33.945
This text color can also be changed using the color property like this.

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.080
We just after the semicolon,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.410
we can also add the color which applies to the text.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.050
We are going to changes to be white,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.795
and also the semicolon at the end.

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:49.205
This can also be a column name and RGBA or hex value.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:54.070
Both am going to keeps it simple as white and then refresh.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.805
Now we have this white color at the top of the header.

00:04:57.805 --> 00:05:02.495
You will notice that these free navigation links and the light,

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:04.640
this is because these are links.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.060
We need to target the A element for this to take effect.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.015
The same background color can also be applied to the 42.

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:19.685
All we need to do is take this style attributes and then copy,

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:23.860
and we scroll right down to the bottom of the page,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.890
we just need to add this inside the opening footer tag.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.044
Then if we go down to the bottom and hit refresh,

00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:35.495
we now get the same colors applied to the footer.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:38.900
This is how we can add inline styles.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.745
They can be useful for quickly adding a style to one particular element.

00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:48.020
But you can probably already see some disadvantages already.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.285
Such as even at this early stage we're already duplicating the same code,

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:55.880
which is not usually a good idea.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.270
Also, but a time where add styles to every elements on

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.065
his page may begin to look really messy.

00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:07.340
Another big disadvantage is if we decide to change something,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.460
such as a font color at a later date,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.895
we will then need to look through every text element in

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.975
every HTML page and change them all individually.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:20.600
Thankfully, there are some better approaches,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.270
and we will look at one of them in the next video.
