00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
In this video, we're going to be looking at the CSS Box Model.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.025
The box model is one of those things where once you know it,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.155
it's really easy to understand.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.600
But if you're not aware of what it is,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.110
it can cause problems when trying to fit elements onto a page.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.125
As an example, if we go over to our CSS and we change

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:28.845
our product width inside this product class here, say 210 pixels.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:33.449
If we save that and reload the browser,

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.425
we now want to have to these products fit in our row.

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:41.640
Now let's go back over to our CSS and investigate.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.325
If we look our product, we've set this to be 210 pixels wide.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:48.335
If we take a look above,

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.255
we set this main section to be 608 pixels.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:57.635
Our three products down below come to 630 pixels in total.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:03.595
So far we are still within the 608 pixels wrapper for the main section,

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:08.255
but then you may be correctly thinking we have some space around the products.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:11.860
We did add five pixels margin to all sides.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.650
These extra five pixels per side would then mean

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.030
each product takes up 220 pixels each and a total of 660.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.870
Again, still within this 680 pixels, main section.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.495
Padding is inside of the elements,

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.075
so you may think this is irrelevant.

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:37.190
We did add five pixels of padding too just down here.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.990
Well, in fact, it's actually included too.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.335
Let's go over to the browser developer tools and see how this looks.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.565
All browsers have their own version of developer tools.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:51.305
If you're not using Chrome,

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:55.195
you'll be able to access the developer tools by looking in the menu,

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:58.940
but I would recommend using Chrome for this case.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.690
All we need to do is right-click and then go down to inspect.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.430
Once it pops up, we can click on the inspector icon in the top left-hand corner.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.000
Click on this arrow there and then we can hover over

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.820
our products and then click the div with the class of products.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.280
This allows us to see the HTML on the left hand side.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.670
Here we can see we've highlighted our first div class of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.445
products and also the CSS which applies this product on the right-hand side.

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:35.155
Our product div is here put the border, width,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:40.050
margin, padding, and the display type of inline block.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.285
If we scroll down to the bottom of the CSS section,

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.025
we can see a box.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.615
This image down here represents the box model.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:53.105
In the very middle, we have our elements,

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:58.235
which we now set to 210 pixels wide, as we see here.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:03.685
Then on top of this we have five pixels of padding around each side.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:06.510
We have a border value of one pixel

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.425
too and then on the outside we have five pixels of margin.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:16.170
It's important to understand that these extra padding, border,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.610
and margin values added to these elements making it bigger overall.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.430
We set the width for the product to be 210 pixels wide.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.000
But in reality, each product takes up a width of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.760
232 pixels once we add on all these extras.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.340
This is why in the browser,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.300
all three of our products won't fit on the same line.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.940
There is a way to change it though.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.115
We can use a CSS property of box-sizing.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:51.020
If we go back over to the products inside the CSS,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.515
we can add the box-sizing property and set this to be border-box.

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.185
Put a column at the end.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:07.220
Setting this to border-box will make sure the width we declare is a total width.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.070
Although we have basis demo on the width,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.280
all these also applies when working with height too.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640
That's one thing to bear in mind.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.720
Now with the box-sizing set to border-box,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.635
it will go to the browser and then reload and just shrink down the developer tools.

00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.815
We now see we have three products on each row.

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:32.255
If we go back over to the developer tools,

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:37.080
in fact we'll need to refresh first and then drag this back up.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.030
Still within our first product here,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.660
if we now scroll down to the very bottom to our box model,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.320
we can instantly see that the element in the center now

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.425
has a value of a 198 for this element width.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:57.075
This has been reduced to accommodate the padding and also the border values too,

00:04:57.075 --> 00:05:00.240
to then equal 210 pixels.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.510
Then we still have this five pixel margin surrounding outside,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.485
just like we did originally.

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.955
This is how the box model works.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:13.870
We even need to take into account any extra value such as border, padding,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.060
and margin too or we can apply the CSS property of border-box.
