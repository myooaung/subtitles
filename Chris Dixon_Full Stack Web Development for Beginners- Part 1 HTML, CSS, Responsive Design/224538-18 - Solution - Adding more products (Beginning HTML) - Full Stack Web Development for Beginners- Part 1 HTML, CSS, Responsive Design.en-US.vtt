00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Hope you managed to complete the rest of the product and get some more practice,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.380
add an HTML to your website.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.005
I'm quickly going to run through and add these extra five product in to my project.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.090
Back over to the index or HTML.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.030
Let's scroll down to our product inside the main section.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.115
This div section here is the one containing all of the product information.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:31.005
I'm just going to copy this and paste this in just below.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm going to actually remove this link to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.905
the product detail and just leave this in the first form.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.910
Let's remove that and line all these up.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.320
The first one was the product controller.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.945
The second one is going to be for the headphones.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:01:00.030
The images was headphones dot jpg.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.790
The alt was the headphones picture.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.240
Then the text of white headphones,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.820
and the price we can add any price you want,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.530
let's say 54.95 for that.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.060
We'll call these awesome white headphones.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.300
There is break tag in there just to add these on two different lines.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.085
Add to cart and more info can remain too,

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.640
but let's remove the link to this two.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.455
You don't have to do that, but I'm just going to remove this for mine.

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:51.220
Then we can copy this again and paste in,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.440
make sure this is all lined up.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.250
The third item was for the camera,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.745
which was camera dot jpg.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:10.000
The camera picture description was for the Canon camera.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.425
Also let's remove this link here,

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:19.755
infact this on the headphones too,

00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:22.325
so that the image with the alternative text,

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.845
the title, the price,

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.300
is going to be a bit more.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.895
Let's say 649.95. The description,

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:37.440
awesome camera by Canon.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.265
Copy and let's paste this in again.

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:47.565
After the camera was the microphone.

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:53.530
Microphone dot jpg, the old text,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.330
a title into that, this is a Yeti microphone.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.670
The price, 119.95 for that.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.960
Inscription, let's say awesome blue Yeti microphone.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.210
Below this, just line is up and are the same.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.340
This is our cables.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.340
Instead of camera this is going to be cables.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.140
Cables picture. The title.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.750
Price, 10.95 and save for cables.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.180
Description, awesome cables available in different lengths.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.780
You can add anything in here which you prefer,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.040
it doesn't really matter.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.965
The whole point is just get some more practice of writing HTML code.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.445
Then after the cables,

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:15.040
we've got our last one which is for the lenses.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.810
Let's say camera lenses

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.870
99.95 and let's say awesome camera lenses.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.300
One, two, three, four, five,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.840
six there's our six products now on the index page.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.440
Give that save and then refresh.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.380
From the top we have our first product,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.980
our headphones, the camera,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.125
microphone cables, and also the lenses.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.165
I hope you manage to complete this, if not,

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:06.035
don't worry, you'll have had some more valuable practice anyway.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:10.950
I'll see you now in the next video where we'll take a look at HTML comments.
