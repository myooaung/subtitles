00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.190
Before we jump into adding HTML to our webpages,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.980
I just want to make sure we understand exactly what HTML is and what it does.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.835
I'm not going to go too deep and technical just yet.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.720
But understanding why we use it and why it came

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.170
about in the first place will really benefit us when we come to code them.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.060
First of all, what exactly is HTML?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560
It may sound a little weird at first,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.475
but we'll look into what this all means soon.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:43.295
HTML is a standard markup language for creating websites and applications.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:46.180
HTML is everywhere on the web.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.565
Most websites are constructed using this and

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.345
all browsers know how to read and display it correctly.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.825
Like all programming languages and most things in life,

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.030
things change and evolve.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.390
We currently own version five of HTML.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.279
Like all new versions,

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:08.315
things get added or removed when a new version comes out,

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.875
which is not that often,

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.110
is not something to worry about.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.830
Everything we already know usually still applies.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.940
It's just often a case of improvements and new features as technology moves on.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.850
We'll cover a lot of the new HTML5 features during this course.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
HTML is used to format a web document.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.330
A web browser knows how to correctly display it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.570
As we've said before, it's a default markup language of the web,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.895
so all web browsers know how to handle and display HTML document correctly.

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:50.660
The HTML applies the formatting needed to instruct the browser what to do.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.915
HTML was invented by a physicist called Tim Berners-Lee.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:02:00.460
The development took place around 1989-1990,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.540
where memos or proposals of HTML we're introduced.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.080
The idea behind HTML was to create a way for

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.035
researchers to send and receive documents to each other electronically.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:15.720
To understand why HTML was created,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.120
first, let's take a look at the problem.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.715
This is an image taken from the Wikipedia website.

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:27.585
But imagine this was a text documents which needed to be sent to individual departments.

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:29.395
When sending this text,

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:32.305
there is no way of describing the formatting.

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:36.790
The HTML header at the top is larger and also bold.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.520
There is a line beneath it and then some standard texts.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.890
Also the beginning of the paragraph is bold too and the text also

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.510
contains a series of links which you want to connect to other documents.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.745
This is a problem that researchers were facing.

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.895
To begin to solve this problem,

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:59.165
one of the first steps is the idea of marking up the text.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.220
When working with hand written manuscripts or documents,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.745
typographers or editors would often write

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.655
or mark up the text in the margins of the paper.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:14.710
This would include information such as the style and size of

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.175
the text for each section before being passed on for typesetting.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:25.660
The idea of this mark up has clearly influenced the way HTML is designed.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.190
Look in our text here before and a basic HTML equivalents on the left.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.860
From the top, we mark up the HTML heading by surrounding it in this h1 tags.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.740
We will look closer at all these times during the course.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.400
But this h1 describes the contents as being the most

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.045
important and also being displayed as the largest heading.

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:55.160
Now we have a way to describe what the texts will look like to the document reader,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.635
such as a web browser.

00:03:57.635 --> 00:03:59.495
The same for below,

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:05.300
we have a hr tag to describe where we want a horizontal rule to appear.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.910
This is a standalone tag and it does not need any text content to format,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.975
them below this standard paragraphs of text and included with the p tags.

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:24.285
We also have strong tags too to tell the browser that this text have strong importance,

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:27.085
and also to display in bold.

00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:31.430
Of course, there are lots more of these tags to cover but

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.165
this basic example should now give you a better understanding of how things work.

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:40.130
Also we want a way for these links in blue

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.420
here to be able to connect all links to other documents.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.680
This leads us on to hypertext.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.705
Hypertext is another one of those words which makes up HTML.

00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:58.835
This is basically the text on the screen which are references to other text or documents.

00:04:58.835 --> 00:05:03.620
Hypertext documents are linked by what we call hyperlinks.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.060
We see this in most webpages we visit every day.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.895
Often that is a top navigation with links or hyperlinks to other pages.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:19.055
These webpages often separate documents too like you see here.

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:23.030
So we now know that texts on a webpage is usually surrounded,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.010
all marked up with tags,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.380
just like we looked at a few slides ago,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.715
and also these p tags at the bottom.

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:36.025
These tags complete with the content in the middle is called an element.

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:40.445
Elements can be thought of as the building blocks of a webpage.

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:45.660
You will have plenty practice writing these elements during the course.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.780
The final thing we're going to look at in this video is attributes.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.245
Attributes are added to elements to provide some additional information.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:59.595
For example, we could set the text color,

00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:04.080
we could tell the browser which page to link to if it's clicked on,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.605
or as you can see in the example here,

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:09.790
we can set a unique ID for the elements.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.815
If this is all new to you and a lot to take in, don't worry it is here.

00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:17.780
While history and background is good to know,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.170
the main thing to grasp is how do these tags to create

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.210
elements and you'll get lots more practice as you progress throughout this course.
