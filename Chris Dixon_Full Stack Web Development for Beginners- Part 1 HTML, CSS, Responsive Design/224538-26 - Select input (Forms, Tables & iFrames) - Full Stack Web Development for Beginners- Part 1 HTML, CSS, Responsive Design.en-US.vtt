00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
The next type of input I want to show you, is the select box.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:09.150
This input basically allows a drop-down list and various options,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.160
which the user can select,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.545
and we can see this just here.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.655
If we scroll down to the Subject here, we can click on this.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.255
I'll be presented with various different ones.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.240
Now this is a slightly different type of select box,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.665
which we're going to look at now but we'll get on this type just soon.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.490
First of all, I'm just going to tidy things up a little bit inside of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.215
all form and separate our sections so they're more clear.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:44.835
Let's have our name section and add some space between each div,

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:50.355
now we can close off the checkbox too.

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:53.204
These all grouped together like this,

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:58.365
and then let's group together our e-mail and phone response section.

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:04.115
Now these are all groups, I'm going to add our select just below the message area.

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:06.350
This is our message area here,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.615
so let's make some space and also create our div section for this.

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:15.435
This time, use the select element rather than an input.

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.000
Add the select just like that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.190
The select, just like all the others.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.825
I'm going to give an ID,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:24.910
and we'll call this the subject.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.160
The select box is going to add a list of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.380
options which the user can select as their message subject,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.980
as well as the select,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.600
we can also add a label too.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.860
Because we have the ID attribute,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.225
we can also add the for attribute of subject,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:48.270
and then a text inside of subject too.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.090
Inside here, each item in the drop-down is wrapped in a option element,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.555
and this goes between the select tags.

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:04.015
Before we do that, let's just check this out in the browser.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:06.570
Says our label of Subject,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.455
and you can see we have the input here.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:14.105
If we click on it, we don't have any options to select from just yet,

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:18.300
so let's add these with our option elements.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.710
Let's add the first one in here,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.070
and inside here we can add our text which will appear inside the select box.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.540
The first one can be returns,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.035
let's see this in action,

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.640
says returns just there.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.665
We can also add a value too.

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:43.265
This value attribute will enable us to pass

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:46.910
a select value with the form when we submit it.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.430
The value of this one can be returns,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.105
and then let's just copy and paste this in a few more times.

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:59.670
This one can be faulty item,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.580
and a options value of faulty item,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.790
and I'm going to use an underscore just instead of having a space here.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.180
The next one for delivery info and the value of delivery.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.600
This one can be for order tracking.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.279
Next an option of advice.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.470
Then finally, we'll just add one more and this can be other.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.660
Give that save and let's go inside the browser.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.280
Reloads, and then click on our select.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.810
Here we're presented with a list of all the options which we added inside the Select.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.530
By default, we can only select one of these values at a time.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.660
As soon as we clicked on this,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.150
the Select is then collapsed.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.015
If we want to select more than one,

00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:23.865
we can add a multiple attribute to the opening select tag.

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:27.580
Just after the ID, we can add multiple,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.175
and then let's go over, reloads,

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:37.210
and we can press Command or Control to select more than one value.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.600
I'm going to remove this for now as we don't need this inside of our project.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.505
But it is useful to know it's there.

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:48.800
We can also group together any related options.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.440
Rather than having just one long list,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.415
we can use the optgroup element to group together certain related subjects.

00:04:57.415 --> 00:05:00.365
Returns and faulty item,

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:02.430
I'm going to group together.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.295
I'm going to cut both of these values out,

00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:14.895
and then use the optgroup element and then I can paste these back inside.

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.705
We need to then give this optgroup a label,

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:23.270
and this is the text which will appear on the screen above both

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.040
of these groups sections and you'll see this more clearly in just a moment.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.100
I'm going to add the text of product issues and save that.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.470
Let's see how this looks.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.950
If we expand, we see in the faint text at the top we have Product issues,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.765
which is the label we added,

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:46.880
and then slightly offset to the right,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.720
we have our two grouped items here.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.770
Next, we have delivery and tracking information.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.450
These can be grouped together into delivery.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.260
Let's cut these two options out and add our options group,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.245
and then paste these back in.

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:12.940
The text label for this one can be Delivery.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.530
Then down at the bottom, we can group advice and other into a Other group.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.895
One more optgroup, paste these last two in,

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.450
and then our label simply of Other.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.670
Now we have all the three separate options groups,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.185
they should now all be displayed in the browser.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:42.590
Reload, open this up,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.315
and we have now three different groups altogether.

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:50.430
Notice we can't also click on this label either of Delivery,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.395
Other, and Product Issues.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.740
This is just simply there for information.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.209
Now we have our select box in place.

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:03.665
We're now going to look at a more recent edition to html forms,

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.450
which is the data list,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.190
and we'll take a look at this next.
