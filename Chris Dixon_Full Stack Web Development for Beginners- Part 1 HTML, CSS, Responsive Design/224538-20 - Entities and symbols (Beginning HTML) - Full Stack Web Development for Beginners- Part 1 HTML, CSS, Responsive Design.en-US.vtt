00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
I want to show you a way to add some nice looking visual symbols to

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.485
our websites and how to display certain reserved characters using HTML entities.

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:14.020
Before we look at HTML entities,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.975
let's take a look at why they're needed by adding to one of the product descriptions.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.214
For example, if we go down to,

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:28.215
let's say the camera, and let's go to the description.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.240
In fact, we'll go down to the lenses down the very bottom.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.720
Inside the descriptions, if you wanted to extend this

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.815
and maybe add some additional information inside the brackets.

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:46.635
Let's say for Canon models less than 2017.

00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:49.880
You can immediately see that the text editor is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.090
changed the color of the less than symbol here,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.525
indicated there is a problem.

00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:58.729
This is because the greater and less than symbols,

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.809
a class has reserved characters in HTML.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.370
These particular ones are reserved because a browser might mistake

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.535
them for these HTML opening and closing tags, which we have here.

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:16.500
This can be replaced with a HTML entity.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.540
All HTML entities begin with a ampersands and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.955
end with the semicolon with a certain code in between.

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:27.135
It looks just like this.

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:29.150
If we remove the less than symbol,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.490
we can add the ampersand,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.695
which is this character here.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.424
Less than uses the LT,

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:39.145
and then a semicolon at the end.

00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:43.730
Now as you change from red to be the same color as the rest of the elements.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.085
This should all be working fine.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:51.860
Save that, reload and if we go down to the image,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.150
down to the bottom of the camera lenses and as our description.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.720
The Canon models less than 2017,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.680
so symbol is now displaying in the browser.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.250
Let's take a look at a couple more just for demonstration.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.190
Greater than, use the gt,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.075
refresh, you can see the angle brackets is now points to the right.

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.970
If you wanted to display this ampersand,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.545
which we have here,

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:26.490
this is AMP, which is show of ampersand,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.495
reload and there is symbol just that.

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:34.355
Another entity we could use is for the quotation.

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:38.825
Instead amp, we could use QUOT,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.865
which you show the quotation,

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.875
save and then reload.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.180
Now have the tuple quotation in place there.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.460
There are also many more entities which you can find with

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.820
a quick Google search if you more interested.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.230
Entities are also useful to display symbols which not on a standard keyboard.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.715
Let's take a look at some of these,

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.205
beginning with the copyright symbol.

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:07.430
The copyright symbol is simply copy.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.385
Makes you have the ampersand and the semicolon at the end too.

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:17.060
There is copyright symbol just there, lets scroll in.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.770
Just to see this a little better.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.720
Let's take a look at a registered trademark which is reg.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.975
Refresh, and now have the R in the circle and also small such as a currency.

00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:36.460
Let's take a look at yen.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.385
Save that one and reload.

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:45.960
Now have a yen symbol which is not on my keyboard.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.920
That's how we can use these and of course you can

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.530
Google this and find a lot more you can use.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.390
There is hundreds of different ones,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.220
so just search for any particular one which you may need to add.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.020
I'm just going to remove this extra section which we added in and say this,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.305
as well as find more of these online with a Google search.

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:11.795
There is a website with [inaudible] called unicode table.com.

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:14.900
If we had all of today, you will find a huge range of

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.930
symbols you can use in your project.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.960
There is the most popular ones at the top

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.180
or you can scroll through a huge set of icons below.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.915
Let's do a search using the search bar at the top.

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.240
Let's search for game.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.530
In fact, we search for video game and then click on search.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.180
Now we have a video game controller symbol.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.080
If we click on this, we see we have two different numbers,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.120
we have a unicode number and also HTML code.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.059
This HTML code starts with the ampersand,

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.875
just like we used before,

00:04:57.875 --> 00:04:59.935
and end in a semicolon.

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:02.205
We're going to use the HTML code,

00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:05.340
so let's copy this code we're given.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.465
Go back over to the project and then let's scroll up to the game controller products.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:13.425
Here is the title just here.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:19.775
Afterwards let's paste this in and over to our project and reload.

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:23.590
Scroll back up to the game controller and there we goes.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.200
There's a little image which is added in.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.700
It's underlined because it's still within the link.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:37.170
Let's cut this out and paste this outside of this ''a'' tag,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.355
so just like that and then reload.

00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:44.530
Now we don't see the underline for the link.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.445
Now we have a nice-looking controller icon next of

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:51.110
product title and as you can see by the unicode table,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.240
with literally hundreds and thousands of

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.200
different modes which we can use in our projects.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.540
I'm sure you'll find lots of good uses for these as you progress.
