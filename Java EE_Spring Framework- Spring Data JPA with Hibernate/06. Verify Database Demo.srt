00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's begin by opening up our Docker Desktop.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,820
And if you're running Docker natively,

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,740
you can just open up the admin app for that as well.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,140
But looking to see that your database is,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,240
in fact, running. And you can see that mine is running here on port 3306,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
and I just pulled up the log files. And sure enough,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,940
it is started up and is running.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,550
One common mistake I'll see from a lot of people is when they have

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,290
pulled a new version down from GitHub or they've restarted their

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,060
server for whatever reason, an update on their laptop or whatever,

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,100
it will stop their database,

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,860
and they can't figure out what's going on when they go to run their

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,880
database with that create script. So make sure it's running.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,610
It looks like ours is up and everything is ready to go from that end.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:53,000
Now let's switch over and look at the MySQL admin to see that those tables are currently there.
