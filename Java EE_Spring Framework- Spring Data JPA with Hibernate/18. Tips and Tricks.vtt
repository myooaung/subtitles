We're almost all the way set up in our app now to where we can

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.520
go ahead and start creating our entities.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.230
But I want to sneak in a couple of tips and tricks that have

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.750
helped me to learn Hibernate and JPA quicker.

5
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.160
First is to tune the logging level for Hibernate to debug.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.290
This will generate quite a bit of logs,

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.940
but it is really helpful to see what queries are being executed.

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.780
Next is to tell JPA to show the actual SQL and to format

9
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.000
that SQL Let's add this to our project, and then we're ready to start coding the business logic.
