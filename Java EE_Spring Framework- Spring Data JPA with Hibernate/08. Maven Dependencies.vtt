00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.560
We've actually already added this dependency to our project,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.860
but I want to point out that this is all you had to

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.040
do to begin using Spring Data JPA.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.050
We have the spring‑data‑jpa‑boot‑starter jar added to our project,

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.300
and it's just added through Maven.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.690
The other nice thing is that any incompatible transitive

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.990
dependencies are already excluded by using their version.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.420
So if we add this dependency to our project using their dependency management,

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
it's handled any of the inconsistencies or problems that we

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.540
wouldn't want to import into our project.

11
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.000
Everything is set up, and we're ready to go from the downloading or inclusion of library aspect.
