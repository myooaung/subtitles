00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's open up our RegistrationRepository.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:11.740
We'll start off by extending the JpaRepository interface,

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.370
and that's going to use the registration object that it

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.960
represents, and its id is Long as well.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.810
And we'll save this functionality.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.760
We can already get rid of this save method because we already have

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.200
that through inheritance on the JpaRepository interface. And we

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.040
actually have the findAll method as well.

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.120
What we don't have is this findAllReports. Let's convert

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.000
this over to using that named query that we created now and replicate that functionality.
