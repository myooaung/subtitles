00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.580
In the Spring MVC course,

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.400
I spoke a lot about Spring and how it tied into the MVC framework and

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.040
how Spring MVC is a model‑view‑controller framework, but it really is

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.470
just dealing with the UI. We didn't tie a database into our

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.140
application or anything like that.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.640
The next couple of slides I actually took from the Spring MVC course,

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.650
but I'm going to talk about them in a different light.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.770
As I mentioned in the Spring MVC course,

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.990
that software architecture has been around a long time,

10
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.140
long since before Spring and Java were around.

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.360
Architecture and design patterns give us a way to communicate

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.310
what we're trying to do and to also implement some of the best

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.460
practices so that we don't keep recreating the same errors or

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.440
making the same mistakes.

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.020
For us,

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.000
having a framework like Spring is all about repurposing these best practices and not having to reinvent the wheel each time.
