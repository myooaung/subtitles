00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.850
The first time you pull up your project,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.070
there are a couple of things that are already defaulted for you,

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.750
one of which you don't want to use,

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.340
and that is the deployment configuration that already exists from Spring Boot.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.540
If we go over to our Configuration drop‑down,

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.470
you'll see that we have an Edit Configurations option

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.340
or a ConferenceApplication option.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.040
The configuration that's already created for us is a Spring Boot instance,

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
and it uses tc Server, which is a modified Tomcat instance.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.930
I'm going to be honest with you,

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.300
you don't want to use this because it breaks a lot of things.

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.940
It's meant to work with some of their tools.

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.310
I have found it to be more problematic than just

14
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.090
creating a Tomcat instance here,

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.740
so I'm going to actually not use that and add a Tomcat Server,

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.870
and we want to create a local instance,

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.310
and I already have Tomcat downloaded on my laptop.

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.130
If you have not downloaded one,

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.530
you need to select one or configure one from this dialog.

20
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.390
And so you can go through here, hit Configure,

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.320
point it to a downloaded instance, choose whichever version you downloaded.

22
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.530
I am using 9.0.30.

23
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.280
I would keep it within the same major release as me

24
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.230
just to guarantee that it works.

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.690
They do have some experimental versions,

26
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.920
some alpha versions that are out there that are later than this,

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.900
but 9.0 is working fine with all the examples that we have for this course,

28
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.220
and it's what I will continue to use.

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.840
Now, before we change anything else,

30
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.340
I want to point out that there is a warning on the bottom of our page

31
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.840
already saying that no artifacts are marked for deployment.

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.430
You can click that Fix link or you can go up to the Deployment tab and click

33
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.640
the plus button and say that we want to do an artifact.

34
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.260
We have two options inside of here,

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.140
we have the conference:war and the conference:war exploded.

36
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.840
I'm going to just choose conference:war.

37
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.080
And the application context that it is at the bottom of this is

38
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.050
the URL to our application for development.

39
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.290
So if you don't want it to say conference_war, you need to change this now.

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.740
You can back it off to just /conference.

41
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.540
I'm going to go ahead and do that and click Apply and then OK,

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.680
and now our configuration is ready to launch.

43
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.440
So if I go ahead and click on that and hit the Play button,

44
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.640
it will take it a second to load the first time,

45
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.340
but you'll see our application deploys, fires up Spring,

46
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.880
and then it will bring up our browser for us.

47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.570
Our app's default configuration is to pull up the index or greeting page,

48
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.580
and so here we are at the root of our application,

49
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.710
and if we click Add Registration,

50
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.340
it's going to pull up the registration page and we can put in

51
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.460
whatever we want and hit Add Registration,

52
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.640
and it just cycles back to this page.

53
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.510
It's not storing anything, there's nothing else happening,

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.320
and if we back up to the Add User, the same thing happens here as well.

55
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.610
It's going to pull down some default information because we're

56
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.850
not pulling anything from that database yet.

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.650
So, let's go ahead and start implementing that now.

58
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.440
To point out some key files though before we dive right into the code,

59
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.340
first of all, this application was all configured using Java configuration,

60
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.560
so it's launched through the @SpringBootApplication annotation and a

61
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.240
main method inside of our ConferenceApplication class.

62
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.840
The AppConfig is all set up inside of here and uses this

63
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.010
ConferenceConfig file to wire together our application.

64
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.880
This is where we're going to be making almost all of the changes inside

65
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.940
of our application for adding in Hibernate and JPA.

66
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.660
It's all annotation‑driven.

67
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.430
If we open up any of our controllers, you'll see that we have the @Controller,

68
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.950
we have our model stuff wired up the same way,

69
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.480
there's all of our registration and user inside of here,

70
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.610
and we're going to add and flesh out the details of our service tier

71
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.170
and our repository tier doing this same fashion.

72
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.500
So we'll implement on top of these two model classes we

73
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.540
have here and tie into this controller.

74
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.130
And, one last thing to mention is the application.properties.

75
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.990
This is where we will go through and wire in our database

76
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.380
configuration to go ahead and connect to that database.

77
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.370
So, really, those key files there,

78
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.000
that's what the bulk of our configuration for our Spring MVC app connecting to a database will take place.
