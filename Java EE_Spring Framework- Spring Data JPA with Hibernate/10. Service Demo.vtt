00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.850
To create our service tier,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.690
I'm going to start off by minimizing and making sure my server is shut

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.210
down and then right‑click on our src, main, java,

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:18.640
com.pluralsight.conference package and say New, Java Class. And inside of

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:28.740
here, I'm going to give it the name service.UserServiceImpl.

6
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.440
And inside of here, we can create our method.

7
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.240
Do public User save and pass in User.

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.010
Let's choose the com.pluralsight.conference.model.User. And for now,

9
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
we'll return null.

10
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.040
We'll save that. Now if we right‑click and say Refactor and Extract Interface,

11
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.070
we can create the user service interface, and it will be in the

12
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
package com.pluralsight.conference.service.

13
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.890
And let's have that also include the save method in our interface. Hit

14
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.240
Refactor. It'll ask us if we want to make sure that that is, in fact, included

15
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.310
and replace any concrete uses of that with the interface,

16
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.540
which we are good.

17
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.440
We also want to annotate this as a service,

18
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.580
and it's the org.springframework.stereotype service annotation.

19
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.840
We'll save that. Now opening up our controller,

20
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.390
we go over to our UserController. And inside of here, we can

21
00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:08.580
now auto wire the UserService inside of here. And in our

22
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.640
postUser method that we have down below,

23
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.660
we can actually call our userService.save and pass in that user.

24
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.020
We have now wired up our service tier to take our object that's

25
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.420
coming from our post and call our save method that's auto wired

26
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.000
in to our ServiceImpl. We're not done yet though. We still need to do the repository on the back end.
