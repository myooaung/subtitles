The only difference to do XML constructor injection is we've now

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,040
moved from a property to a constructorâ€‘arg element.

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,170
It takes an index which specifies the position of the object we're trying to

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:26,000
inject. Again, mostly showing this for historical purposes, you likely wouldn't be using XML configuration in a new project.
