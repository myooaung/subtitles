Auto wiring constructors is very similar to auto wiring setters.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,150
Instead of the XML configuration, just like setters,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,710
we have our customerRepository bean that we have configured, and note that

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,520
the code is truncated for that definition and now we just use the @Autowired

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,360
annotation to a constructor that takes the argument passed in instead of a

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:30,000
setter. It really is almost identical as just moving the @Autowired annotation up to that constructor.
