00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,780
So I mentioned it in the previous slide, but to get Docker,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,100
you literally just go to docker.com,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,790
choose Products, and select Docker Desktop. From here,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,790
it'll bring you to a page where you can choose to download for

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,190
the specific operating system that you're on.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,790
I am on a Mac, so I'll download the one for Mac,

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,970
which I've actually already done, and just run through the install on it.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,740
Nothing special there.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,810
I do create an account and sign into that account on Docker just because it'll

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,080
allow me to store and select images and do some other things.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,640
Really nothing promotional that comes out of it.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,000
But that's all you've got to do to get Docker installed on your machine so that we can start using the containers that we want to.
