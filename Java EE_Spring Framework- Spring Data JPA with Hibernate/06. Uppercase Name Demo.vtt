00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.780
To force that uppercase name,

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.910
we can just go ahead and add the

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.580
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physicalâ€‘strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.740
in our application.properties.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.520
And once we save this, inside of our user object,

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.240
we can come in here and say conf_users,

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.740
and this will force that to an uppercase naming convention.

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.440
Let's restart our server and switch over to our MySQL Workbench.

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.120
Refreshing our schema, we can see that our tables are now named

10
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.640
how we thought they would be, conf_users,

11
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.470
and it has updated everything.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.340
And since it was named the same as the lowercase version,

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.800
it did update that to uppercase because it could

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.340
alter that table that it was tied to.

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.840
As we mentioned before, when we were switching complete table names,

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
it didn't know how to bind that other one anymore,

17
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.000
and so it just left it there, where this one will update it to the correct naming conventions.
