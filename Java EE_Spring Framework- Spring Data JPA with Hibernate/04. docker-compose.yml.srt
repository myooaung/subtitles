1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,940
All you need to do to run Docker is to have the Docker Desktop app installed.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,470
And for that, you just go to docker.com and download the

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,940
version specific to your operating system.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,840
From there, we're going to add this dockerâ€‘compose file to our application,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
and it will set up everything.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,170
In this case, we're going to have a database,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,640
and you can tell that by the db: that sets up the container for this.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:36,140
Its image type is of mysql:5.7, and the container name is conference.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,440
Next,

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,160
we're going to bind the ports that are exposed on our operating

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,610
system to this port inside of the container,

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,040
which is 3306.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,560
From there, we'll tell it where it's going to store the data,

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,130
which is underneath our project in a .data directory /db

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,340
and then for our environment as well.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,120
We're going to say that the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is pass, and

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,990
the database name is conference. And we have all of our stuff

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,500
set up and configured right here.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,760
So this will download that instance for us,

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,520
store it,

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:19,000
bind the ports, and set up the username and password and database name for us. Let's add this to our application now, and we can start up our Docker instance.
