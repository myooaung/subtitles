00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,300
Continuing on our timeline of current versions that we're going to be using,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:11,940
we had looked earlier at JPA, and JPA 2.2 was released in 2017.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,650
I'll honestly admit that releases for JPA versions have slowed down a lot,

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,130
and some of that has to do with us tackling a lot of the

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,940
problems that we see inside of ORM tools.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,010
Hibernate 5.4 was released in 2018,

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,040
and we will be using a new version of this release, just a minor dot revision.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,220
And finally,

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,690
Spring 5.3 was released and has all of the current integrations baked into it.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:48,000
So this is a pretty good snapshot of the current stack that we will be using with possibly some minor dot revisions in there as well.
