1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,120
So we're just about finished with our JPA context,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,770
and the last thing we need to add is the data source to it so that we

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,540
can fix that yellow squiggly we had on our EntityManagerFactory as

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,030
far as injecting that resource into it.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,090
We're going to configure just a straightâ€‘up data source.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,060
No connection pooling, nothing, no JNDI lookups right now

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,350
just so we don't have any more moving pieces to try and

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,070
keep this as simple as possible.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,830
I would change this before I went to production so that I didn't have a

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,760
hardcoded username and password stored in my file.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,840
And we're probably going to show that as a bonus

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,700
module at the end of this course.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,310
It doesn't do anything for showing you how to use JPA specifically,

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,140
but just how to better develop software using Spring.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,540
So for our data source,

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,090
we're going to use a DriverManagerDataSource that

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,260
comes out of the spring.jdbc.jar.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,600
For our class name,

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,720
we're going to use com.mysql.jdbc.Driver, and that comes out of the My

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,470
SQL jar that we loaded through Maven. Our URL is

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,040
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306. Those are just all the defaults.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,870
And if you remember,

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,960
we created our schema and named it Fitness Tracker. And then our

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,440
username and password is just root and password.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,670
Those are the defaults we set up.

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,840
If you chose something different,

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:34,000
obviously you'll want to substitute those in for the ones I've created here. Now we'll go ahead and set that up and get the rest of our application tied in.
