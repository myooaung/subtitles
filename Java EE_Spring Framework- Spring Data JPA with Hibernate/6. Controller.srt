1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,960
Controllers, as we've mentioned,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,240
handle our incoming request and building the response.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,660
I can't emphasize strongly enough that business logic

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,940
should not be handled in the controller.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,090
This is also where our request and our response object should stop as well.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,290
We shouldn't hand those off to separate tiers.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,170
It should grab information from the request and the response

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,640
and hand it over to the business logic.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,670
This works with our service and repository tier for

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,740
business logic and data gathering,

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,440
and it's also annotated with the @Controller annotation.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,500
There are some convenience classes that you can extend,

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,620
but you either have to wire them up or annotate them with controllers

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,440
still. It should also be noted that this also handles exceptions and

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,000
routes views accordingly based off of whether or not we had an exception or we've gotten the correct information.
