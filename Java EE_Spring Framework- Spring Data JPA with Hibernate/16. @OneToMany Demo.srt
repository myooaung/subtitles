00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,230
I've closed out all of the open tabs that I had just so we can

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,240
focus on doing this one‑to‑many mapping.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,940
Let's begin by right‑clicking on model and creating a new Java class,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,470
and its name is going to be Course.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,790
We're going to annotate this just like we did our registration.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:25,840
We're going to give it the @Entity annotation, @Table.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,400
We'll name this COURSE, all uppercase.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:46,540
Inside of our class, we'll also give it an @Id and @GeneratedValue.

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,540
We'll have a member variable private Long id.

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,810
And then let's give it a couple of other fields just to make it more meaningful.

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:07,690
We'll have inside of here an @Column, and we'll name this name,

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,740
which will just be the name of the course,

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,430
and it will be a private String name.

14
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:30,440
And then another column, and we'll name this one DESCRIPTION.

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,440
And this is a bug I often see people introduce into their code base.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,830
They will name this field DESC,

17
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,520
which in some database queries stands for descending.

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,330
So if you're going to sort the results on something,

19
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,590
you might sort it descending.

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:56,940
Then we'll make this a string as well.

21
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,030
And since we're already in this class,

22
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,710
we'll add the many‑to‑one mapping back to our registration list here.

23
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,690
This will make more sense in a minute,

24
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,640
but to save us from switching back and forth,

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,840
we'll do it while we're here.

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,060
We'll say private Registration registration.

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,040
We'll save that.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,430
Give ourselves some white space at the bottom and Generate, Getters and Setters.

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,540
Select all the fields.

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,890
Click OK and save that.

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,990
Now we have our basic course object filled out here,

32
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,440
and we did half of our one‑to‑many join.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
We did our many‑to‑one, which is our join back to our object.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Let's go back to our Registration object now. And inside of here, below

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:03:00,640
name, but above our getter for the ID, let's add an OneToMany annotation,

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:12,790
and it is mapped by registration. And we're going to set cascade using the

37
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:28,800
enum CascadeType.ALL. And then this is on a private List of Courses. So

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
we'll pass in the object Course,

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,050
and we'll name it Courses. And this is equal to a

40
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,440
new ArrayList, and we'll save it.

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,040
And let's go below our get id and right‑click and say Generate, Getter and

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,690
Setter. We'll choose Courses. Hit OK. And we've actually specified our

43
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,440
one‑to‑many join and the many‑to‑one back to it.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,640
One key thing to point out here is that the mappedBy = registration,

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,090
that string should tie to the name of the member variable on the course object.

46
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,640
So you'll see we have registration over here.

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,760
We have registration here. So that's saying that on the courses, our course

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,190
object has a field named registration that we have getters and setters for. Tie

49
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:40,000
that to that object, and that's how we keep that list, that one‑to‑many mapping in check.
