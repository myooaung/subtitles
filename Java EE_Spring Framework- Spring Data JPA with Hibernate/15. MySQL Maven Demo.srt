00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,260
Inside of our IDE,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,990
let's go below the spring‑boot‑starter‑data‑jpa dependency that we

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,040
just added and add another dependency inside of here.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,460
The groupId is going to be mysql, and the artifactId is the

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,420
mysql‑connector‑java. Again, no version because it's going to inherit

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,600
that from the Spring Boot parent starter jar,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,850
even though this is on MySQL jar, because it's using dependency management.

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,130
So when we save this,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,440
it'll automatically download the correct version of that library

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,920
for the package that we have inside of our app.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,000
And now we have all of those dependencies inside of here and can begin configuring our data source and the other resources.
