00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.440
Let's dive right into annotating an entity.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.150
The @Entity annotation is the simplest tagging to mark

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.640
something as being tied to a database.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.760
For now, we're going to just accept the defaults,

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.340
but we will improve upon them later.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.660
It can't stand alone though. With just this tagging, we also need to add

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.740
the @Id annotation to signify which field is the primary key and also

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.000
which type it is by using the @GeneratedValue. Let's switch over to our IDE and add these fields to our user object now.
