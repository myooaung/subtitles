1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,940
Let's update our UserRepository to now be a JpaRepository.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,430
To do so,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,990
we just open up the interface and say that it extends JpaRepository, and

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:22,110
it's used to service the User class, and its id is a Long. From here, we

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,260
can actually delete this method because it's going to inherit methods

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,340
from the JpaRepository interface.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,850
The other thing that we can do is go in our

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:37,940
UserRepositoryImpl, rightâ€‘click, and delete it.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,840
Click OK.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,800
And our application already knows that this is a JpaRepository

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,880
because we have extended that interface.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,520
But I am going to give it the annotation of @Repository up here, and this

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,070
is how you also would override the name if you want to give it some other

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,090
registered bean name. This will work for us.

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,570
We can save this. If you open up your UserServiceImpl, you can see that we don't

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,340
have any compile errors because that method save is already implemented for us

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,840
in the JpaRepository interface that we extended.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,390
That's it.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,080
We have no other functionality here.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:25,000
We will add functionality to one once to show you how to customize this. But the default CRUD implementations are already here for us.
