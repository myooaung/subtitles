00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's take a second to walk through the steps of

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,740
downloading our scaffold application.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,210
First,

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,310
you can download the app and slides right here on the course

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,740
web page under the Exercise files heading.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,340
It's definitely a good option.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,750
I have also hosted the application up on GitHub just to make it

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,810
so that I can update the files that are in there and that you

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,840
can get the most recent version.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,680
Don't worry though if you've never used Git or GitHub,

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,680
you actually don't need to have Git installed for this class, and you don't

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:38,000
really need to have any prior working knowledge of Git either. We'll do a demo now of how to get that and get our environment set up.
