Another update requested of this reâ€‘release was how to specify naming to

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,810
force uppercase. It's not an uncommon practice to have table names inside

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,480
your database all uppercase. And in Hibernate, we can use the physical

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,140
naming strategy standard implementation,

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,710
and this just goes in our application.properties,

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:29,000
and it will force uppercase in our table and column names. Let's add that to our application now and drop and recreate our database.
