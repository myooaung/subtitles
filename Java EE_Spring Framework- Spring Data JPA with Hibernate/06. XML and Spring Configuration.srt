00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,680
The focus of this course has since been moved to complete Java

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,120
configuration, but to show the XML equivalent,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,280
this is what it would look like.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,140
You may maintain existing applications that still have XML in there,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,800
and the XML configuration actually still works just fine, so I wanted to

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,040
show you the two so you could compare and contrast them.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,410
We have a bean for the customerRepository, we have a bean

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,830
for the customerService, and the property for wiring the

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,730
repository into the service.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,980
That's where our setter injection is occurring.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,000
We created that bean and then injected it through that property into our service instance.
