00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.690
Now that we've briefly chatted about some of the neat functionality that we get

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.150
out of Spring Data JPA, let's actually see it do something.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.190
The first thing we're going to do is delete our

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.840
implementation class for the UserRepository.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.640
The implementation class is only required if we need to

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.400
override functionality. Our interface actually becomes our

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.140
fully functional user interface.

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.690
We're going to change our interface to extend the JPA interface.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.140
And then it just needs to know the class it services and its ID type.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.940
This is what our UserRepository interface becomes now, nothing more.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.000
It extends JpaRepository, the class that it's representing as User, and the ID type as Long.
