00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,670
The previous release of this course required us to

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,590
import five different jars into it.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,540
Since we're now using Spring Boot,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,440
we can just include the spring‑boot‑starter‑data‑jpa jar that's listed here.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,220
A couple of things to note though, we don't have a version on this code.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,430
So if you've used Maven before or it's maybe not so

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,590
common for you to recognize it, there is not a version element inside of here.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,340
And that's because we inherited from the parent version inside of our pom.xml.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,700
Secondly, the Hibernate jars, you'll notice, aren't being imported here anymore.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,300
So we just have the data‑jpa starter jar.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,100
Well,

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,360
it pulls all of the other libraries we need in through transitive dependencies.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,780
If that's foreign to you, don't worry about it.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,410
But if you want to dig deeper,

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,590
I suggest going and watching my Maven Fundamentals course here, on

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,240
Pluralsight, and it will explain that greater detail to you.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's add the spring‑boot‑starter‑data‑jpa dependency to our pom.xml inside of our application now.
