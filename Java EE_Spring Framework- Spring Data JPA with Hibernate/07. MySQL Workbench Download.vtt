00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.110
I didn't include a video of me installing the MySQL Workbench

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.530
because there's a lot of tools out there that you can use. If

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.430
you don't want to use MySQL Workbench,

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.110
you could use MySQL Admin or SQuirreL or some of the

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.540
other database administration tools.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720
I don't mind the MySQL Workbench,

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.880
so I just went ahead and went to the mysql.com/products/workbench URL and

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.000
click the Download Now link and installed that app, and that's what I'll be using for the next demo.
