00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.580
Switching back over to our IDE, without changing anything else because

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.280
we have our properties set in our application.properties, and our

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.200
user.java has now been annotated, we can click the Play button or the

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.240
Run button next to our Tomcat configuration for our conference WAR.

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.260
And this will go through and actually create those tables in our

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.960
database for us.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.690
If you watch these log files down below,

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.430
I'm going to leave this window open more so you can see it,

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.790
it'll go through and evaluate the database schema and see

10
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.500
that it has not created those yet.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
So all of those logging statements that we put in

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.420
application.properties and show sql, all of that stuff. You'll

13
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.000
notice it says in here drop table if it exists,

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.040
drop this other table if it exists, so it creates a sequence and the user table.

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.040
Create those values inside of there. Establish any foreign

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.340
and primary key constraints that it needs to. And it's

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.180
creating those with the engine=InnoDB, which is the transactional engine.

18
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.240
You can do a nonâ€‘transactional engine for MySQL that's used for reporting.

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.520
So you really want to make sure that does say InnoDB, which we

20
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.750
specified that in our application.properties.

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.880
But that is a common mistake I see people make. Switch

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.040
back over to our MySQL Workbench.

23
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.040
And if we come inside of our schema and refresh it,

24
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.440
you'll notice that we now have our user table inside of here and

25
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.000
our columns inside of that table, our id, age, firstname, and lastname.
