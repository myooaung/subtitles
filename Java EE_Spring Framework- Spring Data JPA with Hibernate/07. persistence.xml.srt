00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,820
Inside of our terminal, you can see that I am at the root of our project.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,840
I just did a print working directory for us there.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,760
And from here, we can actually execute that docker‑compose file.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,440
So we'll say docker‑compose.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,360
You leave off the .yml because we're actually invoking the

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,550
application here and say up ‑d. And this will go through and create

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,220
that instance and start it for the first time.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,030
So it's actually up and running now,

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,000
and we can verify that by switching over to our Docker Desktop instance to see which containers are running.
