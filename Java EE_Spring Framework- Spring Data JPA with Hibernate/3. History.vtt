00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.180
We're going to take a minute and just walk through a

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.640
little bit of the history of Spring.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.400
Spring actually started out as a bunch of developers that were

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.530
consulting and were tired of some of the shortcomings or

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.740
painful pieces of developing with JEE.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.210
So this group of people got together and put together the Spring Framework,

7
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.110
which actually used to be called Interface 21 and decided

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.680
they wanted to roll this out as an enterprise framework

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.040
available for the public to use.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.100
Their first milestone release was in 2003.

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.040
Now, not really a big deal, but it's when things kind of got rolling for them.

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.350
Now, in 2004, they had their 1.0 release,

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.630
and one of the things you're going to see as we step through the

14
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.710
years is that Spring had a pretty consistent,

15
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.950
very stable release cycle.

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.360
As part of their release cycle,

17
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.730
they've always tried to keep it backwards and forwards compatible.

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.510
In fact, all of the applications that I've ever written since 2003,

19
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.040
I don't know of one thing that I've had break from backwards compatibility.

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.160
I have actually also integrated some key dates in here with Hibernate in

21
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.780
our timeline and notably started with Hibernate 3.0,

22
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.940
which was released in 2005.

23
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.620
Where it starts getting interesting though is in 2009 when JPA 2.0 was

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.840
released and then again in 2013 when JPA 2.1 was released.

25
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.330
All this time, Spring 2.0 and 3.0 were subsequently released in that timeline.

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.550
Hibernate 4.3 was released in 2013,

27
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.870
as well as to support the new features of JPA 2.1, and then

28
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.100
Spring 4.0 and 5.0 were both released after that,

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.000
integrating newer JVMs and continued longâ€‘term support. Let's talk more about JPA though, since that really is the focus of this course.
