00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.900
This was a short module, but it was intended to be.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.790
I wanted to show you how easy it was to create an entity and

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.820
have that generate your database table.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.270
We also wired up the schemas so that when we started up our app,

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.310
it created our schema for us.

6
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.710
And then we downloaded a workbench or admin tool to verify

7
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.560
what was going on inside of our database and that it did, in

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.940
fact, create those tables for us.

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.530
Now I will point out all of the stuff we did was just utilizing the defaults.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.210
In fact, you may have not caught it,

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.300
but it created a Hibernate sequence table inside of there,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
which is kind of an odd default that Hibernate does for any

13
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.170
primary key values inside of our application. We're going

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.710
to look in the next module,

15
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.440
and it's a big module, of how we dive in and override all of those defaults.

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560
And we're actually going to go through and use almost

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.090
every annotation inside of JPA to show you its

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.110
functionality in one fashion or another.

19
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:07.000
So this is really the core of what we're going to cover in the entire app, and it is a very big module.
