00:05.190 --> 00:12.420
So far all the elements we've added have directly affected how text is interpreted by the browser headings

00:12.930 --> 00:17.750
paragraphs lists links and so on.

00:18.090 --> 00:24.720
But there are more astm out elements that we need to add to semantically mark-up our page properly.

00:26.770 --> 00:33.790
Websites commonly have a header that contains common information shown on every page in a website like

00:33.790 --> 00:43.000
the title our logo navigation links which usually remain consistent across different pages.

00:43.060 --> 00:51.160
The main content of the page which could include various different articles subheadings and so on related

00:51.160 --> 00:59.380
content which could be related articles Arthur information or even advertised months and a footer which

00:59.380 --> 01:06.820
generally contains copyright information and secondary navigation links we generally use font size and

01:06.820 --> 01:11.490
colour to divide up and draw attention to different parts of the page.

01:11.500 --> 01:18.640
However this is just far sighted use as a visually impaired user for example might not find a larger

01:18.640 --> 01:22.790
font very useful for knowing that a section is a heading.

01:23.040 --> 01:31.940
Are that a section is only related content and not the main content of the page and so on.

01:32.650 --> 01:38.530
Each team provides us with elements that we can use to mark up the sections of the page based on their

01:38.530 --> 01:39.760
function.

01:40.420 --> 01:46.900
The header element for the common information at the top of a page like a logo are the main title.

01:47.350 --> 01:55.490
This element can also be used at the top of a section element which will see in a moment the nav element

01:55.510 --> 01:59.620
for the navigation bar which is usually just a series of links.

02:00.340 --> 02:07.990
The main element which represents the main content of a document the article element which represents

02:08.050 --> 02:13.940
a standalone piece of content that would make sense if taken out of the context of the page.

02:14.020 --> 02:18.370
For example a news article are a blog post.

02:19.240 --> 02:25.600
The section element which is similar to the article element but represents a standalone section that

02:25.600 --> 02:33.970
doesn't otherwise have a more semantic elements like article forit the a side element which is for content

02:34.000 --> 02:42.220
that is related to the main content often shown in a sidebar and the footer element which typically

02:42.220 --> 02:47.050
contains information about an Arthur R copyright information.

02:50.340 --> 02:57.840
Let's add these elements to this h.t. AML to give it some semantic structure the H one heading here

02:57.900 --> 02:59.660
is the main title of the site.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.670
That would appear on every page.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.570
So this belongs in a header element.

03:06.570 --> 03:10.210
This is followed by the main navigation links of the site.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.710
So these belong in a nav element.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.280
Following this we have the main content of the page.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.670
Which will go inside the main element

03:25.130 --> 03:26.700
inside the main element.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.290
We have the content foreign article so this goes in an article element.

03:34.540 --> 03:41.850
This secondary content and advertise meant and some related links go in an aside element.

03:44.030 --> 03:52.200
And finally at the end we have some copyright information which would go in a footer element like that.

03:56.290 --> 04:02.230
These elements don't affect how a visual browser like this dispose the content but they are taken into

04:02.230 --> 04:09.430
account for screen readers and other software for visually impaired visitors and they also help search

04:09.430 --> 04:12.370
engines to index your content.

04:13.450 --> 04:20.680
So although they aren't required it's generally good practice to include these semantic sectioning elements

04:20.890 --> 04:22.320
if you can.

04:24.980 --> 04:32.780
There are two more elements I want to mention in this video and they are the div and span elements wrapping

04:32.780 --> 04:39.040
content in a div are a span doesn't represent anything semantically but they do allow you to mark-up

04:39.080 --> 04:46.220
content for styling purposes are for use with javascript which will look at later on.

04:46.220 --> 04:51.850
The only difference between div and span is that a div element is shown on a new line in the browser

04:52.700 --> 04:58.680
whereas a span element is shown in line with the rest of the surrounding content.

04:58.730 --> 05:02.200
We'll see why you might want to use these elements later on.
