We just saw the first example of what's known as a controlled structure in HP the far each loop in this

00:13.390 --> 00:16.410
section will learn about other control structures.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.210
HP provides.

00:20.730 --> 00:28.550
AP HP script is made up of a series of instructions are statements and instruction can be assigning

00:28.560 --> 00:37.170
of value to a variable like this a function call like this on a loop like this.

00:37.530 --> 00:41.610
Instructions usually end with a semicolon.

00:41.610 --> 00:48.060
We also saw that we can group statements into a block like we did in the Far East loop by enclosing

00:48.060 --> 00:56.340
them in curly braces like this when iph prescript is executed these instructions are executed in ardour

00:56.820 --> 00:58.770
one at a time.

01:02.870 --> 01:11.390
However you might not always want this by using the if control structure we can perform different actions

01:11.600 --> 01:13.890
based on different conditions.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.060
We use it like this.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.820
First we put it off.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.890
Then the condition in brackets.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.420
Then the cold we want to run.

01:26.430 --> 01:34.940
If the condition is true contained inside curly braces the condition is a boolean value.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.390
True are false.

01:36.570 --> 01:43.040
If it's true the cold inside of the block is executed if it's false it isn't.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.940
Let's look at an example.

01:48.410 --> 01:59.680
We'll add an if statement and a block of cold inside the codebook will just echo out a message.

02:00.050 --> 02:07.830
If we take a look at this in the browser we see the message printed out.

02:08.210 --> 02:17.990
Now if we change the condition to false and then go back to the browser we don't see the message.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.400
This is because the condition is false so the code block isn't entered into.

02:25.420 --> 02:28.460
And this line of code isn't executed.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.680
In practice you'd never have a literal boolean value here.

02:35.840 --> 02:41.300
You'd have a variable are the result of a comparison which we'll see next.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.870
So let's change this to a more useful example.

02:44.930 --> 02:52.550
First let's add an array with no elements in it which you can do like that.

02:54.490 --> 03:01.640
The empty function will return a bewley in value depending on whether a variable is empty or not.

03:04.250 --> 03:09.260
Let's just dump this out so you can see like that.

03:09.500 --> 03:14.060
And in the browser we get the boolean value true

03:16.610 --> 03:19.310
because the array is empty.

03:19.310 --> 03:22.910
So this function has returned true.

03:22.910 --> 03:33.140
Let's change our IF condition to use this along with the message like that.

03:33.140 --> 03:40.250
Now if we run this code we get the message saying the array is empty.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.270
So the empty function here returned true.

03:45.650 --> 03:49.220
So the cold inside this block was executed.

03:49.580 --> 03:58.940
If we add some elements to the array and then run the code again the empty function has returned false

03:59.330 --> 04:02.150
and therefore the message isn't shown.

04:04.770 --> 04:10.570
We can also execute some code if the condition is false by using else.

04:13.020 --> 04:17.160
Else extends an IF statement to run some code.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.980
If the condition is FALSE.

04:22.920 --> 04:28.360
Let's add else to our IF statement along with a message to print out.

04:28.380 --> 04:35.290
If the condition is FALSE let's also empty the array.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.110
And now if we look at this in a browser.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.530
First we see the message that the array is empty.

04:47.410 --> 04:56.080
And then if we add some elements back in the array and then look at this in the browser we get the message

04:56.080 --> 04:58.800
coming from the ELSE code block.

05:01.540 --> 05:07.930
One more thing I need to mention about if statements if you only have one statement in a cold block

05:09.670 --> 05:12.200
you can omit the curly braces.

05:12.490 --> 05:18.820
However this is generally bad practice as if later you want to have more than one statement and you

05:18.820 --> 05:21.340
forget to add the curly braces.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.210
You can end up with unexpected results.

05:24.250 --> 05:28.690
It's best practice to always include the curly braces like this.
