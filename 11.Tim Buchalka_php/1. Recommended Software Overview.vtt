00:05.350 --> 00:12.220
In order to develop cold locally on your computer you'll need to install a web server which needs to

00:12.220 --> 00:13.140
support P. H.

00:13.150 --> 00:16.580
P. So you can run code on the server.

00:16.910 --> 00:24.700
A database server so you can store and retrieve data and ideally you should have the p HP mapping admin

00:24.700 --> 00:28.570
program installed which makes it much easier to administer.

00:28.570 --> 00:35.270
The database will learn more about each one of these as we progress throughout the course.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.090
Whatever your operating system.

00:40.090 --> 00:46.660
There are many software packages available that will install and configure all of these for you at once.

00:46.690 --> 00:51.330
One of the most popular is X amp samp.

00:51.400 --> 01:00.630
This gives you the Apache Web server with P HP the Maria dbe database server and also pay HP my admen.

01:00.670 --> 01:06.320
This is the one I recommend and the one we're going to install as a side to him being the most popular.

01:06.430 --> 01:13.200
It's free open source works on all platforms and it's very easy to install.

01:16.940 --> 01:21.520
Also when writing code you're going to need a code editor.

01:21.890 --> 01:31.850
Most operating systems have an editor included for example notepad on Windows text edit on OS X G edit

01:31.900 --> 01:33.850
and lennix and so on.

01:33.890 --> 01:39.870
You could use these but they generally don't have many features to help you code.

01:42.250 --> 01:45.270
A quick search reveals there are many alternatives.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.420
Some free.

01:46.420 --> 01:49.030
Some you have to pay far.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.360
The one I recommend is atom.

01:51.640 --> 01:59.420
It's free open source and has many useful features such as aalto completion and syntax highlighting.

01:59.830 --> 02:06.490
It's also multi platform so if you move between operating systems you can keep using the same editor

02:06.880 --> 02:09.030
without having to learn another.

02:11.090 --> 02:18.490
Following this video there are separate videos for installing ramp and atom on Windows Mac and Linux.

02:18.620 --> 02:22.430
So please choose the ones relevant to your operating system.

02:24.160 --> 02:30.510
Please note that installing this software is optional although recommended also.

02:30.550 --> 02:37.190
If you already have a web server an editor installed then you can safely skip to the next section.
