One of the defining features of the World Wide Web is that pages can be linked together pages can contain

00:13.010 --> 00:18.230
elements that when clicked on take you to another page.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.480
These are called hyperlinks.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.610
So far we've been working with one page in a file called index.

00:28.670 --> 00:29.920
It's tier mail.

00:30.410 --> 00:39.580
Let's add another page and call it page to Dr. tetched here.

00:40.910 --> 00:46.350
And I'll just add some basic content similar to the first page.

00:50.170 --> 00:56.730
Going back to the index page let's add a link to this new page.

00:59.100 --> 01:05.970
We add links using the A R anchor element that we site a glimpse of at the start of this section

01:09.240 --> 01:11.470
to make an area into a link.

01:11.520 --> 01:16.110
We wrap anchor tags around whatever we want to be clickable.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.850
This could be text are an image for example.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.580
So first let's add some text.

01:24.580 --> 01:34.780
And then an anchor tag around the words page two like that the H ref attributes of the anchor tag contains

01:34.780 --> 01:40.280
the address of where you want the link to point to.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.510
In our case the page we just added.

01:48.020 --> 01:48.890
In the browser.

01:48.950 --> 01:49.880
Here's the link.

01:49.970 --> 01:54.040
And note that the default styling for text link is underlined.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.390
Blue text.

01:55.550 --> 02:01.790
And when you put the mouse cursor over the link it changes to a painting hand.

02:01.790 --> 02:05.160
When we click the link it takes us to the page.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.860
We just added.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.380
Note that I didn't put the link around the word here.

02:14.830 --> 02:23.020
Rather around the text page 2 you can make any part of the text you like into a link.

02:23.020 --> 02:31.230
But it's a good idea to make the text link understandable if it's taken out of context of the page.

02:31.270 --> 02:34.140
This is for accessibility reasons.

02:34.180 --> 02:40.030
People who have some sort of disability that are using special browser software like a screen reader

02:40.240 --> 02:44.440
will appreciate it and it'll make your site easier to use.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.340
If it isn't just a collection of links that say click here

02:52.390 --> 02:59.800
we can of course also add links to pages on other websites sometimes referred to as external pages.

02:59.800 --> 03:08.530
By using the full address of the page let's add another link here that links to the Wikipedia entry

03:08.530 --> 03:10.530
about the World Wide Web.

03:14.410 --> 03:20.610
When we click on this link it takes us off our site and onto Wikipedia.

03:24.780 --> 03:31.410
As with many h.t. email elements the anchor element has several optional attributes which are listed

03:31.410 --> 03:33.720
here.

03:33.720 --> 03:40.710
A common one to use is the title attribute which gives the user more information about the link.

03:40.740 --> 03:43.440
If they place the mouse cursor on top of it.

03:48.860 --> 03:59.810
Let's add a title attributes to the link we just added and then in the browser when we hover over the

03:59.810 --> 04:05.350
link we get the contents of the title attribute.

04:05.410 --> 04:10.550
If you have some links that you want to provide further information about then it's generally a good

04:10.550 --> 04:15.940
idea to add some descriptive text in the title attributes like this.
