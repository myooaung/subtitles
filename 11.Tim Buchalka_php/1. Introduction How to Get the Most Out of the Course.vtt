Hello.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.260
I'm Dave hollingworth.

00:08.260 --> 00:09.520
Welcome to the course.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.460
And thank you for joining me.

00:12.460 --> 00:19.990
We'll start by looking at how to get the most out of the course throughout the course we'll be writing.

00:19.990 --> 00:20.500
P H.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.730
P. code.

00:22.390 --> 00:28.690
The best way to learn is to follow along by running the code yourself and experimenting with it to see

00:28.690 --> 00:31.590
exactly what it does for this.

00:31.600 --> 00:38.090
You'll need a web server and cold editor installed on your computer will look at how to do that.

00:38.170 --> 00:46.510
Next if you need it all the cold shown in the videos is available to download in the resources section

00:46.510 --> 00:52.470
of each video along with the addresses of any website shown.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.960
I also recommend you complete the quizzes in each section to help reinforce the material covered in

00:58.960 --> 01:00.420
the videos.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.820
And of course if at any time you need help please don't hesitate to ask.

01:06.820 --> 01:13.210
Each video has a question and answer session where you can browse existing questions and answers and

01:13.270 --> 01:14.890
ask your own question.

01:14.890 --> 01:22.440
If you need to be one of my colleagues are even another student will answer your question.

01:22.870 --> 01:27.320
If we can help in any way please let us know.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.220
So if you ready let's get started.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.110
See you in the next video.
