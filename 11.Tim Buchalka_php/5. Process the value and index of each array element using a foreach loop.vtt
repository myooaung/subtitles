When using far each loop to process each element of an array in addition to the value of each element

00:13.820 --> 00:18.410
you can also access the index.

00:18.740 --> 00:26.180
Let's look at an example here we have an array with three elements and a far each loop that's printing

00:26.180 --> 00:33.860
out the value of each element of the array to access the index of each array element.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.690
We add another variable to the far each loop like this.

00:39.350 --> 00:42.710
You can call this variable whatever you like.

00:43.190 --> 00:50.240
Then inside the far reach leaps code block this variable will contain the index of each erate element

00:50.300 --> 00:59.780
in turn let's add this index to the airco statement displaying it before the value and also adding a

00:59.780 --> 01:01.870
hyphen to separate them.

01:04.880 --> 01:11.180
When we run this code by opening the script in the browser in addition to the value of each element

01:11.540 --> 01:17.060
we can also see the index as we didn't assign any indexes manually.

01:17.060 --> 01:20.170
The first element has an index of zero.

01:20.270 --> 01:23.250
The second an index of 1 and so on.

01:26.870 --> 01:30.810
Let's change the array and manually assign some indexes.

01:31.860 --> 01:40.350
I've also put each index and value on a new line which is perfectly valid and makes it easier to read.

01:40.440 --> 01:48.150
Now the first element as an index of a the second an index of B and the third c.

01:50.510 --> 01:56.220
When we view this in the browser we can see these indexes displayed as before.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.580
Just as before.

02:00.590 --> 02:07.550
Here we have the articles variable that contains the array and the far each loop including the index

02:08.960 --> 02:10.850
as the loop executes.

02:10.850 --> 02:17.900
In addition to the value of each element of the array being assigned to the article variable the index

02:18.080 --> 02:21.180
is also assigned to the index variable.

02:23.160 --> 02:29.480
Then in the far each code block you can access the elements value and its index.
