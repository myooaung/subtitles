00:05.230 --> 00:09.520
In addition to strings integers and floats

00:11.860 --> 00:20.830
variables can also contain boolean values a billion value is simply true are false.

00:21.010 --> 00:25.380
These are useful because we can use them when controlling programme flow.

00:25.510 --> 00:27.920
Ah what a program should do next.

00:28.060 --> 00:31.090
We'll see this in detail later on.

00:31.780 --> 00:38.200
To assign a billion value to a variable used the word true are the word false.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.730
Note that we don't have quotes around the values.

00:42.220 --> 00:49.310
You can write it in upper case a lower case but it's best practice to put it in lower case like this.

00:51.610 --> 00:55.250
A variable can also contain a special value called No.

00:55.700 --> 01:00.210
No is used to represent a variable that has no value.

01:00.730 --> 01:05.360
A variable is null if no value has been assigned to it yet.

01:05.590 --> 01:09.920
Ah if it's assigned the value null like this.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.770
As with billions.

01:11.770 --> 01:18.460
Note that there are no quotes around this value and it can be upper and lower case but the convention

01:18.700 --> 01:21.980
is to write it in lower case.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.800
As with numbers we need to be careful with variables like these.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.710
The first one contains a boolean value.

01:30.070 --> 01:33.630
Well the second one contains a string with the word true.

01:33.850 --> 01:36.620
These are not the same.

01:36.820 --> 01:45.310
Likewise the first variable here is null while the second one contains the four characters N U L L.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.750
Again these are not the same.

01:51.590 --> 01:55.500
Let's look at an example of some of these variables.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.650
Let's add a boolean and a nold variable.

02:03.330 --> 02:04.810
And again will use the.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.930
Far don't function to print out these values.

02:12.950 --> 02:18.480
This time however instead of calling ghafar Dump twice once for each variable.

02:18.660 --> 02:23.920
I'm only going to call it once passing in two variables at the same time.

02:24.110 --> 02:29.070
The violent function lets you pass in as many variables as you like.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.960
Will learn more about passing values to functions later on.

02:35.990 --> 02:43.420
So back in the code we'll pass our two variables to the vihar Dump function like that.

02:47.920 --> 02:53.950
Then in the browser when we open our p-h P file we see the values printed out.

02:53.950 --> 03:00.170
First a boolean are bool value of true and then a no value.
