00:05.230 --> 00:11.920
Now that we know what variables are in this video will learn what you can store in them.

00:12.110 --> 00:16.140
Variables in P HP can store data of different types.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.360
So far in our code.

00:18.430 --> 00:22.030
We've created a variable that contains a string.

00:22.480 --> 00:30.960
A string is simply some text are more specifically a sequence of characters between quotes.

00:31.540 --> 00:35.220
The contents of the variable are its value.

00:35.260 --> 00:42.970
What's between the quotes but the quotes aren't included in the value.

00:43.810 --> 00:51.080
So these are all the valid string variables you can use single are double quotes to contain the value

00:51.580 --> 00:55.410
as long as you use the same at both ends of the string.

00:55.990 --> 00:59.380
There is a slight difference between single and double quotes.

00:59.380 --> 01:05.430
When we come to process string values but we'll cover that in more detail later.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.080
Variables can also contain numbers.

01:10.210 --> 01:16.050
These numbers can be integers which are whole numbers that dont have a decimal part.

01:16.330 --> 01:20.400
Integers can be positive or negative numbers like this.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.430
Numbers can also have a decimal part.

01:27.430 --> 01:30.950
These are known as float's a dot.

01:30.970 --> 01:35.010
Period is used to separate the decimal part.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.930
And of course these can be negative.

01:37.960 --> 01:45.790
Also it's important to note that if you use a language other than English where decimals are separated

01:45.790 --> 01:52.930
using a different character for example Spanish you still need to use the dupped are period when writing

01:52.930 --> 01:55.880
a float value in p p.

01:58.820 --> 02:03.980
One thing to be aware of is the difference between two variables like these.

02:03.980 --> 02:09.330
The first one contains a number while the second one is a string.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.030
It's a string that contains numeric characters but it's still a string.

02:15.290 --> 02:19.540
They are not the same value.

02:20.060 --> 02:26.860
You need to be aware of this when using variables but we're going to this in more detail later on.

02:31.030 --> 02:34.210
Let's look at an example of some different variables.

02:34.450 --> 02:38.210
We already have a string variable that we created earlier.

02:38.590 --> 02:43.190
Let's add an integer and a float.

02:45.510 --> 02:49.500
Instead of using airco to print this out.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.500
Let's use p-h.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.520
PS.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.530
Dump function.

02:55.530 --> 02:59.410
This is useful for seeing what value a variable contains.

03:01.920 --> 03:11.520
Will go into functions in more detail later but to use this function you write that dump followed by

03:11.520 --> 03:17.830
a variable in brackets.

03:18.990 --> 03:24.150
This will print out the details of the variable in the browser.

03:24.150 --> 03:33.090
Let's print out the details of the other two variables like that will save the file.

03:36.950 --> 03:44.750
Now if we go to our page in the browser we can see that the VAR dump function has printed out the details

03:44.810 --> 03:46.630
of our variables.

03:46.790 --> 03:51.010
We have a 12 character string that contains the text.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.850
Hello again.

03:52.850 --> 03:58.130
An integer are in it with the value 3 and a float with the value.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.130
One point ninety nine although you wouldn't use it in your final code.

04:04.190 --> 04:09.680
The dump function is very useful if you want to see what a variable contains.

04:09.890 --> 04:15.340
I use it's a whole the time when I am trying to work out what some code is doing.

04:18.160 --> 04:24.630
You might have noticed that were not declaring these variables to be a specific type.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.850
Unlike in some languages.

04:26.860 --> 04:35.050
P H P is what's known as a loosely types language in some languages like Java for example which is strongly

04:35.050 --> 04:35.910
typed.

04:36.130 --> 04:41.860
When you declare a variable you have to declare its type in p p.

04:41.860 --> 04:47.350
You could create a variable and stop any type of value in it like this.

04:47.350 --> 04:53.740
This means it's very flexible but it can be easy to introduce errors if you are not careful.

04:53.740 --> 04:56.560
Don't worry though we are going to be careful.
