We've now learnt enough aches to AML to create some fairly complex documents.

00:10.700 --> 00:18.140
We've been inventing our code using spaces and putting code on different lines to make sure our h.t.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.800
email code is laid out in a clear way.

00:21.920 --> 00:28.380
Space is tabs and New Line characters are commonly referred to as whitespace characters.

00:28.910 --> 00:31.910
However there's nothing to say that we have to do this.

00:32.150 --> 00:41.030
And if I remove some of this white space like that now a cold is much more difficult to understand.

00:41.300 --> 00:45.980
But what we see in the browser isn't affected at all.

00:45.980 --> 00:55.120
The browser doesn't care how much white space you have and don't have in your HP AML but without whitespace

00:55.340 --> 01:01.530
in our source code it's quite difficult to work out what's going on.

01:01.850 --> 01:09.650
It's much better to lay out our code nicely like this with embedded elements indented for example so

01:09.650 --> 01:17.870
it's easier to read and therefore easier to maintain while so most cold editor software like atom here

01:18.110 --> 01:23.210
will try and help you by barter Mattingly indenting new code for you.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.820
If you're using the atom browser there's a package here that you can install that will clean up ugly

01:32.820 --> 01:34.760
AITs term al fa you.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.170
To install.

01:38.170 --> 01:46.660
We go to the edit menu and select preferences and then click on install and will search for the atom

01:46.700 --> 01:48.810
beautify package.

01:56.200 --> 02:02.880
And then we'll click install takes a few seconds to install the package.

02:04.910 --> 02:08.710
And once it's installed we can close the settings.

02:10.970 --> 02:14.310
And to clean up some messy astm out.

02:14.810 --> 02:24.170
We can select the packages menu go to atom beautify and select beautify And there we are.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.220
The package has cleaned up our H.

02:26.240 --> 02:32.000
Tim L. adding indentation and putting elements on different lines.

02:35.540 --> 02:39.740
There are also some websites that will clean up some code for you.

02:39.740 --> 02:43.330
All you have to do is paste your code onto the website.

02:45.530 --> 02:51.870
And then submit the farm and it will form at the age to mail code for you.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.220
Looking at this code.

02:57.240 --> 03:05.250
Most of it is self-explanatory but as our h.t. email gets more and more complex sometimes you might

03:05.250 --> 03:11.070
want to also annotate the code to help whoever is reading it to understand it.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.470
There's a special tag in it tnl called A comment tag.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.800
This that is the opening of a comment and this is the end.

03:23.890 --> 03:28.800
Anything inside a comment tag isn't displayed in the browser.

03:34.940 --> 03:38.410
Let's add a comment to our h.t. email here.

03:38.990 --> 03:41.880
After the article heading.

03:44.950 --> 03:51.010
In the browser the comment text is not displayed but if we view the sarce.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.040
We can see it for this reason.

03:56.040 --> 04:02.370
Be careful not to include anything you don't want the user to see in a comment as they can easily see

04:02.370 --> 04:02.770
it.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.300
If they do this.

04:07.670 --> 04:10.530
You can even comment out more than one line.

04:10.640 --> 04:19.400
So for example lets comment out the entire navigation section as you can see the Editor helps us by

04:19.400 --> 04:23.160
colour coding the commented out section.

04:23.780 --> 04:36.390
Now in the browser the whole navigation section isn't displayed but it is shown in the source.

04:38.640 --> 04:44.730
Commenting out entire code blocks like this is a useful technique for when you're developing a new feature

04:45.060 --> 04:46.190
that isn't ready yet.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.140
For example.
