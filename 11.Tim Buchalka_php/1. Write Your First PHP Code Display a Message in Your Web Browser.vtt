00:05.220 --> 00:08.820
Let's write some p-h P code in the cold.

00:08.830 --> 00:14.260
Ed we'll create a new file and call it Hello.

00:14.370 --> 00:23.070
Doug P. HP in this file on the first line will write a less than character question mark.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.600
And then the word thp.

00:25.740 --> 00:29.240
This is called the P HP opening tag.

00:29.370 --> 00:30.880
Now explain what this is.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.580
In a moment.

00:32.580 --> 00:40.740
Next on a black line below will tap the word echo followed by a space a double code character the message

00:40.890 --> 00:43.110
Hello world.

00:43.110 --> 00:47.700
And finally another double quote character and a semicolon.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.220
I'll explain this in more detail in a moment.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.760
We'll save that file by pressing control.

00:53.790 --> 00:54.580
Yes.

00:57.520 --> 01:05.410
Then in a web browser world type local host followed by a slash and then the name of the file we just

01:05.410 --> 01:06.420
created.

01:06.490 --> 01:09.840
Hello old doppie HP.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.330
When I press Enter We see the hello world message.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.590
So what just happened.

01:18.610 --> 01:26.890
First let's learn how websites work a web server is simply a computer that has a web server software

01:26.890 --> 01:35.990
installed web server software is a program that delivers our servers files that make up websites.

01:36.400 --> 01:45.900
Earlier we installed X amp which includes the Apache Web server every web server has an address.

01:45.940 --> 01:51.320
This could be Google that can learn programming but academy Wikipedia does.

01:51.370 --> 01:51.700
Argh.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.400
And so on.

01:53.440 --> 01:59.420
By default the address of the web server you have installed on your computer is local host.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.370
When web server software is running it sits and waits for requests for files.

02:06.490 --> 02:14.040
These requests now may come from web browsers a web browser is a program for accessing websites.

02:14.680 --> 02:20.620
When you tap the address of a web server into your web browser it requests the site from the web server

02:21.640 --> 02:26.990
the web server it receives the request and sends the requested file back.

02:31.170 --> 02:34.230
P H P is a programming language.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.190
We write code in p h.

02:36.190 --> 02:41.320
P that we save in a file on the web server.

02:42.420 --> 02:51.150
When a p HP file is requested the web server first executes the AP HP cold then the results of executing

02:51.150 --> 02:53.750
that code as sent to the browser.

02:53.790 --> 03:01.830
It's important to note that p HP runs on the web server it doesn't run in the browser the browser knows

03:01.830 --> 03:05.130
nothing about P HP.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.340
So in our hello world example.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.720
First to be at this line which is called an opening.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.610
P HP tag.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.690
This just tells the web server that some p-h peak cold is going to follow.

03:21.500 --> 03:30.160
Then we have the Ã©cole construct that says that whatever follows should be printed out to the browser.

03:30.230 --> 03:34.140
Following that we have a message that just says hello world.

03:34.670 --> 03:42.200
This message is contained within quotes so that the echo statement knows where the message starts and

03:42.200 --> 03:43.880
where it ends.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.370
Finally we have a semicolon.

03:46.370 --> 03:49.410
This marks the end of this instruction.

03:49.580 --> 03:53.880
We'll see many more examples of P HP code like this as we progress.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.530
So don't worry too much just yet.
