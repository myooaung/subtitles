Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,250
My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course, Spring MVC Fundamentals.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,170
I'm the director of software development at Software Technology

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,420
Group and the CEO of Complete Programmer.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,060
Spring MVC is a full‑featured yet lightweight Java framework that

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,420
has taken the web development space by storm. Spring's

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,370
integration is excellent with just about any other Java tooling,

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,430
and Spring MVC is no exception.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,940
In this course we're going to cover the fundamentals of Spring MVC.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,510
We will cover all the major parts of Spring MVC,

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,530
including container and containerless deployments,

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,510
both standard controllers and REST controllers,

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,840
JSP pages and the Spring alternative, Thymeleaf,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,250
as well as consuming Spring MVC from client‑side JavaScript.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,380
By the end of this course,

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,310
you should feel comfortable developing with Spring MVC. Before

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,760
beginning the course, you should be familiar with Java,

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,010
and although not necessary, some Maven experience will help.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,320
From here, you should feel comfortable diving into Spring with courses

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,170
on Spring security, Spring data JPA using Hibernate, or having a better

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,410
understanding of architectural design through the design patterns in

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,460
Java courses here on Pluralsight. I hope you'll join me on this journey

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,000
to learn Spring MVC with the Spring MVC Fundamentals Course, here at Pluralsight.
