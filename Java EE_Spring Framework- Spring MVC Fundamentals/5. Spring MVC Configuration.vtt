00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.670
A major change that was just beginning in the previous release of this

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.540
course was the migration from XML in your web application.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.280
It started first by just not having XML in your Spring code,

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.460
and then other standards pushed for it as well.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.630
More recent serverless specification have called

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.910
for not having a web.xml at all.

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.220
XML is often thought to be more complicated and,

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.590
at a minimum, is more errorâ€‘prone for copy/paste errors.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.450
Not using XML though can fill a little like a blackbox.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.050
And what I mean by that is you can start using it,

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.100
but not understand what's going on behind the scenes.

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.380
This often leaves developers confused about what's going on in

13
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.810
their application and how it's working and,

14
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.380
furthermore, left wondering what to do when something breaks.

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.020
The configuration of Spring MVC though,

16
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.830
regardless of whether we're using XML or not,

17
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.840
is broken down into four basic areas.

18
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.480
First, we have a POM file to download any of our dependencies,

19
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.940
and that's what we created using the start.spring.io starter initializer.

20
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.920
We then have a configuration section,

21
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.340
whether that is XML or Java configuration or using web.XML.

22
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.140
There's going to be a configuration section next, so don't worry about that.

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.780
The next section is our Java files, our controller,

24
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.570
possibly our configuration, our model tier.

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.050
That's all going to be done in Java code.

26
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.640
And the last section is our view.

27
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.190
It doesn't matter if we are doing REST services,

28
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.270
Java Server Pages, FreeMarker templates,

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.360
we're actually going to look at Thymeleaf in this course. As a side note, you

30
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560
can use all of these in your application at the same time,

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.410
but we're going to focus on them one at a time and see how

32
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.000
this helps us navigate through our app. Let's look and see how this was configured in our application now.
