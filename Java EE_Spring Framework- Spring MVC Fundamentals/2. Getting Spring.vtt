00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.080
One of the reasons for reâ€‘releasing this course was because Spring quit

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.240
offering a direct download for the compiled jars.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.840
Sure, there are ways to obtain it,

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.540
but nothing is simple as just clicking a link on their project page.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.530
With some of my older courses,

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.510
people had asked for it just to focus on one technology and

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.170
not use supporting tools such as Maven.

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.130
Well, like it or not, Spring wants you to download their tools using Maven.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.970
It will be simple for this course, though,

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.800
and candidly,

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.040
any project of moderate complexity should be using Maven

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.090
or Gradle to manage its dependencies.

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.910
The Maven repo has the source, Javadocs,

14
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.240
and binaries all available for download.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.750
One of the main reasons Spring wants you to use Maven is because of the

16
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.810
transitive dependencies that are required to run projects.

17
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.400
We're going to start off by setting up our app to use Spring

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.290
Boot and then add in the features that Spring Boot doesn't

19
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.210
offer out of the basic configuration.

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's get our app configured and use Maven to download those defenses that our app will require now.
