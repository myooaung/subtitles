00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.620
Although this is a shorter module, we went over a couple of advanced techniques.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.080
We went over interceptors, and we implemented internationalization

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.210
inside of our application using some resource bundles,

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.510
specifically a Message.Properties properties file and the

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.940
according file for the Spanish translation.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.940
And then we went ahead and implemented a post‑redirect‑get

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.660
pattern, a PRG, inside our controller using the redirect

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.330
preappend to the page we want of view.

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.410
Both of these are great solutions to complex problems that you'll often face

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.740
inside of your application, and they don't just work for JSPs.

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:52.000
You could actually implement these same things if you're using Thymeleaf or any other view technology integrated with Spring MVC.
