Although not required,

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.980
there's a convention of placing view pages under the WEB‑INF directory so

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.650
that they cannot be deep‑linked or bookmarked to. This way all requests

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.660
must be directed through our application,

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.320
and we can guarantee the user experience.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.210
We already have this set up in our application.

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.910
Let's look at what that configuration did for us,

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.270
though,

9
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.440
and how it was tied to our application as far as deployments were concerned.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.040
When we converted our application from a self‑contained

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.810
executable JAR file to a WAR file that we deployed on Tomcat,

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.460
we created a src main webapp directory,

13
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.530
and you can see that in our project structure over here on the left.

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.250
Underneath that, we created a WEB‑INF directory,

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.580
a JSP directory,

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.540
and that JSP directory contains the JSP files that we have created so far.

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.060
Now, why would we do this?

18
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.000
As I mentioned,

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.640
it's to make it so that people can't deep link to our application.

20
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.140
And if I switch over to my browser,

21
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.730
we have our page that we've set up links to, but if you

22
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.010
remember when we added these links, they were a reference to the service call.

23
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.750
So we were doing a call to the controller to route us

24
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260
back to the page that we wanted.

25
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:26.450
What happens if we come over here and we type in registration.jsp.

26
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.090
It won't serve that up, and we don't want it to serve that up.

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550
That's by design.

28
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.990
So putting those pages underneath our WEB‑INF folder and a JSP

29
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.450
folder makes it so that they have to be served up internally

30
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.840
and turned back to our end user,

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.730
thus making it to where we control the state of how they flow through

32
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.880
the application, and they can't bookmark into things that we don't want

33
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.000
them to. It's a lot better designed for us. All we had to do was just move that under that WEB‑INF folder.
