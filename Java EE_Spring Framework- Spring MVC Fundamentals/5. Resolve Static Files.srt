1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,510
There are actually a lot of reasons why we would want to host up static

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,470
files from with inside of our Spring MVC application.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,890
We may want to implement security on them,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,350
we want to make sure they're logged in, we could possibly do some caching stuff.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,920
Regardless, it's really easy for us to do.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,660
It's very similar to what we just did with the view resolver,

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
except we're going to add a resource handler.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,410
We do have to implement one interface, and we'll walk through that,

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,370
but then we just add it to the registry of the Resource Handler Registry,

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,640
and we say that, hey, any request to files,

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,830
I want you to go ahead and look in this directory,

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,910
and we've created a WEB‑INF/pdf/ directory,

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,130
and we can host up static files from there that are PDFs.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,370
Let's walk through this configuration in our code now.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,870
To host up static PDFs,

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,970
I'm going to start by creating a PDF directory alongside of our JSP directory.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,870
I'm going to right‑click on WEB‑INF and say New Directory, pdf, hit Enter.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,100
Then I have a sample PDF I just grabbed off of my file system,

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,540
and I encourage you to do the same, and just drag that PDF into your application.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,990
It's going to ask you if you want to copy that in, and we'll say yes.

21
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,400
Then we want to implement an interface.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,140
Now we have this configuration class set up,

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,120
but we're going to implement this interface and use

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,770
it to override some functionality.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,530
So I'm going to say implements WebMvcConfigure,

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,390
and then I want to add in here a resource handler.

27
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,610
So I'm going to add in the addResourceHandler's method that overrides the

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,100
implementing basic functionality that's currently there,

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,640
and say registry.addResourceHandler.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to put in a path of /files/**.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,130
So it's going to look for anything in that path,

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,580
and then I'm going to specify the location of where we

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,270
just created that directory structure, /WEB‑INF/pdf/.

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,540
So that resource location needs to match exactly what you

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,090
named your folder underneath WEB‑INF.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,820
If you added an s on the end or something like that,

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,300
it's a common mistake I've seen people make.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,620
It needs to be identical.

39
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,770
Let's save that, restart our application server, and see

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,680
if that will host up our PDF for us.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Now that we are at our browser,

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,620
we can go up to our address bar and type in files/ps.pdf, because you'll

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,680
remember in that resource handler, that was the path that we wanted it to

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,050
resolve to, and hit Enter, and it will serve up our PDF.

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,940
And it works just like we thought it did.

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,080
Let's look at that configuration in that configure again one more

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,130
time. You can see on line 15 where we told it to go to /file/**, and

48
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,340
on line 16 where we told it to locate those files under

49
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:16,000
/WEB‑INF/pdf/. That's all it took for us to resolve static files hosted from inside of our application.
