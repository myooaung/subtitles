1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,500
Our previous example displayed static pages as a fully

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,910
self‑contained Spring Boot application, and that works very well,

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,380
and it works fine if you want to just go ahead and use RESTful services too.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,500
But deploying JSP pages,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,580
which a lot of you may be watching this course to migrate

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,320
and existing application or maintain an existing

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,540
application and have to use JSP pages, they actually still work great,

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,920
but Spring Boot self‑contained JARs don't do well with them.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,610
In fact,

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,680
Spring will caution you in their documentation to not

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,320
deploy your application as a fully self‑contained JAR and

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,200
as a Spring Boot application.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,160
So let's go ahead now and look at converting that to a packaged

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,200
WAR and deploying that on a Tomcat server.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,810
To get an instance of Tomcat for us to use for our project,

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm going to go ahead and open up a browser and navigate to tomcat.apache.org,

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,430
and then we can go down to the Download section on the left here.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,480
And if you're not sure which version you want to use,

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,270
there is a link that you can navigate to and read

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,400
about all the different versions.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,730
But for Java 11 and what we're doing, we want to use Tomcat 9.

22
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,980
So I'm going to click on that, and scroll down a little bit,

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,770
and click the Core zip version, and it will download for me.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,630
And let's expand that ZIP file.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,410
I like to do that in my DevTools directory, and here's my downloaded ZIP file.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,610
As I mentioned,

27
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,170
I like to have all of my tools under a DevTools directory

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,560
where I've got multiple versions of Maven,

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
and Tomcat, and those types of things,

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,990
any of the things I'm messing around with on projects,

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,330
I like to put underneath here.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,890
You can see I expanded our apache‑tomcat‑9.0.30 version here.

33
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,040
And we'll want to remember where this path is because we

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,310
have to configure this inside of IntelliJ.

35
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,490
We have to tell it the home path to this Apache Tomcat instance.

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,510
So remember where that path is.

37
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,690
Let's open up our IDE and get that all configured.

38
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,870
To begin with, we want to stop that server if yours is still running.

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,440
So our self‑contained server, I'm going to go ahead and click Stop on it.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,100
Then I want to open up our settings and preferences,

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,800
so I want to go to File and Preferences.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm on a Mac, so mine's underneath the IntelliJ application name.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,790
Yours may be under Windows Preferences if you're on a Windows machine.

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,840
I want to go to Build, Execution, Deployment,

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,540
Application Servers,

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,880
and you'll notice that we don't have anything configured here yet.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,930
So I'm going to click the plus sign and say that I

48
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,530
want to choose a Tomcat server,

49
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,860
and this is where it's asking for that home

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,410
directory like we spoke about earlier.

51
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,090
So I want to navigate to that folder structure,

52
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,010
which mine was under DevTools, and I had Apache Tomcat 9.0,

53
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,210
and click Open.

54
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,340
So you see where I had mine into that Tools directory,

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,160
apache‑tomcat‑9.0.30, and it also put that as the base directory,

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,940
which is correct.

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,230
That's what we wanted that to have.

58
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,590
Those two should mirror each other.

59
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,210
There are cases where they don't, not in this course though.

60
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,610
For what we're doing, this is how we want it to look.

61
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm going to choose OK, and it has all of that environment set up,

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,830
and select OK again.

63
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,530
Now, we need to change our project to be packaged as a WAR.

64
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,210
So if we open up our pom.xml file, right now,

65
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,580
there isn't a package type associated in here.

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,050
So there's a lot of stuff going on in this Maven POM filer.

67
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,980
There's the parent, there's the group, and artifact,

68
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,470
and version ID, and our name of our project,

69
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,900
our Java version, and then dependencies that were added inside of here,

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,780
but we don't see any packaging type inheritance,

71
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,040
and it's because it's defaulting to what the parents says that we are.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,140
We want to go underneath version here,

73
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,540
and you see it on line 13 in my application,

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:26,320
and choose package, and the packaging type is a war now,

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,140
and we'll save this.

76
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,020
And you can see that Maven,

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,270
I've purposely left it turned off on mine to show you,

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,190
is asking if we want to import these changes,

79
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,910
and I want to choose Yes, and you can enable it to auto import it as well.

80
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,520
I want to have it import these changes,

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,340
and now it's changed the project type of the structure of what we had.

82
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,740
Before, it was packaged up as a self‑executable JAR,

83
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,910
and now it's a WAR, so it should be available to our Tomcat server to deploy.

84
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,250
We need to make one other change to our POM file.

85
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm going to scroll down,

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,960
and I've already copied and pasted in the code because I didn't want

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,240
to have to have you watch me just type it all in.

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,150
I'm going to add a dependency, and I've just commented mine out here.

89
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm going to uncomment it.

90
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:21,020
Below the org.springframework.boot, artifactId of spring‑boot‑starter‑web,

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,650
and above the spring‑boot‑starter‑test, you see on line 29 through 33,

92
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,240
I've got this spring‑boot‑starter‑tomcat plugin in here,

93
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,000
and this is to remove the dependencies on the internal packaged

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,220
application and convert this over to where we now have our own

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,940
standalone Tomcat‑enabled WAR,

96
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,120
and so we have a WAR that will work for Tomcat with all

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,480
of its dependencies all packaged up.

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,970
Let's save this, and now we can go edit our runtime configuration.

99
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,530
Click on Add Configurations up in your toolbar up here,

100
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,750
and you'll see we currently don't have a configuration for Tomcat.

101
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,360
We added the server, but we haven't created a configuration,

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,980
so let's click the plus sign, scroll down,

103
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,980
and select Tomcat Server and local.

104
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,460
If you don't see this,

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,850
you probably skipped the step earlier where we added

106
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,240
that server in when we downloaded it.

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,690
So let's choose Local and open this up.

108
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,790
To start with, I want to select the correct JRE.

109
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,120
So make sure if you have multiple JREs installed, you choose the right one.

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,140
This is the one that I want.

111
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,660
For deployments, choose the Deployments tab and click the plus sign,

112
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,940
choose artifact, and choose the conference:war.

113
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,270
Click OK.

114
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:54,640
I want to change the Application context to just /conference,

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,280
and let's switch back over to our server,

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,110
make sure everything looks good here, and it is.

117
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,840
The URL is localhost:8080/conference,

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
though it should be the same from our deployment in our server,

119
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,240
and click OK.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,600
There's one other small change we need to make.

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,290
I'm going to exit full screen mode here.

122
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,950
Static resources aren't served from src,

123
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,850
main, resources, static in standard web applications.

124
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,540
They're usually out of a src, main, web app directory.

125
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,240
So if I right‑click and say New, Directory,

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,720
and choose webapp, now, notice, I started that off of src,

127
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,240
main, so src, main, and enter in the new directory web app,

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,510
and hit Enter, I now have a directory to start

129
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,790
hosting up static resources out of.

130
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,640
And to begin with,

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,460
I'm just going to copy and paste that index.html that we had under resources,

132
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,110
static and paste that into of the webapp directory.

133
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,490
Click OK.

134
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,540
Now we have everything ready and configured to run our application.

135
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,990
If your configuration says Tomcat 9.0.30,

136
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,140
like mine does or whatever version you downloaded,

137
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,450
go ahead and click the plus sign next to it,

138
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,560
and it should start up your server for you.

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,490
And you'll see the build status in the lower‑right‑hand corner,

140
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,120
and then your server pop up.

141
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,370
And once its loads,

142
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,400
it's automatically configured to bring up your

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,070
application and launch that Index page.

144
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,660
So it did it faster than I could even walk you through it,

145
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,880
and you'll notice our application pulled up,

146
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,040
and it's now localhost:8080/conference.

147
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,240
Before, we were just at root.

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,650
Tomcat, by default, does it by the name of your WAR file.

149
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,910
So our application is now localhost:8080/conference.

150
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,800
There's ways to change that.

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,820
You can go put the final build artifact name in there, but this is great.

152
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,140
This gets us developing and gets us doing everything we want to do,

153
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,940
and our app is now up.

154
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,900
We did a bunch of stuff there.

155
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,140
Let's walk through that real quick.

156
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,310
We started off by opening up our POM file and changing the

157
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,080
packaging type to war and then adding this dependency for

158
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,940
the spring‑boots‑starter‑tomcat.

159
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,120
We also downloaded a Tomcat instance and added a

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,820
configuration for it. We see our configurations here.

161
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,120
I changed the URL to be /conference, and in the deployment,

162
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,590
I changed the Application context to be conference.

163
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,940
We need to make sure those two line up.

164
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,120
Back on our Server tab,

165
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,770
if you hate that it launches a browser every time it starts up,

166
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,040
you can uncheck this Open browser After launch checkbox right here in

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,170
the center of the application configuration section,

168
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,270
and that can become a little bit annoying after a while.

169
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,590
I like it because it gets me up and running and

170
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,440
lets me see what I want to faster.

171
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,540
But if you do hate that, you can go ahead and disable that there.

172
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,600
Then we went ahead and created a src, main,

173
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,820
webapp directory,

174
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,360
and copied over that index.html you can see on the left‑hand pane there,

175
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,590
and launched our application, which pulled up our index.html page.

176
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,130
So quite a few steps, Tomcat downloaded and expanded,

177
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,710
installed, configured the runtime configuration,

178
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,840
and then switched it over to a WAR and added a plugin for it,

179
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,000
not that bad when you break down the steps. It just maybe seems like a lot if you're not used to all of that.
