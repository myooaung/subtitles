1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,250
To begin adding internationalization to our application,

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,500
we want to start by opening up our ConferenceConfig,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,810
and we're actually going to add three beans inside of here.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,700
I'll make this full screen so it's a little easier for you to see.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,650
The first thing we're going to add is a SessionLocaleResolver,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,330
and this will just use the LocaleResolver interface,

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,210
but the SessionLocaleResolver's what ties our current session to a locale.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,150
And this bean is just going to take and create an instance of the

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,540
LocaleResolver and put it out in our Spring registry for us.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,240
I've gone ahead and pasted this in.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,040
You can see we start off with a default locale of Locale.US.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,280
You can change that to your specified region if you want,

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,570
but this is what I'm going to start with.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,620
The next bean that we're going to add in here is the LocaleChangeInterceptor,

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:11,010
and the LocaleChangeInterceptor just looks for a parameter,

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,290
either through a hidden element or on our URL string as a query parameter,

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,380
however we want to pass that in,

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,840
but it looks for that to see if it should intercept that change.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,980
And you can see on line 35 here that we are looking for the param name of Lang,

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,740
L‑a‑n‑g.

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,590
Now the next thing we need to add actually isn't a bean.

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,580
It's going to be a feature that we override from the WebMvcConfigure,

23
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,820
and it's the interceptor we're going to add.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,330
So we just created this LocaleChangeInterceptor.

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,540
Now we're going to register it,

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,370
and I like to keep all the things that we've overridden at the top

27
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,690
where we're going to be making those changes to that

28
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,420
WebMvcConfigure and the beans defined down below.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,740
Really, it's just personal preference.

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,440
It doesn't matter.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,060
Anywhere you put this in this file will be fine.

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,530
Those are the three things we had to add to the ConferenceConfig.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,640
Now we want to go ahead and create two properties files,

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,880
and I'm going to do that by right‑clicking on our src,

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,940
main, resources directory and say New, File.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,450
And for the name, I'm going to type in messages.properties,

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,410
and the name matters here.

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,980
So notice its messages, plural.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to hit Enter.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,290
And the first thing I'm going to put inside of here is a comment.

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm going to do labels, and this is just for personal preference.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,940
And then give it to the name‑value pair of Name.

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,260
And then I'm going to throw another comment in here for buttons,

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:03:01,210
and the name‑value pair of save.changes=Save Changes,

45
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,790
and save it.

46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,800
Now we want to add another properties file out here.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,860
I'm going to right‑click on our src, main,

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,830
resources directory again and say New, File,

49
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:21,440
and the name of this one's going to be messages_es.properties.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,640
And this is specifically for the Spanish translations.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,780
So in here, I'm going to do the same thing, except I'm going to cheat.

52
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm going to just grab this text that we just typed out,

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,830
copy it, and paste it inside of here.

54
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm going to change it to the Spanish translation of Nombre.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:52,340
And we'll change Save Changes, cambios.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,030
There we go.

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,690
And we have our two properties files,

58
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,260
and the locale that we pass in with that change interceptor is

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,880
going to go look for the appropriate properties file and pull

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,940
that translation out of that file.

61
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,870
Now let's open up our registration.jsp page,

62
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,530
and this is pretty simple, but we have to add two pieces inside of here.

63
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,510
First, we want to start by adding another tag library at the top of our page.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:29,240
We'll say %@ for the tag library,

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,790
and we're going to give this a prefix of spring.

66
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,680
And for the URI,

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,410
we want to choose the http://www.springframework.org/tags and save that.

68
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,250
And now we can come down to this text for Name,

69
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:56,330
and we'll change that to be the spring:message tag.

70
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,040
And the code="name".

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
And then make sure you close that tag off.

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,600
So we can save that,

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,030
and you can go through and change all of the fields as we go.

74
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm going to start my server up just to show you that this is

75
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,000
working the way that we expect it to work.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,710
And now it's launched our browser for us.

77
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,690
I can click on the registration link, and to begin with,

78
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,210
it shows up with Name in English.

79
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,880
But if I had a query parameter on the end of here and say

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
language=es for Spanish and hit Enter,

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,890
notice that it will translate Name to Nombre,

82
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,270
and it will also ask us if it wants us to translate

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,200
this page for us automatically.

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,070
So you can see that we are now using that internationalization.

85
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,970
And you can go through and change the title of the page,

86
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,940
the buttons to say Submit changes or Save changes or to add registration,

87
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,390
whatever translations you want to go through and add.

88
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:04,000
You can see we have all the pieces now set up to do internationalization inside of our app.
