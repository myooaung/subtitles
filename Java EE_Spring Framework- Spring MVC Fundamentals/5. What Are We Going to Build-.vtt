00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.740
We're going to build a conference application that has a

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
registration object that we do some validation on.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.180
We're going to show you how to build the controllers associated

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.910
with those and what that code looks like.

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.740
It's where it's handling all the errors for it and navigation.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.420
We're going to solve complex problems using the Post/Redirect/Get

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.720
pattern and just show you basic internationalization throughout the

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.420
application. So things will be internationalized where it'll work in

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.220
either English or Spanish.

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.240
And you can add other languages to that resource bundle.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.020
We'll also dive into how to handle the dependencies that are in there and show

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.640
you how to start your application using Spring Boot and move out of that into a

13
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.580
standard Java configuration using the Boot starter and then overriding things

14
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.140
through customizations inside of your app.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.850
It really goes into all of the details without getting too

16
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.390
cumbersome in your project about how and what we should do and

17
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.000
what Spring will do for us by convention and what we want to override through configuration.
