00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.410
Obviously, our browser worked fine to do a simple test to grab that URL and

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.530
see that the values were changing, but I wanted to show you Postman. I've

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.900
just downloaded their basic version for free.

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.410
I don't have the paid version of it,

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.810
but it's a great tool for testing web services,

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.540
and you can see that it'll actually store history of it.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.390
You can create a test suite out of here if you'd like.

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.120
But to run a simple test in here,

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.470
we can go ahead and enter our URL,

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.470
localhost:8080/conference/user, and this is of type GET.

11
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.960
I can Send on this, and you'll see that it retrieves

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.140
the firstname Bryan, lastname Hansen, age 43 in here. Works great.

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.690
We can also do posts in here.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.540
So if we come in here and set a POST and create the Body,

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.870
we can add in these key valued pairs inside of here saying that I want to

16
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.800
pass in a key of firstname and a value of Bryan, a key of lastname and a

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.180
value of Hansen, and a key of age and a value of 43, and it will handle all

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.980
of the quotes, and strings, and manipulation, and converting it to integer

19
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.890
objects for us automatically.

20
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.950
If I call this right now, it's going to fail,

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.310
though, and give us an error back because we haven't created this method yet.

22
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.490
So let me hit Send on this, and you'll see we get a 405 error saying that

23
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.000
the request method, POST, is not currently supported. Let's add that into our code now.
