00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,730
The bean validator reference implementation is actually an instance of

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,550
hibernate‑validator. To configure it for spring, we just need to add it to

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,090
our class path and begin validating objects.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,390
It doesn't matter if you are using Hibernate the ORM tool, the

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,610
validator is actually just the reference implementation and

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,980
has nothing to do with databases.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,690
Let's add the hibernate‑validator dependency to our project. We want

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:35,990
to open up our POM file, and I'm going to put that below our Tomcat

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,110
starter, but above our starter test,

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,540
and I'm just going to add that code in there.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,000
We want to have a group ID of org.hibernate.validator, an

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,330
artifact ID of hibernate‑validator, and a version of 6.1.1.Final.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,540
When you first add this in here and save it,

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,380
it is going to take it a minute to download.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,550
So if you get a red error for a minute,

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,750
realize it just has to resolve that dependency and

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,200
download it to your local repository.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,090
Once you've saved that, though, just as we've done with other dependencies,

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,140
you should be able to look in your external libraries and look for

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,780
org‑hibernator, and specifically the hibernate‑validator,

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,340
and you can see that it's downloaded there.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,660
We've got it in our window pane on the left,

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:35,000
and it's specifically version 6.1.1.Final. Let's go back and see how we start using this now.
