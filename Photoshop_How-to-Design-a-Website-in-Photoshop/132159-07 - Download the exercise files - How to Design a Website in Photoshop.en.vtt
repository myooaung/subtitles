Hi, in this video we're going to look at how to download

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.800
the exercise files that go along with this course.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.570
Now you don't have to have these files,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.960
but it's really helpful if you want to follow along step-by-step.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
Within the files, drop your email address here in the middle,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.340
and I'll email you out the images that go along with the course,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.850
along with things like the fonts and colors that we use.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.370
What I've also done is that at the end of each video,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.640
I've saved a Photoshop document that represents where we're up to.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.815
So if you get lost or your file is not working the way it does through the videos,

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.440
you can compare your file to the downloaded file,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.180
so you can see where you might have gone wrong.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.500
Throughout the course, I referred to lots of different references and resources,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.780
things like syntax and websites,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.530
they'll all be part of this exercise files here. All right, let's keep going.
