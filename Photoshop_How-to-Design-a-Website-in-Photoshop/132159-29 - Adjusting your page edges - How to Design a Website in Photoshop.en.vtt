00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Before we get into images, I'm going to show you,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.500
I find it tough to work to the exact measurement size,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.870
the 690 pixels wide.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.490
That's exactly what we should be working too,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.500
but I need to see a little buffer around the edges here,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.840
a little bit of aging just to see

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.375
what it's like when it's sitting inside of a bigger screen.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.240
To do that, I'm going to grab the Artboard tool hiding underneath the Move tool.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.160
I'm going to click on this one here where it says LG Desktop,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.380
and I'm going to scroll down until I get to the middle,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.420
but I'm going to drag this a little bit.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.235
Drag that a bit.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:30.450
It doesn't really matter how far,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.940
because what's going to happen is if I turn my guides back on,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.160
you'll see the guide to still where they should be.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.775
They're still that 960 wide including the padding on the outside.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.665
Next thing we need to do is we've got a lot of boxes in here aren't the right size.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:46.460
What I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll down and find my Nav Bar.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.870
I'm going to hold command key down on my Mac or control key on a PC,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.430
and select all of the boxes that I need to go and change.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.900
There is the footer.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.460
I'm going to zoom out quite a bit so I can see everything,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.130
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my transformed tools

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.520
remember command T on the Mac and control T on a PC.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.420
Then I'm going to drag these out to match the sides of all done Alt,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.070
it'll drag both sides with me evenly, okay.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.320
Just make sure they're overlapping a bit over the edge there.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.310
When you're finished, hit Enter on your keyboard,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.530
and just gives us a bit more breathing room.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.690
I'm going to turn our guides off, which is still perfect.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.330
I'm going too zoom in a bit. This is just

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880
going to give me a little breathing room around

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.100
the outside before I start working on the next part.
