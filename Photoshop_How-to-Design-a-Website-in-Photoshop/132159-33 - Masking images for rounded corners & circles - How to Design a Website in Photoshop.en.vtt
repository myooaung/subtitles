00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
This video is the same technique but a slightly different flavor.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.475
We're going to look at using a clipping mask,

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.890
but using circles and rounded corners.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.045
Now, see down the bottom here is my finished example.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.205
I'm going to do it down the bottom here in this white part,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.965
where I've got my team's photographs.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.385
What I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll down here using my spacebar.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.050
I'm going to zoom in using my command plus.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.675
Slowly get down the bottom.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.885
I'm going to click hold down the rectangle tool.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.490
Click and hold it down until I get to the Ellipse tool.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.580
Now, the Ellipse tool, if I click and drag it,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.650
it's going to give me ellipse that goes anywhere.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.395
Now, if I hold down the Shift key, remember,

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.410
I locked the high-end width to a size that I need.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.345
What I'm going to do is I'm going to turn on my guides and I'm going to delete that.

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:48.870
I'm going to draw one that spans, say, three columns.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.745
I'm going to hold shift, down and I'm going to get it so it snaps to these three.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.745
I'm going to go to my Move tool, I'm going to move it down a little bit.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:01:00.230
Now, it doesn't really matter what color it is because just like we did the last image,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.180
is going to get covered up by the image.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.380
Let's go to File and let's go to Place Embedded.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.500
We're going to grab the desktop,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.095
we'll grab push-up exercise files.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:12.170
This team 1, which is going to be the first one.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.225
I'm going to hit Place.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.450
Now, I'm going to move it so it's over the top here,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.175
and I'm going to hold Shift,

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:24.150
scale it down before I hit Enter just to get it to appropriate size.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020
I'm going to move it in roughly about there.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.580
We can resize it afterwards.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.930
Remember, here's an ellipse,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.390
and this one's going to be Team Circle1.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.080
I am going to, remember,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.360
hold down my Alt key on a PC or Option key on a Mac,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.080
and it's going to join the two.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.400
If you are unhappy with the crop,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.380
remember, I click this one, this is team-1,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.740
and I can use my arrow keys just to tap it around to get it to where I want.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.205
I can transform it using my Command T. I can scale it up.

00:01:56.205 --> 00:02:00.565
Hit Enter. Use my keys just to tap it around again.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:02.855
That's how you crop to a circle.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.490
I'll quickly do how you crop to a rounded corners.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.150
If you are using rounded corners,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.565
click and hold down the Rectangle tool or the Ellipse tool,

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:12.590
and there's one here called rounded corners.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.640
Now, before you get started, pick a radius.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800
If you're unsure, don't worry,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.970
you can change it afterwards.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.920
I'm going to click and drag.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.640
This little box here will allow me to change the radius corners.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.955
I'm going to change the radius corners to say something like 30.

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:28.875
Big mess of rounded corners.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.660
Then I can bring in another image.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.805
I can go to File, Place Embedded.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:35.530
I'm going to bring in team 2.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.145
Place it over the top, scale it down it, hit Enter.

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:44.475
Remember, holding down the Alt key or Option key,

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:46.010
depending if you're a Mac or PC,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.640
and it will crop to the rounded corners rectangle.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.070
That's how to crop to a circle and a rectangle with rounded corners.
