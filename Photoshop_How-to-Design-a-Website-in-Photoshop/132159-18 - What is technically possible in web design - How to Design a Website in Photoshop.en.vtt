00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
In this video we're going to look at ways that we can

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.015
help ourselves when we're building our site after Photoshop.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:09.705
In Photoshop we have an infinite amount of things we could do.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.985
We could have a great theme with a drop shadow with

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:15.750
unicorns flying out of it and fire and all things.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.160
We can do that in Photoshop,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
that's that kind of program but when it comes to Web design we're quite limited in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.315
terms of the types of things we can put on a website down to its code,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.940
and mainly comes down to the browsers and how old

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.435
the browsers are depending on what they can and can't support.

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.615
Flying unicorns, no, there's no CSS feature for that

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.455
but there are features for gradients and drop shadows.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:40.770
What we can do is we can use this website called caniuse.com.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.710
Now there are other sites like this one.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.850
I really like this site,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.330
and let's say we want to work with gradients.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.900
If I type in gradient here it tells me that

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.925
the CSS gradient works on everything except Opera Mini.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.720
Now if you need to support Opera Mini then you're going to have

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.420
to think twice about using CSS gradients,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.570
luckily gradients are out at the moment and it's all about flat design.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.770
But say you need to have a gradient that if you have to support this Opera Mini,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.350
then you'll going to have to not use CSS gradients.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.960
Another thing that you might need to find out

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.965
whether you have to support some older browsers.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:17.540
If you're building a website and the rule is we have to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.855
support at least a minimum of Internet Explorer 9,

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:23.090
you are not going to be having CSS gradients.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.530
Now, it doesn't mean you can't use it,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.105
it just means they're not going to appear.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:29.605
You might design it so that if the gradient is not applied,

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:33.130
that there is just a flat background color and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.850
that might be fine because it's in the background it's not a huge important part of it.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.520
Let's say something like, let's look at shadows.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.890
There's couple of different shadows, box-shadow.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.305
Box-shadows, they're shadows that hang off

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.140
the sides of div tags that works pretty consistently.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.945
Let's look at text-shadows.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:52.395
It's not supported in IE9 again.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.480
Now this might be more important because you might be deciding that I'm going to have

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.420
this very light blue text on this white background

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.140
but it's totally not readable unless there's a drop shadow behind it.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.855
You're relying on that drop shadow for the text to be read.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.590
What that'll do is that Internet Explorer 9 is going to be this really

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.550
faded out text on white background so it's a little bit more important.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.815
Just to have a look at this site sometimes you're thinking,

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:18.035
I wonder if I can do that on a website or not.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.970
This Can I Use.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.000
Now, another nice little extra for the site is here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.430
It's to take that I'm in Ireland that's where I'm filming at the moment.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.090
If I click "Import" it gives me this nice stuff.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.610
At the moment by default it gave me the global stuff

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.250
and now it gives me actually what's happening in Ireland.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.190
You can see globally that it is 90 percent

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.220
supported but in Ireland it's 97 percent supported.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.070
Global takes into all countries whereas Ireland

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.640
technologically quite modern so a lot more is going to be supported,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.620
quite modern browsers and modern computers.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.890
Now if you were doing a site that is specifically

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.040
for say a developing nation you're going to have a different ratio here.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.570
You're going to have a lot lower.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.840
You're not going to be able to use some of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.260
these features as much as say we came here in Ireland.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.210
All right, and that's the Can I Use website.
