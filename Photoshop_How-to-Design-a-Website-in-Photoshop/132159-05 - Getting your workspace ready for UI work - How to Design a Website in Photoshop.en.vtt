00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
In this video, we're going to look at resetting your workspace.

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:04.755
Now you'd reset your workspace,

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:07.710
if you opened up Photoshop and it was looking different from

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.905
my version and you want to get it to look the same so you can follow along.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:14.010
Now, I'm using Photoshop CC 2015.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.435
If you're using other versions,

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.100
it might look slightly different.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.420
But let's say that you've been using it for other things and you've moved these palettes,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.660
you drag around or you've accidentally done it.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.340
You've done this during the tutorial.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.960
You can come back to this video.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.065
All you need to do is get it back to normal to make it look right,

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.165
it's up here, it says Essentials.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:38.160
Let's make sure it set to Essentials first,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.205
and then click on where it says "Reset Essentials".

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:46.320
Then I put everything back in its place and look like mine for this tutorial.
