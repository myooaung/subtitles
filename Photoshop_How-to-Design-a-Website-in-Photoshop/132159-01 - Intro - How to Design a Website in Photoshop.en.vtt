00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.925
Hi, my name is Dan.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.920
I'll be leading you through this course on how to build

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.500
professional Website Mockups using Photoshop.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.675
These are the skills employers want,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.800
and UX/UI design skills are where the high paying jobs are at.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.790
I began my life as a graphic designer and quickly found out that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.915
it was quite competitive and the pay wasn't super exciting.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:30.150
It wasn't until I upscaled into the world of web design before my career really took off.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.770
I built this course for beginners,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.590
for people nervous about changing their careers into web design,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.860
for people new to the web world,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
as well as developers who lack any previous design training.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000
We cover everything you need to design

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.975
your first Web Mockups without getting too technical.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.730
During the course, we'll create a website for

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.000
a mock creative agency developing their mobile,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.875
tablet, and desktop views.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.465
With the exercise files you can download and work along with me.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:04.220
With a principal PDF you can follow along and create your own personal notes.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.810
I'll be teaching you how to set up new documents and how to work with mobile,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.970
tablet, and desktop views.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.495
You can easily pick website colors and fonts and preview them on your iPhone or iPad.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:21.110
You'll learn how to crop images and make full backgrounds all the way

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.665
through to exporting all the right files that you need for a website.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.210
Though that I'll be around to help.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.505
When you're ready, you can send me your files

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.205
and I'll take a look and offer any suggestions.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.560
Now it's time to upgrade your skills,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.820
get that bid of job,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.110
and impress your clients.
