00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
Hi, in this video we're going to look at rules in measuring things.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.850
We do this for two reasons.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
One is that we want some even spacing between

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
boxes and also we might be doing this because the person building the website,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.030
if it's not us, might want the measurements to know how

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.390
far apart things should be or the padding between objects.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.100
To do this, there's two ways,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.175
there is the official way and then there's the way that I use.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.640
Now the official way of doing it is to use the Ruler Tool.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.175
Now the Ruler Tool is hiding underneath the Eyedropper Tool here.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:33.750
If I click hold, hold, hold,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.940
there it's there, grab the Ruler Tool.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
Say I want to measure the distance between this More button and the box underneath it.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.280
What I do is I click and hold and drag.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.675
What you'll see is in the top left hand up in the app bar,

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.555
that the measurements are changing as I'm dragging this around.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.975
Now by default its stretching goes anywhere.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:59.070
What I want to do is hold down the Shift key to lock it in this vertical position,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.510
so I can scroll it down.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.360
You'll see there it set to 77 pixels between this one and this one.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.460
Now, what you have to do is zoom in a little bit just to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.850
ensure that it's actually very close.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.820
You can see because I was so far out, it hasn't been perfect.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.290
I can click hold and drag it just to clean it up and say actually I want it to be there.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.500
Now it's more like 81 pixels. Now that's the official way.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.190
I'm going to clear my rulers, to get rid of it,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.990
I'm going to zoom out by holding Command or Control minus.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.270
Now that's the official measuring tool and it's great.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.600
What is better though is to use the Rectangle Tool,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.165
the Rectangle Tool here has

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.930
a big benefit in the fact that it snaps to the edges of things on the page.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.850
Whereas we had to do some adjustments with

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.220
the Ruler Tool afterwards to make sure it was all measured right.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.030
Watch this, I'm going to measure the distance between here and here.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.280
I'm going to click hold and drag and see there's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.360
like pink lines that are appearing everywhere.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.970
That's because it's trying to line up with lots of different things on the pages.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.110
Mine is quite a complex page,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.700
so there's lots of things that's trying to line up with,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.085
but it's pretty good at just snapping, watch this.

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:02.675
If I just drag it down here,

00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:05.675
it's pretty good it got out 81 pixels.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.565
I'm going to zoom in and double-check.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:11.545
Let's bang on, it is perfect.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:15.140
Now the Rectangle Tool is really good for spacing out objects as well.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.880
I'm going to delete this layer down here.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.780
I'm going to zoom out a bit and move down holding my Spacebar,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.025
click, and drag down.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:26.255
I'm going to zoom in here to my little portfolio list.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:30.215
Now I've got some even spacing between these two objects.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.390
I'm using column widths,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.815
so let's View, Show,

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:36.375
and I'm going to turn on Guides.

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:39.770
You can see there I've used the spacing between these columns.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.660
Now what I want to do is make sure that the spacing

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.570
is exactly the same between here and it's obviously not.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.200
To make it perfect what I can do is using my Rectangle Tool,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.310
I can click hold and drag the rectangle between these two and you'll notice that,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.730
you see it snap to the edge is perfect.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.615
But you'll notice that I want it to be perfectly square.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:01.235
I'm going to undo that by going to Edit, Step Backwards.

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.290
What I'm going to do is I'm going to hold down

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.675
the Shift key while I'm dragging my rectangle,

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.535
if I hold the Shift key it'll lock the constraints.

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:10.830
You can see it's 30 pixels by 30 pixels now.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.890
Now if I use my Move tool, click, hold,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.020
and drag them down and we use them like a spacer.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.355
I'm going to snip into the bottom of that, now it's there.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:20.465
Now I'm going to move this image up.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.960
Now, sometimes it doesn't snip,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.170
so in this case it's not.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.850
What you can do is you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.690
I'm just going to use the arrow keys that bump it up.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.560
Using rectangles is a good way to make sure that the padding

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.630
is the same between these images and the same underneath here.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.819
The only trouble with them is that they are physical,

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.840
which means this thing here is going to print or go out on your mock up.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.105
You must make sure when you are finished with it,

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:50.320
that you select it in your Layers panel and you delete it.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.330
All right, and that's how you measure up things in Photoshop.
