00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Now this tool is really handy when you want to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.360
get a sense of how the website's going to look without all the junk are on the outside,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.805
all of the Photoshop tools and tabs and toolbars.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:10.860
Now to do this, you go to "View",

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.530
there's one called Screen Mode and you use this one here.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.655
Now for some reason,

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.650
I know it's the shortcut key of F but

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.990
some reason on this mark here I'm not sure if on a PC,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.160
but it doesn't have the shortcut,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
so we're going to ignore that little bit and use the quick little shortcut key.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.485
If I tap the F key once,

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.630
it hides half of it.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.975
Type the F key again on my keyboard,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:34.260
it gets rid of all the toolbars except for the rulers.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.240
Now what I want to do is I'm going to toggle back one

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.045
more and turn the rulers off, rulers turn them off.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.205
Then remember, once for the F key,

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.140
twice for the F key and I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.165
can see my document and I can move it around and I can hold my space-bar.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.640
I can move it around and it gives me just a bit of sense of what

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.100
my website is looking like at the moment.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.035
An F key a third time,

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:55.220
will get you back to square one.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.450
So this is a three sittings.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.830
There's this one here, and then this next one, and then this full screen.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.415
They cycle around by using the F key.

00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:05.540
Now, another nice thing I like to do is I get F key

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770
twice to get into the full screen mode is I don't like this white background,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.890
especially when I'm dealing with such a dark website.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.820
I want this background here not be white.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.980
So what you can do, you can right-click it and pick either dark gray,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.865
right-click it and pick black,

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.440
and it just changes the background color.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
If I zoom out, you'll notice that it changes forever my little background color.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.960
If I have F key back,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.895
it's up to you how you prefer to work.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.490
I like to work on a dark screen or dark

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.440
gray just so I can get nicer scenes of my website.
