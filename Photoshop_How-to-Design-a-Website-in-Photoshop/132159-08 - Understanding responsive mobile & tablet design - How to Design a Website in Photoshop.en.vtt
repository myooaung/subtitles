00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.170
Responsive web design is a way to change a website depending on the browser size.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.750
Now I'm showing him Smashing Magazine.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
Smashing Magazine is website that I read a lot and I really like

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.545
the effort they went into to redesign the different pages depending on the browser size.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.620
At the moment we're looking at it as you would on say,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.730
a big screen like an iMac or a 4K monitor or something really big and high definition.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.425
You can see there's a nav on the left,

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:37.070
a sub nav, main content and some ads.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.190
But once I get smaller,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.970
say down to a regular desktop view, can you see it changes,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.535
it goes down to this navigation here,

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:45.020
our main content and ads,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.580
but as it gets smaller, say down to say, tablet view.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.285
Changes quite a bit, ditches is the ads,

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.135
the navigation becomes comes a bit smaller,

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:55.190
this is along the top here, now.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.420
If I get down into smaller,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.785
down to the mobile view,

00:00:57.785 --> 00:00:59.560
things change quite a bit again.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.395
Now what you need to take from that is that when you are designing in Photoshop,

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.360
Photoshop is aesthetic medium.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.645
It's not scalable, stretchy one,

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.585
like you can get when it's finally put out as a website.

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:16.700
So the trick for designers when mocking up a prototype in Photoshop is that you'll

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.175
need to design the different views so that when you hand it over to the developer,

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:25.990
they know what the site does when it gets down to mobile.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.075
What happens when the menu is in tablet view?

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:32.840
And all those questions need to be answered in your mock-up.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.620
What you don't want is loads of questions back and forth between you and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.750
the developer trying to answer questions

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.360
that should have been fleshed out in the concept stage.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.420
And that is a quick introduction to responsive web design.
