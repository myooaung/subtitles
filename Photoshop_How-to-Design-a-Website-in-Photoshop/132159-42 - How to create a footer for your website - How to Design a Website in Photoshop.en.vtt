00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
In this video, we're going to mock-up our footer.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.715
It's pretty basic, we're going to bring in a group of icons,

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.185
we're going to get our file,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.490
"Place Embedded" and I've got this one called "Icons-social", it's an illustrator file.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.875
I'm going to place this one.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.050
Great, move it down,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.805
I'm going to place it so it lines up with one of the column codes here.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:23.160
Zoom in to double-check,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.665
take it across, hit "Enter" when I'm ready.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.250
I'll zoom out. What I'd like to do is make sure it's in the right place.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.805
I'm going to make sure it's inside my footer box.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.100
Everything else, I'm going to make the same colors as my icon,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.620
so I'm going to find my icons.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.360
I'm going to select icon here.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.560
What I'm going to do is right click it and go to copy layer style.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.955
Go down, find my graphic and my footer.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:50.220
Right-click him and go to the one that says

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.530
"Paste layer style" and it's going to be the same.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.820
Add one last thing to my photo,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to grab the type tool and I'm going to add my copyright.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.550
I'm going to click once and I'm going to paste in my all rights reserved,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.890
pick a font that's a little bit more appropriate for us.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.075
So it's going to be Roboto,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.560
it's going to be medium.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.390
That's going to be quite small, so it's going to be down to 12 pixels.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.820
Great, and that's going to be my footer.
