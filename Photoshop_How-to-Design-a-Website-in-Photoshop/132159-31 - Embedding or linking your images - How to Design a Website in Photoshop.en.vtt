00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In this video, we're going to look at how to bring in images.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.250
Now, there's many ways of bringing in images from different programs.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.920
The easiest ways is to go to File and you've got these

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.800
two: Place Embedded or Place Linked.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.215
Now, we're going to use Place Embedded.

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.960
It's definitely a better way of working when you are

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.485
new to web design or new to designing in Photoshop.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:23.835
Linked files can be quite handy if your file size is getting really high.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:25.500
They don't tend to get super high when you're

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.540
dealing with web design because the resolution is

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.680
not huge and there's not a lot of detail to some of the effects that you're doing.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.910
But let's just have a quick look at the difference.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.535
Go to your Photoshop web exercise files.

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.670
I'm going to open up this one called image books and I'm going to place it in.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.950
He comes in, you get to resize him,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.515
I'm going to leave him exactly how he came in and hit "Return".

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.545
Now, you'll see him in my Layers panel here, he's called image books.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:54.770
What's happened though is that it's being put

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.230
inside this document and will be carried around.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.120
If I send somebody my Photoshop document,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.040
it's going to come along for the ride.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.160
Now, if I do it the other way,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.630
if I go to Place Linked,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.110
what will happen is the image will come in,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.895
it'll look the same, I hit "Enter",

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:10.170
I got two images the same.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.520
You'll see the icon changes,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.125
this one has got a little linking icon.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.580
It just means that if I now send this, say,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.115
to my designer or my web developer to build,

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:21.685
they're not going to have the images unless I send them separately.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.145
I'm going to need that image books.JPEG to send along,

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.210
whereas the embedded one gets stuck in the file and it's a little bit easier to share.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.520
The other problem you need to watch out for linked ones like

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.500
this is if I go to my desktop now and I go and delete image books,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.650
you can see in here, there's a little question mark.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.920
It means that, hey,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.215
I'm freaking out because I've lost that image in here.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:43.520
It'll come up with the error saying,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.380
"I can't find it, I don't know where it is."

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.455
So it is a bit easier at the beginning to use embedded.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.960
The reason you'd use linked images is that if you're using

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.635
that same image over and over again in lots of files.

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:56.420
You don't really want to have lots of copies of it everywhere,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.280
taking up lots of file size.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.510
It also can be we're working on really complex document with lots of embedded images,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.920
it can start running really slow.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.140
If you got a terrible old laptop that you're using,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.895
that's something you might want to consider.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.370
For the moment though, I'm going to delete this layer

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.870
here and leave the one that was embedded.
