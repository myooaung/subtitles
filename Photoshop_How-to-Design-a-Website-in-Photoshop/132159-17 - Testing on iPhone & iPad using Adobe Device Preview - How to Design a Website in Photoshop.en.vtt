00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.080
Adobe Preview or Device Preview is a way of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.965
showing what you're working on on Photoshop directly onto a mobile device,

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.130
either an iPhone or an iPad while you're working.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
This means that you could be making a mock-ups on your computer,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.340
but actually seeing what it looks like on a mobile device.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
Now, this app only works for iPhone and iPad at the moment,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.000
there's no Android equivalent yet and probably won't be,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
but keep checking to see whether Adobe do release anything for Android.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.730
Next thing you need to do is you need to download the app for your iPhone and iPad.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.645
Now, I've got on the iPhone here,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.770
ignore the wallpaper there of my very handsome son.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.605
Once you've done it, you open it up and in there,

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.815
you'll have to sign in with what's called your Adobe ID.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.755
Now, if you don't have an Adobe ID, you probably do,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.105
you just don't know what it is,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:00.340
the way to find out is to go up to here, go up to Help.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.130
I'm in Photoshop, go up to Help and you can see here mine is DANIEL@BRINGYOUROWNLAPTOP.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.735
Now, don't click "Sign Out",

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:11.720
this is just a guide here to know what your email address is for your Adobe ID.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.355
If you can't remember your password,

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:15.425
try using this email address in

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.114
Adobe.com and try and sign in and if you can't remember your password,

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:20.465
click the button that says,

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.310
"Send me out a new password".

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.570
Once you've got that, sign in to your app.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.860
From there, one or two things needs to happen,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.245
you need to either have it connected like I have to your plug,

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:35.375
this is just a plug that comes via charger,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.240
plug it into your computer and use that to connect it up;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.295
or you can use Wi-Fi without the plug.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:44.970
Now, using Wi-Fi just means that this phone

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.400
needs to be connected to the same router that your computer is,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.095
they need to be hooked up to the same network and then it'll work wirelessly.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.970
Now what we need to do, is we need to have our Device Preview open.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.635
You can see it here, this little icon.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.030
If you can't see it there,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.910
it's under Window and it's called Device Preview.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.675
Now if they're both connected up,

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.100
you'll see on your screen,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.530
it will have the name of your phone and on

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.515
your app it'll have here that you're connected.

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:16.040
Next thing to do, is to make sure you have our file open on Photoshop.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.110
I'm going to open up the file that we're going to be

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.335
using or creating during this course,

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:21.870
that is the final version.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.505
You can see here on my phone,

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.425
it's all being displayed.

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:26.940
Now the really nice thing here,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.790
it's that it's usable,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.820
I can scroll through it and see what all the design looks like on this phone.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.955
It's independent of Photoshop.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.430
You can see it's not doing anything,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.055
but it's displaying here.

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:42.555
Now, a really nice thing is that it's dynamic,

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:45.980
which means that when I update something in Photoshop it's going to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.985
instantly update on my phone without me doing anything, so watch this.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:57.380
I've noticed on my phone that both BYOL and the Navigation Bar is quite big,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.040
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it smaller.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.850
I'm going to zoom in on this top part here.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.445
You'll notice if I find my navigation and I make it nice and small,

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:15.370
you'll see if I grab my navigation and I make it a bit smaller, click "Enter",

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.210
you'll notice very quickly that it's updating on the phone,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.250
takes about a second or two, but totally usable.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.460
Same thing with this Bring Your Laptop here, the font is too big.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.820
Grab the Font, make it smaller,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.290
let's turn it down to something like 45,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.880
move along, move around and you'll notice that it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.730
updates as I'm moving around with about a second or two delay.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.530
Let's say the same for this text here.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.650
This white text here looks a little small on my mobile device,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.670
so I'm going to grab the Type Tool,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.104
I'll select it all and I'll move it from 16,

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:56.850
bump it up to say 18 and you'll notice in my phone it'll update automatically.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.235
A couple things you can do with the Device Preview,

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:00.405
is if you click it once,

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.470
at the top here there's a drop down and it means you can

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.870
shuffle through the different art boards you've got.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.280
For me it's not that useful because I've got the different Artboards

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.645
are tablet and desktop and it's interesting to see it down on the slides,

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:14.415
but not really going to help me my workflow.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:18.025
What was really good for, is say you're developing an app or say you're at

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:21.180
that concept stage for mobile and you've got a couple of different versions.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.200
That means you can toggle through and click

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.965
the different Artboards to see them in comparison to each other.

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:29.470
One thing to note as well, is that you don't actually have to have

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.320
Artboard set up in Photoshop for this to work,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.175
you can open up any old file and it will load up in the app.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.640
Now, I'm the first one in when there's

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.620
any tech that connects my phone and my computer and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.290
does demoing and stuff and often they don't work very

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.130
well and I'll struggle along with them for quite a bit of time,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.930
but this particular one,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.075
Adobe Preview is brilliant.

00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:53.190
It works, it's quick,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.140
and it really does help my workflow.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.515
Now, if you're designing for mobile and tablet,

00:04:57.515 --> 00:05:00.710
now you should be using something like this throughout

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.430
your build because so many designers wait till right at the end,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.170
so the website is actually built before they really get down and

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.050
test what it's going to do on mobile and tablet,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.510
and that's far too far along the design process to be doing something like that.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.430
Be testing, have it open,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.360
have it on the whole time so you can see and review as you go along.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.720
Now, probably the most important thing to remember when using

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.425
Adobe Preview is to make sure that you connect up a couple of phones,

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:28.725
a couple of iPads,

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:33.680
you pin them all around your screen here to make it look like you're super

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.720
important and also it'll look like you're working on the Minority Report,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.850
like Tom Cruise, moving things around,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.255
swiping them around and it'll totally impress your colleagues.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:47.460
All right, that's it for Adobe Preview.
