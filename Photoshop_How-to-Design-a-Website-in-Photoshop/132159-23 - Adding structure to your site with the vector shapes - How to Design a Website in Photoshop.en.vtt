00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
All right, in this tutorial we're going to mock up some of

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.260
the big kind of structured areas using the rectangle tool.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.050
The rectangle tool, for the people that are web designers,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.990
know that it creates essentially div tags that you can

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.350
pull the style and size and colors and things from later on.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.990
You've got to make sure you're using this rectangle tool here.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.005
If you can't find the rectangle tool, click, hold,

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.395
drag it down and you might find the last two U using the ellipse tool,

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:26.360
you might have to hold it down and grab the Rectangle tool.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.575
What we're going to do, is if you're following along using my template,

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.090
I'm going to, there's an option here,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.140
it says called Delete Me.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.410
I am going to actually delete that because it gets rid of these little green boxes.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.420
That's my little advertising bits there.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.390
I'm going to bin him and I'm going to zoom in a little bit,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.490
command plus and I'm going to zoom in so I can see the edges of my desktop view.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.935
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to start creating.

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:50.740
Okay. So my first box is going to be

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.355
my big kind of main hero image and I'm going to use this purple here,

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.085
so I'm going to click that or pick it from this swatches panel,

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:58.810
and I'm going to click hold and drag.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.675
What you'll notice is that I can drag over the edges,

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.595
it's my problem and at rest, the edges there.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.975
If yours is got the wrong color like mine has,

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.250
its remembered the last color even though my foreground color

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.590
says be this lovely new Bring Your Own Laptop Purple.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.030
What you can do is, just click on it again and it will draw and change,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.360
or if I go to undo,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.340
I can click up here and pick the color from my swatches panel.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.320
Great. That's going to be my big kind of hero graphic image.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.360
What am going to do now,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.070
is I'm going to add my nav bar.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.140
So I'll use the rectangle tool again and I'm going to click

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.785
hold and drag over the top here and I'm guessing a little bit.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:35.555
This is going to be my navigation bar.

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.700
What I want to do is fill it with black.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.965
Black is somewhere in the top of your swatches here and or you can use it from up here.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.565
I'll pick this as my foreground color.

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:48.950
Great, so that's going to be my navigation panel.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.945
What we're going to do in the end, is we're going to have an image

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:53.330
underneath the navigation that we can still see.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.225
What we're going to do is, we're going to have this nav bar selected.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:57.530
The way I know it's selected,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.725
I can see it here in my layers part.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:04.535
What I'm going to do is double-click the word rectangle and call this one, nav bar.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:09.510
I'll call this one here, Hero Graphic.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.100
On the nav bar here, I've got this one called opacity.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.095
If I lower the opacity a little bit,

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:20.300
I'm maybe down to about 80%.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.040
What you'll notice, is that if I lower it right down,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.380
can you see it's actually quite transparent over the top of

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.295
the background and that's up to you and how much see through you want it to be.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.910
We'll change it probably later on when we get our image underneath,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.490
but for the moment, that's how you change the opacity of any of your rectangles.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.715
Next thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to shuffle across here.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:41.390
For this tutorial, we're going to skip tablet just so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.420
that the tutorial's not 10 hours long.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.975
I'm going to do a mobile version.

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:49.790
On mobile, how I know am on mobile,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.735
you can see him here in my layers panel,

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.070
is the extra small version.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.765
I'm going to go into this and delete where my name and my website is,

00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:58.565
delete that, we don't need that.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.740
What we're going to do though is we're going to zoom out.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.095
So I'm going to close that, pop it in, zoom out a little bit.

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:06.440
What I want to do is take these rectangles and move them across.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.620
I'm going to switch to my move tool.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.310
I'm going to use my trick we learned in early video,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.330
about holding the command down.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.875
I'm going to click the rectangle which is my nav bar and I'm going to

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:20.060
drag it across holding the O key and what the O key member dragging that will do,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.340
is it will make a copy as it moves across.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.380
To get it in the right function and the right bit,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.225
you might have to give a little wiggle but it looks like it's perfectly lined up.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.460
Correct. I'm going to move this one across as well

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.295
so this purple one here holding [inaudible] key down.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.800
It's selected the hero graphic.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.795
Hold the O key and drag it across and I'm going to move it so it lines up perfectly.

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:48.200
Great. Got a slight problem where the hero graphic is above the nav bar.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.480
All we need to do is, to change the order of this as

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.420
click Hold and Drag the hero underneath the Nav.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.600
Okay, so I've got my desktop and my mobile view with my two rectangles.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.070
These rectangles are going to be used as the structure or the div tags for my website.
