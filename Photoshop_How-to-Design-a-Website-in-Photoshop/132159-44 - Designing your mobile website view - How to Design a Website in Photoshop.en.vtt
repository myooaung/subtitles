00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, we're going to look at mobile design.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
Probably the most important part when looking at building

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.885
a mobile site is probably the navigation, how you get around.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:11.070
Because of the limited space,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.160
you can't have that big menus like we have on our desktop view.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.155
Knowing which one to pick can be difficult.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.650
A really good site here is this exisweb.net site.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.270
It's an incredibly long link,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.490
so use the link on the screen now to go and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.905
find all the different useful links everywhere.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.635
Now, we're not going to have a chance to go through them because there are

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.590
so many different ways of considering mobile menus.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.510
But let's look at the main groups.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.350
This one here, where we've got this thing called the burger or the sandwich.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.680
The sandwich or the three horizontal lines, whatever you want to call it.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
This thing here clicks and the whole site shifts to the right,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.125
and this menu appears.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.000
There's another option here where they stack.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.055
You can see here,

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.375
this is the desktop view,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:51.814
but when it gets to mobile,

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:56.060
they stack as nice big buttons on top of each other with some other ones.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.760
This one here I like, just the burger by itself when it clicks,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.680
there's a drop-down menu from it.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.630
There are lots of different options.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.330
Have a look through the site, there's a crazy amount to pick from.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.955
They're all flavors of a similar thing.

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:11.950
The big thing to decide is whether you're going to burger or no burger.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.160
Like Smashing Magazine, we looked at this earlier.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.735
Watch this, if I collapse this down,

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:16.995
they've decided no burger,

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:19.040
they've got this word "menu" and that's totally cool.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.960
But you can see even in my Chrome plug-in, I've used the burger.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.350
Let's do a little stunt.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.440
It may be a fad.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.150
I think it's probably around to stay.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.895
It's a nice new icon for mobile menus. Let's go and build one.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:33.720
What we're going to do is we're going to start with the mobile site.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020
So we're going to get start at building a couple of parts of it,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.880
dragging parts of the desktop across,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.170
and then rebuild the menu.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.225
The things I want to start with is the navigation here and hero box.

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:47.175
I've selected both of these by holding

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:50.085
Command and clicking both of them or Control on a PC.

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:51.390
What I'm going to do is click,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.745
hold and drag, but holding on the O key first,

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.965
click and hold and drag, move it across,

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:59.220
get it same to this over here.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.365
Line it up. You'll notice that they've all move to my mobile version.

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.465
I'm going to zoom in. There's lot of work to fix it up.

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:08.355
So I'm going to zoom in a bit.

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:10.880
What I want to do is I'm going to have to use this.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.705
So I'm going to go to my navigation box and the bring your own laptop logo.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:15.770
I'm going to move across.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.330
I can't see it because it's over this side here.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.760
But I know if I hold Shift and drag it across,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.805
it'll move along in a nice, perfect line.

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:23.400
It goes perfect.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.730
My hero box needs to come up a little bit.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.005
Lovely. Bring your laptop, it's going to be there.

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.120
I'm going to move it up to be centered.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.100
This navigation though, is going to disappear,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.990
because services just doesn't fit.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.030
So I'm going to turn that off.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.870
I'm going to draw my three horizontal lines.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.480
It's really easy. Just use the Rectangle tool.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.450
Make sure your fill is set to white.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.495
I'm going to have my stroke set to none,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.455
and I'm going to draw.

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:49.175
You could do it with a Line tool as well if you wanted to do it,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.650
I find it's just easy enough to use the Rectangle tool,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.910
I make them feel like lines.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.385
It's a bit big, so I'm going to zoom in.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.820
You find if you're nice and close when you're working on,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.710
it becomes a little easier to work with.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.710
If I'm far out and I'm dragging these lines around,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.515
they seem to snap, but it's a lot easy when close in.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:10.010
I'm going to hold down Alt and draw my burger.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.350
You can see here my smart guide is telling me that it's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.170
matching the distance away from that top one, from the bottom one.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.955
Great. Now, the burger is quite big.

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:18.530
So I'm going to select all of them,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.155
transform them, and scale them down a little bit,

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:22.580
maybe make them a little shorter.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.965
So that's my mobile burger menu.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.215
Great. What I'd like to do is when that button is clicked,

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:30.920
I'd like to overlay all of the stuff here with a new div tag up there.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.480
I'm going to use the Rectangle tool,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.225
and I'm going to draw a nice big rectangle for my menu,

00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:41.430
and I'm going to put it inside. I'm going to give it a color.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.760
I'm going to use purple. Now, I'm going to use a little bit of transparency.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.770
There's no reason you have to, it just looks cool.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.130
So I'm going to change it down to 90 percent just so you can faintly aware,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.570
see the stuff behind it,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.690
so when it slides down you know that it can be

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.795
potentially slide backup and it's not a new page.

00:03:56.795 --> 00:03:58.610
Let's look at doing some naming.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.550
Let's put my bring your laptop in the navigation menu.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.505
This one is going to be box navigation.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:07.030
What I'm going to do is I'm going to start a second one.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.305
This one's going to be called mobile Dropdown.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:15.675
I'm going to keep everything separate.

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:17.250
I'm going to grab the Rectangle tool.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.525
Is that my rectangle? That's up. I put him in there.

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:24.360
I'm going to grab these three guys.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.280
These guys here are my burger menu.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.325
What I'm going to do is group them together or link them.

00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:31.590
The easy way to do that is to right-click

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.700
them and convert them into what's called a smart object.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.890
Then I'll rename it, I'm going to call it Burger Menu.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.320
I'm going to slide that up into Mobile Dropdown.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.570
Great. Now, I've got that, I got that.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.400
What I'm going to do now is I'm

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.650
going to switch out my Burger Menu so I'm going to have two.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.775
So this is Burger Menu Inactive,

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:53.155
and I'm going to have a second one,

00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:55.450
which is going to be my Burger Menu Active.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.835
Because what I want to do is do what I've done in this site here.

00:04:58.835 --> 00:05:01.460
If I scale this down.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.080
This is what I've done on my New Zealand site, where I got my burger,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.420
and I click it and there's a little cross to know that you can click

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.230
it and close it afterwards. So let's switch back to that.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.970
Or to create it, I could use a few different tricks.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.960
The easiest way I find to get a perfect cross is click once. Have a plus.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.790
I don't use X because they look like Xs they don't look like a cross.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.295
What I want is a plus on its side,

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.945
so I'm going to use plus.

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:36.080
Some fonts don't look great using this technique because they're quite stylized pluses,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.075
so Arial Regular is great for this one.

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:39.500
What I want to do is transform it.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.995
So I'm going to use my Command-T or Control-T on a PC.

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:44.630
I'm going to rotate it around, say,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.210
45 degrees. Click "Apply".

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.755
It looks like a nice, good cross.

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:52.125
I'm going to scale it up a little bit, Control-T,

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.980
make it a little bit bigger just to match my navigation burger.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.525
Cool. I'm going to copy that and I'm going to paste that here.

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:06.165
He is going to be active.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.680
What's going to happen is that's going to turn

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.100
off and they're going to switch between each other.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.670
Actually, what I might do to make it clearer for

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.070
the web designer is that I'm going to put

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.670
the Burger Menu in the actual navigation itself so when

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.670
people turn that on and off it's behind there and this guy's at the front.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.700
Next thing I need to do is add the ticks.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.260
So I'm going to grab my Type tool,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.000
and I'm going to click and drag a box out,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.145
and I'm going to type in my bit.

00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:33.340
It's going to be SERVICES, I'm going to do it in caps.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.825
I'm going to do PORTFOLIO,

00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:37.980
I'm going to do TEAM,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.450
and I'm going to do CONTACT.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.660
I'm going to select them all,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.835
change the font, dragging it down.

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.085
I'm going to use my Roboto.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:49.830
I'm going to use Roboto Light.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.820
Now, what you want to do is make sure that there's enough space between these words.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.340
You don't want to have people clicking one and then inadvertently clicking the other.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.320
So a good bit of line spacing is great.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.365
Mine's got it by default because I've been playing around with it already.

00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:05.600
If you grab the Type tool and select everything,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.430
what you want to be looking for is,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.100
let's click on this icon here,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.470
bring out your Character panel.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.010
This option here, yours is probably set to Auto, which is 28.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.955
It's probably going to be about 30 in terms of the line spacing.

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:20.405
I'm going to crank mine up to about 60.

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.040
Depending on the font size you're using,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.290
what kind of font, it's up to you.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.480
Now, that's going to work for me.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.810
Actually, maybe even a little bit bigger up to 70.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.625
Just so there's a nice big gap between them,

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:39.240
so that big fat fingers can click on them really easily.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.990
This is going to be my Nav dropdown.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.100
Lovely. That's going to be my dropdown navigation.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.310
Now I need to go through and transfer

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.250
all the things that I've been doing on desktop and make them work on mobile.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.330
We'll do that in the next video.
