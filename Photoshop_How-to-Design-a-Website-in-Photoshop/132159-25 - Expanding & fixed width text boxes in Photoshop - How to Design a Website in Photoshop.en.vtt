00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
In this video, we're going to look at type or text.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.170
First thing we need to do is grab

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.700
the Type tool and then we're going to look out for a couple of things.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.385
There's some shapes that the cursor can change into that you want to be aware of.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.790
By default, it's this square here, and that is great.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.520
Watch what happens to the cursor changes when I get in

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.250
front of this box because I have the hieroglyphic selected here,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.110
it changes to the circle around it.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.240
This other one, which is the dotted line.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.175
Now, this is really what I'm looking for.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:31.575
I want to dump a bit of ticks on a layer by itself that I can move around and work on.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.140
If I click on this "Layer", what it's going to do is,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.970
it's going to turn my rectangle,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.800
my hieroglyphic, into a shape box for it to fit inside. Watch this.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.725
If I click "Inside", it's going to keep typing,

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.930
and it's going to use the edges of this box,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.150
which can be a little confusing when you're new.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.830
To get out that I'm going to hit "Escape".

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.090
That'll get rid of my text.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.025
So what I want to do is either have something else selected, like the Nav Bar,

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.480
then it's nothing selected or just type

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.850
the type lower and move it in when you're finished.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.840
So what I'm going to do is just have the overall art board

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.165
selected and that'll let me type anywhere using the square cursor,

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.135
and I'm going to show you two ways of applying text.

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:10.105
One is an expandable text box and one is a fixed width.

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:12.860
So expandable means that I can type something and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.665
you'll see that it keeps on going forever.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.830
It will just keep stretching off to the right there.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.675
Now, another way of doing it,

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm going to hit "Escape" on my keyboard,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.435
gets rid of that text and is to click "Hold" and drag of that text.

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.915
What that means is that it'll fix width.

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:30.030
That means that when I get to the edge,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.765
it will break onto two lines or as many lines that will fit.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:38.795
So this is the two boxes we're going to use when we're working with Photoshop.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.300
So the first one we're going to do is, I'm going to hit "Escape" again.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.250
I'm going to click once and I'm going to type in our logo.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.525
That's going to be capital B-Y-O-L.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:49.055
I'm going to move it using my move tool into the Nav Bar here.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.990
If you're finding its hidden where you can't see it,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.960
it's probably because it's on a lower layer.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.040
To move the layers, you click "Hold" and drag it above to where you need it to be.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.760
To change the font, it's nice and easy.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.050
Make sure you're on the Type tool.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.230
Make sure you're on your Type Layer and play around with the fonts in here.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.095
Now, if yours is not set to pixels and set to points,

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:08.420
you might need to go and change that in your preferences,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.935
which is in an earlier video.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.570
So there's two ways of doing it.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.850
You can use the drop-down and pick some of these sizes.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.170
Now, I find quite useful is actually dragging this one here,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.300
can you see if I hover above this icon here, click it,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.070
drag it right or left,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.205
you can see the font changes depending on where you dragging.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.230
Right to go higher, left to go lower.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.940
Let's say I'm going to pick 40 for the moment, you can type it in.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.445
So let's say, I pick 40 pixels in the moment,

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.710
and I'm going to use the move tool and move it in here.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.105
To change the color of the text,

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:39.770
I'm going to make sure I'm on my Type tool,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.170
I make sure I'm on my layer I've got selected,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.565
here's my type layer,

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.845
and up here is where the font color is.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.970
I click this, I'm going to click "Hold" and drag this around to pick the color I want.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.550
I want white, so I'm going to drag it all the way into the top left corner,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.470
you can see I dragged it past where it needs to go,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.880
so it gets more joined up in the corner there.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.610
Definitely set to white, fff. Click "Okay".

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.070
If you want to use one of your special swatches,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.360
what you do is you click on this and over here you can see the eyedropper

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.935
appears and he will pick the color that you need from the swatches.

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.620
I'm going to go back and pick white and click "Okay".
