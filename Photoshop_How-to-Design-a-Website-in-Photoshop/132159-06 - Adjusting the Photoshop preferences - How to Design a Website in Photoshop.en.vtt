00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.110
Hi. In this video we're going to look at changing your preferences to work with web.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.420
Now, by default Photoshop comes out of

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.540
the box ready to do a lot more print orientated work.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.825
What we need to do is go into our Preferences and change it for web.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:17.020
Now, first thing we're going to do is turn on our Rulers.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.375
We're going to go to View, and down to Rulers.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:24.925
What that'll do is it'll show me how wide this document is.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.635
Mine is set to centimeters,

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:30.370
because I'm in Europe and yours will be set to inches if you're in America.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.540
Now, what's happening here is you can see it's hanging about 16 centimeters.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.830
Now when we're dealing with web,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.810
we don't want to know what the centimeter value is,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.610
we want to know what the pixels are.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.545
We need to change this unit of measurement to pixels.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:45.050
To do that, we'll go up to, on a Mac,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.760
go to Photoshop CC,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.945
go to Preferences, and go to one that says Units & Rulers.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.550
Now, if you're on a PC,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.125
it's in a slightly different place.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.520
You go to Edit, then right down at the bottom here,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.184
there would be one that says Preferences,

00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:00.690
and then you go to Units & Rulers.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.585
Whichever one, let's make it to units and rulers.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.860
What we want to do is,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.650
mine is set to centimeters, yours might be set to inches or millimeters.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.130
Let's change the rulers to pixels.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.700
The other thing we need to change is the type.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.420
Type uses points typically when we're dealing with print.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.200
But what we want to do is we want to switch now to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.020
pixels because that's the measurement we use dealing with web.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.645
When I click "Okay" you'll notice that it's now roughly about 1,200 pixels wide.

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:28.655
When I go to the Type tool, which is this T here,

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.690
you'll notice that I'm dealing with pixels instead of points.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.190
One thing to note is that if you're a person that is moving from print to web,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.650
you're going to have to go back and change those provinces every

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.380
time you want to work on a different type of document.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.850
To do it on a Mac,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.415
we're going to go to Photoshop down to Preferences,

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:48.830
and go down to Units & Rulers, remember if you're a PC,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.675
it's under Edit, Preferences, Units & Rulers,

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:55.250
and you're going to put it back to either inches or centimeters,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.410
and type goes back to points.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.830
But of a pain, but that's what we have to do.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.970
I'm going to click "Cancel" because I want to leave it,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.190
as it was, set to pixels.
