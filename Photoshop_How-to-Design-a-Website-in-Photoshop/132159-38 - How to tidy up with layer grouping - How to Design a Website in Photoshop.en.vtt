00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
In this video, we're going to look at using Layers.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.165
Now, I'll document slowly what's surely becoming into a crazy mess of things everywhere.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:10.995
It's going to be little a little hard to work with,

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.900
especially if we send it to somebody who's,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.210
say, we're designing it and we're sending it to somebody,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.010
say, is a developer and doesn't use Photoshop very much and has to work with it,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.315
it can be really complicated for them to use.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.590
It's even becoming a little bit too complicated for us to use.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.060
What we're going to use is something called Layer Groups.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.850
Now, Layer Groups is a way of just grouping everything together,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.150
and it makes our Layers look a little tidier.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.380
What we'll do is we'll start with our group of our Navigation.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.660
There's a couple of tricks we can use to find everything.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.390
What I wanted to do is actually let's use this hero box here.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.645
I'm going to use a little trick. Turn on the "Auto-select".

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.390
Auto-select allows us to do is drag a box around everything here,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.440
and it will select everything it can underneath that little dotted line.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.840
You'll notice in my Layers panel here, right in the bottom here,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.915
it's picked everything that it found hidden in that Layer.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:03.050
Turn "Auto-select" off and give it

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.420
a wiggle just to make sure it's got everything we need and nothing it doesn't.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.730
Then I'm going to go to Edit, Undo or Edit,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.960
Step Backwards and put it back where it was.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.655
Now I know it's all in the right place.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.480
All you do is click this "Group" button.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.225
Photoshop is pretty clever,

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:20.585
and it sticks them all in a nice little Group.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.655
The Group's ended up above our Navigation,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.320
but that's something we can fix afterwards.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.080
We call this one Box Hero.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.370
That's this one. I'll turn it off at the moment.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.160
The next thing I'm going to do is select the Navigation.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.735
I'm going to turn my "Auto-select" on,

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:38.200
grab everything along here,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.135
and you'll see it's picked these three elements here, which is perfect.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.985
If I go "Auto-Select" off and give it a wiggle,

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:48.460
just to make sure it's got everything I want and nothing I don't. Hit the "Group" button.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.215
Let's call this one Box Navigation.

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:55.635
I'm going to drag him above this guy.

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:58.110
I dragged him into it. So be careful when you're dragging.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.200
I drag this, can you see the little line running around the outside?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.465
That's going to drag it inside my Hero Box.

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:05.985
What I want to do is actually drag above, and you'll see the difference.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.820
You see that little line that appears between them rather than over them?

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.690
That will mean it's just above.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.430
I'm going to turn both of these off.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.900
Now I'm going to grab my tool again,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.310
select both of these guys.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.410
It's picked everything I need. Group them.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.075
This one's going to be called Box,

00:02:21.075 --> 00:02:24.885
and this one was our Who We Are box.

00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:27.885
I'm going to turn them off now. We'll turn that one off.

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:30.720
Now we're up to Our Services page.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.730
I'm going to grab the same tool,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.265
Auto-select on, select them all.

00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:37.700
I like to turn them off. Give it a wiggle.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.630
Make sure they're all what we've got selected, nothing we don't.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.030
Then group them.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.710
This one is our Box Services.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.345
Auto-select on, grab all of these guys, and then group.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:54.180
Let's call this one Box,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.440
and this one is going to be,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.570
Portfolio. Turn this one off.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.830
This is our Teams one.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.810
So all of these on. Turn it off.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.335
A good wiggle. We're going to group this one together.

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.780
This one is going to be called Team Box.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.000
Team, great. Turn that one off,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.300
and we're down to nothing really else.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.790
We've got our Contact Form and Footer.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.320
What we'll do is we may as well put those into group, this one here.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.920
If it doesn't end up in the Group,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.165
what you can do is click hold and drag it into the Group, like I did there.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:31.840
This one's going to be called Box Contact Form.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.760
This last one, we'll put it in here.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.560
We'll drag it inside.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380
This one is going to be called Box, and this is going to called,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.200
Footer. Turn all these up.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.970
Using the Layers, turn them off.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.385
You'll see this guy, a little lone ranger here,

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:48.900
who's a Type Layer,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.015
but he is called Layer 1.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:52.980
If there's a Type Layer and it's called Layer 1,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.245
it means there's a Type Layer with no type on it.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:58.100
So actually, this thing has no purpose in the world.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.035
It's something that I've started to type,

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.975
and I've not got around to doing it and forgotten about and left it there.

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.910
This guy here's a lone ranger,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.085
so he doesn't appear anywhere on this.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:08.675
If it has a word in here,

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:12.640
it'll be a word somewhere hidden on your document that you need to go find.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.970
In this case, I'm going to delete it. Click "Delete".

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.200
You can see now that I've gone through and grouped everything,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.220
it becomes a lot easier to work with,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.530
especially when we start doing our mobile design.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.750
I can turn everything on,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.030
and what I might have to do is play around with the Layer

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.045
order depending on which Layers they're on.

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.385
I'm going to turn my helpful column guides off.

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:35.940
But everything else is stacked up nicely on top of each other, and we're ready to go.
