00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
When you're working with a responsive layout in Photoshop,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:07.440
I used the term column grids and guides a lot interchangeably.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.750
Because the overall term is called a grid,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.020
but really when you're looking at them, they're just columns.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.205
To define those columns in Photoshop, we use guides.

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:18.160
Confusing? Yes, kind of. All right.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.290
Let's have a look at the finished version of this one.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.010
You can see here, these little blue lines,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.980
these light blue lines are guides and they

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.355
help me make up my columns in my responsive layout.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.655
If I go back to my empty document,

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:33.005
how to make a guide?

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.120
How do you make your own guide? Just go to View,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.585
and you got to make sure something called the rulers is turned on.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.530
What you'll notice is, on the sides here,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.930
the top and the bottom, that these little rulers are repeated.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.240
What we can do is anywhere in this area,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.380
here we can click hold,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.730
drag, drag, drag, drag, drag.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.220
That would dump a guide on our layout.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.365
We jump once from the top as well.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:55.730
What will happen is when you're working with the downloaded template that I've given you,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.795
is that you might need to move them or turn them off or lock them. Let's look at that.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.500
By default, your template is probably locked.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.935
The guides on your template is probably locked.

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.595
That's because I didn't want you to go and wreck the guides.

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.430
But if you want to move them around or lock them or unlock them,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.530
go to View, get onto Lock Guides.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.340
What that means is that I won't be able to move these.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.080
I won't be able to move them much.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.255
They are all stuck there.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.645
If I want to unlock them, I untick this.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:25.700
Then because it changes a little bit,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.380
and I can move them around afterwards.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.150
Say there's a guide that I don't need anymore.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.830
What you can do is you can select it.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.800
To delete it, you click hold and drag it.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.395
You just drag it back into the ruler where you got it and it disappears forever.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.310
I'm going to delete that one and go back over there.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.180
When you are working though, you'll notice on,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.530
say this one here, those guides can be quite distracting.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.900
Helpful when you're first laying out,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.625
but quite distracting later on.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:48.710
What you can do is turn them on and off.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.825
Go to View, there's one under Show,

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.270
and it's this one here called Guides.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.460
Now, you see this [inaudible] here, it's Command and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.430
Semicolon or Control Semicolon on a PC.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.855
[inaudible] quite a bit.

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.375
When I'm working, I'm heading Command Semicolon

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.940
on and off to turn them on and off when I'm working,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.905
because it's a lot easier to see and get a bit of a visual going without the guides.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:11.630
But structurally, the guides go out full.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.040
This will [inaudible] on how to create,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.870
modify, and delete guides.
