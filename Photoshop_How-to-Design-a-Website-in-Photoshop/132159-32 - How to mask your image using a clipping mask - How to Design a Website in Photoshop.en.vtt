00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
In this video, we're going to look at how to use a clipping mask.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.160
Now, a clipping mask is a really great way of cropping an image down to use.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.050
Let's see what that final product is going to look like.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.265
It's the square image here.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.790
I'm going to show you how to do that with what's called a clipping mask.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.565
First thing is let's turn this eyeball off on our image books layer,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.400
and what we do is we start with a rectangle.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.845
I'm going to turn my guides back on, Command Colon.

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.175
I want it to span,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.650
say four guides here.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.105
I want to be a perfect square,

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.450
so what I do is I hold down Shift while I'm dragging it,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.495
and can you see it locks the height and width along.

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.030
I'm going to drag it so it fits across these four.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.640
Now, it doesn't really matter what color we're going to use at the moment,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.335
because clipping mask don't matter that much.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:44.765
I'm going to use my Move tool and I'm going to move it down a little bit.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:46.670
It's in the center of my box,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.140
and what I want to do now is,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm going to pop it in and I'm going to turn my image back on.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.530
Now, my image needs to be a bit more of an appropriate size for this square.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.420
With a Layer Selector, I'm going to use my Transform Tool, Command T. Well,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.360
Control T on a PC and I'm going to holding the Shift Key down on the corners,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.485
to lock the height and width.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:09.990
Otherwise, it ends up stretching it and distorting it.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.255
I'm going to use the Shift Key down.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.720
I'm not too worried that it's going to be perfect around here,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.475
I'm going to cropping it in for effect.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.785
I'm going to Enter when its transform is done.

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.280
What I need to do is I need to make sure that the image is above my rectangle.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.935
I'm going to rename this rectangle and let's call this ones the Who- Image,

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.890
so my Who Yeah Page.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.865
This underneath, now what I want to do is crop this guy,

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:40.010
which is the image about the books to the square.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.690
To do it, the easy way is with the image layer selected,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.765
hold on the Alt key.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.090
Can you see this little icon here with the box with the arrow?

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.730
This is going to turn top image and bottom image,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.950
and join them together and make a clipping mask.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.590
You can see what happened in the structure here in the layers,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.620
and you can see what's happened over here in my actual image.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.170
I'm going to turn my guides off to make it pretty.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.125
The beauty of that is that this Who box underneath here and this image,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.735
they're actually separate so I can move them around.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:12.170
What I can do is, let's say that the box I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.650
want to crop slightly differently and I haven't selected here. Watch this.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.080
With my Move tool, I can move it around and you see I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.765
can move it around and adjust. It's like a little window.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.630
Likewise, the image underneath can be moved around,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.345
the box around can be moved around to find where we need to go.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.950
Now, what you want to be careful of is,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.390
if you want to move them both together,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.225
you need to hold Command down and click them both.

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:33.875
With them both selected,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:35.165
I can move them around.

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.330
Now, if you want to move them around permanently together,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.345
well, now I'll have to select them both.

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:42.620
Is you can right-click these two.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.455
After the selected and there's one in here this is Link Layers.

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:48.185
You see this linking icon appears,

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:49.910
just means that if I have,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.530
say my background back selected,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.050
and then go back and click just one of these two guys,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.520
you can see just one of them selected,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.095
they both come along for the ride, because the have been linked.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.985
If you need to un-link them, right-click them,

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.835
and there's one here that says, Unlink Layers.

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:05.440
I'll leave my link for the moment.
