00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
All right, in this last little bit we're going to tidy up.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.840
One last little missing bit is that up here,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.020
I haven't put in my type yet for the who we are,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.310
so I'm going to do that.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.720
I've got my type tool,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.580
and I'll make sure I'm in the right box as well.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.855
At the moment, I need to be in the one that says Who.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.990
Once selected, if I click once,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.800
you'll notice that my typing's up inside of it,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.390
it's a good starting point at least.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.060
Okay, this one's going to be who we are.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.025
I'm going to pick Text.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:33.990
I'm going to use my Roboto,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.385
but I'm going to use Slab,

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:36.975
and use my Bolds.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.360
It's going to be white, size-wise,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.740
that's going to work for me, my move tool,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.825
move them across, undo.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:50.220
I wanted to move them across an add my "Lorem ipsum."

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.825
So I'm going to click hold and drag.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:53.160
This one is going to go out,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.215
I think, in the last column here,

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:58.170
and let's go to Type,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.300
and I'm going to go Paste "Lorem ipsum".

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.830
The fonts obviously really big,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.340
when I use four clicks and turn it down to more manageable size of maybe 14 pixels.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.839
I'm going to make left lines,

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.550
I'm going to pick Roboto,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.440
I'm going to use Regular.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.735
Choose lighten this case.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:20.250
Great, and that going to be it for this one.
