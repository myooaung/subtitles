00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
One of the other nice things you can do when you are working with your Layers panel,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.120
and you're trying to get things ready to send out to your designer or developer,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.490
you might find lots of times where you've got lots of things called as rectangle

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.060
one or type one or box two and they're not really that useful for the developer.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.225
But what you can do is let's go down to

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:26.670
our icons which is our services. I'm going to open that up.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.870
Say you want to start naming these,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.740
say icon one, three, and two.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.235
It is a video, photography, and our app.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.940
We'll go down and do the last one down here.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.555
Actually we'll drag him out for the moment.

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:40.040
Let's get him up to be with his friends.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.500
What we came do is a nice little option for naming things.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.330
Otherwise, you can double-click everything to get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.250
into it and you can spend ages doing it.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.670
The way to do this is to tab between them.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.850
I'm going to double-click this one,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.540
I'm going to call this one icon hyphen and I'm going to call this one video.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.235
I'm going to tab down,

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.750
you can see icon photography.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.640
Rather than having to click on every single one to get it to work,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.665
you can just tab between them, okay?

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.150
Icon hyphen.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.350
This one's going to be called app,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.350
and this one's going to be called Icon hyphen print.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.710
All right. Nice little shortcut for naming your Layers.
