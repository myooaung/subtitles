00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
In this video, we're going to look at how to make a background image.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.940
Now, background images tend to be quite washed out or darkened.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.605
At the moment it's quite stylish,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.540
and they seem to fill the whole background using

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.175
100 percent stretching and covering CSS. Let's look at doing that.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.480
I'm going to turn off my guides,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.895
I'm going to go to File, Place Embedded,

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:24.090
under our PS Web Exercise Files,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.695
find the one that says,

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.650
background-brick-building and bring that one.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.660
Now in terms of the size-wise,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.780
it's going to fit, but it's not quite big enough.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.040
What I'm going to do is I'm going to scale it up.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.850
Scaling it up in Photoshop is a terrible thing to do.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.525
But I'm going to show you a couple of techniques to hide if it does not speculating.

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:44.600
This one's not because it's a reasonably good image and it's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.630
scaling up more at about 120 percent,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.650
so it's going to be okay.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.090
I'm going to click Enter.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.790
Next thing I want to do is I want to clip it,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
so that it's being clipped to this purple box here.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.785
I'm going to overlay that one there,

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:02.850
and I'm going to find my background's called the Hero image.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.975
What I'm going to have to do, is drag it so it's above

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:08.615
this box here called Box-Hero Graphic.

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm going to drag it down, scale, scale.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.835
Now what you will find is that it can be a bit of a pain to get it to the right part.

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.810
What you can do is you can collapse these one here,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.945
like this library, I haven't used that for a while.

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.745
I'm going to double-click the tab Libraries,

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.545
I'm going to double-click the type Swatches,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.570
just that my layers are nice and big.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.330
I can work on them and it's easier to drag them around.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.335
My background-brick-building is above my box here on graphic,

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:38.280
and then I'm going to hold down the Option key on a Mac or Alt key on a PC to crop it in.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060
What I'd like to do is, well is actually before I do that,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.370
I'm going to undo that, so it is a step backwards.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm going to turn off this layer,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.430
and instead of this being purple,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.775
what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it black.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.260
With this selected, I'm going to go to this panel here's called the Properties,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.950
and I'm going to select black from my colors.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.480
I'm going to do this because when I turn this one on,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.459
I'm going to make it actually a little bit transparent,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.070
so it starts to show the color underneath.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.795
Earlier when we did clipping videos,

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.675
I said it doesn't matter what color

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.340
the boxes because you're going to use

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.560
an image on top to clip it. It doesn't really matter.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.710
In this case, it is because I'm going to make this slightly transparent.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.860
I'm going to hold down Alt or Option,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.210
and it's going to crop to this graphic here.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.455
This box here, our graphic lab.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:26.455
What I'd like to do though is make this one slightly transparent.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.570
Turn the transparency down until it gets to a point where I can

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.125
start to see the tics quite clearly above it.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.940
It's up to you, and it's going to depend on the image

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.695
you used and how opaque you make it,

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:40.190
but just make sure the graphic color underneath it is nice solid black,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.460
and it's going to show it through.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.535
Obviously, you get down to zero.

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:45.845
The image is completely see through and we see the box underneath it,

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.430
so I'm going to clip it up so it's still visible.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.090
What I also want to do to make that background more awesome,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.630
is I'd like to make it a little bit blurry.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.475
There's lots of different ways of blurring the background, because I don't want to,

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:03.530
I like the effect of seeing the old brick building in the background,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.960
but I don't want to actually be able to read grains seeds.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.925
What I want to do is use Filter.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.890
There's lots of things under Blur.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.050
There's whole Blur Gallery and there's another Blur Gallery.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.485
There's lots of them. Gaussian blurs are really popular one.

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.990
I like to use this one now called Field Blur.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.555
I like Field Blur mainly because it allows me to blur.

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:24.405
You can see it's going to go off and do its blur,

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.765
blur to default of 15 pixels.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.230
It's probably a little too strong,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.045
so I'm going to turn it down to maybe something like 10.

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:32.460
It's going to redraw it.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.720
Now you can see it's there,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.890
I can see what it is,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.025
but I cannot start to read the names very well.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:42.105
The reason I like this is because there is this little option here says Noise.

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:43.680
I click on Noise,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.525
well, I need to put it appear on here,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.715
and I'm going to kick on Mount,

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:49.155
and if I click right up,

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:50.250
it's going to go a bit crazy,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.420
but you'd be able to see what I mean.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.400
I'm going to zoom in a bit. Can you see,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.730
it's put this noise background,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.485
so I will turn noise off, on, off, on.

00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:01.230
It gives us some low light noise which hides

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.000
some of the smooth Days of Our Lives effect that it ends up happening.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.330
How much you apply is totally up to you and your image.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm going to apply maybe not that much,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.665
turn it down a little bit, 20 percent.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:18.950
It can take a little while to redraw depending on how good your computer is.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.875
When you finish, you need to click this one up here that says "Okay".

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.920
The beautiful thing about using this type of method,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.410
is that it's something that's being turned into what's called a Smart Filter.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.565
We can turn it on and off.

00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:32.010
Say a client comes back and says, "I like it,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.490
but it's not blurry enough or too blurry."

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.220
What you can do is you can double-click the word Blur Gallery,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.440
go back in and sanctioning or turn it down a little bit to maybe six.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.445
I'm going to turn the grain up a little bit to 40, and then click "Okay".

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:50.510
It's totally reusable when you've used the technique that we've done in this course here.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.330
Now that's how to make an awesome background where we

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.500
used a bit of opacity to show through the box underneath,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.230
we also used a better blur and a better noise to push it into the background.
