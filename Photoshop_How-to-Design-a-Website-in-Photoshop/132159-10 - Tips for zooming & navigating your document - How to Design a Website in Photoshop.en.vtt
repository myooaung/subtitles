00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Hi. In this video, we're going to look at zooming and moving around in a document.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.145
Now, there are many ways to zoom in and out of a document.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:11.625
I'm going to show you the quickest and the easiest way.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:17.085
On a Mac, you hold down the Command key and tap the "Plus" on your keyboard.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.435
Now if you're on a PC, hold down the Control key and tap "Plus" and it will zoom in.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:26.040
Now, holding that same key and tapping the "Minus" will zoom out.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.055
What we want do is we want to make sure that we're viewing

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.185
our Photoshop mockup at the same size it's going to be rendered in a web browser.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:35.790
Because a web browser, obviously,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.670
we can't zoom in and out like we can do in Photoshop,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.755
so what we want to do is see it at actual size.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:45.140
To do this, if you're on any computer other than a new MacBook Pro,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.160
the easiest way is to go to View and pick a 100 percent.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.970
That will show it at it's actual size.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.345
Now, you can see on mine here,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.910
it is about half the size it should be because

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.640
I'm using a MacBook Pro with a retina display in.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.050
Long story short, it essentially shows you everything at about half size.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.625
Now what we need to do,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.170
with anybody with a MacBook Pro,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.480
is that you need to reset to this 200 percent,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.845
brought up twice the size.

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:13.430
Photoshop will show at the same size it will show you on a website so you

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.720
can be a bit clearer about what font sizes you want to pick.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.710
So to be clear, if you're on any computer but a MacBook Pro retina display,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.000
use this 100 percent.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.755
If you are on a retina display, use 200 percent.

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:31.920
Now that we're in this closer zoom level, we want to move around.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.620
The long way is I could drag these little sliders around and that works.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.460
A nicer way to work is if I hold down my Spacebar key on my keyboard,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.560
you'll see my cursor changes from

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.480
move tool to this little hand and this hand will allow me to click,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.660
hold, and drag my mouse and move around my document.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.290
I'm holding my Spacebar key down the whole time and I'm

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.980
clicking and I'm dragging and then letting go with my mouse.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.945
This is a nice, easy way to move around the document.

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:03.390
That's zooming and navigating your document.
