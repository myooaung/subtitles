Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,280
My name is Craig Golightly, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,950
Spring Framework: Versioning Spring Data REST APIs.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,080
I am a senior software consultant.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,540
You may have heard that it's best to avoid any breaking changes in your

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,890
API, but what are your options when you can't avoid it?

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,140
Is there anything in Spring Data REST that can make it easier?

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,440
In this course, you'll explore several different API versioning strategies,

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,940
and we'll walk through a couple of implementations so you

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,330
can better understand your options.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,310
Some of the major topics that we will cover include when you might need to

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,410
version your API, API versioning strategies, how to implement URI

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,120
versioning, and using a custom header for versioning.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,450
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,170
you will be able to decide which versioning strategy makes

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,560
sense for you and effectively implement that strategy with

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,110
your Spring Data REST API.

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,640
Before beginning the course,

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,060
you should be familiar with Spring Data and REST APIs.

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,950
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about versioning

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:19,000
REST APIs with the Spring Framework: Versioning Spring Data REST APIs course, at Pluralsight.
