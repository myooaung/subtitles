1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:02,220
I will come back in with you.

2

00:00:02,220  -->  00:00:06,110
Let's look at running a file from idea.

3

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:13,740
Naturally we have to write our programs line by line where each line gets executed instantly.

4

00:00:13,770  -->  00:00:18,480
It means we can't really write programs that are much longer than one line.

5

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:26,430
This is why in python like in all the programming languages we can create the program in a file and

6

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:27,670
then we can run it.

7

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:33,530
Ideally the python shell is not a requirement for running Python programs.

8

00:00:34,290  -->  00:00:38,360
However it does have the functionality to run a file.

9

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:46,620
So the way we would create a new file from Ideally the Python show will be to go to the File menu and

10

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:49,670
then press new file or just press command.

11

00:00:49,690  -->  00:00:54,560
And if you're on a Mac what I would assume control and if you're on Windows.

12

00:00:54,710  -->  00:00:59,540
Well as pre-stamped and then it creates this here and I'm just going to resize it.

13

00:00:59,610  -->  00:01:03,330
So it appears on the screen there we go.

14

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:10,470
And now notice how the crocodile clips have disappeared because we can now write whatever we want in

15

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:16,170
this file as long as it's Python code and then we can run the file all in one go.

16

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:22,620
Python programs like most other programming languages run from top to bottom so whatever we write to

17

00:01:22,630  -->  00:01:27,890
the top will get executed first and then the next line and then the next line and so.

18

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:36,630
So let's try to write a very simple program that will declare a variable and then display the variable

19

00:01:37,050  -->  00:01:37,810
value.

20

00:01:37,830  -->  00:01:39,480
So let's create a variable.

21

00:01:39,480  -->  00:01:40,630
We know how to do that.

22

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:43,310
Age equals five for example.

23

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:49,770
And then as we've learned previously the only thing we have to do in order to display the age value

24

00:01:50,160  -->  00:01:56,350
is to type it in and then Python would evaluate that and this play is the value.

25

00:01:58,350  -->  00:01:59,590
So let's press run.

26

00:01:59,610  -->  00:02:05,790
I'm going to run menu and then run module and then it will go over to the python shell and execute that

27

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:06,210
.

28

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:07,950
And we must see it first.

29

00:02:08,130  -->  00:02:17,370
So I'm just going to save it as a him print and notice how nothing gets printed out which is kind of

30

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:19,730
ironic.

31

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:24,560
It did run the file and then just did nothing.

32

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:29,700
So let's go back into our file and figured out why this is.

33

00:02:29,990  -->  00:02:36,930
And the reason why is because the IDL e is programmed to evaluate each line sequentially.

34

00:02:36,930  -->  00:02:42,690
So whenever we execute a line it will evaluate and then when we execute another line and we'll evaluate

35

00:02:42,750  -->  00:02:44,130
that too.

36

00:02:44,610  -->  00:02:51,720
And in this case when it evaluates age it just returns the value of it and which is what we would expect

37

00:02:51,720  -->  00:02:52,430
.

38

00:02:52,440  -->  00:02:57,660
However when we run the file it doesn't quite run the same way when we run this fine.

39

00:02:57,660  -->  00:03:01,670
It runs in the normal sort of Python runtime.

40

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:09,510
And what that means is that it does not evaluate each line and return the value of it to the user.

41

00:03:09,510  -->  00:03:16,260
What it does is it just evaluates them and keeps them in memory and then we have to tell it give us

42

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:17,320
the value please.

43

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:21,150
In order for it to actually come out and be printed.

44

00:03:21,480  -->  00:03:28,070
So instead of simply typing age we're going to need to do print.

45

00:03:28,320  -->  00:03:35,760
And then in here age and now when we run the model which you can do by pressing the function 5 key you

46

00:03:35,760  -->  00:03:36,640
must save it.

47

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:42,150
And then the value 5 does come out which is fantastic.

48

00:03:42,330  -->  00:03:47,290
OK we are approaching very quickly the ability to create the sections program.

49

00:03:47,400  -->  00:03:48,850
So I'll leave that up to you.

50

00:03:48,870  -->  00:03:52,410
How would you instead of printing just the age.

51

00:03:52,410  -->  00:03:57,300
Print out the number of seconds that the user has left for for simple challenge.

52

00:03:57,300  -->  00:04:01,160
However it still requires some thought.

53

00:04:02,700  -->  00:04:03,270
OK.

54

00:04:03,420  -->  00:04:09,240
So in order to just print the number of seconds without giving the user much information we would have

55

00:04:09,240  -->  00:04:15,960
to multiply this by 365 than 24 for the number of hours 60 for the number of minutes and 60 for the

56

00:04:15,960  -->  00:04:16,860
number of seconds.

57

00:04:16,980  -->  00:04:23,480
So if we save that and run it again we now get the number of seconds printed out.

58

00:04:23,640  -->  00:04:29,040
Second challenge give the user a bit more information for example something that I would like to be

59

00:04:29,040  -->  00:04:31,780
printed out is the string.

60

00:04:32,190  -->  00:04:36,810
You have lived for the number of seconds and then seconds.

61

00:04:36,870  -->  00:04:40,140
So let's print out.

62

00:04:40,530  -->  00:04:49,620
You have lift for seconds and then seconds where this is the number of seconds that we've calculated

63

00:04:49,620  -->  00:04:50,280
here.

64

00:04:50,730  -->  00:04:55,290
So that's the second challenge for you to try and create a program that will print that out

65

00:05:04,290  -->  00:05:06,690
slightly more challenging than the last one.

66

00:05:06,900  -->  00:05:15,750
What we have to do is write the string you have left for and then added to the string representation

67

00:05:15,810  -->  00:05:20,830
of our number and then add seconds at the end.

68

00:05:20,910  -->  00:05:23,240
What this does is it says you have lived for.

69

00:05:23,280  -->  00:05:30,560
Remember the space there and then it appends to it the string representation of our multiplication.

70

00:05:30,570  -->  00:05:37,740
Remember it does the multiplication first and then passes so that to this command and then it depends

71

00:05:37,740  -->  00:05:37,830
.

72

00:05:37,830  -->  00:05:41,730
Seconds at the end remember the space there as well.

73

00:05:41,730  -->  00:05:43,660
So let's say that and run it.

74

00:05:44,190  -->  00:05:50,020
And now we get a slightly better message you have lived for that number of seconds.

75

00:05:50,080  -->  00:05:57,030
However the user hasn't told us their age which means they do not know how many years this corresponds

76

00:05:57,030  -->  00:05:58,030
to.

77

00:05:58,770  -->  00:06:03,620
So you can optionally tell them this corresponds to five years.

78

00:06:03,870  -->  00:06:12,810
Or we can continue moving on and actually ask the user for their age before giving them the age in seconds

79

00:06:12,820  -->  00:06:13,410
.

80

00:06:13,980  -->  00:06:18,980
OK so trying to tell them this corresponds to five years as a string.

81

00:06:19,140  -->  00:06:20,170
And you know how to do that.

82

00:06:20,190  -->  00:06:22,570
You just have to add a few more things at the end.

83

00:06:22,950  -->  00:06:27,270
And then we move on and try to get the user input.

84

00:06:27,330  -->  00:06:28,410
So after your next video
