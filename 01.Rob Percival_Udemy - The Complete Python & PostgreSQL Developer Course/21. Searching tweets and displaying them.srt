1

00:00:00,140  -->  00:00:03,050
I will come back in this video we're going to be searching tweets.

2

00:00:03,060  -->  00:00:08,710
Finally we are able now to log in the users using Twitter into our web application.

3

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:10,500
We're saving them to the database.

4

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:14,990
Now what's left is to actually do something with Twitter data really.

5

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:22,400
So in this video we're going to be searching for tweets and displaying them on a web page.

6

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:24,100
We've got a profile page.

7

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:25,260
We've got the off.

8

00:00:25,270  -->  00:00:27,560
We've got the log in log out on the home page.

9

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:31,660
Let's create another route for the search.

10

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:34,890
So app don't root for search

11

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:44,570
and here where we want to do is to get the tweets the tweet texts.

12

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:47,730
We did that before in our loggin dopy y.

13

00:00:47,970  -->  00:00:55,200
So ideally what I would like to do is to have a list of the text inside each tweet that we search for

14

00:00:55,210  -->  00:00:55,620
.

15

00:00:56,040  -->  00:00:59,020
You guys know how to do that already we've looked at that before.

16

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:02,090
I would once again encourage you to pause the video and try that.

17

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:05,700
It's the best way to learn it's by trying to make mistakes.

18

00:01:05,820  -->  00:01:10,060
So go ahead and do that and then continue here.

19

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:12,720
OK.

20

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:14,040
Hopefully you managed.

21

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:20,310
And what we're going to do is say tweets equals and remember we have access to the currently logged

22

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:28,080
in user in jihadi user so we can't just say gee don't use or don't twitter request.

23

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:31,850
And here we can request the page that is going to allow us to search.

24

00:01:31,980  -->  00:01:38,340
And if you remember the page of the P.S. call on slash slash API or to about com slash 1.1 slash search

25

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:39,370
last tweets Don.

26

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:46,170
Jason and then we can put in a query at the end which is what we are searching for and the query is

27

00:01:46,170  -->  00:01:50,930
going to be in this case computers plus filter images.

28

00:01:50,970  -->  00:01:53,550
It doesn't have to be that that we can be anything you want.

29

00:01:54,060  -->  00:01:58,640
And rember that the request by default to use the get verb.

30

00:01:58,950  -->  00:02:01,850
So this request is going to happen using get.

31

00:02:01,980  -->  00:02:03,280
Which is what we want.

32

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:04,720
OK.

33

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:14,200
In order to get the tweet texts we're going to say use a list comprehension.

34

00:02:14,250  -->  00:02:16,460
We're going to go into the log in the IPY file first.

35

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:21,280
And here's what we did is we iterated over the status is.

36

00:02:21,570  -->  00:02:25,230
And then we printed the text for each tweet.

37

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:28,260
Now here's a wee bit of a challenge for you.

38

00:02:28,380  -->  00:02:37,560
Instead of printing each tweet out put each text in a list inside tweet text tweet texts.

39

00:02:37,590  -->  00:02:43,420
So ideally what I like in the end is something like blah blah blah.

40

00:02:43,770  -->  00:02:49,740
To eat one tweet to tweet three

41

00:02:52,860  -->  00:02:53,590
and so on.

42

00:02:53,970  -->  00:03:03,270
So for each of the tweets in here put the text in a list like so I would recommend using a list comprehension

43

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:03,300
.

44

00:03:03,300  -->  00:03:05,220
We looked at that before.

45

00:03:05,730  -->  00:03:08,020
You can certainly do that.

46

00:03:08,130  -->  00:03:10,820
Go ahead and try that.

47

00:03:12,890  -->  00:03:13,250
OK.

48

00:03:13,290  -->  00:03:14,240
Hopefully you managed.

49

00:03:14,460  -->  00:03:21,360
And the way to do that is we're going to see a tweet for tweets in tweets and what this is doing is

50

00:03:21,360  -->  00:03:31,920
it's iterating over the tweets in tweets and it's just putting the entire tweet in in that list.

51

00:03:31,920  -->  00:03:36,160
Remember the tweets are not directly in here but they are inside.

52

00:03:36,180  -->  00:03:38,700
The status is key.

53

00:03:39,450  -->  00:03:45,580
So we have to see for tweets in tweets statuses and now that's iterating over each tweet but we don't

54

00:03:45,580  -->  00:03:47,750
want the entire tweet to go in the list.

55

00:03:47,760  -->  00:03:49,450
We only want the text.

56

00:03:49,740  -->  00:03:58,770
So what to do is say text and now the way this reads is get the tweets text for each of the tweets in

57

00:03:58,770  -->  00:04:02,600
tweets statuses and then just putting that in say the new list.

58

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:05,700
So that's what tweet texts will contain.

59

00:04:05,700  -->  00:04:12,720
And finally what are we going to do is return a rendered template search dot HTML and the content is

60

00:04:12,720  -->  00:04:16,080
going to be tweet text remember content can be anything you want.

61

00:04:16,080  -->  00:04:22,200
This is just the variable name that we can then use in Jinja to such the DML doesn't exist.

62

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:28,650
So let's go and create that right reichlich template press new HDMI file call it search dot page DML

63

00:04:30,420  -->  00:04:34,370
and then why does it seem to work search results.

64

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:36,120
You can put that in the title there.

65

00:04:36,230  -->  00:04:39,570
You can put it search results you can put anything you want really.

66

00:04:39,930  -->  00:04:45,180
And now we're going to be instead of printing things out to the console we're essentially going to be

67

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:49,080
printing them out here in the body of our HDMI file.

68

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:52,540
Remember the body is what users see.

69

00:04:52,590  -->  00:04:57,860
So we're going to be putting things in the body and users are going to be able to see them.

70

00:04:59,100  -->  00:05:01,200
OK so what to do is say

71

00:05:03,990  -->  00:05:14,550
open a curly brace and then a percent sign and say four element in content and then close the percent

72

00:05:14,550  -->  00:05:18,090
sign a curly brace and at the end two lines down.

73

00:05:18,240  -->  00:05:20,820
Type in and forth.

74

00:05:21,720  -->  00:05:23,460
I'm sure you recognize this from Python.

75

00:05:23,460  -->  00:05:28,120
This is just a normal for loop that it's going to be iterating over content.

76

00:05:28,380  -->  00:05:35,920
The list we passed in with our tweets and it's going to be calling each element Element.

77

00:05:36,740  -->  00:05:37,580
OK.

78

00:05:38,040  -->  00:05:44,640
So here we could put in a p tag a p tag is used for paragraphs and we can essentially just put anything

79

00:05:44,640  -->  00:05:55,260
we want in it and we're going to put in is double and curly brace element and that is going to access

80

00:05:55,260  -->  00:05:58,550
this element variable there and it's going to print it out.

81

00:05:58,620  -->  00:06:04,360
So the element variable should be the text of the tweet and that is going to be each of the texts in

82

00:06:04,440  -->  00:06:11,790
site content which as we know is the tweet texts which is the list of tweet texts.

83

00:06:12,000  -->  00:06:14,340
My god that was a bit of a mouthful.

84

00:06:14,460  -->  00:06:22,560
OK let's restart the app and now we can go over to the you are Rayle type log in with Twitter.

85

00:06:22,560  -->  00:06:25,680
We get that and then we're going to type in search

86

00:06:28,380  -->  00:06:32,630
and there we have some tweets.

87

00:06:32,640  -->  00:06:40,080
OK it's not very pretty but we have tweets that have come out of Twitter and we're displaying them on

88

00:06:40,080  -->  00:06:40,680
our Web page.

89

00:06:40,680  -->  00:06:46,560
Now if you started only programming at the beginning of this course where you didn't have much experience

90

00:06:46,590  -->  00:06:50,800
I'd say this is quite a lot of practice.

91

00:06:50,850  -->  00:06:52,950
So I'd like to congratulate you on that.

92

00:06:52,950  -->  00:06:57,570
We have come really far from the beginning of the course until now.

93

00:06:57,810  -->  00:06:59,130
And that's really great.

94

00:06:59,130  -->  00:07:01,290
Hopefully you are understanding what's going on here.

95

00:07:01,290  -->  00:07:04,780
I always encourage you to ask questions in the course Q and A.

96

00:07:05,100  -->  00:07:08,470
I really do take my time answering everything that I can.

97

00:07:09,240  -->  00:07:09,800
OK.

98

00:07:09,870  -->  00:07:18,770
Now we're presenting the results there and we know that each of the elements is the tweet text.

99

00:07:18,780  -->  00:07:25,380
So now we can worry about presenting them better instead of just printed them one in each line.

100

00:07:25,380  -->  00:07:31,680
We can maybe do a bit of styling and present them a bit nicer and then we can move on to do the sentiment

101

00:07:31,710  -->  00:07:34,830
analysis on the tweets which we're going to be doing.

102

00:07:35,100  -->  00:07:39,770
And I'm not going to go into what it is just yet but we will get there.

103

00:07:39,810  -->  00:07:45,150
So now that we are able to display the tweets like so we're going to move on to the next videos we're

104

00:07:45,150  -->  00:07:50,570
going to be styling them a bit better making them prettier and then doing the analysis.

105

00:07:50,580  -->  00:07:52,590
I see you in the very next video.
