00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:07.170
Find We'll come back in the studio we're going to look at what is a set and a set and a list are very

2

00:00:07.170  -->  00:00:15.690
similar sets are extremely underused in Python I believe especially by beginners list as we've seen

3

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:21.820
it is just a collection of things and you can put whatever you want inside the list.

4

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:27.280
For example we can put a list of numbers like so.

5

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:36.810
And in this list we can have the number three multiple times if we want and then when we save that and

6

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:44.910
get it's value we can see that there's for three years and 16 7 and 4 in there a list is kind of like

7

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:50.820
a string in the sense that the list just stores whatever you want to put in it.

8

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:55.020
And Python doesn't try and be smart with lists.

9

00:00:55.020  -->  00:00:59.640
If you give it four times the number three it will just store the number three four times.

10

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:02.390
It is just a collection of items.

11

00:01:02.730  -->  00:01:09.340
A scent is slightly smarter because it removes duplicates in a list.

12

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:15.450
So essentially when you get a set and you put the number three twice in it you end up with only one

13

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:16.300
number three.

14

00:01:16.470  -->  00:01:17.790
So let's try that.

15

00:01:17.790  -->  00:01:24.600
Let's now say that our number is variable instead of being that list is going to be a set and that is

16

00:01:24.600  -->  00:01:29.790
the way that we tell Python that we want to initialize a set.

17

00:01:29.880  -->  00:01:30.700
So there we go.

18

00:01:30.700  -->  00:01:36.000
And now when we get the value of numbers out it is an empty set.

19

00:01:36.040  -->  00:01:39.150
However we can add values to a set.

20

00:01:39.150  -->  00:01:42.920
For example we can say numbers don't add and then add the number three.

21

00:01:42.950  -->  00:01:48.800
And if we get the numbers out now we see that it has changed but it's still a set.

22

00:01:48.840  -->  00:01:56.040
And now it is then stated with these curly braces as opposed to the list which uses square brackets

23

00:01:56.040  -->  00:01:56.680
.

24

00:01:57.180  -->  00:02:01.050
So our numbers list now has one element which is a 3.

25

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:06.720
So let's try to add three again and now get the value out.

26

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:11.220
And notice that it remains unchanged because the number three was already there.

27

00:02:11.220  -->  00:02:15.860
We tried to add it again but a scent is always made up of unique elements.

28

00:02:15.900  -->  00:02:20.510
So we cannot add the number three again where we can but it just won't go in.

29

00:02:20.510  -->  00:02:25.320
It will just get ignored because it's already there.

30

00:02:25.320  -->  00:02:26.880
Now let's create two sets.

31

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:33.330
I'm going to call one lottery values and we can define a sent link.

32

00:02:33.330  -->  00:02:39.690
So for an empty set with a word set and then open and close bracket that defines an empty set.

33

00:02:39.840  -->  00:02:44.280
Or we can define a set just with the numbers here.

34

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:51.010
So let's define the lottery numbers as this set the has four unique elements.

35

00:02:51.120  -->  00:02:55.790
So now our lottery values is this set has four unique elements.

36

00:02:55.900  -->  00:03:00.070
And notice how the order of the elements has changed because the set is also unordered.

37

00:03:00.090  -->  00:03:01.760
That is not order in a set.

38

00:03:01.890  -->  00:03:04.810
Every time you print it out the order may be different.

39

00:03:05.250  -->  00:03:06.660
So these are not really values.

40

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:08.480
And then our use of values.

41

00:03:08.520  -->  00:03:16.560
These are the numbers of buter has picked and these can be something like 3 5 11 and 2.

42

00:03:16.710  -->  00:03:21.990
So the user values contains these numbers and notice how Also the order has once again changed slightly

43

00:03:22.000  -->  00:03:22.950
.

44

00:03:23.850  -->  00:03:27.650
So these two cents have some numbers in common.

45

00:03:27.650  -->  00:03:28.590
They have three.

46

00:03:28.740  -->  00:03:30.780
They have five in common right.

47

00:03:30.990  -->  00:03:34.380
So there are two different views on sense.

48

00:03:34.820  -->  00:03:38.910
The way we're going to see them just now is a few more but we're only going to look at two in this video

49

00:03:38.910  -->  00:03:39.930
.

50

00:03:39.960  -->  00:03:50.280
Let me show you one set which is this one here non-intersecting 6 as we can see in this picture we've

51

00:03:50.280  -->  00:03:51.660
got two cents.

52

00:03:51.810  -->  00:04:01.950
Each set is represented by a circle and set a has Number 1 3 5 and 6 set to be has numbers 2 4 7 and

53

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:02.970
8.

54

00:04:02.970  -->  00:04:06.830
There are no numbers between the two that are identical.

55

00:04:07.110  -->  00:04:10.150
So we say that these hands are non intersecting.

56

00:04:10.800  -->  00:04:14.870
And what that means is that there are no numbers that are the same in both sets.

57

00:04:14.880  -->  00:04:18.060
There are no elements that are the same in both sets.

58

00:04:18.060  -->  00:04:20.330
Remember that a set can contain things other than numbers.

59

00:04:20.330  -->  00:04:23.200
It doesn't have to be numbers only.

60

00:04:23.220  -->  00:04:27.410
So in these two sense there are no identical numbers.

61

00:04:27.420  -->  00:04:33.990
So for example if we added two sets together these two sets together we would get an resultants set

62

00:04:34.230  -->  00:04:40.680
with eight elements because no duplicates would be removed because they're all different.

63

00:04:40.680  -->  00:04:49.300
This is different from this other example in which we have set a with a values 1 and 3 Set B with the

64

00:04:49.310  -->  00:04:50.720
values 2 and 4.

65

00:04:51.030  -->  00:04:55.690
And the intersection of both sets is the value 5 and 6.

66

00:04:55.770  -->  00:04:59.940
That means that the values 5 and 6 are in both sets.

67

00:05:00.090  -->  00:05:07.500
That means that A is actually one of the three but also 5 and 6 and set B is 2 and 4 but also 5 and

68

00:05:07.500  -->  00:05:07.910
6.

69

00:05:07.950  -->  00:05:13.740
So five and six are in both sets and we represent that with an intersection between the two circles

70

00:05:13.760  -->  00:05:15.500
.

71

00:05:17.250  -->  00:05:24.420
So what would happen therefore if we intersected these two sets if we calculated the intersection between

72

00:05:24.420  -->  00:05:26.820
lottery values and use of values

73

00:05:31.200  -->  00:05:38.700
which is how we would calculate it lottery values dot intersection and then say the brackets of the

74

00:05:38.700  -->  00:05:43.340
intersection we would put the sense that we want to intersect with.

75

00:05:43.350  -->  00:05:48.930
So what do you think is going to come out of this.

76

00:05:49.650  -->  00:05:55.230
And the result is another set which contains the elements that are in the intersection which is 3 and

77

00:05:55.230  -->  00:05:55.500
5.

78

00:05:55.500  -->  00:06:01.670
In this case notice that we can also do use a values dot intersection set of values.

79

00:06:01.770  -->  00:06:06.220
It's the same thing because it doesn't matter the order in this case.

80

00:06:06.540  -->  00:06:11.170
So there we have it the intersection of these two sets is the number of numbers.

81

00:06:11.170  -->  00:06:14.790
What the actual numbers that are identical between both.

82

00:06:14.970  -->  00:06:20.430
So that is going to be useful for our application to be able to calculate how many numbers they use

83

00:06:20.430  -->  00:06:22.410
are matched from the lottery.

84

00:06:22.410  -->  00:06:24.560
The lottery is going to generate a few random numbers.

85

00:06:24.690  -->  00:06:29.580
The user is going to pick some numbers and then we're going to compare and see how many numbers that

86

00:06:29.590  -->  00:06:30.100
you got.

87

00:06:30.120  -->  00:06:30.770
Right.

88

00:06:30.780  -->  00:06:38.340
And then we're going to calculate the winnings from that sets are an essential part of mathematics and

89

00:06:38.330  -->  00:06:42.690
they are also very useful in programming to do things like these where you've got unique elements and

90

00:06:42.690  -->  00:06:47.190
you have to calculate how many are in what else.

91

00:06:47.280  -->  00:06:52.160
So very useful mathematical entity and also very useful in programming.

92

00:06:52.230  -->  00:06:54.520
And this is how you calculate the intersection.

93

00:06:54.600  -->  00:06:59.240
There are also a few other things that we can calculate with sets but we're not going to get into them

94

00:06:59.580  -->  00:07:02.930
just in this section because we won't need it for this application.

95

00:07:03.030  -->  00:07:09.050
But nevertheless Python can use sense for a few other things such as unions and subtractions.

96

00:07:09.210  -->  00:07:13.050
We will maybe look at those later on in the course.

97

00:07:13.170  -->  00:07:17.100
That's everything for this video we've looked at what a set is and how we can use it.

98

00:07:17.100  -->  00:07:21.950
So we're going to move on into the next video where we're going to start working on our app.

99

00:07:22.110  -->  00:07:22.560
So either
