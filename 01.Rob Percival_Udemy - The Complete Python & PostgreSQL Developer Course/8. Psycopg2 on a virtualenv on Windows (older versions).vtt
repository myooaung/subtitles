00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:06.510
Hi welcome back in this video we're looking at installing psycho OPG too in a virtual environment in

2

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:13.140
Windows what we've got right now and what we did in the last few videos we're not completely useless

3

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:13.450
.

4

00:00:13.530  -->  00:00:19.350
We managed to install psycho-BS U2 and now we know how to do that in this video we're going to be creating

5

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:20.330
a virtual M.

6

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:25.460
And we are going to install psycho OPG to end it.

7

00:00:26.280  -->  00:00:34.710
So what to do is go through the process of creating your project in pie charm create your virtual environment

8

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:36.440
in the place that you want it.

9

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:41.870
And then once you've created your project then let's go into this video.

10

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:48.150
So now I'm assuming that you have your project created with PI chum and you've created your virtual

11

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:56.250
And as we saw in the very last video once you're ready let's now install psycho puji to in your virtual

12

00:00:56.250  -->  00:00:58.460
environment in Windows.

13

00:00:58.930  -->  00:00:59.460
OK.

14

00:00:59.640  -->  00:01:03.400
So what to do is go into your start bar.

15

00:01:03.630  -->  00:01:04.760
Open up the gate.

16

00:01:04.860  -->  00:01:11.490
BASH which is what we used last time to install c.a.p G-2 and then we're going to be going into the

17

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:20.000
project that we've created in pyjamas so that in my case that's in my documents project and then into

18

00:01:20.000  -->  00:01:21.300
the data databases.

19

00:01:21.600  -->  00:01:27.600
So here as you can see I've got my project folder which is where my pyjama project is and I've got my

20

00:01:27.600  -->  00:01:31.760
vendor folder which is the virtual environment I've created.

21

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:38.880
Now if we try to use psycho-BS G-2 at this point it will give us an error because it's not yet installed

22

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:43.390
and following the instructions for Mac might not work.

23

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:49.260
We have to follow the windows specific instructions using the installer that we downloaded a couple

24

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:50.100
of videos ago.

25

00:01:50.160  -->  00:01:53.090
Hopefully you've not deleted that because we still need that.

26

00:01:53.240  -->  00:01:59.460
The first thing to do is we're going to type a command that is going to activate our virtual environment

27

00:01:59.460  -->  00:01:59.550
.

28

00:01:59.550  -->  00:02:05.490
And what that means is that it's going to allow us to install things in the virtual environment as opposed

29

00:02:05.580  -->  00:02:09.530
to in the system pipe and installation.

30

00:02:09.840  -->  00:02:18.210
Right now when we do Python where if we type python in him what that launches is piped in 3.5 that we've

31

00:02:18.210  -->  00:02:25.080
installed in Windows the python that we want to launch is the one that we've put in the virtual environment

32

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:25.210
.

33

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:31.500
So the way we tell this console that we want to interact with a virtual environment Python is by typing

34

00:02:31.500  -->  00:02:34.850
source and then space and then virtual environment.

35

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:44.460
The Venture management folder scripts activate so source and then space then slashed scripts slash activates

36

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:45.630
.

37

00:02:45.750  -->  00:02:48.370
And now we get this bracket.

38

00:02:48.390  -->  00:02:55.440
Then at the start of every line essentially and now what we're going to do is very simply exactly the

39

00:02:55.440  -->  00:03:00.160
same command as we installed psycho PGE 2 in the system Windows last time.

40

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:07.740
So it's going to be Python bash em easy underscore install and then we're going to install the downloaded

41

00:03:07.740  -->  00:03:15.820
package which is an easy package which is in Tildy slash downloads.

42

00:03:16.050  -->  00:03:26.530
And then here it is psycho PGE psycho Peachi to Dasch 2.6 point one dot Win32 dash PI 3.5 Daut.

43

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:28.020
Yikes.

44

00:03:28.440  -->  00:03:30.290
So this is the package we downloaded.

45

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:35.190
It is possible that by the time you have downloaded this package that these numbers may be slightly

46

00:03:35.190  -->  00:03:39.290
different it could be two point six point one potentially PI 3.6.

47

00:03:39.300  -->  00:03:43.620
Don't worry about that just follow exactly the same thing that I'm doing but with your numbers as opposed

48

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:52.500
to mine running this program is going to allow us to run the easy install program on the python installation

49

00:03:52.500  -->  00:03:57.540
that we're running in our van and it's going to take in this as an argument which is going to install

50

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:00.260
that exe package in this python.

51

00:04:00.820  -->  00:04:06.500
So let's press enter and that is going to just install and it outputs a lot of stuff.

52

00:04:06.510  -->  00:04:14.690
But eventually it should say installed Cyclopedia to blah blah blah dot org and dot org folders.

53

00:04:14.850  -->  00:04:20.700
Sorry I got a big archive is just a Python package used for installation.

54

00:04:20.820  -->  00:04:30.300
Once that's done then you are now ready to continue your cycle OPG 2 module is now usable from within

55

00:04:30.300  -->  00:04:31.790
this virtual environment.

56

00:04:32.010  -->  00:04:38.340
And because we installed it previously in the system Python It is also usable across your system even

57

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:40.800
if you are not in a virtual environment.

58

00:04:40.800  -->  00:04:46.110
Just remember whenever you create a virtual environment you're going to have to do this again but that's

59

00:04:46.110  -->  00:04:46.740
it.

60

00:04:46.740  -->  00:04:50.460
We've installed it on Windows and now we're ready to start developing our app.

61

00:04:50.460  -->  00:04:52.990
So thanks for bearing with me during this.

62

00:04:53.040  -->  00:04:57.060
I know quite a long set of video setting things up but now we are ready.

63

00:04:57.060  -->  00:05:01.230
And trust me I just saved you a bunch of hours because that's where it took me to find out how to do

64

00:05:01.230  -->  00:05:02.720
all this stuff in Windows.

65

00:05:02.730  -->  00:05:05.520
I don't tend to use Windows very often so there we go.

66

00:05:05.520  -->  00:05:06.510
Not installed.

67

00:05:06.510  -->  00:05:10.910
We are ready and it only took us a few minutes so I'll see you on the next video.
