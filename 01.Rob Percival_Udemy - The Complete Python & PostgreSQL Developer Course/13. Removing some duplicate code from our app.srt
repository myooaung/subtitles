00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:06,390
Hi welcome back in this would we're going to be removing some duplicate code as you can see.

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:12,030
Our app has a bit of duplicate code that can sometimes be a problem and we're going to go into exactly

3

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:16,810
why it is a problem in this instance.

4

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:22,920
The main bit of duplicate code and the bit that worries me is the speed here and there is one particular

5

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:29,160
reason why it worries me and that is because it contains string literals it contains the user name that

6

00:00:29,160  -->  00:00:35,230
we're using to connect to postscripts the password the database and the host.

7

00:00:35,400  -->  00:00:41,250
I'm not concerned about security at this point although I would be if this was my real password what

8

00:00:41,250  -->  00:00:46,780
I'm concerned about is what happens when we change the password in posh Grace.

9

00:00:46,860  -->  00:00:52,350
What happens when we change the password is that this then fails and we have to come into the file and

10

00:00:52,350  -->  00:00:53,050
change it.

11

00:00:53,050  -->  00:00:59,710
Here and here that's fine because we've only got two instances where this is happening.

12

00:01:00,000  -->  00:01:05,730
But potentially they could be 10 places where we're using this connection or 20 places or 50 plus users

13

00:01:05,730  -->  00:01:08,370
depending on how large our application is.

14

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:13,950
So the best thing to do is to make sure that this is only written down in our code once and when we

15

00:01:13,950  -->  00:01:20,330
have to change the password would just go into that one place and change it.

16

00:01:20,370  -->  00:01:24,150
This is also duplicate code with connection dot cursor as cursor.

17

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:28,130
And we're going to get there later on we're going to get to this bit.

18

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:34,830
Then after the first thing to do is to remove these duplicate clothing for the reasons I said earlier

19

00:01:34,850  -->  00:01:35,130
.

20

00:01:35,400  -->  00:01:42,270
So I'm just going to cut these things and then I'm going to go into the database Doppie why file and

21

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:50,810
define a method which I'm going to call connect and that is going to return that.

22

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:57,330
So what that does is when we call the connect method that returns the connection to postscripts And

23

00:01:57,360  -->  00:02:02,750
we also have to import psyco P.G. to show how we are able to do that.

24

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:11,150
Now in the User class instead of inport psycho puji to what we do is from database import connect database

25

00:02:11,190  -->  00:02:13,290
is our database file connect.

26

00:02:13,290  -->  00:02:21,610
Is the method that we've created and now we just do connect like so.

27

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:28,830
So with CONNECT as connection and what this is doing is getting the return value of the connect function

28

00:02:29,660  -->  00:02:31,920
and calling it connection as a variable.

29

00:02:31,920  -->  00:02:37,070
And then when you get to the end it's going to you know save it and all were OK.

30

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:39,220
So let's see vamp's.

31

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:47,820
And now let's run the app and we still see the user being printed out and going to verify that saving

32

00:02:47,820  -->  00:02:49,230
to the database also works.

33

00:02:49,230  -->  00:02:51,670
That is something you should get into the habit of doing.

34

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:54,960
Making sure the things that you've changed are work.

35

00:02:54,990  -->  00:02:57,330
So I'm going to create a new user

36

00:03:07,950  -->  00:03:08,760
and save it

37

00:03:12,270  -->  00:03:13,220
and then press play.

38

00:03:13,380  -->  00:03:20,010
Nothing will be printed out but I'm going to go over to Peachi admin run it and Rowlf is there.

39

00:03:20,070  -->  00:03:25,650
Which means what we've done has not broken our program which is great.

40

00:03:25,700  -->  00:03:30,890
So now what we've done is simplified our code but we've gone we've done more than that what I've managed

41

00:03:30,890  -->  00:03:38,070
in this video is to communicate to you the importance of making sure that your code is maintainable

42

00:03:38,510  -->  00:03:39,130
.

43

00:03:39,720  -->  00:03:46,140
If you have the same string everywhere suddenly your code becomes unmaintainable unmanageable when you

44

00:03:46,140  -->  00:03:51,050
have to make a change you lose yourself and you don't know where to make those changes.

45

00:03:51,060  -->  00:03:57,870
So it's very important to remember to keep your code easily readable easily maintainable so that weeks

46

00:03:57,960  -->  00:04:02,370
months years down the line when you come and make a change it's easy.

47

00:04:02,550  -->  00:04:06,280
And if you have the same thing written all over the place that is not the case.

48

00:04:06,630  -->  00:04:12,750
So make sure that your code is succinct readable easy to maintain and you'll have great fun programming

49

00:04:12,750  -->  00:04:13,710
.

50

00:04:13,710  -->  00:04:14,870
And that's what we've done is video.

51

00:04:15,000  -->  00:04:16,350
So now let's move on to the next one.

52

00:04:16,560  -->  00:04:18,130
I see you there.
