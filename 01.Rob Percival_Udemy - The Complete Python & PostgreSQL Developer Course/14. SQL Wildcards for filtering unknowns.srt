00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:07,560
Hiawatha Mack in this video we're looking at to the like command and wild cards wild cards are really

2

00:00:07,560  -->  00:00:13,830
useful because they let you select data only based on part of the field as opposed to the entire field

3

00:00:13,830  -->  00:00:15,000
.

4

00:00:15,060  -->  00:00:21,260
For example let's say you're running a promotion on your customers that you want to give them a discount

5

00:00:21,330  -->  00:00:24,950
if they have the letter O in their last name.

6

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:27,200
Probably not something very realistic once again.

7

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:33,080
But nevertheless this will allow us to show you how this works.

8

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:41,350
You know how to select everything from a table select stock from the table name.

9

00:00:42,830  -->  00:00:50,790
So I'm going to run this query select stuff from customers and that gives me about five customers.

10

00:00:50,790  -->  00:00:54,190
I only have one customer that has the letter O in the name.

11

00:00:54,230  -->  00:00:55,760
So just pick a different letter.

12

00:00:55,770  -->  00:01:01,270
Let's pick the letter T because that's for customers to have the letter T and and nominee.

13

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:04,150
So there is no way to do that.

14

00:01:04,150  -->  00:01:10,800
We what we already know we could do with when where and then what do we do.

15

00:01:10,800  -->  00:01:20,980
The pythonic way would be to say something like t in last name but this doesn't really work.

16

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:28,080
And this although it does exist in sequel it doesn't do what we want.

17

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:32,040
So that isn't the best thing.

18

00:01:32,040  -->  00:01:39,630
What we want to use is the like command which allows us to compare a field with a pattern.

19

00:01:39,630  -->  00:01:40,640
So I'm going to see.

20

00:01:40,660  -->  00:01:46,170
So let's start from customers way last name like.

21

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:48,660
And then I put in a pattern.

22

00:01:49,160  -->  00:01:52,120
So the pattern can use a couple of wildcards.

23

00:01:52,230  -->  00:01:59,690
It can use the percent wild card which if I run this I get everything.

24

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:01,480
Now explain why that is.

25

00:02:01,920  -->  00:02:11,280
And I can also use the underscore wild card and if I put four of them and I run this I only get Adam

26

00:02:12,420  -->  00:02:14,140
as the last name.

27

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:19,200
OK so now let's remove that number for underscores.

28

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:24,900
Get me Adam and 1 percent symbol gets me all of them.

29

00:02:24,900  -->  00:02:31,190
So if I run this again take a wild guess as to what each of those mean.

30

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:39,190
What does a percent symbol mean and what does the underscore symbol mean.

31

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:44,710
You may have guessed the percent symbol is just like the asterisk symbol up here.

32

00:02:44,760  -->  00:02:47,580
It means anything any correct.

33

00:02:47,610  -->  00:02:49,670
What is the underscore symbol means.

34

00:02:49,710  -->  00:02:51,490
Are you single correct.

35

00:02:51,600  -->  00:02:57,180
So when we use for underscores we got Adam because that's the only custom of the has a four letter surname

36

00:02:57,180  -->  00:02:57,600
.

37

00:02:57,740  -->  00:03:02,390
And when we use the percent symbol we got everything because it matches everything.

38

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:04,290
So there you go.

39

00:03:04,970  -->  00:03:10,750
So it's like to start from customers with any last name like.

40

00:03:10,770  -->  00:03:18,660
And here we're going to use our first pattern and we wanted those customers that have the letter T in

41

00:03:18,660  -->  00:03:19,500
their name.

42

00:03:19,500  -->  00:03:24,000
So what we're going to do is say I sent t percent.

43

00:03:24,120  -->  00:03:29,190
And that means any Kanak to any number of characters before 80 minutes.

44

00:03:29,400  -->  00:03:37,860
And then any number of characters after the t show when we run this you would expect to get those four

45

00:03:38,250  -->  00:03:41,860
users there for customers.

46

00:03:42,060  -->  00:03:43,300
That's what happens.

47

00:03:43,770  -->  00:03:47,870
So you've got all those customers there and that's fantastic.

48

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:54,000
What would happen if I replace this Pisin symbol after the T with an underscore

49

00:03:57,420  -->  00:04:00,350
which customers would get.

50

00:04:01,170  -->  00:04:08,040
And the answer is Smith and Scott because those are the only customers that have one Kanika after the

51

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:08,830
T.

52

00:04:08,970  -->  00:04:14,480
The other customers have multiple characters so they don't match this pattern.

53

00:04:15,060  -->  00:04:23,570
So that is how we can do a like selection or like filtering which is not the fastest thing to do.

54

00:04:23,940  -->  00:04:30,300
So unless you require that this sort of filtering I would potentially try to avoid it.

55

00:04:30,300  -->  00:04:37,260
And is always faster to filter by specific things just because it decreases a bit of the power requirements

56

00:04:37,290  -->  00:04:39,180
of the server.

57

00:04:39,180  -->  00:04:42,310
But nevertheless this does exist and it is very useful.

58

00:04:42,330  -->  00:04:48,210
So please do use it when it is required and that is how you can filter based on a pattern.

59

00:04:48,210  -->  00:04:54,060
Remember the percent symbol means any character any number of times and the underscore symbol means

60

00:04:54,060  -->  00:04:55,700
a single character.

61

00:04:56,060  -->  00:04:57,830
With that said I'll see you in the next few
