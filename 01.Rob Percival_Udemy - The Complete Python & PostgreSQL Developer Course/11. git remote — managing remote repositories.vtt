Hi and we'll come back in this video we're looking at adding the remote repository that is going to

2

00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:08.850
be a short video because it tells you here how to do that.

3

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:16.770
Let's copy this first command and then I'm going to go over into the terminal where we've got our repository

4

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:22.530
and I'm going to paste it in and I'm gonna explain to you what this really is.

5

00:00:22.530  -->  00:00:30.150
Remember that a remote repository is another good repository that instead of being in your file system

6

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:38.400
in your computer it is in good hubs servers and it is identical to your local get repository except

7

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:43.230
that we can add it as a remote so we can send it stuff.

8

00:00:43.260  -->  00:00:48.590
We can send it our Snapshot our commits to what we're doing here is saying get remote.

9

00:00:48.600  -->  00:00:54.630
This is a command used to manage remote repositories and then subcommanders And then there's others

10

00:00:54.630  -->  00:01:00.750
like remove for removing remote repositories we can have as many remote repositories as we want and

11

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:08.490
the one we're adding here is this one which is the you Arel that is available here.

12

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:14.790
And we are calling it origin where you can call it whatever you want it doesn't have to be called Origin

13

00:01:14.940  -->  00:01:18.460
origin it's just the sort of default name.

14

00:01:18.460  -->  00:01:21.280
So when we press that nothing really seems to happen.

15

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:28.350
But now we are able to send our snapshots send our commits to this remote repository.

16

00:01:28.590  -->  00:01:34.700
And the way we do that is as it says in the page get push dash you or in master.

17

00:01:35.100  -->  00:01:43.740
And what this does is it says I'm going to push and send my comments to origin and more specifically

18

00:01:44.070  -->  00:01:50.220
the branch that I want to send which we've only got mastered at this point is must.

19

00:01:50.820  -->  00:01:58.500
And it's saying that you flag means origin create a new branch called master and make sure that they

20

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:00.430
are synchronized essentially.

21

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:06.960
So when we press Enter then it asks us if we want to connect for sure and then we say yes and then he

22

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:09.720
says permission denied.

23

00:02:09.720  -->  00:02:11.630
Trust me this is the way to do it.

24

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:12.920
It tells you there as well.

25

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:20.760
But we do not have permissions we don't have correct access rights to access that repository.

26

00:02:20.760  -->  00:02:25.410
So we have to make sure that we have access rights and that's where we are going to be looking at in

27

00:02:25.410  -->  00:02:30.990
the very next video because it's really important concept to understand which is the concept of S-sh

28

00:02:30.990  -->  00:02:31.580
Keeves.

29

00:02:31.740  -->  00:02:32.990
We're going to look at that in the next video.

30

00:02:33.150  -->  00:02:34.470
So I'll see you there.
