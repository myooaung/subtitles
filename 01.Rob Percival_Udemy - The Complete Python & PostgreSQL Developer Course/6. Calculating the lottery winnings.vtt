00:00:00.140  -->  00:00:05.850
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to calculate the winnings and let how you play the lottery

2

00:00:07.770  -->  00:00:10.420
in order to allow a user to interact with our program.

3

00:00:10.440  -->  00:00:15.090
We're going to need more than just calling a single method.

4

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:20.010
We're going to need to allow the user to do everything that the program requires.

5

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:21.480
One step after another.

6

00:00:21.540  -->  00:00:26.250
So the first thing we have to do is ask the user for their numbers and then we have to calculate the

7

00:00:26.250  -->  00:00:31.610
lottery numbers and then we have to print out the winnings.

8

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:38.190
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new method which I'm going to call menu and this menu

9

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:43.410
is going to essentially run our program and allow the player to pick the numbers and then calculate

10

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:45.750
the lottery numbers and then print out the winnings

11

00:00:45.930  -->  00:00:58.180
.

12

00:00:58.250  -->  00:00:59.270
OK.

13

00:00:59.280  -->  00:01:02.720
So you guys can actually do all of this.

14

00:01:02.850  -->  00:01:04.650
You can ask the player for the numbers.

15

00:01:04.650  -->  00:01:06.550
We've got a method for that already.

16

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:08.430
You can calculate the lottery numbers.

17

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:10.350
We've got a method for that already.

18

00:01:10.350  -->  00:01:16.140
And then you can also calculate how many numbers did the user match.

19

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:21.060
So the intersection of the two sets returned by these methods.

20

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:26.520
The way I would do it assign the first method to a variable such as use a numbers.

21

00:01:26.520  -->  00:01:32.840
The second method to another variable such as lottery numbers and then calculate the intersection.

22

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:35.350
The video and try and complete that.

23

00:01:35.480  -->  00:01:35.840
Now

24

00:01:39.870  -->  00:01:43.680
OK now that you've tried that let's do it here as well.

25

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:45.020
Asking the player for numbers.

26

00:01:45.060  -->  00:01:46.410
We've got a method for that.

27

00:01:46.410  -->  00:01:53.760
So I'm going to say use a numbers is get play in numbers and then calculating the lottery numbers is

28

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:54.810
simple as well.

29

00:01:54.810  -->  00:02:00.330
Lottery numbers is create lottery numbers which is the method below.

30

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:08.040
And finally to print out the winnings we need to first calculate the winnings so matched numbers is

31

00:02:08.040  -->  00:02:12.500
used on the score numbers don't in the section with lottery numbers.

32

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:18.120
And that gives us a sense that is how many numbers are in both.

33

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:24.660
So for example if a lottery generated six numbers and the user got two right then they said we'll have

34

00:02:24.750  -->  00:02:27.140
those two numbers.

35

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:38.700
And finally we can print you won that much money where that money is coming in through the format available

36

00:02:38.700  -->  00:02:38.790
.

37

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:45.270
So we're going to replace this value with something and that something is going to be one hundred to

38

00:02:45.270  -->  00:02:50.730
the power of the length of matched numbers.

39

00:02:50.730  -->  00:02:51.830
My apologies for the cursor.

40

00:02:51.830  -->  00:02:54.570
It does keep going in the way.

41

00:02:55.100  -->  00:02:58.590
So what this is going to do is first of all calculate the user numbers.

42

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:02.140
Or rather ask the user for them and then it's going to create lottery numbers.

43

00:03:02.190  -->  00:03:07.080
And finally it is going to calculate intersection between both.

44

00:03:08.280  -->  00:03:15.100
And finally it is going to multiply Treyc calculate 100 to the power of how many matched numbers there

45

00:03:15.100  -->  00:03:18.730
were and tell the user how much that they won.

46

00:03:19.440  -->  00:03:19.980
OK.

47

00:03:19.980  -->  00:03:24.730
So let's now remember two at the bottom here.

48

00:03:24.760  -->  00:03:31.860
If we no longer need to print anything we just need to run the menu press run and we get invalid syntax

49

00:03:32.430  -->  00:03:34.640
because we are missing a bracket.

50

00:03:34.740  -->  00:03:38.400
So I say that again and press 1 and there we go.

51

00:03:38.400  -->  00:03:44.070
We can now enter our six numbers and then we get that we won 10000.

52

00:03:44.070  -->  00:03:50.370
So we must have matched probably three numbers that say no to numbers my bet.

53

00:03:50.370  -->  00:03:52.380
My math is not too great.

54

00:03:52.390  -->  00:03:53.840
So there we go.

55

00:03:53.880  -->  00:03:58.050
However it would be nice if we could also see which numbers we matched.

56

00:03:58.140  -->  00:04:04.490
So let's do that to you matched.

57

00:04:04.650  -->  00:04:05.270
There we go.

58

00:04:05.370  -->  00:04:10.180
And now we can put the matched numbers in here in the format Ashwell.

59

00:04:10.410  -->  00:04:12.590
I think you guys know how to do that.

60

00:04:12.600  -->  00:04:20.160
Remember that the numbers we matched must come first inside the format method and the amount that we've

61

00:04:20.170  -->  00:04:22.180
won must come second.

62

00:04:22.200  -->  00:04:27.090
So you can put the matched numbers inside the format method in the correct order and I'm sure we can

63

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:29.090
do that.

64

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:31.260
OK.

65

00:04:31.380  -->  00:04:37.140
Remember that parameters for the format method and indeed for any method are always separated by commas

66

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:37.230
.

67

00:04:37.230  -->  00:04:44.340
So what we have to do is say matched numbers comma and then the amount so match numbers is going to

68

00:04:44.340  -->  00:04:50.550
replace the first set of curly braces and the amount that we've won is going to replace the second set

69

00:04:50.610  -->  00:04:53.010
of curly braces.

70

00:04:53.010  -->  00:04:56.450
I'm going to save that and run it again.

71

00:04:58.500  -->  00:05:04.480
And there we go we matched two and five and we won $10000.

72

00:05:07.030  -->  00:05:07.520
OK.

73

00:05:07.530  -->  00:05:12.840
So we no longer need these comments down here because we've implemented those up at the top and now

74

00:05:12.840  -->  00:05:15.380
we are essentially finished with our app.

75

00:05:15.390  -->  00:05:21.690
So congratulations for getting this far and you've learned a lot about Python you've learned about list

76

00:05:21.690  -->  00:05:27.050
comprehension set comprehension and also about the mathematical uses of cents.

77

00:05:27.090  -->  00:05:34.230
We've calculated lottery numbers by using a while loop and then we've implemented our first larger application

78

00:05:34.230  -->  00:05:36.760
using a menu as well.

79

00:05:36.780  -->  00:05:45.300
However these apps are all running in the python shell the python shell is nice but it only lets you

80

00:05:45.300  -->  00:05:47.350
run one file at a time.

81

00:05:47.370  -->  00:05:50.710
Or rather it's difficult to run more than one file at a time.

82

00:05:50.730  -->  00:05:56.460
So what we're going to be doing in the next section is get started with more complex and larger applications

83

00:05:56.460  -->  00:06:03.450
and we're going to be installing our ID which stands for Integrated Development Environment which is

84

00:06:03.570  -->  00:06:07.480
a more professional software used to develop larger applications.

85

00:06:07.500  -->  00:06:13.870
So I'm excited to go through that with you and get us developing larger more complex apps.

86

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:16.680
So I'll see you in the next video where we're going to get started with that
