00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:05.640
Find Welcome Back in this video we're looking at viewing previous commits which is going to be a short

2

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:06.320
video.

3

00:00:06.480  -->  00:00:12.420
But just remember that the commits are stored in your don't get folder or in the remote repository if

4

00:00:12.420  -->  00:00:16.410
you upload your repository to a get service like get help.

5

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:23.760
And it is useful that you are able to view what commits have happened in the past.

6

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:27.150
There's an easy command for that which is get long.

7

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:31.740
And that gives you a log of what has happened in it.

8

00:00:31.890  -->  00:00:33.470
In this case we've only done one commit.

9

00:00:33.480  -->  00:00:41.400
So the only thing we get here is this which is commit and then the code the author notice how the has

10

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:49.500
the amended e-mail address the date and the commit message.

11

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:50.450
There's a couple of options.

12

00:00:50.470  -->  00:00:55.510
If there's loads of options that you can give get a log that will format this differently.

13

00:00:55.560  -->  00:00:59.520
But here's a couple of them that are quite useful.

14

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:10.140
Good log dash dash one line only gives you a shortened version of the commit code and a one liner with

15

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:12.750
the commit message.

16

00:01:13.030  -->  00:01:20.640
Another one which we don't really have the option to see in this moment in time is dash dash graph and

17

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:26.220
that would give you a graphical representation of the commits.

18

00:01:26.220  -->  00:01:30.660
And we're going to be looking at exactly what that means as we make more commits especially in the next

19

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:32.420
few sections.

20

00:01:33.040  -->  00:01:36.060
That's everything for this video that is how you can view previous comments.

21

00:01:36.120  -->  00:01:38.520
And this is arguably the most popular way to do it.

22

00:01:38.520  -->  00:01:39.090
Good luck.

23

00:01:39.090  -->  00:01:44.670
Dash dash one line as you make commits and especially if you're working with other people it's important

24

00:01:44.670  -->  00:01:47.850
to keep track of what commits other people are doing.

25

00:01:48.090  -->  00:01:51.550
So remember to check the log every now and then.

26

00:01:51.750  -->  00:01:52.550
That's it for this video.

27

00:01:52.620  -->  00:01:54.420
And I see you in the next one.
