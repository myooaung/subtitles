00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:05.700
One will come back in the section we're going to get started with postscripts and the first thing we

2

00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:12.660
have to do is to install it possible sequel is just a relational database which means we can store data

3

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:19.450
in a row and then we can add more data and data can be related from one table to another.

4

00:00:19.470  -->  00:00:23.420
We're going to explore exactly what all that means throughout this section.

5

00:00:24.030  -->  00:00:26.090
As I said the first thing to do is to install it.

6

00:00:26.250  -->  00:00:31.350
And in this video we're going to go over installing on Windows to install Windows.

7

00:00:31.350  -->  00:00:32.360
It's really simple.

8

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:38.240
Simply go to postscripts sequel dot org and then go to the downloads page here.

9

00:00:38.990  -->  00:00:45.990
And as you can see these binary packages installer's for nearly every operating system you can think

10

00:00:45.990  -->  00:00:46.420
of.

11

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:48.510
And Windows is down here at the bottom.

12

00:00:48.540  -->  00:00:54.150
So just press that and then we can download the install

13

00:00:54.150  -->  00:01:01.660
.

14

00:01:01.680  -->  00:01:04.950
Here we have to pick the version that we want.

15

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:08.220
So we are just going to pick the latest one.

16

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:15.660
Nine point five point two in some operating systems when you install Pasquarelli won't be the latest

17

00:01:15.660  -->  00:01:16.060
version.

18

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:18.640
And that's something to keep into account for later on.

19

00:01:18.860  -->  00:01:24.190
And for example if you're using a server online the version that you'll install may be 9.3 or nine point

20

00:01:24.190  -->  00:01:24.830
two.

21

00:01:25.020  -->  00:01:26.190
That's not a big deal.

22

00:01:26.190  -->  00:01:31.320
We're going to just learn about Pascua sequel and then you can look at the differences between versions

23

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:35.300
later on because I'm using Windows 10 64 bits.

24

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:42.110
I'm going to download this one which other 64 at the end if you're using a slightly older computer that

25

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:46.980
has under 4 gigabytes of RAM chances are you'll be using 32 bits.

26

00:01:47.160  -->  00:01:49.230
But it's also possible you'll be using 64 bits.

27

00:01:49.220  -->  00:01:51.510
So that's something to check as well.

28

00:01:51.960  -->  00:01:54.010
If you use a Mac naturally download that one.

29

00:01:54.150  -->  00:02:00.670
Let's focus on the windows aspect and download the 64 bit one.

30

00:02:06.970  -->  00:02:13.230
And then a download starting and it shouldn't take very long and then we can look at where we want to

31

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:18.350
install.

32

00:02:23.710  -->  00:02:24.860
OK so that downloaded.

33

00:02:24.870  -->  00:02:28.020
Let's press on it and give you with that

34

00:02:31.140  -->  00:02:36.320
and then we can start installing it.

35

00:02:36.570  -->  00:02:41.670
If you don't have visual C++ which I don't because this is a fresh Windows install then you'll have

36

00:02:41.670  -->  00:02:42.400
to install that.

37

00:02:42.420  -->  00:02:47.260
And then we get the pasta set up decide where you want to install it.

38

00:02:47.580  -->  00:02:52.560
Leave it as the default is my recommendation just because these programs tend to work best when you

39

00:02:52.560  -->  00:02:58.070
leave everything as a default if you change a configuration parameter or the installation path.

40

00:02:58.260  -->  00:03:00.220
Then you may have to change other things as well.

41

00:03:00.420  -->  00:03:01.470
So my recommendation.

42

00:03:01.470  -->  00:03:09.770
Leave it as the default and you can choose a password for the data the super user.

43

00:03:11.640  -->  00:03:19.130
So you can enter a password for the database superuser and then press next then select the port.

44

00:03:19.160  -->  00:03:25.010
One second I would leave it as the default and select a default locale which is just the language and

45

00:03:25.010  -->  00:03:26.900
that will be English in my case.

46

00:03:26.910  -->  00:03:32.920
And then it just starts installing.

47

00:03:39.750  -->  00:03:47.520
And once that's installed we can launch stack builder which we're not going to be doing in this video

48

00:03:47.540  -->  00:03:47.860
.

49

00:03:48.180  -->  00:03:49.470
And then just press finish.

50

00:03:49.470  -->  00:03:54.030
Now we've got Pasqua sequel installed so in the next video we're going to look at how to initialize

51

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:55.580
it and how to interact with it.

52

00:03:55.590  -->  00:03:56.070
I see the
