1

00:00:00,140  -->  00:00:05,150
I will come back in this video we're going to talk about raising our own CSX.

2

00:00:05,370  -->  00:00:11,200
Now remember this cause is not about learning CSSA learning it's the metal etc..

3

00:00:11,540  -->  00:00:17,310
So all I want to teach you in this video is how you can use these things from Python how you can embed

4

00:00:17,340  -->  00:00:22,440
jiujitsu in them teach you a bit about essentially using this stuff with Python because that's where

5

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:23,510
the future is going.

6

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:29,370
But if you want to learn about history Eliseus has in more depth you're going to need to go online and

7

00:00:29,370  -->  00:00:35,060
learn about that somewhere else because this court is not about HD and SS and Javascript.

8

00:00:35,290  -->  00:00:36,240
OK.

9

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:45,170
Now writing a Rosia says and importing it from here it's actually fairly simple and it has a nice way

10

00:00:45,250  -->  00:00:47,170
of flask has a nice way to do it.

11

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:53,300
So let's close up our templates tab and open up a new directory inside our project.

12

00:00:53,340  -->  00:01:00,140
And I'm going to call that static now inside the static I'm going to get a new directory called CSX

13

00:01:00,160  -->  00:01:00,640
.

14

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:06,480
And in s.c.s as I'm going to create a new file called style Dotsie SS You can call it whatever you want

15

00:01:06,750  -->  00:01:08,290
as long as it ends with Dot.

16

00:01:08,300  -->  00:01:10,140
Yes.

17

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:15,700
Now let's go back to our search down the mail page and presenter before the title.

18

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:18,180
And we're going to import another style sheet.

19

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:24,660
Make sure that your style sheet is after bootstraps style sheet because it says works by reading the

20

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:27,210
first file first and then the second file and so on.

21

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:34,980
So if bootstrap were to overwrite anything we write in our CSSA file then that won't happen if our test

22

00:01:34,980  -->  00:01:37,100
file comes after.

23

00:01:37,280  -->  00:01:45,600
I will type your link rail style sheet and hates ref which is the hypertext reference is going to be

24

00:01:46,980  -->  00:01:51,850
you guessed it you are on the go for inside these curly braces.

25

00:01:52,230  -->  00:01:59,820
And what we're going to put in there is going to be static and then filename equals CSSA slash style

26

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:01,880
those yesus.

27

00:02:01,920  -->  00:02:07,970
So what we're doing now is we're accessing a special flask endpoint called static and this endpoint

28

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:12,120
allows us to define the file name we want to retrieve from the static folder.

29

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:18,320
So we're accessing the CSSA folder and in the CSSA folder there's a lot CSSA file.

30

00:02:18,690  -->  00:02:24,180
So this is some special flask and Ginger code used to access static files.

31

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:24,990
OK.

32

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:26,720
So this is how we do that.

33

00:02:26,880  -->  00:02:28,100
And that's it.

34

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:32,460
Now we can go into our style that CSSA and write our own the essays.

35

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:35,470
This is not again a complete introduction to see.

36

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:39,200
But I wanted to show you nevertheless how it works.

37

00:02:39,240  -->  00:02:44,200
So let's go over to our search and we can see we've got this list here.

38

00:02:44,490  -->  00:02:50,670
What I'm going to do is I'm going to push it down because it is too close to the top so I'm going to

39

00:02:50,670  -->  00:02:52,040
push the list down.

40

00:02:52,170  -->  00:02:59,970
And the way to do that we see a sense is to add a margin a margin just as some space between two elements

41

00:02:59,970  -->  00:03:00,690
.

42

00:03:00,750  -->  00:03:05,580
And in this case the speed is going to be between this an ordered list element.

43

00:03:05,610  -->  00:03:06,670
Let's go into our.

44

00:03:06,860  -->  00:03:15,300
Hey Jim if the space is going to be between the top of this an ordered list and the container.

45

00:03:15,900  -->  00:03:22,460
So the bottom the container the top of the container is right now aligned with the top of the list.

46

00:03:22,560  -->  00:03:24,430
That's why they're both up there.

47

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:31,010
And now we're going to push the list down by adding a margin to this an ordered list element.

48

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:31,720
OK.

49

00:03:31,890  -->  00:03:40,250
The way we do that is there's a few ways we can either type UL and then open a close bracket.

50

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:48,810
And now any styling we write in say these curly braces are going to be applied for all unordered lists

51

00:03:49,380  -->  00:03:50,490
in this page.

52

00:03:50,490  -->  00:03:51,160
There are only one.

53

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:54,320
But if there were many it would apply to all.

54

00:03:55,050  -->  00:04:02,820
Another option would be to type Daut list dash group and then the styling we write here would be applied

55

00:04:02,940  -->  00:04:11,130
to all elements in the file that have this class list group which right now there's only one ul.

56

00:04:11,960  -->  00:04:12,630
OK.

57

00:04:13,020  -->  00:04:20,520
Another option would be to give the UL an ID to just tweets and finally go into a style Alosi essays

58

00:04:21,450  -->  00:04:26,350
and type in the hash symbol tweets.

59

00:04:26,350  -->  00:04:34,620
Now IDs in Haiti should be unique so this should only be one element with the ID tweets in your entire

60

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:36,190
page.

61

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:37,490
It's not a requirement.

62

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:41,960
You can have many if you want but it is recommended there's only one.

63

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:47,700
So you know when you write some CSSA if you're only affecting the element with the tweets that you're

64

00:04:47,700  -->  00:04:48,810
only affecting one element.

65

00:04:48,810  -->  00:04:51,050
And in this case this is what we want to do.

66

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:55,780
And then what we're going to be doing is adding margined at the top of the element.

67

00:04:55,860  -->  00:04:58,730
So we will push it down some margin dash top.

68

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:07,730
We're going to say one RAM and a ram is a type of unit that change in size depending on the device.

69

00:05:08,010  -->  00:05:13,320
So if you're using a phone the RAM will be quite small if you're using a desktop like I am right now

70

00:05:13,320  -->  00:05:13,590
.

71

00:05:13,590  -->  00:05:18,690
The ram will be quite big and that's good because it means that on smaller devices the spacing is still

72

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:20,620
reasonably consistent.

73

00:05:21,130  -->  00:05:28,820
OK let's now refresh and as you can see there is a bit of space now looks a bit but ok.

74

00:05:28,920  -->  00:05:31,240
Not everything I wanted to show you in this video.

75

00:05:31,260  -->  00:05:36,600
I'm not going to go into massive styling because that's not the aim of this but I wanted to show you

76

00:05:36,600  -->  00:05:41,940
how you can import your own stylesheet from within your pages using Jinja too.

77

00:05:42,700  -->  00:05:51,630
And just a couple of knowledge bombs about CSI how you can access different things in CSX and how you

78

00:05:51,630  -->  00:05:56,200
can apply your styles Naturally if you want to learn more about CSL which I would encourage you to do

79

00:05:56,200  -->  00:05:57,400
which is a useful thing.

80

00:05:57,690  -->  00:06:03,720
Then please do that and you will be able to style your pages a lot more nicely.

81

00:06:03,720  -->  00:06:04,720
That's it for this video.

82

00:06:04,800  -->  00:06:08,390
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the very next one.
