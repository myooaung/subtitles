00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:06.380
Hi and welcome to the complete Python and pasta sequel developer course.

2

00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:07.620
Welcome.

3

00:00:07.620  -->  00:00:14.010
I'm Jose and I'm really excited to have you in the course because we're going to be going from absolute

4

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:16.560
beginner to knowledgeable developer.

5

00:00:16.710  -->  00:00:24.240
Over the course of over 20 hours throughout the course I'm going to personally support you in the entirety

6

00:00:24.240  -->  00:00:28.620
of it by answering questions and providing feedback on your project.

7

00:00:28.770  -->  00:00:33.000
I've got a few projects for you to do and I'm always welcoming new projects.

8

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:37.980
If you have any ideas so what will we cover.

9

00:00:38.010  -->  00:00:43.530
We're going to start with the basics of Python 3.5 which using new version of a programming language

10

00:00:44.040  -->  00:00:45.950
and the basics of programming as well.

11

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:51.370
If you've never done any programming before don't worry because we've got you covered.

12

00:00:51.450  -->  00:00:54.840
After that we'll quickly move to advanced programming with Python.

13

00:00:54.840  -->  00:01:00.330
Where are you going to get more experience and learn a lot more about programming language.

14

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:07.020
After that we'll look at data bases and Pasqua sequel possumus equal is a great DTV system which allows

15

00:01:07.020  -->  00:01:14.110
your programs to have a lot more power by storing data in the system than we're going to be using Pasqua

16

00:01:14.110  -->  00:01:21.750
sequel and Python together and learning how these two can interact after we look at creating web applications

17

00:01:21.840  -->  00:01:27.180
with Python which allows a lot more users to interact with your applications by putting them on the

18

00:01:27.180  -->  00:01:27.850
web.

19

00:01:28.440  -->  00:01:33.540
And the wrap up for the course will be some advanced Python concepts and functionality while also looking

20

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:41.520
at the Ozo famous data structures and algorithms because it's meant for you and many people struggle

21

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:44.550
with learning programming for a very long time.

22

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:49.890
The course is intended to get you where you want to be efficiently and if you tried learning programming

23

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:56.520
before with Python or a different programming language I promise that you'll see results quickly.

24

00:01:56.520  -->  00:02:01.950
However if you're a complete beginner don't worry because I've designed this cause with you on my mind

25

00:02:02.220  -->  00:02:05.380
and I promise that you will not feel lost.

26

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:11.360
In addition I'm always available to answer questions and help you out in the course Q&A.

27

00:02:11.400  -->  00:02:13.410
So what will you have to do.

28

00:02:13.650  -->  00:02:18.630
Because unfortunately programming is not just a matter of watching videos and becoming an expert all

29

00:02:18.630  -->  00:02:19.760
of a sudden.

30

00:02:19.770  -->  00:02:21.480
Practice is paramount.

31

00:02:21.690  -->  00:02:27.990
But I've got you covered throughout the course and providing concise explanations and hands on projects

32

00:02:28.080  -->  00:02:29.440
for you to attempt.

33

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:34.710
The first two projects are a magic numbers app and a lottery app.

34

00:02:34.740  -->  00:02:39.480
These are the two beginner projects which are going to be using the terminal and we're going to be learning

35

00:02:39.510  -->  00:02:42.380
about programming with these two.

36

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:44.690
Then we will move on to intermediate projects.

37

00:02:44.760  -->  00:02:50.400
We're going to be using object oriented programming to create a student registration system and a movie

38

00:02:50.400  -->  00:02:52.210
rental system.

39

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:57.780
Finally after learning about Pascua sequel we will move over to advanced projects which s five of them

40

00:02:58.320  -->  00:03:04.120
including a Twitter analysis app as well as the implementation of four data structures.

41

00:03:05.040  -->  00:03:11.220
And that's a lot that's a lot of content but it's structured in a way to make it easy for you if you

42

00:03:11.220  -->  00:03:16.290
follow the course following along with the examples interacting with myself which I'm always there to

43

00:03:16.290  -->  00:03:19.050
help and with other students through the course.

44

00:03:19.050  -->  00:03:26.040
Q And a you will take everything in and in no time you will be a fantastic developer.

45

00:03:26.040  -->  00:03:29.500
Once again I'm excited to have you and I see you on the inside.
