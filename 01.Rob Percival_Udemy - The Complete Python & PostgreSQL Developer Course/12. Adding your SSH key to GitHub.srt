00:00:00,200  -->  00:00:06,270
Hi welcome back in this video we're looking at S-sh keys and how we can add them to our get her account

2

00:00:06,270  -->  00:00:07,080
.

3

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:11,760
First of all however we have to learn what an S-sh key is.

4

00:00:12,040  -->  00:00:20,490
It is each keys are extremely popular things nowadays for security and the way they work is that there

5

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:25,600
are two keys a private key and a public key.

6

00:00:25,620  -->  00:00:32,100
I'm not going to go into specifics as to how they work but anybody can generate a pair of keys and they're

7

00:00:32,100  -->  00:00:38,780
always in pairs a private key and a public key whenever you want to send data away.

8

00:00:39,240  -->  00:00:42,720
You encrypt the data using your private key.

9

00:00:42,760  -->  00:00:47,700
And again I'm not going to go into how that happens but you encrypt your data using your private key

10

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:58,090
and anybody else can decrypt your data using your public key which is the key that you give away.

11

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:04,550
Naturally it's important that your public key doesn't become really known or else it's not really as

12

00:01:04,550  -->  00:01:06,780
safe.

13

00:01:06,780  -->  00:01:15,540
So what we do is we give our public key to get a job and then we encrypt things with our private key

14

00:01:15,540  -->  00:01:16,200
.

15

00:01:16,200  -->  00:01:20,310
We give them our public key so they can read our traffic.

16

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:23,940
The stuff we're sending them and like that.

17

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:29,310
There's a lot of other communication on the Internet that behave with the S-sh keys for example connecting

18

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:31,310
to remote servers.

19

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:37,560
Usually happens like that you have your private key and you put your public key on the server you're

20

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:42,330
connecting to and then the communication can be encrypted like that.

21

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:48,410
So the the key in this video is generating those keys in Windows.

22

00:01:48,480  -->  00:01:53,130
Remember to use the get bashed to get shell that we installed originally in order to run this command

23

00:01:53,160  -->  00:01:54,760
or else it won't work.

24

00:01:54,870  -->  00:02:04,680
The command is S-sh that can just run that and just accept the defaults for the file in which to save

25

00:02:04,680  -->  00:02:09,940
the key unless you already have other keys then you may want to choose a different place.

26

00:02:10,020  -->  00:02:15,960
If you've never generated a key before then just accept that default then you can enter a passphrase

27

00:02:15,960  -->  00:02:17,790
which is just a password.

28

00:02:18,330  -->  00:02:23,130
So that whenever you use your key you have to put the password in that's useful.

29

00:02:23,130  -->  00:02:29,010
So that here when you're committing when you're pushing things to get to them you'll be asked for the

30

00:02:29,010  -->  00:02:30,920
password for this key.

31

00:02:30,990  -->  00:02:32,960
You can leave it blank if you want.

32

00:02:33,240  -->  00:02:34,160
And if you leave it blank.

33

00:02:34,170  -->  00:02:39,020
Just make sure that nobody steals your computer or else they'll have access to go get an account.

34

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:42,940
OK so let's press enter and then enter again I'm not going to put a password in.

35

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:45,870
And then you get this stuff here.

36

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:48,070
Which I appreciate is blurred out.

37

00:02:48,150  -->  00:02:50,020
But you'll see something like this.

38

00:02:50,100  -->  00:02:52,600
And finally we want to do that.

39

00:02:52,890  -->  00:03:04,490
And then the till the slash dot S-sh slash ID dot underscore R-S.C. dot pub.

40

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:12,690
And when I copy that and always blowdown but just copy your own then going to get up into your profile

41

00:03:15,390  -->  00:03:17,600
and edit profile.

42

00:03:18,060  -->  00:03:23,930
Go to S-sh and GBG keys add a new stage.

43

00:03:23,970  -->  00:03:24,640
Don't go down there.

44

00:03:24,650  -->  00:03:28,280
Don't either Noojee PTG just add a new key.

45

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:35,730
You can call it whatever you want and then you can paste it in something important if you're working

46

00:03:35,730  -->  00:03:36,540
from windows.

47

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:43,420
It is possible that there is a new line that there's a new line in there.

48

00:03:43,530  -->  00:03:48,490
Make sure to delete new lines so that everything is in one line.

49

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:53,220
Even the way I appreciate is shown in multiple lines but there is known no and Turkey be impressed.

50

00:03:53,220  -->  00:03:58,600
Notice that I can press enter there and twice and then I can delete the enter there.

51

00:03:58,800  -->  00:04:02,590
Make sure it all in one line but make sure that you're not deleting any characters.

52

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:04,680
If you delete a character then it won't work.

53

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:11,520
So if you delete the oh by accident then just put back in and thus everything you have to do.

54

00:04:11,550  -->  00:04:18,600
Then you can give it a title over to your app JCL at hoagies MBP dot home.

55

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:19,560
That's why I'm calling mine.

56

00:04:19,590  -->  00:04:25,330
You can call it whatever you want again and then finally at it and not it.

57

00:04:25,380  -->  00:04:34,950
Now if we go back into it we can now do the get push that you origin must

58

00:04:38,380  -->  00:04:39,730
and that's it.

59

00:04:39,840  -->  00:04:44,680
Then it comes to the objects that we're pushing which is 3 and writes them up to get hub.

60

00:04:44,880  -->  00:04:48,580
And then it creates the new branch in the remote repository which is called M..

61

00:04:48,600  -->  00:04:54,480
Just as it is in our local repository and then it says the branch master was set up to track the remote

62

00:04:54,480  -->  00:04:55,970
branch master from origin.

63

00:04:55,980  -->  00:04:59,280
That's what the dash you flag does.

64

00:04:59,730  -->  00:05:06,180
And now whenever we modify things or make any commits in our master branch which is our default branch

65

00:05:06,720  -->  00:05:09,390
we can just do get push.

66

00:05:09,390  -->  00:05:10,850
We don't have to do that.

67

00:05:10,860  -->  00:05:12,500
You origin must.

68

00:05:13,410  -->  00:05:14,570
And that's it.

69

00:05:14,580  -->  00:05:19,750
This is how you create your S-sh keys and how you make sure that you have access to pushing to get her

70

00:05:19,800  -->  00:05:20,100
.

71

00:05:20,230  -->  00:05:25,210
Remember don't have any newline characters in your S-sh key and don't delete any characters from yours

72

00:05:25,220  -->  00:05:27,730
as each key and you'll be fine.

73

00:05:27,900  -->  00:05:30,650
Without further ado I'll see you in the next video.
