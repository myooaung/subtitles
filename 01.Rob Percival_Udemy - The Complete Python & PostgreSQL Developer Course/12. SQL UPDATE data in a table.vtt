00:00:00.250  -->  00:00:05.970
All come back in this video we're looking at the update command the update command lets us change data

2

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:09.520
that is already in our database for this video.

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:14.160
We're going to be using the items table as opposed to the customers table.

4

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:18.560
First let's look at what data is already in our table.

5

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:20.050
The table is called items.

6

00:00:20.110  -->  00:00:24.510
I'm sure you can just get the data out of your table using the knowledge you've already got.

7

00:00:24.510  -->  00:00:30.180
Remember the command you want to use is select and I want you to select all of the data from that table

8

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:33.090
.

9

00:00:33.390  -->  00:00:40.680
I'm sure you were able to get that select store for select everything from items and run with the semi-colon

10

00:00:40.810  -->  00:00:41.530
.

11

00:00:42.460  -->  00:00:47.910
And then you compress the function five key if you want to run the query without pressing the play button

12

00:00:47.980  -->  00:00:48.730
.

13

00:00:49.020  -->  00:00:52.490
Someone pressed that and then you get the data out.

14

00:00:52.750  -->  00:00:58.440
We've got a name we've got ID and we've got price and the price prices a new data type called Gnumeric

15

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:04.710
which is just a data type that lets us have decimal points in our numbers.

16

00:01:04.710  -->  00:01:07.930
The 10 is the maximum number of digits.

17

00:01:08.190  -->  00:01:09.810
This one has four digits.

18

00:01:09.810  -->  00:01:14.640
This one has five digits and the two is a number of digits after the decimal point.

19

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:19.530
So in this case all these are prices so they have 2 digits after the decimal point.

20

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:24.810
You can change that when you create your database at your table sorry and we're going to get to that

21

00:01:24.810  -->  00:01:26.450
later.

22

00:01:26.460  -->  00:01:35.570
So this is the data that we've got and we want to change the ink to be $4 instead of 350.

23

00:01:35.910  -->  00:01:37.500
So we can do that with the update command.

24

00:01:37.510  -->  00:01:45.870
So we're going to say update something set something way something and I'm going to explain what this

25

00:01:45.870  -->  00:01:46.760
is.

26

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:49.630
You already know what way does.

27

00:01:49.830  -->  00:01:57.750
And it's used for filtering this here should be the table name that you want to update and this should

28

00:01:57.750  -->  00:02:04.620
be the column name that you want to update and the new value that you want to set for that column.

29

00:02:04.620  -->  00:02:06.090
So let's start with this one here.

30

00:02:06.330  -->  00:02:10.920
I'm going to put items because that's what we want to update we want to update the items table.

31

00:02:11.160  -->  00:02:17.860
And we went to St price equal for dollars.

32

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:25.650
Finally we wanted to filter so that we're only updating the price for ink and you know there's two ways

33

00:02:25.650  -->  00:02:26.300
you could do that.

34

00:02:26.320  -->  00:02:30.650
Well there's actually three which you could do that you could filter by name.

35

00:02:30.930  -->  00:02:35.210
You could filter by ID where you could filter by price.

36

00:02:35.220  -->  00:02:44.880
So for this mini challenge try to do this query filtering by ID so make sure that you're only changing

37

00:02:45.300  -->  00:02:49.490
the ink.

38

00:02:49.730  -->  00:02:59.130
So you've got that the only thing you have to do is say where ID equals three and that we get this item

39

00:02:59.310  -->  00:03:08.550
ink and sets the price of that to $4 that's breastplate and undertows as we do to turn successfully

40

00:03:08.670  -->  00:03:10.280
one row effect.

41

00:03:10.680  -->  00:03:20.180
So now let's go back and select staff from items and now our ink is $4.

42

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:23.310
Once again update items sent.

43

00:03:23.490  -->  00:03:28.830
Price equals $5 where price equals $4.

44

00:03:28.860  -->  00:03:31.670
What do you think is going to happen now.

45

00:03:33.150  -->  00:03:38.040
Well the first thing you have to realize is the filtering which browes are going to get affected by

46

00:03:38.040  -->  00:03:38.780
this statement.

47

00:03:38.790  -->  00:03:44.580
That's an important thing to take into account and it's no longer the ink only because the Panish also

48

00:03:44.590  -->  00:03:45.350
$4.

49

00:03:45.570  -->  00:03:48.840
So now both items are going to increase in price.

50

00:03:49.290  -->  00:03:57.480
So we're going to set the price of those two items to be $5 to this breast plate and this thing bugs

51

00:03:57.480  -->  00:04:02.750
out quite often which is a bit annoying.

52

00:04:03.750  -->  00:04:08.800
And you can cheat and change anything but sometimes it doesn't like to work very well.

53

00:04:08.890  -->  00:04:09.300
That's fine.

54

00:04:09.300  -->  00:04:18.000
Select start from items known as now are pen and ink both $5.

55

00:04:19.170  -->  00:04:24.740
OK so what happens if we say update items sent price equals ten.

56

00:04:25.320  -->  00:04:27.790
And we omit the where clause.

57

00:04:27.810  -->  00:04:34.230
What do you think is going to happen when we do this if we don't have a WHERE clause which columns get

58

00:04:34.230  -->  00:04:35.670
updated.

59

00:04:37.080  -->  00:04:45.150
And this is a key thing to remember if you don't have a filter all of your columns get affected.

60

00:04:45.150  -->  00:04:50.000
So this would override the prices on all of our items and they're not going to run this query because

61

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:52.370
it's a bit of a hassle to have to rebuild the thing.

62

00:04:52.740  -->  00:04:58.610
But if you run this query you'll lose the prices of your items and that's it.

63

00:04:58.620  -->  00:05:06.180
Now we have such a small dataset in an important data dataset it's not a big deal but there's another

64

00:05:06.180  -->  00:05:07.950
command called Delete.

65

00:05:07.950  -->  00:05:13.140
And if you forget the way when you delete come on we're going to look at that very soon and then you

66

00:05:13.140  -->  00:05:14.170
lose all your data.

67

00:05:14.220  -->  00:05:15.920
So be careful.

68

00:05:15.930  -->  00:05:22.020
Remember the way I command the WHERE clause is important so you can decide which columns get affected

69

00:05:22.350  -->  00:05:26.070
by a statement without said.

70

00:05:26.070  -->  00:05:27.280
Remember that warning.

71

00:05:27.350  -->  00:05:28.430
Now see you in the next video.

72

00:05:28.540  -->  00:05:31.350
We're going to look into that warning and see what happens.

73

00:05:31.580  -->  00:05:33.250
See you there.
