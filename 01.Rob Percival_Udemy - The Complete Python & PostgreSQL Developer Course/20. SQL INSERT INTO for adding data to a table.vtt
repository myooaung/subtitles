00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:05.540
Line will come back in this short video we're going to look at insert into and that's a sequel Commander

2

00:00:05.650  -->  00:00:11.780
let's says well insert data into a table let's remove what we did in the last video.

3

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:16.660
And remember we've got two tables one for videos and one for users.

4

00:00:17.190  -->  00:00:24.750
Let's first insert some data into our users table and if we try to insert data into a video table remember

5

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:32.520
because it is a foreign key it would not let us and I'll show you exactly how in a moment most of us

6

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:35.100
insert one row into our users table.

7

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:39.330
So I'm going to do insert and then into.

8

00:00:39.650  -->  00:00:43.400
And we have to specify which table we're putting data into.

9

00:00:43.740  -->  00:00:47.230
And once again you can say public and don't use those.

10

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:53.820
But if you're using the public which is a default schema and you can omit public in just a users if

11

00:00:53.820  -->  00:00:58.290
you prefer public users nevertheless it's a good practice to type in public domain users.

12

00:00:58.290  -->  00:01:01.500
Make sure you specify the schema that's a good thing to do.

13

00:01:02.880  -->  00:01:09.960
And then after insert into political users we open and close brackets and inside the brackets we say

14

00:01:10.470  -->  00:01:14.070
the columns that we are going to put the data into.

15

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:19.820
So here it's going to be ID and name and that's the columns that we've got.

16

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:25.360
And then I'm going to type in a new line but remember this is optional values.

17

00:01:25.620  -->  00:01:29.540
And here go once again between brackets the values that we put in it.

18

00:01:29.670  -->  00:01:38.460
So the idea is an integer which means that it has to be a number and the name is a string a character

19

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:41.510
varying which means it has to be between quotation marks.

20

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:44.360
And I'm going to type maybe Smith there.

21

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:49.440
Let's assume the name is a username maybe not a very good name for the column but nevertheless

22

00:01:52.550  -->  00:01:58.440
when we do this and we press play it says one row affected and then it gives us the time and all that

23

00:01:58.440  -->  00:01:59.820
stuff.

24

00:01:59.850  -->  00:02:09.410
So now let's select start from public domain users and we get the ID 1 and the name there.

25

00:02:11.010  -->  00:02:11.740
OK.

26

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:21.150
Now let's insert into public domain users but without specifying the columns that we're putting in.

27

00:02:21.180  -->  00:02:31.110
So I'm going to change that into a public that uses values and then inside brackets to Ralph Smith You

28

00:02:31.110  -->  00:02:34.200
can see I'm not very good at coming up with surnames.

29

00:02:35.280  -->  00:02:37.920
So what do you think is going to happen in this in this case.

30

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:41.930
Do you think this is going to work maybe give an error.

31

00:02:43.170  -->  00:02:44.850
Well let's find out.

32

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:48.020
As you can see it says quite written successfully.

33

00:02:48.040  -->  00:02:56.100
Wonder affected and when we select staff from public users we have Ralph there as well.

34

00:02:56.100  -->  00:02:57.200
So what does this mean.

35

00:02:57.600  -->  00:03:00.270
Well it means that the insert into

36

00:03:04.470  -->  00:03:14.070
does not need the column names there and if the values we are inserting match all of the columns in

37

00:03:14.070  -->  00:03:15.550
the table.

38

00:03:15.600  -->  00:03:18.880
So what we've got here is ID and name.

39

00:03:18.960  -->  00:03:27.510
And then what we've got here is three and my name in this case because three and the name are the Row

40

00:03:27.600  -->  00:03:35.760
other columns that are on the table and there's only these two columns we can omit the columns specifying

41

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:43.970
the columns is necessary when we want to insert data not in all the columns of the table.

42

00:03:44.070  -->  00:03:53.040
So for example say we had here a phone number and the phone number column that is.

43

00:03:53.130  -->  00:03:55.130
And that can be empty.

44

00:03:55.440  -->  00:04:01.100
Then we should specify the three and the three rows the three columns.

45

00:04:01.140  -->  00:04:08.220
And so if we have a phone number them and we would have to specify the columns that we want to put data

46

00:04:08.220  -->  00:04:15.200
into because if we don't then we would have to put in the phone number down here.

47

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:17.870
That would be valid.

48

00:04:17.940  -->  00:04:20.080
This would not be valid.

49

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:21.090
OK.

50

00:04:21.240  -->  00:04:25.580
So that's essentially when you can skip the column names in there.

51

00:04:25.710  -->  00:04:26.610
And when you cannot.

52

00:04:26.610  -->  00:04:31.940
So if the values are all of the columns in the table then you don't have to specify the columns.

53

00:04:32.140  -->  00:04:37.500
But if you want to put data only into some of the columns then you have to specify the call.

54

00:04:38.460  -->  00:04:44.400
OK so now let's select start from videos and as you can see it's empty.

55

00:04:44.760  -->  00:04:47.100
And let's insert some data into videos.

56

00:04:47.200  -->  00:04:52.210
So insert into public adult videos.

57

00:04:52.230  -->  00:04:59.220
And now remember that we can specify We call them names or we can choose to skip them if we're going

58

00:04:59.220  -->  00:04:59.750
to put them all.

59

00:04:59.820  -->  00:05:02.010
So in this case I'm going to skip them.

60

00:05:02.080  -->  00:05:03.440
It would be values.

61

00:05:03.450  -->  00:05:10.540
And then here we would put in the ID of the video then the ID of the user.

62

00:05:10.650  -->  00:05:14.610
And finally the name of the video so I'm sure you can do that.

63

00:05:14.610  -->  00:05:20.900
The first one would be number one for the ID of the video then it would be ID number 10.

64

00:05:20.970  -->  00:05:23.820
I'm going to put in something invalid in here just to show you.

65

00:05:23.820  -->  00:05:27.690
And finally the name of the video test.

66

00:05:29.010  -->  00:05:30.840
So what do you think is going to happen in this case.

67

00:05:30.850  -->  00:05:32.710
When I when I try and do this.

68

00:05:33.690  -->  00:05:35.370
Is that going to be OK.

69

00:05:36.000  -->  00:05:41.870
Is Pocho sequel going to allow me to enter at 10 even though we don't have 10 users.

70

00:05:42.330  -->  00:05:48.440
We don't have a user with ID 10.

71

00:05:48.840  -->  00:05:53.870
The answer is no it is not going to let me.

72

00:05:54.030  -->  00:05:57.760
And I think this is actually not the right message.

73

00:05:57.780  -->  00:05:58.770
There we go.

74

00:05:59.030  -->  00:06:03.620
And sometimes it does like to to bug out and do weird things.

75

00:06:03.720  -->  00:06:05.670
But nevertheless this is the right error message.

76

00:06:05.860  -->  00:06:15.270
It says insert or update on table videos violate foreign key constraint the key user ID 10 is not present

77

00:06:15.300  -->  00:06:16.970
in table users.

78

00:06:17.100  -->  00:06:22.030
What it's saying is you've tried to tell me that this video belongs to user with ID.

79

00:06:22.710  -->  00:06:24.570
But such a user does not exist.

80

00:06:24.570  -->  00:06:27.110
So naturally that cannot be.

81

00:06:27.130  -->  00:06:28.200
This must be wrong.

82

00:06:28.410  -->  00:06:29.740
And indeed it is.

83

00:06:29.760  -->  00:06:37.020
So if we instead type 2 which is one of our users then we press play then that works and then we can

84

00:06:37.020  -->  00:06:45.640
do so Nexstar from public videos and then we get our test video.

85

00:06:45.840  -->  00:06:51.390
Remember now that we have this foreign key and primary key relationship between user ID and the users

86

00:06:52.080  -->  00:07:02.010
we can do select stuff from videos inner join public domain users on public domain users ID quolls public

87

00:07:02.010  -->  00:07:08.850
don't videos stopped user ID and then we can get the name of the user who uploaded this video as we've

88

00:07:08.850  -->  00:07:10.890
seen in the past.

89

00:07:12.180  -->  00:07:19.320
So this is how you would insert values into the tables remembering the a foreign key constraint is going

90

00:07:19.320  -->  00:07:24.400
to limit what you can insert based on the data that is on the other table.

91

00:07:24.990  -->  00:07:32.850
Now something that you can do in things like My sequel is do something like insert into users and then

92

00:07:32.850  -->  00:07:34.750
just see the name.

93

00:07:34.880  -->  00:07:38.840
And this should be public don't use it but it doesn't really matter.

94

00:07:38.850  -->  00:07:42.510
It's not case sensitive public user's name.

95

00:07:43.050  -->  00:07:47.510
And then I would like to be able to see values.

96

00:07:48.240  -->  00:07:49.890
John Adams

97

00:07:53.610  -->  00:08:03.120
Now this is not correct but what I would like this to do is to give John Adams the next available number

98

00:08:03.900  -->  00:08:10.960
as an ID and that would be kind of an all too incremental ID which is quite popular in my sequel.

99

00:08:11.640  -->  00:08:17.590
So I'm gonna come down and say select stuff from public don't use them.

100

00:08:17.850  -->  00:08:26.130
So ideally what would happen if I execute this is that John Adams would be added were ID number three

101

00:08:26.130  -->  00:08:26.820
.

102

00:08:26.820  -->  00:08:35.070
However if I run it then it gives me an error because by default what it does is it puts null in the

103

00:08:35.070  -->  00:08:35.830
ID.

104

00:08:36.270  -->  00:08:38.230
So it's a type it tries to put in No.

105

00:08:38.250  -->  00:08:39.120
And John Adams.

106

00:08:39.150  -->  00:08:46.500
And then because ID is a primary key and it cannot be null the primary key cannot be null and then the

107

00:08:46.500  -->  00:08:51.060
erroneous has no value in column Id violet not an old constraint.

108

00:08:51.060  -->  00:08:56.430
So basically you're saying the the prime column ID cannot be null and you've tried to put in a no value

109

00:08:56.430  -->  00:08:58.520
in it and you can't do that.

110

00:08:58.570  -->  00:08:59.670
So this doesn't work

111

00:09:04.950  -->  00:09:06.160
however.

112

00:09:06.660  -->  00:09:11.400
Fortunately there is a way that we can do this in Pascua sequel and it's actually really quite simple

113

00:09:11.420  -->  00:09:11.510
.

114

00:09:11.610  -->  00:09:18.720
So we're going to look at that in the next video simply because it's nice to not have to remember where

115

00:09:18.780  -->  00:09:22.650
in your ad Rose you are at with your users and your IDs.

116

00:09:22.650  -->  00:09:26.520
For example if you have 23 million users you don't want to be remembering.

117

00:09:26.520  -->  00:09:26.910
OK.

118

00:09:27.090  -->  00:09:34.170
The next user is 23 million and one you'd rather just put in the user details and let postscripts deal

119

00:09:34.170  -->  00:09:36.770
with finding the correct date for it.

120

00:09:36.780  -->  00:09:39.960
So we're going to look into the next video just because that's something that's really popular to do

121

00:09:40.200  -->  00:09:40.600
.

122

00:09:40.690  -->  00:09:43.330
And if you can't do that really that's a bit limiting.

123

00:09:43.350  -->  00:09:44.820
So let's look at that in the next video.

124

00:09:45.020  -->  00:09:45.400
So either
