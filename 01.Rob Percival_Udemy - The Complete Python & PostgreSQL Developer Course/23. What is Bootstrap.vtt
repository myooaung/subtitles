00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:07.110
Hide Welcome back and there's video I'm going to introduce to you the concept of CSX cascading style

2

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:17.010
sheets and of bootstrap Cascading Style Sheets is a language used to style change the things like colors

3

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:21.000
sizes things like that of our hitch DML elements.

4

00:00:21.540  -->  00:00:26.010
And I know it may sound a bit arbitrary but random a bit weird a bit confusing.

5

00:00:26.010  -->  00:00:32.820
We're going to look at exactly how it does that bootstrap is somehow Zia's has code that is already

6

00:00:32.820  -->  00:00:37.760
written for you that makes things pretty essentially a lot easier.

7

00:00:37.770  -->  00:00:44.230
So it is used to speed up your siestas development essentially.

8

00:00:44.320  -->  00:00:45.950
And it's not perfect.

9

00:00:45.990  -->  00:00:53.910
It's not the end all and be all of a sense of styling but it is a nice way to style your things nicely

10

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:56.930
without having to write much code.

11

00:00:57.060  -->  00:01:02.480
So I tend to use bootstrap quite a lot when I'm developing small web sites and things like that.

12

00:01:02.560  -->  00:01:06.190
And I would encourage you to do the same at least while you're starting.

13

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:12.390
So let's go to get bootstrapped dot com and then press on the blue bar bootstrap.

14

00:01:12.460  -->  00:01:17.230
For now it's possible in the future that the version here will be Version 4.

15

00:01:17.250  -->  00:01:21.970
And if that is the case we will just go over to getting started.

16

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:29.190
But if the version here is not a version for let's press this bar there and this takes us to the bootstrap

17

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:29.890
blog.

18

00:01:30.040  -->  00:01:39.990
Now we want to go and find the place where it says head to the V for Alpha ADOX or you can directly

19

00:01:39.990  -->  00:01:41.770
go to V for that Alpha.

20

00:01:41.820  -->  00:01:49.920
Don't get bootstrapped Dockum but you or I might change as bootstrap evolves then let's go to documentation

21

00:01:49.950  -->  00:01:56.010
at the top and go to QuickStart down here and then we're going to take the copy button and then press

22

00:01:56.340  -->  00:02:01.650
control see if you're in Windows 2 copy command see if you're on Mac or you can just right click and

23

00:02:01.650  -->  00:02:02.380
copy.

24

00:02:03.010  -->  00:02:09.260
OK once we've done that we're going to head back to Python.

25

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:13.820
We're going to go to our search digest in our file and below the matter tag.

26

00:02:13.860  -->  00:02:15.850
We're going to press enter and paste that in.

27

00:02:15.870  -->  00:02:21.560
It's going to be a long line there but it doesn't really matter as long as we placed it in there and

28

00:02:21.610  -->  00:02:23.850
pasted inside the title or anything like that.

29

00:02:23.850  -->  00:02:25.220
Just paste it outside there.

30

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:30.780
What that's doing is that that's importing bootstrap the bootstrap code that is already written for

31

00:02:30.780  -->  00:02:31.360
us.

32

00:02:31.590  -->  00:02:33.280
It's importing that.

33

00:02:33.330  -->  00:02:36.000
So that's quite nice.

34

00:02:36.270  -->  00:02:43.410
Now that we've got that we can go back to our page and go to the search page and then notice how the

35

00:02:43.410  -->  00:02:48.030
text is different before it was over a times new roman font.

36

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:50.320
Now it's some sort of Helvetica font.

37

00:02:50.660  -->  00:02:55.240
And so it's some serif which is some people think a bit nicer.

38

00:02:55.320  -->  00:02:56.920
I tend to agree with that.

39

00:02:57.000  -->  00:02:58.980
So the font has changed but it hasn't changed much.

40

00:02:58.980  -->  00:03:00.460
I mean it's just a different font.

41

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:12.540
That's all we can do more things with this for example and we can instead of putting a paragraph tag

42

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:17.460
for each of the elements we can put them in a list like we pull at points.

43

00:03:17.460  -->  00:03:24.010
So let's do that because the bullet points offer some more flexibility over the paragraphs.

44

00:03:24.030  -->  00:03:28.580
So I'm going to delete the tags outside of the for loop.

45

00:03:28.620  -->  00:03:31.120
I'm going to put UL tags.

46

00:03:31.260  -->  00:03:38.640
So the opening tag is going to be above the for loop and the closing UL tag is going to be below the

47

00:03:38.640  -->  00:03:39.340
form.

48

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:47.280
This stands for unordered list a list of bullet points with no specific order and then each of the elements

49

00:03:47.370  -->  00:03:50.510
instead of a p tag are going to be l tags.

50

00:03:50.730  -->  00:03:56.620
List index I think is what it stands for but I could be wrong list item this item nomics importance

51

00:03:56.680  -->  00:03:56.950
.

52

00:03:57.210  -->  00:03:58.850
So each of the elements going to be a list item.

53

00:03:58.860  -->  00:04:04.750
Let's go back to Safari and refresh.

54

00:04:05.090  -->  00:04:12.630
And now we have a list of bullet points as we would expect ok with bootstrap.

55

00:04:12.630  -->  00:04:14.590
There is more we can do.

56

00:04:15.570  -->  00:04:20.490
We can assign these tags classes.

57

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:29.400
Now a class in CSSA is not the same as a class in Python is says class allows us to give the list or

58

00:04:29.400  -->  00:04:37.170
the element some styles and styles might include things like changing the color changing the border

59

00:04:37.230  -->  00:04:39.360
adding a border around the element.

60

00:04:39.360  -->  00:04:44.650
It may include things like changing the font size things like that.

61

00:04:45.240  -->  00:04:52.830
If we change the style of an element it is still going to be an unordered list but it may look different

62

00:04:52.840  -->  00:04:54.240
.

63

00:04:54.270  -->  00:04:56.730
OK so let's do that.

64

00:04:56.820  -->  00:05:04.680
Let's change the styling of this UL tag the way we do that is we put a space after the UL and type class

65

00:05:04.740  -->  00:05:12.620
equal list group and then in each of the airline tags we're going to add a class as well.

66

00:05:12.660  -->  00:05:16.080
That's going to be list Gloup item.

67

00:05:16.500  -->  00:05:23.280
If we're not sure what classes to put in here the best way to learn about bootstrap is to go into the

68

00:05:23.280  -->  00:05:31.290
bootstrap an introduction here and go to component's down here we have a list of components that are

69

00:05:31.320  -->  00:05:33.540
available to us in Bootstrap.

70

00:05:33.540  -->  00:05:36.390
And one of those components is the list.

71

00:05:37.590  -->  00:05:41.360
So this is what the code is for a basic example.

72

00:05:41.730  -->  00:05:42.880
And that's what it's going to look like.

73

00:05:42.900  -->  00:05:51.510
So I'm going to just quickly introduce you to the difference between our list with no bootstrap and

74

00:05:51.510  -->  00:05:57.810
I'm going to refresh our list with Butcha completely different as you can see there's no not even a

75

00:05:57.810  -->  00:05:58.850
bullet point.

76

00:05:59.130  -->  00:06:06.990
But now there's a border around each element and they are somewhat centered in that sort of panel if

77

00:06:06.990  -->  00:06:09.010
you want to call it that.

78

00:06:09.360  -->  00:06:12.010
So it looks reasonably nice.

79

00:06:12.030  -->  00:06:19.800
The next thing we can do is add a div element around the list.

80

00:06:20.940  -->  00:06:29.490
So I'm going to add the divs and then I'm going to make sure this is indented properly a div is just

81

00:06:29.730  -->  00:06:33.060
an element created to contain other elements.

82

00:06:33.060  -->  00:06:36.070
That's the simplest way to put it.

83

00:06:36.120  -->  00:06:43.200
So the usefulness of a deal is that we can apply styles to the div and they are the style we can apply

84

00:06:43.200  -->  00:06:50.040
to the div in this case is going to be will be no limit its width as you can see right now these lists

85

00:06:50.190  -->  00:06:53.150
are 100 percent of the viewport width.

86

00:06:53.220  -->  00:06:57.270
They occupy 100 percent of the window and that's not very nice.

87

00:06:57.270  -->  00:07:03.210
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use bootstrap to make sure that these do not occupy 100 percent

88

00:07:03.690  -->  00:07:08.540
of the width and I'm going to center them on the page.

89

00:07:09.000  -->  00:07:15.210
The way we do that is we get this div and we type class equals container inside the quotation marks

90

00:07:15.210  -->  00:07:16.360
.

91

00:07:16.410  -->  00:07:18.600
So let's say that refresh.

92

00:07:18.830  -->  00:07:23.240
Now as you can see they've shrunk down and become a bit smaller.

93

00:07:23.250  -->  00:07:30.350
However if we were to size down the window as you can see these size down with it.

94

00:07:30.430  -->  00:07:40.020
So this is why bootstrap is so nice because it allows us to easily make Web sites mobile friendly which

95

00:07:40.020  -->  00:07:41.170
is nice.

96

00:07:41.930  -->  00:07:43.470
OK then see if there this video.

97

00:07:43.470  -->  00:07:45.150
Just wanted to introduce you to bootstrap.

98

00:07:45.150  -->  00:07:47.730
I would encourage you to read through the documentation.

99

00:07:47.730  -->  00:07:49.670
Look at all the things you can do.

100

00:07:49.680  -->  00:07:51.370
Have a play around with it.

101

00:07:51.510  -->  00:07:53.470
But don't worry too much about learning.

102

00:07:53.610  -->  00:07:59.340
Massive amounts of HDMI LNC I says that's not the focus of this course but is nevertheless interesting

103

00:07:59.340  -->  00:08:02.760
to make your sites look appealing whenever possible.

104

00:08:02.910  -->  00:08:07.620
It's better to have a list that looks nice rather than a list of bullet points and that's going to make

105

00:08:07.620  -->  00:08:14.280
it a bit nicer and also bootstrap is going to allow us more flexibility in terms of making things look

106

00:08:14.280  -->  00:08:21.120
nice when we apply the AM sentiment analysis which we're going to be doing very soon.

107

00:08:21.120  -->  00:08:25.910
So that's it for this video in the next one we're going to talk a bit more about CSSA in terms of writing

108

00:08:25.980  -->  00:08:31.290
our own sense as opposed to using bootstrap only and then we're going to move on from that.

109

00:08:31.320  -->  00:08:33.660
So without further ado I see you in the very next video
