00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:02.250
<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back to the course.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:04.970
In this video, we're going to be installing PyCharm
3

3

00:00:04.970  -->  00:00:06.063
on Windows.
4

4

00:00:06.960  -->  00:00:10.590
The best thing to do is to go over to jetbrains.com,
5

5

00:00:10.590  -->  00:00:14.240
then hover over the tools and find PyCharm.
6

6

00:00:14.240  -->  00:00:17.130
The website may change a little bit over time.
7

7

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:21.000
I'm sure you can get to the PyCharm website anyway.
8

8

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:23.590
Then go ahead and find a way to download it,
9

9

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:28.560
and what we're gonna download is the Community Edition.
10

10

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:32.020
Community Edition is the free version of PyCharm.
11

11

00:00:32.020  -->  00:00:34.740
Professional is the paid version.
12

12

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:37.250
The Community Edition is plenty powerful
13

13

00:00:37.250  -->  00:00:40.440
for everything we're gonna do in this course and much more.
14

14

00:00:40.440  -->  00:00:43.640
So don't worry about getting the Professional Edition.
15

15

00:00:43.640  -->  00:00:45.853
You really don't need it yet.
16

16

00:00:46.749  -->  00:00:49.440
And make sure you've selected Windows as well, of course,
17

17

00:00:49.440  -->  00:00:50.610
although it should be the default
18

18

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:52.770
and then go ahead and download it.
19

19

00:00:52.770  -->  00:00:54.760
Once it's downloaded, just instal it
20

20

00:00:54.760  -->  00:00:55.930
as you would with any other programme.
21

21

00:00:55.930  -->  00:00:58.310
There's nothing special in the installation process.
22

22

00:00:58.310  -->  00:01:01.203
And you can then go ahead and launch it.
23

23

00:01:02.850  -->  00:01:06.620
So it'll open and launch up like this,
24

24

00:01:06.620  -->  00:01:08.900
and it may ask you if you want to import settings
25

25

00:01:08.900  -->  00:01:10.370
from a previous installation.
26

26

00:01:10.370  -->  00:01:12.010
You don't have to say yes.
27

27

00:01:12.010  -->  00:01:15.260
It may also ask you about your colour scheme that you want
28

28

00:01:15.260  -->  00:01:18.200
and you can choose either a dark theme or a white theme,
29

29

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:19.950
and I've gone for the white theme here
30

30

00:01:19.950  -->  00:01:22.383
just because it's a bit easier to see.
31

31

00:01:22.383  -->  00:01:25.271
But of course, you can choose whatever you want.
32

32

00:01:25.271  -->  00:01:26.970
Then you have this window
33

33

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:29.913
and we can go ahead and create a new project.
34

34

00:01:31.340  -->  00:01:33.090
And the first thing to do is to decide
35

35

00:01:33.090  -->  00:01:34.530
where you're gonna put your project.
36

36

00:01:34.530  -->  00:01:37.190
So it doesn't matter where you choose to put it.
37

37

00:01:37.190  -->  00:01:40.260
You can just select any folder you want,
38

38

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:42.720
and in my case, I'm gonna select the folder called Students
39

39

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:45.216
because we're gonna build a student registration,
40

40

00:01:45.216  -->  00:01:48.940
student grading system in this section.
41

41

00:01:48.940  -->  00:01:50.060
Then go ahead and open up
42

42

00:01:50.060  -->  00:01:52.727
the little project interpreter dropdown
43

43

00:01:52.727  -->  00:01:56.443
and go ahead and selected Existing interpreter.
44

44

00:01:57.560  -->  00:02:00.110
Don't worry about this environment stuff.
45

45

00:02:00.110  -->  00:02:01.860
We're gonna look at that later on in the course.
46

46

00:02:01.860  -->  00:02:03.910
For now, go for Existing interpreter,
47

47

00:02:03.910  -->  00:02:06.083
and then if nothing appears here,
48

48

00:02:07.670  -->  00:02:09.480
go ahead and press the three dots
49

49

00:02:10.860  -->  00:02:15.860
and then go ahead and select System interpreter
50

50

00:02:16.160  -->  00:02:17.963
and find the interpreter there.
51

51

00:02:19.070  -->  00:02:22.320
Okay, so here we've got Python 37, 3.7.
52

52

00:02:22.320  -->  00:02:24.370
If nothing appears here either,
53

53

00:02:24.370  -->  00:02:26.280
it's because when you installed Python,
54

54

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:29.400
you didn't select Add Python to path.
55

55

00:02:29.400  -->  00:02:31.240
So you can go ahead and uninstall Python,
56

56

00:02:31.240  -->  00:02:32.150
then reinstall it.
57

57

00:02:32.150  -->  00:02:35.660
Make sure to select the checkbox to add it to path.
58

58

00:02:35.660  -->  00:02:37.511
And if you do that and it still doesn't appear,
59

59

00:02:37.511  -->  00:02:39.820
then you can select the three dots
60

60

00:02:41.550  -->  00:02:45.540
and find the installation folder where Python is.
61

61

00:02:45.540  -->  00:02:49.280
So in my case, that's under C:\Users\Jose\AppData\
62

62

00:02:49.280  -->  00:02:52.230
LocalPrograms\Python\Python37\python.exe.
63

63

00:02:52.230  -->  00:02:54.210
And that's the default, so if you didn't change it
64

64

00:02:54.210  -->  00:02:57.040
when you installed Python, it'll be in a place
65

65

00:02:57.040  -->  00:03:00.615
very similar to this, of course not Jose, but your account,
66

66

00:03:00.615  -->  00:03:03.350
but other than that, it should still be in AppData,
67

67

00:03:03.350  -->  00:03:06.170
LocalPrograms, Python, Python37.
68

68

00:03:06.170  -->  00:03:07.700
So I'm sure you can find that.
69

69

00:03:07.700  -->  00:03:10.810
And once that's selected, just press OK,
70

70

00:03:10.810  -->  00:03:13.440
and that will add the interpreter here
71

71

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:14.763
and you can press Create.
72

72

00:03:16.780  -->  00:03:17.670
And that's it.
73

73

00:03:17.670  -->  00:03:20.678
Once you press Create, the project will open up
74

74

00:03:20.678  -->  00:03:23.640
and you can have your tips of the day there.
75

75

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:24.930
Sometimes you get something interesting,
76

76

00:03:24.930  -->  00:03:27.300
so you can read that.
77

77

00:03:27.300  -->  00:03:30.700
And you've got your folder in here, the Students folder,
78

78

00:03:30.700  -->  00:03:32.560
which is our project folder.
79

79

00:03:32.560  -->  00:03:35.610
In here, you can always add new files
80

80

00:03:35.610  -->  00:03:37.480
and Python files and so forth
81

81

00:03:37.480  -->  00:03:39.740
but we're going to look at how to do that
82

82

00:03:39.740  -->  00:03:41.340
throughout the rest of the course.
83

83

00:03:41.340  -->  00:03:42.420
So don't worry.
84

84

00:03:42.420  -->  00:03:45.170
Let's move on to the next video and I'll see you there.
