00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:08,190
High and we'll come back in this video we're looking at what is a repository when we're using GET ALL

2

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:17,990
OF OUR get related things are going to be in a repository the repository is the main get container in

3

00:00:18,280  -->  00:00:25,230
this are going to quickly try to explain what good it does for you and how the repository fits into

4

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:28,270
that.

5

00:00:28,290  -->  00:00:36,030
Remember the get is a set of layers and this is really important to remember your repository is used

6

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:40,260
to move files between those layers.

7

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:47,940
Each layer has a function and when files are inside your repository you can move them from layer to

8

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:51,440
layer using gets commands.

9

00:00:51,570  -->  00:00:57,630
Each layer provides some function such as aero control which is being able to go back on the changes

10

00:00:57,630  -->  00:00:58,880
that you've already made.

11

00:00:59,220  -->  00:01:01,620
Redundancy in case you lose your hard drive.

12

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:06,490
You can have them on line and a few more things.

13

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:08,340
Let's start by looking at these layers.

14

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:14,250
And remember this video is not meant to give you full understanding of what it is but rather a quick

15

00:01:14,250  -->  00:01:18,510
overview of each of those layers and what they might be used for.

16

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:22,050
The first layer is the file system.

17

00:01:22,650  -->  00:01:26,220
All of the files that you create in your computer are in your file system.

18

00:01:26,350  -->  00:01:28,150
And this is not a good layer.

19

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:29,860
It's just your computer.

20

00:01:29,880  -->  00:01:34,820
So whenever you create a python file this is in your file system.

21

00:01:35,040  -->  00:01:37,420
It doesn't really give you anything except storage.

22

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:40,780
If you lose your harddrive your files get lost.

23

00:01:40,800  -->  00:01:48,900
So this is the base layer and you create your repository in this layer when you want to create your

24

00:01:48,900  -->  00:01:54,690
repository what you do is you initialize and get in a folder and we're going to look at doing this in

25

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:56,170
the next video.

26

00:01:56,820  -->  00:02:03,090
So you have your folders such as your Python project and you want to initialize get in that folder you

27

00:02:03,090  -->  00:02:10,980
install get in that folder essentially and that unlocks the ability to use the other layers in it.

28

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:16,880
But remember when you initialize get in a folder you can only use the layers inside that folder and

29

00:02:16,880  -->  00:02:22,570
not outside of it but you can have many good repositories in your computer at the same time.

30

00:02:22,620  -->  00:02:27,600
Just remember to use a good repository for one project and a different repository for another project

31

00:02:27,600  -->  00:02:29,880
.

32

00:02:29,880  -->  00:02:37,920
Once you've installed get and you have your wife and files you can get to include them in the next snapshot

33

00:02:37,940  -->  00:02:38,450
.

34

00:02:39,000  -->  00:02:43,360
So that is the next layer is called the staging area.

35

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:50,130
And when you tell get to include files in the next snapshot in the next commit what you're doing is

36

00:02:50,130  -->  00:02:57,180
you're adding files to the staging area so you have your pipe and project with your Python code and

37

00:02:57,180  -->  00:03:01,600
you can add your code into the staging area using a get command.

38

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:04,090
And we're going to go into that.

39

00:03:04,350  -->  00:03:10,200
Once you've added your files to the staging area they are in the staging area but get hasn't really

40

00:03:10,200  -->  00:03:12,040
done anything with them yet.

41

00:03:13,110  -->  00:03:21,030
But you can create a snapshot of the files in the staging area and this snapshot is called the commit

42

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:24,290
when you create a snapshot.

43

00:03:24,390  -->  00:03:28,800
You commit your staging area your staging area becomes empty.

44

00:03:29,130  -->  00:03:36,810
You don't lose the files naturally but the snapshot is created and is stored inside the folder.

45

00:03:36,990  -->  00:03:39,750
What happens once you've committed your files.

46

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:45,510
Is that now the snapshot are puts in a history and you can go back to the previous snapshot.

47

00:03:45,510  -->  00:03:52,800
You can delete snapshots which deletes part of your files and you know you can undo some snapshots or

48

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:54,190
or that sort of stuff.

49

00:03:54,210  -->  00:03:57,490
We're going to go into all the things you can do.

50

00:03:57,630  -->  00:04:03,030
Finally after you've created this snapshot when you've committed your files you can optionally push

51

00:04:03,030  -->  00:04:06,710
them to the cloud push them to a get service.

52

00:04:06,720  -->  00:04:11,010
So just get hub and another services bitbucket they also get lab.

53

00:04:11,010  -->  00:04:12,070
There's a bunch of them.

54

00:04:12,480  -->  00:04:15,840
Once you push them to the cloud which as I said is optional.

55

00:04:16,110  -->  00:04:22,380
This gives you some redundancy if your hard drive fails you will not lose your files because they are

56

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:28,850
in get hub for example and then you can download them again when you push to the cloud.

57

00:04:28,950  -->  00:04:31,260
What you are pushing is your snapshot.

58

00:04:31,620  -->  00:04:36,280
So your history of the changes that you've made to over time are saved.

59

00:04:36,510  -->  00:04:43,410
So for example if you spend a month of working on a project making one snapshot per day and then you

60

00:04:43,410  -->  00:04:45,750
lose your hard drive but you pushed it to the cloud.

61

00:04:45,750  -->  00:04:52,980
Before that you can download the repository from get hub and that contains the snapshots that you did

62

00:04:53,040  -->  00:05:00,000
each day which is nice because that means you never really lose any work at all.

63

00:05:00,000  -->  00:05:01,460
So these are the different layers.

64

00:05:01,530  -->  00:05:06,840
And it's important to remember where your files are in each of these layers although there are commands

65

00:05:06,840  -->  00:05:11,770
to check that all of your files are always in your file system.

66

00:05:11,790  -->  00:05:14,580
They never leave your file system.

67

00:05:14,910  -->  00:05:20,730
Then you can initialize get with a special command that gives you get Powers's actually in a folder

68

00:05:20,750  -->  00:05:20,960
.

69

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:25,260
And once you have that you can add files to the staging area.

70

00:05:25,740  -->  00:05:29,230
Then you can commit the files that are in your staging area.

71

00:05:29,430  -->  00:05:38,490
And finally you can push the commits to the cloud so to remember each layer has a function and it is

72

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:40,790
optional to push your commits to a remote repository.

73

00:05:40,830  -->  00:05:45,760
Although that provides that redundancy that security that you're never going to lose your files.

74

00:05:45,840  -->  00:05:52,740
And remember also that layers are physical and they are all stored inside a hidden folder that gets

75

00:05:52,740  -->  00:05:55,740
created when you initialize get inside a folder.

76

00:05:55,740  -->  00:06:02,370
When you initialize your repository we're going to be looking at this in a few videos of the next section

77

00:06:03,150  -->  00:06:07,530
so that you can understand really what's happening behind the scenes and how you can interact with it

78

00:06:07,850  -->  00:06:09,930
in these levels.

79

00:06:09,930  -->  00:06:10,930
That's it for this video.

80

00:06:11,070  -->  00:06:12,910
And I see you in the next one.
