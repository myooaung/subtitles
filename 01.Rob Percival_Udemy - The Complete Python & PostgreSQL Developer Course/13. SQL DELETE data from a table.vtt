Hi and welcome back in this video we're looking at the delete command which allows you to delete rows

2

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:14.340
from your tables but delete command is dangerous because of the warning issued in the last video delete

3

00:00:14.430  -->  00:00:21.740
allows you to delete everything in a table unless you specify specific rows to delete.

4

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:28.670
So I'm going to say delete from and then the table name items.

5

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:32.710
And if I run this query I'm screwed.

6

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:38.360
To put it simply in my case I have very little data so I wouldn't be that badly.

7

00:00:38.580  -->  00:00:47.190
But if you have a large database with things that you care about don't forget the where because if you

8

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:50.430
do you will be in a lot of pain.

9

00:00:50.580  -->  00:01:00.660
So I'm going to delete from items an ID equals 1 in 4 and that would delete the item number 4.

10

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:04.420
And is an important thing to remember.

11

00:01:04.440  -->  00:01:08.100
That way if I run this query I'm not sure if it'll work or not.

12

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:09.210
Let's run it.

13

00:01:10.110  -->  00:01:15.370
And indeed it doesn't quite work because Pasko sequel is smart.

14

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:20.610
And this is actually going nicely with what we're going to be looking at very soon.

15

00:01:20.610  -->  00:01:23.080
So that is why I am putting this in here.

16

00:01:23.220  -->  00:01:33.540
I'm deleting an item but the Avra says update or delete on table items Violet's foreign key constraint

17

00:01:34.760  -->  00:01:38.410
and then the name of the foreign key constraint on table purchases.

18

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:45.340
The key ID for is still referenced from table purchases which is great.

19

00:01:45.360  -->  00:01:48.290
Trust me it's great that it doesn't let you do this.

20

00:01:48.360  -->  00:01:50.740
I have another table called purchases.

21

00:01:50.940  -->  00:01:58.230
And in that table I am referencing this item with ID fall and possible sequel knows that I'm referencing

22

00:01:58.230  -->  00:01:58.680
that item.

23

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:02.330
So it doesn't let me delete it just in case I'm doing it by accident.

24

00:02:02.970  -->  00:02:08.850
What I have to do is go to the purchases stable and delete the rows where the item is used and then

25

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:10.280
I can delete the item.

26

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:18.510
This relationship between those two tables is what makes sequel so fantastic and it means that there

27

00:02:18.520  -->  00:02:27.600
is a bit more security or when making a delete to explain why this is being used and how let's select

28

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:30.720
everything from purchases

29

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:42.330
and as you can see these purchases table has three columns the ID of the purchase an item ID and a customer

30

00:02:42.330  -->  00:02:52.410
id the item id here at some point is number for them which means that's the way I've constructed this

31

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:59.180
table Pascua sequel knows that this number four relates to the item in the other table.

32

00:02:59.190  -->  00:03:04.480
So when I try to the least vitam it tells me hey you're all using this item elsewhere.

33

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:10.170
If you delete this item then this thing here is going to break and you don't want that.

34

00:03:10.170  -->  00:03:14.520
So what I have to do is delete this row here and then I can delete the item.

35

00:03:14.520  -->  00:03:18.600
So let's do that deletes from purchases.

36

00:03:18.610  -->  00:03:21.900
Where item ID equals four.

37

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:30.200
And they will delete all the purchases made of item 4 which is the item.

38

00:03:30.270  -->  00:03:31.710
So two rows were affected.

39

00:03:31.710  -->  00:03:32.910
Two rows were deleted.

40

00:03:32.910  -->  00:03:40.520
And now if we select from items then we've got that locked up there.

41

00:03:40.670  -->  00:03:47.420
And we can go the leads from items where ID was full.

42

00:03:47.730  -->  00:03:53.330
And now this will let me do that because it is no longer being used elsewhere.

43

00:03:54.150  -->  00:04:00.300
Notice that you have to set up your tables in specific ways for possible sequel to know that that link

44

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:01.940
is meaningful.

45

00:04:02.040  -->  00:04:05.220
And we're going to get into how you can do that later on.

46

00:04:05.280  -->  00:04:12.960
But I just want you to realize that delete is dangerous and you have some security if you've set up

47

00:04:12.960  -->  00:04:16.760
your data correctly but you're not going to delete the wrong things.

48

00:04:16.800  -->  00:04:20.420
So it's still it's still very powerful very dangerous.

49

00:04:20.460  -->  00:04:23.500
Boy you have some security there as well.

50

00:04:23.580  -->  00:04:26.340
So this is how you delete from a specific table.

51

00:04:26.340  -->  00:04:31.110
And with that said let's move on to the next video and I'll see you there.
