00:00:00,400  -->  00:00:05,850
We'll come back in this video we're looking at how to create your get up repository.

2

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:10,950
The first thing you have to do is sign up pick a username and email address and a password and sign

3

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:12,430
up for get help.

4

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:14,910
I'm going to just sign in into my profile

5

00:00:18,990  -->  00:00:22,920
and then you will be received with something like this.

6

00:00:23,220  -->  00:00:28,860
Naturally you may not have this history on the left all these repositories that you've contributed to

7

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:33,000
or your own repositories it'll all be empty but that's OK.

8

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:36,150
Let's go into a new repository.

9

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:39,490
And here you can choose a repository name.

10

00:00:39,730  -->  00:00:44,420
This should be descriptive about what your project does.

11

00:00:44,420  -->  00:00:51,760
So for example it could be a sequel analytics app for example.

12

00:00:51,760  -->  00:00:55,390
And here you can write a description if you want.

13

00:00:55,410  -->  00:00:58,350
Finally whether it is public or private.

14

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:03,420
Initially you may want to send it to private while you do some work on it and then change it to public

15

00:01:03,450  -->  00:01:07,870
later on if you want people to be able to see it or you can just leave it as public from the beginning

16

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:08,180
.

17

00:01:08,590  -->  00:01:13,920
And that way everybody can see that sort of work you're doing on it.

18

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:16,990
Finally you can also initialize the repository with the read me.

19

00:01:17,190  -->  00:01:24,930
And if you do this then sort of the stuff we've done already with Kate gets a bit nullified.

20

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:27,760
To some extent not not really but to some extent.

21

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:32,760
Let's not do that and we're going to go into creating a read me over the next few years.

22

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:34,590
Finally just press create repository

23

00:01:38,010  -->  00:01:39,510
and then you get some information

24

00:01:42,300  -->  00:01:44,400
you can create a new repository.

25

00:01:44,610  -->  00:01:49,030
You can push to an existing repository or you can import code from another report.

26

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:55,530
Let's forget about this option and look at these two to create a new repository on the command line

27

00:01:55,530  -->  00:01:55,560
.

28

00:01:55,560  -->  00:02:03,090
We've already seen how to do this with get in it and then they do a bunch more things like create a

29

00:02:03,090  -->  00:02:04,290
read me File.

30

00:02:04,290  -->  00:02:10,050
We're going to look at that and then they do commit and then they do a couple more things to add this

31

00:02:10,230  -->  00:02:17,460
sequel analytic app repository as the remote repository will look at that as well or from an existing

32

00:02:17,460  -->  00:02:22,690
repository which we have then we could just do the last two options.

33

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:28,650
This is how you create the repository in get and we're going to be looking at the next steps in the

34

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:29,820
next few over the years.

35

00:02:29,980  -->  00:02:31,400
I'll see you there.
