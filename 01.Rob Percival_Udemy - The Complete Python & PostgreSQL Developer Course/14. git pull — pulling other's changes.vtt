00:00:00.960  -->  00:00:08.640
Hi and welcome back in this video we're looking at pulling other people's changes now because we're

2

00:00:08.640  -->  00:00:10.470
working by ourselves in this project.

3

00:00:10.500  -->  00:00:15.890
We're not going to be receiving changes or nobody else is going to be making changes to our remote repository

4

00:00:15.890  -->  00:00:16.340
.

5

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:19.980
However it's important to know how you can do that.

6

00:00:20.420  -->  00:00:25.400
To remember get easy distributed version control system.

7

00:00:25.440  -->  00:00:31.080
That means that if you are working with somebody else you can both download the remote repository.

8

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:33.010
You can clone it.

9

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:40.980
And that means you will both have all of the code in the application and then the other person can make

10

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:43.020
some changes you can make some changes.

11

00:00:43.110  -->  00:00:48.120
Hopefully not in the same files that tends to be a problem but nevertheless you can both make changes

12

00:00:48.990  -->  00:00:55.800
then you can both push the changes and then naturally you'll both want to download and receive the other

13

00:00:55.800  -->  00:00:57.540
person's changes.

14

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:03.920
So what to do in this case is do get pull and that's it.

15

00:01:03.990  -->  00:01:11.130
If the other person has committed that changes into the master branch then get pool will automatically

16

00:01:11.310  -->  00:01:17.820
download and the master branch because we are currently in the master branch which we can check with

17

00:01:17.820  -->  00:01:24.350
get status on branch must if we do get pull it will try to download things from M..

18

00:01:24.350  -->  00:01:29.190
But it is already up to date because we are the only person making changes here.

19

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:37.400
But that is how you pull changes that other people have pushed into the master branch.

20

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:42.220
This section is not meant to be a complete view on everything gets deleted.

21

00:01:42.380  -->  00:01:44.940
So we've not looked at branches.

22

00:01:44.940  -->  00:01:49.720
However it is possible to create branches and then download other people's created branches.

23

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:55.680
As long as they've pushed them previously and there's also a bunch of other things that we can do however

24

00:01:55.950  -->  00:02:00.480
I wanted to introduce you to get so that the projects that we create in the scores and other projects

25

00:02:00.480  -->  00:02:07.080
that you create for your own pleasure you can put them in get hub for your employers to see and for

26

00:02:07.080  -->  00:02:12.440
other people to see as well in these projects you'll most likely be working by yourself.

27

00:02:12.630  -->  00:02:19.350
But if it does come to having to work with other people please do read the good hub to get documentation

28

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:21.850
which is an get dash Cmdr.

29

00:02:21.870  -->  00:02:27.570
Com we've seen that in the past and or optionally you can search for more.

30

00:02:27.570  -->  00:02:30.290
Get guides on the internet.

31

00:02:30.300  -->  00:02:32.730
Remember this is not a complete get.

32

00:02:32.730  -->  00:02:36.840
Course this is just meant to introduce you to some of the things that it can do.

33

00:02:36.840  -->  00:02:42.570
You can start putting your project in there OK and hope you enjoyed the section.

34

00:02:42.690  -->  00:02:46.360
Everything for it and we'll see you in the next one.
