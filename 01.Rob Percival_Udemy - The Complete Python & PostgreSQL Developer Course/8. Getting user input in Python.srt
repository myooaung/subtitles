00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:04,800
Hi and welcome back in this video let's look at the input method.

2

00:00:05,540  -->  00:00:12,090
In the last video we created a program that would sense the age to be five and then it would tell the

3

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:17,910
user that they've lived for a certain number of seconds as an extension.

4

00:00:17,910  -->  00:00:24,300
I suggested you may want to tell the user how many years that correspond to and that is simple enough

5

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:24,320
.

6

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:26,450
You just have to add something more.

7

00:00:26,760  -->  00:00:34,960
This corresponds to SDI age years.

8

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:40,290
So when we do that and save it and then we can you have left for that number of seconds.

9

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:42,230
This corresponds to five years.

10

00:00:42,240  -->  00:00:45,750
So remember the only thing we have to do is add in this string.

11

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:52,800
This corresponds to and then adds that the string representation of age which is five and then printout

12

00:00:53,390  -->  00:00:56,260
years aswell.

13

00:00:56,790  -->  00:01:01,290
However this is not necessary if the user tells us the age.

14

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:05,490
So that's what we want to achieve in this video.

15

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:10,950
We want the user to give us the age first and then we will calculate the seconds from that.

16

00:01:10,950  -->  00:01:16,050
So therefore we don't need to tell the user how many years this corresponds to because they've all told

17

00:01:16,050  -->  00:01:18,040
us the age before.

18

00:01:18,690  -->  00:01:22,620
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make small changes to this program.

19

00:01:22,800  -->  00:01:29,900
The first thing I'm going to do is actually remove this line just for this video.

20

00:01:29,970  -->  00:01:33,960
And the way I'm going to do that is instead of deleting it I'm going to do what's called commenting

21

00:01:33,960  -->  00:01:34,610
it out.

22

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:41,210
So I'm going to change this line into a comment and what a comment does is it simply does nothing.

23

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:44,850
So we can make this line a comment and then it won't run.

24

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:51,150
So Python won't execute this line the way we do that in Python it's by putting a hash symbol in front

25

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:51,380
of it.

26

00:01:51,400  -->  00:01:57,080
That small sort of hash or sharp if you study music that's the shops as well.

27

00:01:57,420  -->  00:01:58,820
So that's Simbel there.

28

00:01:59,460  -->  00:02:01,050
And now this line is never going to run.

29

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:07,380
So if we save this and run the module again we don't get anything back because we've only declared the

30

00:02:07,380  -->  00:02:12,940
variable and not printed it out because this doesn't run OK.

31

00:02:13,290  -->  00:02:15,720
So instead of age equals five.

32

00:02:15,750  -->  00:02:24,380
What I want to do is say input and in here and your age OK.

33

00:02:24,390  -->  00:02:27,530
So any guesses as to what this is going to do.

34

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:34,430
What are we going to get out in this program when we save and run it.

35

00:02:34,660  -->  00:02:40,050
So what happens now is that we get a small prompt and the prompt says enter your age and then we've

36

00:02:40,050  -->  00:02:45,650
got a blinking carrot where we can now pipe in our age.

37

00:02:45,650  -->  00:02:52,410
So I'm going to type 10 and naturally nothing happens because if we go back to our program we've only

38

00:02:52,650  -->  00:02:59,940
set the age to be something and we've not actually done anything with it.

39

00:03:00,420  -->  00:03:00,910
OK.

40

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:06,360
So let's uncomment this line and save that and run it again.

41

00:03:07,350  -->  00:03:10,310
And now I'm actually a bit scared of running this program.

42

00:03:10,410  -->  00:03:17,450
And before I type anything and run the program I'm going to tell you why am I scared.

43

00:03:18,090  -->  00:03:23,230
Let's go back to the program and look past this input method.

44

00:03:23,790  -->  00:03:28,740
So we're asking the user to enter their age.

45

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:34,980
That means the user can type something that means the user can type a letter A for example or a string

46

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:35,050
.

47

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:38,350
They can type the name or they can type their age.

48

00:03:38,420  -->  00:03:40,350
That means they can type anything they want.

49

00:03:40,350  -->  00:03:46,650
Which means that Python is not going to be able to extract meaning from that which means that most likely

50

00:03:47,160  -->  00:03:49,610
the result of this.

51

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:55,580
The thing that the user types is meant to be stored in age but it's probably not going to be an number

52

00:03:55,590  -->  00:03:55,620
.

53

00:03:55,620  -->  00:04:00,900
It's probably not going to be an integer because a user can type anything they want.

54

00:04:00,900  -->  00:04:08,280
So therefore I would assume that the output of this method is going to be a string.

55

00:04:08,790  -->  00:04:15,640
Ok so assuming that 80 is a string what is going to happen when we do this.

56

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:22,410
And if you recall the second video I believe we talked about what happened when we multiply the string

57

00:04:22,770  -->  00:04:30,240
by a number and what is going to happen is I'm not going to run the program because it will crash my

58

00:04:30,510  -->  00:04:31,500
computer.

59

00:04:31,500  -->  00:04:34,520
Is that it will give us 365

60

00:04:36,570  -->  00:04:44,550
units of the age is going to multiply the age string by 365 which is going to give us 365 numbers and

61

00:04:44,560  -->  00:04:47,950
then we're going to multiply that by 24 and they're going to multiply that by 60.

62

00:04:47,990  -->  00:04:53,400
Then when I'm older brother Mike 60 so if we type the number 5 in here we're actually going to get a

63

00:04:53,400  -->  00:04:56,940
long string made up of fives.

64

00:04:56,940  -->  00:05:01,030
Now we don't want that because there are so many that it will crash.

65

00:05:01,260  -->  00:05:03,510
So let's not do that.

66

00:05:03,870  -->  00:05:07,050
And instead let's turn do something else.

67

00:05:07,050  -->  00:05:12,790
So how do we convert a string to a number so we can use it in here.

68

00:05:13,110  -->  00:05:15,960
And that's exactly what we're going to be looking at in the next video.

69

00:05:16,140  -->  00:05:21,750
And if you decide to run this program do it at your own peril because most likely your computer will

70

00:05:21,750  -->  00:05:25,890
crash momentarily but it's easy enough to stop it so you can run this if you want to you can just close

71

00:05:25,890  -->  00:05:28,870
the window after and it was not the problem.

72

00:05:29,580  -->  00:05:30,140
OK.

73

00:05:30,330  -->  00:05:36,340
So let's go into the next video and look at how we can convert the age into a number and see you there

74

00:05:36,350  -->  00:05:37,600
.
