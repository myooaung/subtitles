00:00:00,750  -->  00:00:06,590
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to look at saving as Jason and to be honest.

2

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:11,370
Saving as Jason always just feels a lot cleaner to me.

3

00:00:11,700  -->  00:00:21,600
Something I see as V feels a bit 2000s or 90s you know seeing as Jason is is cleaner and it's more structured

4

00:00:22,080  -->  00:00:26,410
and it allows you some greater flexibility gives you more more power.

5

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:29,250
Let's look at how we could do that.

6

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:37,640
So first of all I'm going to delete because C as V is from the last century and we don't want that well

7

00:00:37,700  -->  00:00:42,450
that we're probably all from the last century what's in this book you know and we're going to save us

8

00:00:42,450  -->  00:00:42,470
.

9

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:44,360
Jason instead.

10

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:50,820
Jason is essentially a python dictionary.

11

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:54,110
It's a python dictionary that can have lists in it.

12

00:00:54,840  -->  00:01:04,750
So if we were to export the user to Jason we would simply want a dictionary representation of the user

13

00:01:04,760  -->  00:01:06,060
.

14

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:08,660
So it would be something like.

15

00:01:08,970  -->  00:01:17,750
Name itself that name movies itself that movies.

16

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:26,370
And I'll tell me this is not cleaner than all the other hassle we had going about with this C S V saving

17

00:01:26,360  -->  00:01:28,120
.

18

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:36,990
There was a small problem however when we save when we write this to a file itself don't movies is going

19

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:41,270
to be a list of this stuff when we convert it to a string.

20

00:01:41,680  -->  00:01:42,980
And naturally we don't want that.

21

00:01:42,980  -->  00:01:44,430
It doesn't tell us enough.

22

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:52,320
We need to be able to save the movie's name Yanar and whether we've watched it or not.

23

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:59,700
So what I'm going to do here is the movies that I'm going to be saving to a file are going to be movie

24

00:01:59,700  -->  00:01:59,980
don't.

25

00:01:59,990  -->  00:02:07,920
Jason for movie in south movies we've done this before this construct this list comprehension stuff

26

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:11,810
and we don't need the opening for some black audience right.

27

00:02:11,830  -->  00:02:21,110
But that is what this is going to do is create a list of movie don't Jason for each of the movies in

28

00:02:21,120  -->  00:02:22,900
movie.

29

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:24,180
So we have two movies.

30

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:30,380
This list will contain two movie don't Jasen one movie that Jason for the first movie and one movie

31

00:02:30,380  -->  00:02:32,760
got Jason for the second movie.

32

00:02:32,760  -->  00:02:35,550
Naturally movie Jason doesn't exist.

33

00:02:35,550  -->  00:02:37,790
So we have to go and create that.

34

00:02:37,890  -->  00:02:41,490
Let's go to movie and create a Jason method.

35

00:02:43,110  -->  00:02:53,490
And once again this has to be a dictionary representation of the movie name of that name Jano self-taught

36

00:02:53,490  -->  00:03:02,380
genre watched but watched.

37

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:11,670
And what this does once again just a me with the movie's name with a key name the key genre on the movie

38

00:03:11,670  -->  00:03:14,950
genre the key watched and whether it's been watched on.

39

00:03:15,930  -->  00:03:22,300
And now the user will save the user's name but also the movies.

40

00:03:22,380  -->  00:03:26,860
Jason for each of the movies in self-taught movies.

41

00:03:28,650  -->  00:03:37,290
Let's go back into apt on P Y and create me again and add a couple of movies which are in the Matrix

42

00:03:38,410  -->  00:03:48,150
so I guess I probably get pretty bored of seeing me type this at movie and the end of you comedy and

43

00:03:48,150  -->  00:03:50,580
finally print user Daut.

44

00:03:50,640  -->  00:03:53,260
Jason let's see what comes out of it.

45

00:03:53,710  -->  00:03:55,390
Let's roll it.

46

00:03:55,700  -->  00:03:57,740
And this is what we get.

47

00:03:58,080  -->  00:04:07,030
We get the name which is the user's name and then the movies which is a massive list of movies.

48

00:04:07,320  -->  00:04:14,190
And for each movie we have the dictionary that his movie does Jason with the genre the name and whether

49

00:04:14,190  -->  00:04:22,770
it's been watched on that key thing here that is quite nice the name and the genre are strings as demonstrated

50

00:04:22,890  -->  00:04:32,910
by the quotation marks watched is not a string because Jason supports truthy values supports boolean

51

00:04:32,910  -->  00:04:36,280
values so we can save things directly as true or false.

52

00:04:36,360  -->  00:04:41,310
Which is Quincy's we don't have to worry about converting it later.

53

00:04:41,370  -->  00:04:45,150
Now if wanted to save this to a file.

54

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:52,560
What we would have to do is open the file and save it or we could use a library which is adjacent library

55

00:04:52,570  -->  00:04:52,930
.

56

00:04:53,400  -->  00:04:54,700
So I'm going to import it.

57

00:04:54,720  -->  00:05:00,240
Jason appear and what I want to do is see Jason dot load.

58

00:05:00,390  -->  00:05:06,300
So I save dump top that's the word dump.

59

00:05:06,930  -->  00:05:13,260
And what I want to dump into is the file pointer.

60

00:05:13,260  -->  00:05:25,170
So with open my file that takes the right mood as if Jason dump and what I want to dump is in F at least

61

00:05:25,180  -->  00:05:27,730
I think that's the way it goes.

62

00:05:27,960  -->  00:05:34,900
I want to dump user Jason my band into APH and let's run that.

63

00:05:35,390  -->  00:05:40,470
And now let's open my father 60 and we got Jason in there.

64

00:05:42,480  -->  00:05:43,030
OK.

65

00:05:43,170  -->  00:05:51,750
So to recap we previewed a user added a couple of movies and then we're going to dump with the adjacent

66

00:05:51,750  -->  00:05:59,030
module the users Jasen into F which f is the file we've opened up here.

67

00:05:59,750  -->  00:06:04,530
And as you guys know I'm going a bit faster now because you guys are getting more acquainted with Python

68

00:06:04,770  -->  00:06:05,030
.

69

00:06:05,360  -->  00:06:08,390
And you have no problem following what I'm doing.

70

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:15,590
I hope with that said let's move on to the next video where we're going to be looking at Jason daat

71

00:06:15,630  -->  00:06:22,290
load which is going to allow us to read some Jason and then use it to reconstruct our youth.

72

00:06:22,790  -->  00:06:24,870
I'll see you there.
