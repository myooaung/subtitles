1

00:00:00,350  -->  00:00:06,360
High will come back in this video we're going to allow users to search and I realized the title is maybe

2

00:00:06,360  -->  00:00:07,560
not very clear.

3

00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:14,460
We've already got the search endpoint and that has a query string parameter that the user can type directly

4

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:17,170
into the you or else to perform a search.

5

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:22,650
But really what I meant is we're going to be creating a form that the users can fill in so that they

6

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:26,220
can then perform the search more easily.

7

00:00:26,220  -->  00:00:32,790
Let's open up our template file and go into the profile page when the user arrives at the profile page

8

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:33,060
.

9

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:35,120
They are already going to be logged in.

10

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:42,350
Which means the user can go from the profile page to the search page and that's fine.

11

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:48,330
And it wouldn't be fine if they are not logged in because the search page requires a user to be locked

12

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:53,520
in in order to perform the Twitter search using the API.

13

00:00:53,520  -->  00:01:03,900
So we can allow the user to perform a search on Twitter from their profile if we put the form in the

14

00:01:03,900  -->  00:01:04,770
home page.

15

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:09,330
The user may not be logged in at that point and then they will try to search and then it will fail because

16

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:10,210
they're not locked in.

17

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:12,760
So that's why I like to put it in the profile page instead.

18

00:01:12,870  -->  00:01:13,910
At this point.

19

00:01:14,630  -->  00:01:15,430
OK.

20

00:01:15,820  -->  00:01:21,150
Well we're going to be doing is we're going to be writing some hated e-mail code which is going to display

21

00:01:21,150  -->  00:01:22,410
a form.

22

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:30,450
The first thing to do is to type in form and include a tag and pyjamas should it may or may not close

23

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:30,980
it for you.

24

00:01:30,980  -->  00:01:38,100
So the opening tag is just form and the closing tag is form but with the forward slash and then we're

25

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:46,990
going to do is put in an input and the input tag just creates a field and it creates a text field.

26

00:01:47,010  -->  00:01:49,000
If the type is set to be text.

27

00:01:49,140  -->  00:01:55,380
So that's just a text field where the users can type something and then we're going to set up two more

28

00:01:55,380  -->  00:01:55,920
properties.

29

00:01:55,920  -->  00:02:04,410
The name which is going to be q and the ID which is going to be q and clip and then we're also going

30

00:02:04,410  -->  00:02:08,960
to set a button of pipe submit.

31

00:02:09,890  -->  00:02:11,790
And here we're going to type in search.

32

00:02:11,790  -->  00:02:17,400
So what this is doing is we're creating a field a text field which we're calling.

33

00:02:17,400  -->  00:02:24,690
Q And has the idea you were going to go into what the queue is a moment and then we're also going to

34

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:31,730
create a button of type submit the buttons of type submit when they get pressed they send the form some

35

00:02:31,730  -->  00:02:32,240
way.

36

00:02:32,340  -->  00:02:40,010
And when we send the form the content of the text field we get sent where we specify.

37

00:02:40,020  -->  00:02:46,740
OK let's go into our log in which would this is what we've got right now in the profile page we've got

38

00:02:46,740  -->  00:02:49,770
a text field and we've got a search button.

39

00:02:49,800  -->  00:02:50,870
OK.

40

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:54,770
Now we can also add a placeholder

41

00:02:58,920  -->  00:03:03,350
and we can either placeholder make it equal to your Twitter search or anything else.

42

00:03:03,540  -->  00:03:04,710
And we will refresh.

43

00:03:04,710  -->  00:03:08,200
Now that's kind of they are grayed out and we can start typing on top.

44

00:03:08,370  -->  00:03:08,830
OK.

45

00:03:08,970  -->  00:03:14,100
So that just gives the user a bit of a bit more information regarding what they might be expected to

46

00:03:14,100  -->  00:03:16,010
type.

47

00:03:16,090  -->  00:03:24,300
However it is best to also put a label label that describes what the input field this fall.

48

00:03:24,300  -->  00:03:25,680
So let's do that.

49

00:03:25,680  -->  00:03:30,820
We're going to put in a label and four is going to be q and that Q is the ID.

50

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:41,290
Q And the label is going to say something like Twitter search and when we refresh we now get that with

51

00:03:41,290  -->  00:03:42,360
a search there.

52

00:03:42,620  -->  00:03:44,470
OK.

53

00:03:45,330  -->  00:03:48,310
Now when we press search.

54

00:03:48,870  -->  00:03:51,100
Nothing really seems to happen let's type something in here.

55

00:03:51,120  -->  00:03:51,990
Hello.

56

00:03:52,260  -->  00:03:59,620
The press search and as you can see they there's a queue Hello up there.

57

00:04:00,450  -->  00:04:09,370
So when we press search we generated a query string parameter called Q and MIGA equal to Haloo.

58

00:04:09,420  -->  00:04:18,060
Now if we can instead of worrying when we do that like high for example what happened is that we stay

59

00:04:18,060  -->  00:04:24,750
on this page but it refreshes and with the pretty strong parameter if we can instead of staying on this

60

00:04:24,750  -->  00:04:33,720
page send the user over to the search page with the query string parameter that is going to perform

61

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:35,210
the search essentially.

62

00:04:35,790  -->  00:04:41,400
Because with that query string parameter we're going to be able to read it and then pass it in to that

63

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:43,930
with a request like so.

64

00:04:43,980  -->  00:04:53,400
So go to our profile page and here make sure that it says action equals you are on the SQL for search

65

00:04:54,920  -->  00:04:57,400
and sorry this should be called I think Twitter search.

66

00:04:57,510  -->  00:05:00,140
Now just search OK that's fine.

67

00:05:00,150  -->  00:05:05,580
So what that's going to do is it's going to instead of send the data to the same page that the form

68

00:05:05,580  -->  00:05:11,250
is in it's going to send the data to a different page and the page is going to send it to is that you

69

00:05:11,250  -->  00:05:12,180
are out of there.

70

00:05:12,530  -->  00:05:15,610
OK let's refresh.

71

00:05:15,810  -->  00:05:17,610
And now perform the search like cars

72

00:05:21,390  -->  00:05:23,380
and there we go.

73

00:05:23,380  -->  00:05:28,530
We're searching now for cars only as you can see the query string is only cars and we could limit that

74

00:05:28,530  -->  00:05:33,280
further by going here and see a plus filter images for example.

75

00:05:33,540  -->  00:05:36,930
And now we get that there.

76

00:05:38,850  -->  00:05:45,140
And these are just encoded but they still mean and plus and color.

77

00:05:45,780  -->  00:05:53,040
So that's how we could create a simple form to send the user to the search page after they've typed

78

00:05:53,040  -->  00:05:57,010
something in an input field which we call queue this queue.

79

00:05:57,020  -->  00:06:00,720
There is the name of the query string parameter.

80

00:06:00,750  -->  00:06:02,410
So that's the question mark.

81

00:06:02,410  -->  00:06:04,100
Q That's happening.

82

00:06:04,680  -->  00:06:05,420
OK.

83

00:06:05,790  -->  00:06:07,280
So that's how you create a simple form.

84

00:06:07,410  -->  00:06:10,310
And again I reiterate this is not a similar course.

85

00:06:10,380  -->  00:06:17,190
So please if you want to learn more about this go ahead and do that now you're learning about serving

86

00:06:17,190  -->  00:06:18,850
these contents with Python.

87

00:06:19,050  -->  00:06:23,550
Learning more about the mail and see essays and Javascript is always a good thing as well.

88

00:06:24,150  -->  00:06:24,820
OK.

89

00:06:24,990  -->  00:06:25,980
That's it for this video.

90

00:06:26,040  -->  00:06:26,700
And thanks for that.

91

00:06:26,700  -->  00:06:31,590
And in the next video we're going to be doing sentiment analysis which is going to be very interesting

92

00:06:31,590  -->  00:06:31,620
.

93

00:06:31,620  -->  00:06:37,190
We're going to be able to color our tweets differently depending on whether the people writing the tweet

94

00:06:37,200  -->  00:06:40,690
were angry or happy things like that.

95

00:06:40,830  -->  00:06:42,370
So let's do that in our next video.

96

00:06:42,440  -->  00:06:43,020
And I'll see you there
