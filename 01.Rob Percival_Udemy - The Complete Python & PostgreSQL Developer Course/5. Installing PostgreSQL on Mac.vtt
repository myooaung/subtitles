00:00:00.230  -->  00:00:05.040
One we'll come back and there's video we're looking at installing Posterous equal on your Mac.

2

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:06.620
Now it's fairly simple to do.

3

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:12.420
Just go to post-career sequel dot org and then go into the downloads page.

4

00:00:12.420  -->  00:00:18.390
And here we can click on McQuiston And there's also a bunch of other binary packages available for other

5

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:19.690
operating systems.

6

00:00:19.710  -->  00:00:24.030
So if you're not using Mac if you got in here by accident you can go into the windows section or the

7

00:00:24.030  -->  00:00:26.850
Ubuntu section or indeed any others.

8

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:32.490
Let's click on my question and here we've got a few options.

9

00:00:33.210  -->  00:00:39.300
If you want a graphical interface then I'd recommend downloading the installer from Enterprise DB for

10

00:00:39.300  -->  00:00:40.910
all supported versions.

11

00:00:41.340  -->  00:00:48.000
That gives you a nice interface too through which you can interact with your Pasqua sequel installation

12

00:00:48.210  -->  00:00:50.640
and that's quite nice.

13

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:56.820
The postgrads not app is a simple app that runs on your menu bar and lets you run a sequel commands

14

00:00:57.420  -->  00:00:58.170
and that's quite nice.

15

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:04.720
It's very simple very basic but it'll do for this course for the most part.

16

00:01:04.800  -->  00:01:09.890
And finally you can also install Pasquier sequel using the usual think MacPorts and homebrewed.

17

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:12.420
If you don't know what these are then don't worry about it.

18

00:01:12.540  -->  00:01:19.650
If you know what these are advocates and using homebrew that's just probably the most stable of them

19

00:01:20.280  -->  00:01:20.720
.

20

00:01:20.970  -->  00:01:23.240
And then there's instructions on how to use that there.

21

00:01:23.370  -->  00:01:24.850
But I won't get into that in this video.

22

00:01:24.850  -->  00:01:30.210
Let's just focus on using the graphical installer since that's just a bit simpler and I gets the job

23

00:01:30.210  -->  00:01:30.940
done.

24

00:01:31.410  -->  00:01:34.110
Let's go to download the installer from Enterprise the B.

25

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:41.700
And here we have adverts and also the ability to download the version that we want and I'm going to

26

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:43.220
go for the latest version.

27

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:47.880
But I do notice that in some instances in some operating systems you won't have access to the latest

28

00:01:47.880  -->  00:01:49.740
version at all times.

29

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:54.060
For example if you're using a web server you may only have access to version nine point two and point

30

00:01:54.150  -->  00:01:55.340
three.

31

00:01:55.440  -->  00:01:57.420
But these are the later versions.

32

00:01:57.420  -->  00:01:59.140
So we're going to go with those.

33

00:01:59.310  -->  00:02:03.240
If you have a previous version you can use that as long as it's version 9.

34

00:02:03.330  -->  00:02:08.160
There's not going to be that many changes that you're going to need an entirely new version for this

35

00:02:08.160  -->  00:02:14.670
cause the changes are usually more advanced things that we're not going to be looking at in this course

36

00:02:14.670  -->  00:02:15.360
.

37

00:02:15.720  -->  00:02:20.400
But once again let's go to nine point five point two which is the latest version and I'm going to click

38

00:02:20.400  -->  00:02:29.490
on Mac OS 10 and I going to download the installer in a moment.

39

00:02:30.820  -->  00:02:34.260
OK then it's downloading.

40

00:02:34.470  -->  00:02:38.590
And I'm just going to speed this up real quick.

41

00:02:38.590  -->  00:02:43.520
And then we can look at that and open it up

42

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:50.950
and then just double click the installer here.

43

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:54.010
You may be asked to put in your passwords.

44

00:02:54.010  -->  00:03:01.730
I'm going to put my password in and the installer then starts.

45

00:03:02.610  -->  00:03:06.330
Which is right there.

46

00:03:08.460  -->  00:03:15.030
The installation directory has a default path and I would recommend staying with the defaults throughout

47

00:03:15.030  -->  00:03:18.020
the entire installation procedure.

48

00:03:18.180  -->  00:03:23.110
If you change something then you may have to change other things as well to make the program work.

49

00:03:23.130  -->  00:03:27.050
Which is why I recommend staying with the defaults in all cases.

50

00:03:27.300  -->  00:03:32.820
If you are unable to stay with defaults and then we will figure that out.

51

00:03:32.820  -->  00:03:39.300
Just ask a question in the course and we'll help you out if it doesn't work later directory's just where

52

00:03:39.300  -->  00:03:42.290
your data is going to be stored for Pasqua sequel.

53

00:03:42.630  -->  00:03:49.710
And here you are am asked to enter a password because we're going to be using this server only locally

54

00:03:49.710  -->  00:03:53.060
in your computer is not going to be accessible by other people.

55

00:03:53.280  -->  00:03:55.170
Then you can choose a really simple password.

56

00:03:55.470  -->  00:04:00.090
If you we're going to put this server out there and people were allowed to connect to the server for

57

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:05.700
example in a web site and so people might hack your server then you would want to choose a strong password

58

00:04:05.700  -->  00:04:06.180
.

59

00:04:06.180  -->  00:04:12.640
But because this is a local server then the password doesn't matter much.

60

00:04:12.690  -->  00:04:19.830
The port is essentially where your computer post-career sequel is going to look for connections and

61

00:04:19.830  -->  00:04:22.510
there's loads of ports that you can use.

62

00:04:22.620  -->  00:04:26.760
But the default one works well and I would leave it at that.

63

00:04:26.830  -->  00:04:30.760
Finally the locale is sort of the language that Persico is going to use.

64

00:04:30.870  -->  00:04:34.080
I'm going to leave it as the default as well.

65

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:35.220
And finally just press next.

66

00:04:35.280  -->  00:04:40.900
And then it starts to install.

67

00:04:40.900  -->  00:04:45.110
Funnily when that's installed you get asked to launch stack build which is for enterprise databases

68

00:04:45.120  -->  00:04:46.600
we're not going to check that.

69

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:51.420
And finally press finish you know we've got portable he can install in the next video we're going to

70

00:04:51.420  -->  00:04:56.310
look at how we can run it and how we can get the graphical user interface working and all that good

71

00:04:56.310  -->  00:04:57.200
stuff.

72

00:04:57.210  -->  00:04:58.050
So it's you in the next video
