<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:04,550
In this video, we're going to be installing psycopg2
3

3

00:00:04,550  -->  00:00:06,500
on Windows.
4

4

00:00:06,500  -->  00:00:09,660
Psycopg2 is a library for Python
5

5

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:13,000
that lets us talk to PostgreSQL databases
6

6

00:00:13,000  -->  00:00:14,223
from within our code.
7

7

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:18,090
Now, first of all, let me say that the method
8

8

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:22,210
I'm going to show you in this video is a fairly new method,
9

9

00:00:22,210  -->  00:00:25,230
so it's possible that it won't work for you
10

10

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:27,440
and if it doesn't, just move on to the next video
11

11

00:00:27,440  -->  00:00:30,470
and try a more manual approach.
12

12

00:00:30,470  -->  00:00:33,410
But first, try what's shown in this video
13

13

00:00:33,410  -->  00:00:34,933
because it's much simpler.
14

14

00:00:36,230  -->  00:00:37,780
The first thing you have to do
15

15

00:00:37,780  -->  00:00:42,060
is go ahead and open your File Explorer
16

16

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:46,760
and you need to go to your Python installation folder.
17

17

00:00:46,760  -->  00:00:51,540
In my case, the Python installation folder is this one here,
18

18

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:54,410
so that's C:\Users\Jose\AppData\
19

19

00:00:54,410  -->  00:00:58,090
Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts.
20

20

00:00:58,090  -->  00:01:01,010
Make sure you use the Python folder
21

21

00:01:01,010  -->  00:01:04,160
for the Python you've got installed and you want to use.
22

22

00:01:04,160  -->  00:01:06,650
In my case, I've only got Python 3.7 installed.
23

23

00:01:06,650  -->  00:01:09,610
But if you have multiple versions of Python installed,
24

24

00:01:09,610  -->  00:01:13,053
just make sure you use the one that you want to use.
25

25

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:16,250
Once you've got this, put it aside,
26

26

00:01:16,250  -->  00:01:19,203
and then open up your Settings.
27

27

00:01:22,280  -->  00:01:24,250
In here, we're gonna find a setting
28

28

00:01:24,250  -->  00:01:25,850
which is, just type PATH,
29

29

00:01:25,850  -->  00:01:28,290
and it will tell you Edit environment variables
30

30

00:01:28,290  -->  00:01:30,350
for your account or something similar.
31

31

00:01:30,350  -->  00:01:33,340
So, you can click on that, come over here,
32

32

00:01:33,340  -->  00:01:35,020
and just make it a little bit bigger
33

33

00:01:35,020  -->  00:01:37,390
to see what's in your path.
34

34

00:01:37,390  -->  00:01:39,270
And what you wanna make sure
35

35

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:43,480
is that either this Path under User variables
36

36

00:01:43,480  -->  00:01:48,480
or this Path under System variables has your Python path.
37

37

00:01:50,240  -->  00:01:52,990
If it doesn't, well, you can see it here by the way
38

38

00:01:52,990  -->  00:01:57,480
in my User variables, if it doesn't contain that,
39

39

00:01:57,480  -->  00:02:02,070
just double-click it and add a new field here
40

40

00:02:02,070  -->  00:02:04,100
and put the path in it.
41

41

00:02:04,100  -->  00:02:08,057
The path has to be the path to Python\Scripts,
42

42

00:02:09,320  -->  00:02:12,143
so make sure you add the Scripts in there.
43

43

00:02:13,120  -->  00:02:14,320
Okay.
44

44

00:02:14,320  -->  00:02:15,440
We're gonna start with that.
45

45

00:02:15,440  -->  00:02:16,900
Make sure it's there.
46

46

00:02:16,900  -->  00:02:18,280
And once you've got it there,
47

47

00:02:18,280  -->  00:02:20,630
don't close any of these just yet,
48

48

00:02:20,630  -->  00:02:24,423
go ahead and open the Command Prompt.
49

49

00:02:26,210  -->  00:02:28,580
The Command Prompt may look a bit scary
50

50

00:02:28,580  -->  00:02:31,890
but it's just a text interface to your computer.
51

51

00:02:31,890  -->  00:02:34,440
So basically, you can use it to run programmes
52

52

00:02:34,440  -->  00:02:38,090
or do anything your computer can do
53

53

00:02:38,090  -->  00:02:41,040
but with text instead of graphics.
54

54

00:02:41,040  -->  00:02:43,680
Something we can do in the Command Prompt
55

55

00:02:43,680  -->  00:02:47,473
is, for example, type pip.
56

56

00:02:48,360  -->  00:02:52,500
Pip is the Python package installer
57

57

00:02:52,500  -->  00:02:53,980
and we can use it to instal
58

58

00:02:53,980  -->  00:02:56,940
any Python libraries that we want.
59

59

00:02:56,940  -->  00:03:00,270
And in this case, we're gonna use it to instal psycopg2,
60

60

00:03:00,270  -->  00:03:04,753
so all you have to do is type pip instal psycopg2.
61

61

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:09,650
Now, if this works,
62

62

00:03:09,650  -->  00:03:12,963
you'll just see it instals without any issues.
63

63

00:03:14,090  -->  00:03:17,390
And if that works, you can try to type Python
64

64

00:03:17,390  -->  00:03:19,013
and see what happens.
65

65

00:03:19,880  -->  00:03:21,330
If Python is not recognised
66

66

00:03:21,330  -->  00:03:23,040
as an internal or external command,
67

67

00:03:23,040  -->  00:03:26,223
that means that we need to add one more thing to our path.
68

68

00:03:27,070  -->  00:03:29,000
So, go back to your environment variables,
69

69

00:03:29,000  -->  00:03:32,210
double-click your path, click New,
70

70

00:03:32,210  -->  00:03:33,930
and what we're gonna type in
71

71

00:03:33,930  -->  00:03:38,223
is the same path as above but without Scripts.
72

72

00:03:41,830  -->  00:03:43,923
Okay, it's just like that.
73

73

00:03:44,810  -->  00:03:46,173
Then press OK.
74

74

00:03:47,150  -->  00:03:49,273
And now, press OK here as well.
75

75

00:03:50,200  -->  00:03:54,010
And we can go ahead and restart our Command Prompt.
76

76

00:03:54,010  -->  00:03:55,930
So, what we've done there, by the way,
77

77

00:03:55,930  -->  00:04:00,280
is we've told our computer
78

78

00:04:00,280  -->  00:04:03,560
that whenever we run a programme using our Command Prompt,
79

79

00:04:03,560  -->  00:04:06,670
it should look in the Scripts folder
80

80

00:04:06,670  -->  00:04:10,060
and also in the Python37 folder.
81

81

00:04:10,060  -->  00:04:11,170
So, we're gonna go ahead
82

82

00:04:11,170  -->  00:04:13,020
and go into our Command Prompt again.
83

83

00:04:14,530  -->  00:04:19,210
Now if you type python, Python runs.
84

84

00:04:19,210  -->  00:04:21,900
That is running this Python programme
85

85

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:24,133
that you see here inside my folder.
86

86

00:04:25,250  -->  00:04:27,040
Because as soon as we type python,
87

87

00:04:27,040  -->  00:04:29,280
it goes and looks in the path
88

88

00:04:30,610  -->  00:04:35,390
and tries to run any programme called exactly python.
89

89

00:04:35,390  -->  00:04:37,820
And because it's found it, that's what we're running.
90

90

00:04:37,820  -->  00:04:40,460
Now, we should be able to do import psycopg2
91

91

00:04:42,910  -->  00:04:46,543
and we don't get an error, which means everything worked.
92

92

00:04:47,580  -->  00:04:51,220
If you do get an error here or you got an error earlier
93

93

00:04:51,220  -->  00:04:53,610
when installing with pip or something like that,
94

94

00:04:53,610  -->  00:04:56,100
feel free to ask a question in the course Q&amp;A,
95

95

00:04:56,100  -->  00:04:58,780
but you may be better off trying the method
96

96

00:04:58,780  -->  00:05:02,220
that is outlined in the very next video.
97

97

00:05:02,220  -->  00:05:03,240
It's a bit more manual.
98

98

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:04,880
It's gonna teach you a little bit longer
99

99

00:05:04,880  -->  00:05:06,580
and you need a couple more tools
100

100

00:05:06,580  -->  00:05:11,090
to be able to do it, but it should also work.
101

101

00:05:11,090  -->  00:05:14,110
Of course, if this has worked, you don't have to watch
102

102

00:05:14,110  -->  00:05:16,400
or do anything shown in the next video.
103

103

00:05:16,400  -->  00:05:19,690
So, if you are able to import psycopg2,
104

104

00:05:19,690  -->  00:05:22,440
that's it, you can skip the next video entirely
105

105

00:05:22,440  -->  00:05:25,060
and you're ready to start with this section.
106

106

00:05:26,160  -->  00:05:27,320
So, that's it for now.
107

107

00:05:27,320  -->  00:05:30,170
Thanks for joining me and I'll see you in the next video.
