Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to look at installing Python.

2

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:11,250
Up until now we've done our development using Ideally the python shell which is an interactive interpreter

3

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:14,390
which gives us instant feedback when we're typing.

4

00:00:14,820  -->  00:00:18,420
However we've looked at creating files with it.

5

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:24,750
And really it's only simple enough when you've got one file when you've got one file on your program

6

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:27,480
only that file then it's quite easy to use.

7

00:00:27,480  -->  00:00:34,110
Ideally to develop However when you want multiple files and when you want to create a larger project

8

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:41,820
ideally sonce lacking a bit on that aspect the tool I'd like to introduce to you is Pi charm which is

9

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:49,080
essentially the most used Python ID in the market if you don't want to use Python or you don't want

10

00:00:49,080  -->  00:00:50,690
to use an ID.

11

00:00:50,760  -->  00:00:56,590
You can also use just a normal text editor and create your files using different folders.

12

00:00:56,790  -->  00:01:03,750
And that's also going to be better than using idealy text editors you might want to use in an atom text

13

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:07,830
Wrangler and there's a lot of others like sublime text.

14

00:01:07,990  -->  00:01:13,320
However in this cause we're going to be using Python because as I said PI charm is the most used Python

15

00:01:13,410  -->  00:01:20,820
ID in the market and by the way ID stands for Integrated Development Environment which means that Python

16

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:24,600
has everything you need to develop large and complex projects

17

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:28,480
in order to download Python.

18

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:33,080
Let's go into the IDs section and then click on Python

19

00:01:36,420  -->  00:01:38,530
then go to download now.

20

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:45,150
And here you can either download the professional edition which comes with a 30 day trial or the community

21

00:01:45,150  -->  00:01:47,550
edition which is free.

22

00:01:47,550  -->  00:01:53,640
Remember you can pick your platform here and program on works with all common platforms if you use the

23

00:01:53,640  -->  00:01:54,590
community edition.

24

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:59,940
You'll be able to follow along the course totally fine and there's really nothing different between

25

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:04,770
the community edition and the professional edition for what we are going to be doing in the professional

26

00:02:04,770  -->  00:02:08,290
edition does have slightly better integration with data bases.

27

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:12,990
But we're going to be using something else for our database management so we don't really have to worry

28

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:15,030
about that.

29

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:20,160
Once you've picked your platform and which one you want to download go ahead and just downloaded and

30

00:02:20,160  -->  00:02:22,730
installed it like any other normal program.

31

00:02:23,130  -->  00:02:24,410
Once you've installed it.

32

00:02:24,420  -->  00:02:28,550
Come back to the next video and we're going to be going over how to set it up so I'll see you there

33

00:02:28,560  -->  00:02:29,900
.
