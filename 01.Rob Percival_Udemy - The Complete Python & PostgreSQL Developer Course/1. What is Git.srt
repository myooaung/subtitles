00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,420
Find will come back in this section we're going to be talking about it.

2

00:00:04,720  -->  00:00:07,780
And in this video about what is it.

3

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:15,960
Well normally when you write your code it is in your computer and then you keep writing and then you

4

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:22,800
keep writing and your code is progressing nicely and then suddenly your hard drive dies and you lose

5

00:00:22,860  -->  00:00:24,180
everything.

6

00:00:24,880  -->  00:00:27,160
I mean that's happened to everybody.

7

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:28,910
And it is never nice.

8

00:00:29,400  -->  00:00:37,950
So what do you do you put it in Dropbox for example and then you have your code and Dropbox and whenever

9

00:00:37,950  -->  00:00:44,880
you make changes in your laptop when you can be in your computer you overwrite the dropbox version and

10

00:00:44,880  -->  00:00:49,500
so on and you do that for a number of days and then eventually you realize that what you've written

11

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:53,330
over the last five days is bullocks and it doesn't work.

12

00:00:53,370  -->  00:01:00,750
So you want to go back to what you had five days ago but unfortunately you can't do that in Dropbox

13

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:07,170
because what it stores is the current version and it doesn't store a history of what it was like five

14

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:08,050
days ago.

15

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:09,480
So what can you do.

16

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:14,950
Well you can use something like a time machine on a Mac that saves versions every hour.

17

00:01:15,270  -->  00:01:17,780
I'm sure there's something in Windows for that.

18

00:01:18,240  -->  00:01:22,950
But what that does it is saves the entire disk every hour and now and at that moment sometimes I plugged

19

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:29,270
in my time machine disk on my computer and it's synchronized 90 gigabytes worth of stuff.

20

00:01:30,060  -->  00:01:34,740
And just to keep your code safe you don't really need to be doing that.

21

00:01:34,770  -->  00:01:36,770
So that's where it comes in.

22

00:01:36,790  -->  00:01:45,120
It helps you solve both of those problems and a few more so get is a version control system and what

23

00:01:45,120  -->  00:01:51,240
it does is whenever you make changes you can commit those changes to get.

24

00:01:51,570  -->  00:01:54,670
And that saves a snapshot of those changes.

25

00:01:54,840  -->  00:02:01,620
And then you can optionally upload them to a site for example get hub is a place where you can upload

26

00:02:01,620  -->  00:02:08,460
your kit projects and there's a few others and that means that you'll get Project Safe in the cloud

27

00:02:08,460  -->  00:02:08,770
.

28

00:02:08,790  -->  00:02:15,000
So if your hard drive dies you get project is in get hub or there's a couple more like a bit bucket

29

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:22,200
and get lab you'll get product is safe so you can then buy a new hard drive and download your kit project

30

00:02:22,200  -->  00:02:24,410
from the Internet.

31

00:02:24,410  -->  00:02:29,630
Another thing that it does is because you can commit your changes whenever you make changes.

32

00:02:29,640  -->  00:02:31,180
It also keeps a history.

33

00:02:31,230  -->  00:02:35,160
So if you realize that for the past couple of days you've written things that don't work.

34

00:02:35,160  -->  00:02:42,900
You can go back in time and you can go back to a specific snapshot of the code and that's nice and you

35

00:02:42,900  -->  00:02:48,930
can also if you realize that in one specific snapshot you wrote something incorrectly.

36

00:02:48,930  -->  00:02:55,170
You can go back and remove that snapshot or you know and backtrack a few snapshots.

37

00:02:55,170  -->  00:02:59,700
There's a lot of things you can do with it which is why it's so nice.

38

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:04,980
And one more problem that I solved that you may not have had yet but nevertheless it is a large problem

39

00:03:05,550  -->  00:03:09,170
is working together with other developers.

40

00:03:09,870  -->  00:03:17,780
If you use Dropbox or you send your code developers zip files with your code they make some changes

41

00:03:17,790  -->  00:03:23,460
you make some changes and there's a few people making changes at the same time synchronizing those changes

42

00:03:23,520  -->  00:03:30,090
and making sure that everybody has the latest version of all the files becomes really difficult.

43

00:03:30,210  -->  00:03:34,480
So get kind of solved or at least helps to solve that.

44

00:03:34,770  -->  00:03:36,660
Now it is not a perfect system.

45

00:03:36,840  -->  00:03:40,980
Nothing is but it works really well and is really popular.

46

00:03:41,280  -->  00:03:46,620
And this wouldn't be a complete course if it didn't go into some of the ways that you can collaborate

47

00:03:46,620  -->  00:03:54,510
with other people and not only collaborate but also showcase your projects and put them online for companies

48

00:03:54,510  -->  00:03:56,660
that you're applying to for jobs to see.

49

00:03:56,940  -->  00:04:04,400
And that's also important to get is going to allow you to upload your project to sites like good hub

50

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:07,640
and then make them public for companies to see.

51

00:04:07,770  -->  00:04:13,410
You can optionally also contribute to projects that already R-IN get up and they are commonly known

52

00:04:13,410  -->  00:04:20,880
as open source projects and you can also make sure your project safe in the cloud and you can also go

53

00:04:20,880  -->  00:04:26,000
back in time if you write things incorrectly or you make mistakes and things like that.

54

00:04:26,130  -->  00:04:32,100
So good is really useful and I would encourage you from this section onwards to always have all your

55

00:04:32,100  -->  00:04:36,760
projects in get just because that means that companies can look at it.

56

00:04:36,840  -->  00:04:37,740
They are safe.

57

00:04:37,800  -->  00:04:41,210
You can go back in time and people can help you with them.

58

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:46,590
If somebody is looking for a project to contribute to in this section we're going to be looking at what

59

00:04:46,650  -->  00:04:54,020
Gates is and how we can use it and and how we can use get hub to put our projects in there.

60

00:04:54,360  -->  00:04:56,800
So without further ado I see you in the next what you
