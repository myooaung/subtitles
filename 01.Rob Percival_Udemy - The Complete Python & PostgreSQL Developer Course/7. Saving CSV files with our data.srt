00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:08,070
Find Welcome Back in this video we're going to be looking at saving our user to a file in order to save

2

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:09,230
our use it to a file.

3

00:00:09,330  -->  00:00:12,180
We need to know what we want to save.

4

00:00:12,180  -->  00:00:16,680
Naturally we can't just save something that we don't know what it is.

5

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:21,510
For example we can just tell this class save yourself.

6

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:28,740
We need to specify what we want to put in the file because only that we will be able to then load it

7

00:00:29,190  -->  00:00:33,420
up into our system again in case of the user.

8

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:41,100
The only data that the user has the only things that we could put in a database of a name and the movies

9

00:00:44,040  -->  00:00:51,720
if we put the name and the movies into a file that will then allow us to load a user from a file by

10

00:00:51,720  -->  00:00:56,370
reading the name of the movies and putting it back into the user.

11

00:00:57,050  -->  00:01:02,760
That's the only point of saving to then load if we save to then not use it for loading.

12

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:04,290
There's not much point in saving anything

13

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:12,260
then let's save this user into a file.

14

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:20,730
There are two ways really that we could save this user to a file we could use a CXXVI format saving

15

00:01:20,970  -->  00:01:25,130
the user with a comma separated value format.

16

00:01:25,290  -->  00:01:30,160
Or we could use a Jason format javascript object notation for.

17

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:31,770
Let's go over both.

18

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:34,930
In this video we're going to explain how to use a CXXVI format.

19

00:01:35,160  -->  00:01:37,950
And then the next we'll go over Jason.

20

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:48,490
The first thing to do is to remember that the user can save itself to a file potentially.

21

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:54,580
Or rather it can tell you what it wants to write on the file.

22

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:55,230
So

23

00:01:58,620  -->  00:02:02,350
let's create a method save file.

24

00:02:03,690  -->  00:02:12,830
And what this method might do is create a new file with the user's name and some of the user's movies

25

00:02:12,850  -->  00:02:13,930
.

26

00:02:14,970  -->  00:02:23,030
Let's open up a file with open and then we might call the file the same as the user's name self not

27

00:02:23,040  -->  00:02:30,730
name in writing mode as F and in this file we might write.

28

00:02:30,790  -->  00:02:41,740
All right then here we'd say self dot name and then we would write the movies.

29

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:45,440
How could you write the movies in a file.

30

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:50,940
Each movie has a name a genre and whether it's been watched or not

31

00:02:53,640  -->  00:03:02,550
well in the next line we could save each of the movies or we could put them potentially in a different

32

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:04,170
file if we wanted.

33

00:03:04,170  -->  00:03:08,760
In my case I'm going to put them in the same file.

34

00:03:08,760  -->  00:03:17,400
So I'm going to write the user's name first and then I'm going to add the backslash NC-Janitor which

35

00:03:17,400  -->  00:03:19,840
breaks into the next line.

36

00:03:20,550  -->  00:03:24,870
And here in the next line I'm going to add the first of the user's movies

37

00:03:27,500  -->  00:03:30,420
as not right.

38

00:03:30,450  -->  00:03:37,350
And what we want to do is separate each of the movie properties with a comma because that's what comma

39

00:03:37,350  -->  00:03:39,340
separated values are.

40

00:03:40,070  -->  00:03:52,740
So what we do here is say self-taught movies zero dot name plus comma plus self don't movies zero dot

41

00:03:52,840  -->  00:04:00,280
Londra plus comma plus self self-taught movie Zero dot watched.

42

00:04:00,310  -->  00:04:03,810
And as you know this axis is the first element in south that movies.

43

00:04:04,140  -->  00:04:05,670
And then we print out the name

44

00:04:08,700  -->  00:04:14,180
and then we are adding a comma to the string and then we're adding stuff that moves zero or Jorah.

45

00:04:14,320  -->  00:04:20,550
And the wording a comma and then when I think of the movies or watched remember watched is a boolean

46

00:04:20,550  -->  00:04:20,700
.

47

00:04:20,700  -->  00:04:28,040
And so we should use the str method here to ensure that it is converted to a string.

48

00:04:28,470  -->  00:04:34,650
By now you may have seen a couple of things wrong with this statement here.

49

00:04:35,700  -->  00:04:44,090
Stop the video and see if you can see two things that are not really right with this tape.

50

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:56,110
OK the first thing that you might have noticed is that I'm accessing self-taught movies zero the first

51

00:04:56,110  -->  00:04:57,770
element in movies.

52

00:04:58,000  -->  00:05:00,550
But what if the user doesn't have any movies.

53

00:05:01,180  -->  00:05:08,860
Well then you can expect to see quite a lot of red text underneath where you should do is see for movie

54

00:05:08,860  -->  00:05:20,170
in self-taught movies and then invent that put it inside the for loop and a hearsay movie not name movie

55

00:05:20,170  -->  00:05:24,960
Dongarra and movie don't watch.

56

00:05:26,380  -->  00:05:34,180
What is the second thing that isn't wrong but could be made better in this statement in this line 26

57

00:05:38,060  -->  00:05:38,740
.

58

00:05:38,920  -->  00:05:43,570
Improvement that we could put in here that would make things more readable is to use the format method

59

00:05:43,570  -->  00:05:45,250
.

60

00:05:45,250  -->  00:05:48,560
We could simply say open it was blackcap coma.

61

00:05:48,600  -->  00:06:00,490
It rocket coma open close bracket dot format and then genre and movie watched.

62

00:06:01,600  -->  00:06:02,610
And that's just it.

63

00:06:02,680  -->  00:06:08,260
I think it's a bit easier to read to know about you but I think that now I know that his name Leandra

64

00:06:08,680  -->  00:06:15,130
and movie watched and I can immediately see that what I'm writing to this file is a CXXVI formatted

65

00:06:15,130  -->  00:06:21,900
string a comma separated values string because the values are separated by commas.

66

00:06:23,860  -->  00:06:28,900
There is more problem with this C S V file isn't really a problem but it's something that we have to

67

00:06:28,900  -->  00:06:37,120
keep in to into account and that's the first line contains self-taught name and the other lines contain

68

00:06:37,210  -->  00:06:42,090
other data that is not related to the user but rather to the movies themselves.

69

00:06:42,670  -->  00:06:49,210
So these two differing types of data in here may cause a problem if we don't know if we don't remember

70

00:06:49,390  -->  00:06:51,020
about this.

71

00:06:51,160  -->  00:06:58,120
Something that I forgot but you must remember to add a new line there at the end newline character so

72

00:06:58,120  -->  00:07:03,300
that the next time that we write something it goes over into the new line.

73

00:07:03,370  -->  00:07:12,400
So now what we have is the user's name in the first line and the user's movies in the second line something

74

00:07:12,400  -->  00:07:17,950
that you may find interesting is we are writing the user's name in the first line and the file is called

75

00:07:17,950  -->  00:07:19,750
the user's name.

76

00:07:19,750  -->  00:07:23,570
To open this file we would need to know the user's name.

77

00:07:23,650  -->  00:07:30,870
So there's not much point in saving the name to the file as well.

78

00:07:31,210  -->  00:07:33,210
There's a couple of ways that we could go around this.

79

00:07:33,250  -->  00:07:40,100
We could call the file users and then right multiple users of the same file.

80

00:07:40,120  -->  00:07:44,200
We could just not write the user name there.

81

00:07:44,320  -->  00:07:49,720
Let's leave it like this for now because we're not really concerned about it.

82

00:07:49,720  -->  00:07:54,910
Next up let's go into our app and create a user at a couple of movies.

83

00:07:54,960  -->  00:07:58,750
Save it to the file and see what happens.

84

00:07:58,750  -->  00:08:03,380
So uder is going to be a user with a name I would say.

85

00:08:05,020  -->  00:08:07,950
And remember we have to import that.

86

00:08:09,220  -->  00:08:12,090
And then user dot add movie.

87

00:08:12,430  -->  00:08:17,620
Remember we no longer need to import a movie in our app because we can add the movie directly from the

88

00:08:17,620  -->  00:08:18,530
user.

89

00:08:18,760  -->  00:08:26,390
The Matrix safelight and user apps movie.

90

00:08:27,240  -->  00:08:33,070
What I'm going to put here is the interview comedy.

91

00:08:33,940  -->  00:08:37,080
And in a way you're from that is OK.

92

00:08:37,090  -->  00:08:44,620
And finally user don't save to file and that's going to hopefully create a new file called Jose and

93

00:08:44,710  -->  00:08:47,900
save the user and the movies into that.

94

00:08:47,920  -->  00:08:51,100
Let's press play and see what happens.

95

00:08:51,160  -->  00:08:51,490
OK.

96

00:08:51,520  -->  00:08:53,400
There's a fire called Jose there.

97

00:08:53,860  -->  00:09:00,370
And if we open that up Fair enough it does contain the matrix the interview and falls and falls and

98

00:09:00,370  -->  00:09:02,500
my name in the first line.

99

00:09:03,010  -->  00:09:11,600
A couple of improvements you may want to do use and call the file the user name Dottie XTi.

100

00:09:13,570  -->  00:09:19,630
You may want to do that so that when you run the app again which I'm going to do just now you get Jose

101

00:09:19,690  -->  00:09:20,660
up to 60.

102

00:09:21,220  -->  00:09:22,760
That maybe looks a bit better.

103

00:09:23,380  -->  00:09:28,630
And you may want to think about whether you want to save the user's name or not or save the file with

104

00:09:28,630  -->  00:09:30,300
a different name.

105

00:09:31,630  -->  00:09:39,010
But what we've looked at in this video is that the user can save itself to a cxxviii file and can write

106

00:09:39,010  -->  00:09:45,370
itself to see as we file what we're going to look at in the next video is loading the user from the

107

00:09:45,370  -->  00:09:49,380
C S V file and then we look at Jason that.

108

00:09:49,690  -->  00:09:52,540
So with that said I'll see you in the next video.
