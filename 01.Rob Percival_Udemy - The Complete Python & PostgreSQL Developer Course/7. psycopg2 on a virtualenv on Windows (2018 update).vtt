00:00:00.140  -->  00:00:01.430
<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.430  -->  00:00:05.020
In this video, we're going to be installing psycopg2
3

3

00:00:05.020  -->  00:00:07.933
in a virtual environment on Windows.
4

4

00:00:07.933  -->  00:00:10.960
Now you can instal things and create virtual environments
5

5

00:00:10.960  -->  00:00:13.573
in Windows using the command prompt,
6

6

00:00:13.573  -->  00:00:16.559
but if you use PyCharm, it's just a little bit easier.
7

7

00:00:16.559  -->  00:00:20.770
So we're going to cover this method in this course.
8

8

00:00:20.770  -->  00:00:22.500
The first thing you want to do is
9

9

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:25.580
we're gonna go ahead and create a new project, first of all.
10

10

00:00:25.580  -->  00:00:28.510
And in here, we will see
11

11

00:00:28.510  -->  00:00:31.693
how we can create a new virtual environment.
12

12

00:00:32.590  -->  00:00:37.590
Once your project has loaded, once you're in this screen,
13

13

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:43.003
you can go ahead and name your project whatever you want.
14

14

00:00:44.750  -->  00:00:46.690
So in here, I'm gonna call it Databases
15

15

00:00:46.690  -->  00:00:48.100
but you can call it anything.
16

16

00:00:48.100  -->  00:00:50.320
Then go ahead and open up the little triangle
17

17

00:00:50.320  -->  00:00:52.000
with the project interpreter
18

18

00:00:52.970  -->  00:00:57.520
and then press on New environment using virtualenv.
19

19

00:00:58.720  -->  00:01:00.900
If you've got pipenv or conda selected here,
20

20

00:01:00.900  -->  00:01:02.220
make sure you select virtualenv
21

21

00:01:02.220  -->  00:01:04.520
because the rest of the course uses virtualenv
22

22

00:01:04.520  -->  00:01:06.331
and it's really the simplest way
23

23

00:01:06.331  -->  00:01:09.202
to use virtual environments.
24

24

00:01:09.202  -->  00:01:12.760
Then select whichever location you want
25

25

00:01:12.760  -->  00:01:14.530
for your virtual environment.
26

26

00:01:14.530  -->  00:01:16.160
Commonly these virtual environments
27

27

00:01:16.160  -->  00:01:19.200
are either in the same folder as the project
28

28

00:01:19.200  -->  00:01:22.174
or somewhere nearby, but they can be anywhere you want.
29

29

00:01:22.174  -->  00:01:24.414
I'm going to leave it inside my project.
30

30

00:01:24.414  -->  00:01:27.510
As the base interpreter, select the version of Python
31

31

00:01:27.510  -->  00:01:30.780
you've got installed, and then don't check
32

32

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:32.492
either of these two.
33

33

00:01:32.492  -->  00:01:37.492
Just press Create and you will be good to go
34

34

00:01:37.520  -->  00:01:38.860
as soon as this loads.
35

35

00:01:38.860  -->  00:01:41.290
So once your project has been created
36

36

00:01:41.290  -->  00:01:44.408
and your virtual environment has been created as well,
37

37

00:01:44.408  -->  00:01:47.640
notice that this virtual environment does not have
38

38

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:50.060
psycopg2 installed.
39

39

00:01:50.060  -->  00:01:52.460
Even though we have psycopg2 installed
40

40

00:01:52.460  -->  00:01:54.530
on our system installation,
41

41

00:01:54.530  -->  00:01:57.560
the virtual environment is a completely fresh installation,
42

42

00:01:57.560  -->  00:01:59.820
so it doesn't have any of the libraries
43

43

00:01:59.820  -->  00:02:02.210
that were installed in the system.
44

44

00:02:02.210  -->  00:02:05.530
We must go ahead and instal them, and using PyCharm,
45

45

00:02:05.530  -->  00:02:09.770
that is even simpler than using the command prompt.
46

46

00:02:09.770  -->  00:02:14.393
So go ahead and go to File and then Settings.
47

47

00:02:16.082  -->  00:02:17.440
I couldn't find that one there.
48

48

00:02:17.440  -->  00:02:22.440
Then go to your project and click on Project interpreter,
49

49

00:02:22.700  -->  00:02:25.756
and here you can go the libraries that are installed
50

50

00:02:25.756  -->  00:02:27.140
in your virtual environment.
51

51

00:02:27.140  -->  00:02:28.660
You've got pip and setup tools.
52

52

00:02:28.660  -->  00:02:30.370
These two come with the virtual environment.
53

53

00:02:30.370  -->  00:02:31.680
Don't delete them.
54

54

00:02:31.680  -->  00:02:34.520
But you can go ahead and press the plus icon.
55

55

00:02:34.520  -->  00:02:36.713
In here, type psycopg2.
56

56

00:02:38.660  -->  00:02:42.050
And important, select psycopg2.
57

57

00:02:42.050  -->  00:02:44.550
Don't go anywhere else.
58

58

00:02:44.550  -->  00:02:49.230
I believe psycopg2 binary is a new project
59

59

00:02:49.230  -->  00:02:51.410
that they've started to make things a little bit easier,
60

60

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:53.777
but for now, stick with psycopg2
61

61

00:02:53.777  -->  00:02:56.440
and don't try to instal anything else,
62

62

00:02:56.440  -->  00:02:59.110
and then just press Instal Package.
63

63

00:02:59.110  -->  00:03:04.110
Now it'll begin installing, and once that's done, that's it.
64

64

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:07.270
You don't have to do anything else.
65

65

00:03:07.270  -->  00:03:08.840
So substantially simpler
66

66

00:03:08.840  -->  00:03:10.390
than going through the command prompt.
67

67

00:03:10.390  -->  00:03:12.720
Particularly, working with environments
68

68

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:15.300
in your command prompt can be a little bit tricky
69

69

00:03:15.300  -->  00:03:19.049
if you are not sure exactly how to go about it.
70

70

00:03:19.049  -->  00:03:23.430
So just verify that psycopg2 is indeed installed here.
71

71

00:03:23.430  -->  00:03:25.600
You can see it there, and that's it.
72

72

00:03:25.600  -->  00:03:26.840
That's all you have to do.
73

73

00:03:26.840  -->  00:03:31.289
Whenever you run this project from within PyCharm,
74

74

00:03:31.289  -->  00:03:33.460
whenever you create any Python files
75

75

00:03:33.460  -->  00:03:35.360
and run them inside PyCharm,
76

76

00:03:35.360  -->  00:03:37.830
PyCharm will use that virtual environment
77

77

00:03:37.830  -->  00:03:40.576
that will have psycopg2 installed.
78

78

00:03:40.576  -->  00:03:42.790
As always, if you have any issues,
79

79

00:03:42.790  -->  00:03:47.290
ask away in the course Q&amp;A, and that's it, really.
80

80

00:03:47.290  -->  00:03:49.611
So you don't have to do anything else on Windows
81

81

00:03:49.611  -->  00:03:52.813
to get started, and I'll see you on the next video.
