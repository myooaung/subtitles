00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:05,310
Hi and welcome back in this video we're looking at drop table and this is going to be a lot shorter

2

00:00:05,310  -->  00:00:10,460
than the previous video because the only thing we have to look at is how do you delete a table in sequel

3

00:00:10,940  -->  00:00:15,810
and we're going to be deleting the two tables that we've created over the last few videos to delete

4

00:00:16,540  -->  00:00:19,470
all the data and drop a table.

5

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:26,340
We can do drop table and then a table name to public DOT uses.

6

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:29,610
What do you think is going to happen when I do this.

7

00:00:29,610  -->  00:00:31,860
Drop table public don't use

8

00:00:36,060  -->  00:00:44,790
and it is a trick question because these public don't use or stable is being referenced from movies

9

00:00:44,790  -->  00:00:45,700
.

10

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:52,050
There's a falling key relationship from movies pointing to the user id column.

11

00:00:52,080  -->  00:01:00,420
So when I run this it tells me that you can't do that essentially cannot drop table users because other

12

00:01:00,420  -->  00:01:06,330
objects depend on it the constrained videos use Radie foreign key on table videos.

13

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:09,400
The Pens on people users is quite a nice area.

14

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:15,990
And then it gives you a hint you may want to use drop cascade to drop the dependent objects too.

15

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:24,030
So by default what's happening here is we're doing drop table public dock users restrict and if we run

16

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:28,070
that we give you the same area naturally because that's what what's the default.

17

00:01:28,230  -->  00:01:31,640
So if we don't type restrict then that's what's happening.

18

00:01:32,590  -->  00:01:38,710
And what restricts does is it analyzes other tables incoming relationships.

19

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:42,210
And if any depend on this table then it tells you.

20

00:01:42,210  -->  00:01:43,440
Wait a minute.

21

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:50,520
If you delete this table you're relationships in other tables are going to get screwed up.

22

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:53,410
So the only option that you've got is to use cascade.

23

00:01:53,750  -->  00:02:02,300
And if you use cascade this is going to delete the rows in the I'm sorry my bad it's not gonna delete

24

00:02:02,310  -->  00:02:08,520
any rows but this is going to do is going to delete the foreign key relationship between and the videos

25

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:10,860
table and they state.

26

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:13,440
So forget about the rows.

27

00:02:13,440  -->  00:02:15,990
Nothing is going to get deleted in videos.

28

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:20,510
But what's going to happen is that the foreign key relationship that constraint is going to get deleted

29

00:02:20,520  -->  00:02:22,330
.

30

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:23,990
So what does that mean.

31

00:02:24,600  -->  00:02:30,000
Well it means that because we're deleting this table we're dropping it.

32

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:38,710
The videos table no longer can have a foreign key relationship a reference to this table.

33

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:44,920
So with Cascade we delete that reference we don't delete any data we just delete the reference.

34

00:02:45,180  -->  00:02:47,640
So let's do that.

35

00:02:47,640  -->  00:02:51,550
We've deleted the constraint.

36

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:58,750
But when we select staff from public videos the data is still there.

37

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:00,460
OK.

38

00:03:00,690  -->  00:03:10,350
I'm going to now go into the other window and refresh the tables and you can see we've got videos here

39

00:03:10,360  -->  00:03:11,030
.

40

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:20,460
And notice how the constraint am for foreign keys is not there and that constraint is there for example

41

00:03:20,460  -->  00:03:21,960
in purchases.

42

00:03:22,380  -->  00:03:24,180
And the constraint foreign key.

43

00:03:24,180  -->  00:03:29,370
Blah blah blah that is a foreign key constraint that is no longer there in videos because we've deleted

44

00:03:29,430  -->  00:03:39,810
the constraint by cascading and the deletion from dropping the user stable so that cascade does but

45

00:03:39,910  -->  00:03:46,800
optionally The other solution is to delete the video Stabil first and then they use a stable.

46

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:48,690
That's also another option.

47

00:03:48,690  -->  00:03:54,890
Drop table public videos that athletes not tape.

48

00:03:55,430  -->  00:04:00,810
Notice is that if we try and do this again it gives us an era of say stable video that does not exist

49

00:04:00,810  -->  00:04:01,040
.

50

00:04:01,050  -->  00:04:03,460
You're trying to drop something that doesn't exist.

51

00:04:03,630  -->  00:04:10,400
So there is a way to fix that which is drop table if exists.

52

00:04:10,680  -->  00:04:12,180
Public videos.

53

00:04:12,180  -->  00:04:15,380
And then it doesn't give you an error it just gives you a notice.

54

00:04:15,670  -->  00:04:18,990
It is as video videos does not exist skipping.

55

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:19,990
And that's fine.

56

00:04:20,010  -->  00:04:29,430
That's just so that if you want to create a table videos you naturally want to delete table video so

57

00:04:29,430  -->  00:04:32,080
you don't create something that is already there.

58

00:04:32,130  -->  00:04:39,060
So instead of drop table videos you may want to do drop table if it exists videos because if you don't

59

00:04:39,180  -->  00:04:43,440
you'll get an error if it doesn't exist and then your program will crash.

60

00:04:43,440  -->  00:04:54,160
So this is just useful in case you want to do drop table exists and then create table videos.

61

00:04:54,840  -->  00:04:57,730
So that's why that's useful.

62

00:04:58,830  -->  00:04:59,220
OK.

63

00:04:59,220  -->  00:05:01,320
And that's how you drop tables.

64

00:05:01,350  -->  00:05:07,550
And similarly you can drop data as well and you can drop sequence.

65

00:05:07,740  -->  00:05:12,600
You can drop view when we're going to look at views very soon.

66

00:05:12,610  -->  00:05:14,550
There's a there's a bunch of things you can drop.

67

00:05:14,670  -->  00:05:18,120
And that's how you delete them and that's it.

68

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:21,300
So thanks for watching and I'll be seeing you in the next few videos.

69

00:05:21,300  -->  00:05:27,510
We're going to be going into some more advanced Posterous sequel stuff such as views and dates and other

70

00:05:27,510  -->  00:05:28,340
data types.

71

00:05:28,500  -->  00:05:30,790
So I'll see you there.
