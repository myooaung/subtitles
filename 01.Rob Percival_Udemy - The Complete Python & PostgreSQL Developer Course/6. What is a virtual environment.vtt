00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.830
Find Welcome Back in this video we're looking at what is a virtual an.

2

00:00:05.090  -->  00:00:11.890
And we're also going to be creating our next app when we stole Python.

3

00:00:11.910  -->  00:00:13.960
We get something like this.

4

00:00:13.980  -->  00:00:17.050
Let's say we open by chairman then we create a new project.

5

00:00:17.090  -->  00:00:18.720
You get something like this here.

6

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:25.860
It asks us for a location which is where our project should be where the files of the project should

7

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:32.520
be in our system and that's fine that's normal and then it also asks us for an interpreter.

8

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:39.020
And in the past all we've done was select pite and 3.5 there from the list.

9

00:00:39.540  -->  00:00:45.090
In this video I wanted to talk to you about virtual NVS and what virtual games are and why we should

10

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:46.600
use them.

11

00:00:47.790  -->  00:00:50.710
Let's say we choose Python 3.5.

12

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:55.590
This is the installation that we've got in our system the python that we've downloaded and installed

13

00:00:55.610  -->  00:00:56.130
.

14

00:00:56.820  -->  00:01:05.580
And whenever we run a python app we can run it with this python 3.5 interpreter which is the python

15

00:01:05.580  -->  00:01:07.500
that we've installed.

16

00:01:07.500  -->  00:01:13.200
If you're on Mac you've also got Python 2.7 installed and that's an older version of python and you

17

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:16.650
can have both installed side by side because the name is different.

18

00:01:16.830  -->  00:01:21.240
If both of them were called Python then you'd have a problem because the system would know which one

19

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:22.680
to use.

20

00:01:22.740  -->  00:01:24.380
In my case I have three of them.

21

00:01:24.400  -->  00:01:29.600
Python 2.6 and 2.7 and Python 3.5.

22

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:32.380
And here we also have another one which has a small v.

23

00:01:32.390  -->  00:01:37.110
There you can see that very clearly there is a green V then or the bottom.

24

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:39.440
And this is a virtual end.

25

00:01:39.960  -->  00:01:46.770
Now the reason why virtual ends exist is because if you create say 10 projects in Python and in all

26

00:01:46.770  -->  00:01:49.950
of them you use this python 3.5 version.

27

00:01:49.950  -->  00:01:57.180
This program here and each project has different libraries that you're using a library is just some

28

00:01:57.180  -->  00:02:01.780
code that somebody else has written that you can import into your program and use it in your program

29

00:02:01.820  -->  00:02:02.040
.

30

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:07.420
Be easier if you create 10 projects with different libraries in each.

31

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:15.330
Then this interpreter here this point of 3.5 ends up having to take into account all of those liberties

32

00:02:17.580  -->  00:02:25.200
and that's fine up until the point that you need two versions of the same library.

33

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:32.700
So for example you create a project today and you use the psycho to library and you create your project

34

00:02:32.790  -->  00:02:38.370
using the current version or psycho-BS you to like we're going to be doing and then two years down the

35

00:02:38.370  -->  00:02:42.210
line you and you create another project using psycho OPG too.

36

00:02:42.390  -->  00:02:49.950
But with the version two years down the line when you go back and run the old project that you create

37

00:02:49.950  -->  00:02:57.450
today it would no longer work because you've updated the library and the old project no longer works

38

00:02:57.450  -->  00:02:58.590
.

39

00:02:58.740  -->  00:03:04.920
Say if they changed something in the library so what to do is create a virtual environment.

40

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:13.530
This is re-installed Python essentially with a different name and use that installation only for one

41

00:03:13.530  -->  00:03:14.660
project.

42

00:03:14.800  -->  00:03:19.950
Then you can install your libraries then you can install psycho puji to them for example and when in

43

00:03:20.010  -->  00:03:25.590
two years on the line you create a new project you create a new virtual environment for it with no libraries

44

00:03:25.920  -->  00:03:30.480
and you can install the new version of Cyclopes G2 on that other virtual environment.

45

00:03:30.480  -->  00:03:34.060
And it does not affect your other environment.

46

00:03:34.830  -->  00:03:40.900
That is what a virtual and is just another installation of Python that you install somewhere else and

47

00:03:40.900  -->  00:03:45.900
that you only use for one project although you can use it for many if you really want but it's not advised

48

00:03:46.460  -->  00:03:52.740
so you use it for one project and therefore it allows you to make sure that the libraries don't conflict

49

00:03:52.830  -->  00:03:55.610
with other installations.

50

00:03:55.700  -->  00:03:58.950
They're essentially the reason why these things exist.

51

00:03:58.950  -->  00:04:01.870
So with that said that's where a virtual environment is.

52

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:05.390
And now we're going to be creating our project once again.

53

00:04:05.430  -->  00:04:12.720
If you do not have the and Enterprise Edition the I'm not really sure what it's called a vision of a

54

00:04:12.720  -->  00:04:13.260
pie chum.

55

00:04:13.290  -->  00:04:16.220
Then you will only see pure python if you have the community edition.

56

00:04:16.230  -->  00:04:19.500
You'll only see pure python if you have the professional edition.

57

00:04:19.500  -->  00:04:23.080
That's what it called then you may see all these things here or even more.

58

00:04:23.370  -->  00:04:27.900
Nevertheless we're going to use pure Python and then we're going to have to choose the location of our

59

00:04:27.900  -->  00:04:29.310
project.

60

00:04:29.310  -->  00:04:36.900
So I'm going to go into this folder and create a new folder for it and it's going to be intro to databases

61

00:04:37.530  -->  00:04:39.390
for example.

62

00:04:39.390  -->  00:04:41.390
Again you can call it whatever you want.

63

00:04:41.580  -->  00:04:47.940
And then inside that folder I'm going to create another folder called Project and this is going to be

64

00:04:48.210  -->  00:04:50.650
the project files the python files.

65

00:04:50.940  -->  00:04:57.540
And the reason why I'm doing that is because inside this intro to databases folder I'm going to create

66

00:04:57.600  -->  00:05:02.880
a virtual end that you can do them by clicking these three dots here and pressing create virtual length

67

00:05:04.200  -->  00:05:06.550
and then the place where we're going to be putting this virtual limb.

68

00:05:06.570  -->  00:05:11.030
This location is going to be inside into two databases.

69

00:05:11.370  -->  00:05:21.210
So let's go then documents personal causes Python progress into the databases.

70

00:05:21.210  -->  00:05:28.020
But instead of in project I'm going to put it inside a folder called then for virtual And this is the

71

00:05:28.020  -->  00:05:31.030
normal naming convention for virtual environments.

72

00:05:31.240  -->  00:05:34.340
They're always usually called then.

73

00:05:35.450  -->  00:05:36.270
OK.

74

00:05:36.270  -->  00:05:43.080
And then we are going to make sure that the base interpreter is python 3.5 and that just means that

75

00:05:43.080  -->  00:05:50.190
this virtual environment is also going to be running Python 3.5 as opposed to a different version.

76

00:05:50.190  -->  00:05:52.250
Finally let's press OK.

77

00:05:53.880  -->  00:05:59.480
And then that's installing some of the stuff that we need in Python.

78

00:05:59.940  -->  00:06:05.440
And we are going to be going into the next video momentarily as soon as it is completed where we're

79

00:06:05.460  -->  00:06:12.600
going to be explaining how we can install packages in Python.

80

00:06:15.640  -->  00:06:16.280
OK.

81

00:06:16.380  -->  00:06:17.940
That's the virtual environment created.

82

00:06:17.940  -->  00:06:24.090
Now we can just click on Create project and then as usual we get this project here that we know and

83

00:06:24.090  -->  00:06:26.010
love already.

84

00:06:26.370  -->  00:06:34.710
Now that we've got this virtual environment created we can go into pikeman preferences Clozaril this

85

00:06:34.710  -->  00:06:44.310
stuff and go to the project and verify that psycho G-2 is installed in this case because I've just created

86

00:06:44.310  -->  00:06:49.230
this python installation this virtual and Cyclopedia 2 is not here.

87

00:06:49.230  -->  00:06:58.770
So what we have to do is first of all update set up tools and we all going to double click on it and

88

00:06:58.770  -->  00:07:02.650
then I'm going to select a set of tools and press install.

89

00:07:03.420  -->  00:07:07.090
And that is going to update set up tools to the latest version.

90

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:09.930
If it does manage that we go

91

00:07:13.160  -->  00:07:14.730
now.

92

00:07:15.010  -->  00:07:20.970
So and then we will try and remember to specify the version so we want to install the latest version

93

00:07:21.550  -->  00:07:23.860
and then install package there.

94

00:07:24.750  -->  00:07:30.300
I tend to do this with a terminal as opposed to via PI John but this is the easier way to do it OK now

95

00:07:30.300  -->  00:07:39.110
that those two are installed we can press on the plus sign again and then go to psycho PGE 2.

96

00:07:39.450  -->  00:07:45.690
Now you can only do this if you are on Mac so let's press that or on Linux and then that will be installed

97

00:07:45.700  -->  00:07:46.040
.

98

00:07:46.230  -->  00:07:55.890
If you are on Windows then you need to run the commands as we saw them in the last couple of videos

99

00:07:55.910  -->  00:07:56.130
.

100

00:07:56.370  -->  00:08:03.390
So the next video is going to be going into how to install psycho-BS due to Windows in the virtual environment

101

00:08:03.390  -->  00:08:03.510
.

102

00:08:03.570  -->  00:08:08.520
If you're not on Windows you can entirely skip the next video and just go on to the next one after that

103

00:08:08.520  -->  00:08:09.470
.

104

00:08:09.510  -->  00:08:13.230
This is psychobilly to install the now in your virtual environment.

105

00:08:13.320  -->  00:08:16.330
Let's go into windows in the next video and install it there.

106

00:08:16.450  -->  00:08:20.030
And like I said if you are in Windows just go into the next video and see the
