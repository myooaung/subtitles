00:00:00.140  -->  00:00:04.130
Hi will come back in this way you will quickly go into look at vim.

2

00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:09.390
Them is a very popular text editor which you can run from your terminal.

3

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:13.170
Remember that if you're in Windows you're going to need to use the get shell that we installed at the

4

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:14.550
beginning of this section.

5

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:16.660
So you have access to them.

6

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:24.120
One thing I want to do is clear the content so that we lose kind of what we did in the last video and

7

00:00:24.120  -->  00:00:29.580
then we're going to open up vim.

8

00:00:29.700  -->  00:00:34.110
So this is vim and it sure is a bit of information here.

9

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:36.930
And it also shows you a couple of commands.

10

00:00:36.960  -->  00:00:41.530
A couple of commands that you can do and one of them is colon.

11

00:00:42.200  -->  00:00:50.310
So let's type colon Q Just right now and notice that as we type the text is not appearing up there but

12

00:00:50.310  -->  00:00:55.410
rather down here when text appears at the bottom of vim.

13

00:00:55.470  -->  00:01:00.660
It means you are executing a special vim command when text appears at the top it means that you're typing

14

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:09.270
something in a document Bazil you quit vim by typing code on queue and you can optionally open them

15

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:10.820
with a file.

16

00:01:10.950  -->  00:01:13.920
So you open vim by editing a file.

17

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:17.420
So let's open up a new file inside the test folder.

18

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:23.340
So I'm going to go to test and then forward slash and then I'm going to type in the file name.

19

00:01:23.370  -->  00:01:30.990
So this is going to create a new file inside text and the file is going to be videoed got DXi.

20

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:37.290
So again with this is going to do is going to open up the vim program with this argument.

21

00:01:37.500  -->  00:01:45.030
The argument is the test folder and inside the test folder the video doc textfile So lets press enter

22

00:01:45.040  -->  00:01:45.560
.

23

00:01:45.870  -->  00:01:52.480
And notice how now it tells a test slash video that he actually is a new file that we've created.

24

00:01:52.590  -->  00:01:54.720
Now we are ready to begin typing.

25

00:01:55.290  -->  00:02:02.320
So let's for example hello world and I'm going to begin typing now.

26

00:02:04.070  -->  00:02:08.220
So what happened then suddenly half the words are missing.

27

00:02:08.250  -->  00:02:10.500
Even though I promised I did type them.

28

00:02:10.890  -->  00:02:19.320
And the reason why is because halfway through that typing this insert appeared there until the insert

29

00:02:19.320  -->  00:02:28.400
appears all you type in vim is treated as a command and therefore is not appearing in the document.

30

00:02:29.850  -->  00:02:36.630
Let's leave insert mode again by pressing escape the escape key which is on the top left of your keyboard

31

00:02:36.640  -->  00:02:36.730
.

32

00:02:36.810  -->  00:02:38.410
Notice how they insert this appears.

33

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:41.430
And if you try to type something like the letter H.

34

00:02:41.910  -->  00:02:42.570
It doesn't work.

35

00:02:42.570  -->  00:02:46.500
Doesn't type anything because h is not even command.

36

00:02:46.500  -->  00:02:49.340
Well it is but it's not one that we can use at this point in time.

37

00:02:49.410  -->  00:02:51.900
I get into that later.

38

00:02:51.930  -->  00:02:58.520
So what to do is press the letter II for insert and then that means the insert mode appear.

39

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:06.930
And we can begin typing now in here and now if we type that are H We can type in as normal while we

40

00:03:06.930  -->  00:03:08.670
are in insert mode.

41

00:03:08.670  -->  00:03:13.070
No in commands we work because they'll instead be typed to the document.

42

00:03:13.080  -->  00:03:22.860
So if we wanted to quit vim with colon Q It doesn't work because the colon appears in our document as

43

00:03:22.860  -->  00:03:29.340
you can probably guess if we want to exit them we would first need to exit insert mode and then type

44

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:31.190
call on queue.

45

00:03:32.700  -->  00:03:38.040
So that would be escape and then call on to notice that it appears down there.

46

00:03:38.820  -->  00:03:39.810
And then we can present

47

00:03:42.960  -->  00:03:48.570
however we have made changes to the document we've typed something in it and very nicely tells us that

48

00:03:48.660  -->  00:03:50.880
we have made changes.

49

00:03:50.910  -->  00:03:57.440
But we have not written the changes since the last change was made and what that means is that we've

50

00:03:57.450  -->  00:04:04.470
not saved the changes to the disc with not written the changes to the disk so we can see if the changes

51

00:04:04.590  -->  00:04:08.420
which is good if we couldn't then this text editor wouldn't be very useful.

52

00:04:08.760  -->  00:04:14.600
And in order to save changes we praise on W for right.

53

00:04:14.850  -->  00:04:21.150
And when we do this that is going to save the video 0.60 file with the contents that we have put in

54

00:04:21.150  -->  00:04:30.930
it and here it says a new file has been created with one line and 16 columns written 16 columns and

55

00:04:30.930  -->  00:04:33.210
one column for each count.

56

00:04:33.240  -->  00:04:38.310
Now if you press call on queue it exits which is fantastic.

57

00:04:39.540  -->  00:04:47.200
OK this was a quick introduction to vim and how you might go about opening up saving documents and exiting

58

00:04:47.220  -->  00:04:49.900
documents on entering insert mode.

59

00:04:49.920  -->  00:04:56.960
Now if we were to access that document again it has the content and we can quit it just as normal.

60

00:04:57.090  -->  00:04:58.050
So that's it for this video.

61

00:04:58.050  -->  00:05:02.030
Just a quick introduction to the very popular text that of him.

62

00:05:02.130  -->  00:05:07.170
And there's actually loads that you can do with vim is not limited to just entering text and saving

63

00:05:07.170  -->  00:05:11.170
and Whitton and there's search that you can do.

64

00:05:11.280  -->  00:05:16.280
You can copy and paste and all that good jazz as you can do in any other text editor.

65

00:05:16.530  -->  00:05:22.830
So by all means use vim if you are using a terminal because it is one of the most powerful text editors

66

00:05:23.310  -->  00:05:24.060
out there.

67

00:05:24.300  -->  00:05:27.540
And certainly one of the most powerful text editors in the timing.

68

00:05:27.870  -->  00:05:28.730
That's it for this video.

69

00:05:28.830  -->  00:05:29.660
When I see you in the next one
