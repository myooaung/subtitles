00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.000
Hi and welcome back in this video we're talking about competition.

2

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:09.960
Competition is a common concept thrown around when people talk about object oriented programming and

3

00:00:10.140  -->  00:00:11.680
it's really nothing confusing.

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:17.130
I'm just going to tell you in this video what it is so that when you do encounter it or somebody speaks

5

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:18.810
about it you know what they're talking about.

6

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:20.350
It's nothing really complicated.

7

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:23.930
Let's create a new file here in the O.P. folder.

8

00:00:24.120  -->  00:00:31.800
I'm going to call it composition and I'm going to create a couple of classes that are going to be using

9

00:00:31.860  -->  00:00:37.920
composition and really composition is probably what you would expect a class to be composed of other

10

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:39.190
classes.

11

00:00:39.240  -->  00:00:43.080
I'm going to give the class leg that isn't going to do anything in the class back that isn't going to

12

00:00:43.080  -->  00:00:43.850
do anything.

13

00:00:44.160  -->  00:00:51.410
And then a class chan that in the neat method is going to take in a parameter numb legs.

14

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:54.160
So it's going to the change is going to have a number of legs.

15

00:00:54.390  -->  00:01:03.540
The legs are going to be leg for leg in range and some legs and it's going to have a back which is going

16

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:05.070
to be a back object.

17

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:13.100
So what we're doing here is just saying give me a class called leg and a classical back.

18

00:01:13.100  -->  00:01:15.140
I know they don't do anything yet.

19

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:21.300
And then a classical chair the chair takes him a number of legs as the method stretches three for example

20

00:01:22.080  -->  00:01:23.150
and then it initialises.

21

00:01:23.180  -->  00:01:29.610
So of the legs to be equal to a leg or object for each of the legs in that range.

22

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:37.050
So if we pass in theory this would be 3 leg objects in a list the back is going to be a back object

23

00:01:37.050  -->  00:01:38.500
.

24

00:01:38.940  -->  00:01:45.450
I'm also for the sake of completion design a wrapper method that is going to say return I have legs

25

00:01:45.540  -->  00:01:51.290
and one back format lane itself legs.

26

00:01:51.620  -->  00:01:51.920
OK.

27

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:55.160
So what this is going to do is say I have three legs and one back.

28

00:01:55.170  -->  00:01:58.500
Right.

29

00:01:58.590  -->  00:02:02.880
So if we print chat with five what would you expect there to be printed out

30

00:02:05.930  -->  00:02:09.690
and hopefully the answer was I have five legs and one back.

31

00:02:09.690  -->  00:02:13.080
So we're going to run this and that is indeed what we get.

32

00:02:13.080  -->  00:02:13.990
Congratulations.

33

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:21.530
You have now used composition and as you can see there's nothing there to be feared.

34

00:02:21.570  -->  00:02:28.400
The only thing we've done is we've composed a class chair out of two other classes leg and back.

35

00:02:28.440  -->  00:02:34.500
That's what competition is it's making up one class out of many other classes.

36

00:02:34.590  -->  00:02:42.980
Notice that we haven't to use inheritance because of a difference in how you would express this.

37

00:02:42.990  -->  00:02:49.770
You use inheritance when the child is the parent.

38

00:02:49.770  -->  00:02:53.280
For example let's go back to the intro here.

39

00:02:53.280  -->  00:02:57.990
A currency is a decimal with an added symbol.

40

00:02:58.590  -->  00:03:03.040
However a chair is not feeback a chair is not a leg.

41

00:03:03.140  -->  00:03:06.350
A chair has legs and a chair has a back.

42

00:03:06.450  -->  00:03:10.760
So that's where you use composition and that's how you can think about it.

43

00:03:10.920  -->  00:03:15.370
And when it comes to designing your application just remember there's no need to use inheritance in

44

00:03:15.370  -->  00:03:16.390
the here.

45

00:03:16.470  -->  00:03:21.960
Even if the leg does things and at the back does things there's no need to use inheritance then because

46

00:03:22.380  -->  00:03:23.610
a chair is not a back.

47

00:03:23.700  -->  00:03:25.020
It contains a back.

48

00:03:25.050  -->  00:03:26.520
So it should be a property.

49

00:03:26.760  -->  00:03:28.020
And that's what competition is.

50

00:03:28.260  -->  00:03:29.390
So that's everything for this video.

51

00:03:29.550  -->  00:03:33.540
And hopefully you learned a bit about composition and remember to not be afraid.

52

00:03:33.690  -->  00:03:39.780
If somebody talks about competition and if somebody says I used composition it's awesome.

53

00:03:39.780  -->  00:03:41.010
It really isn't.

54

00:03:41.100  -->  00:03:45.650
Competition is just something you do when you have to.

55

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:46.350
And that's it.

56

00:03:46.470  -->  00:03:49.250
There's nothing magical or complex about it.

57

00:03:49.510  -->  00:03:50.250
That's it for this video.

58

00:03:50.250  -->  00:03:51.190
Thanks for watching.

59

00:03:51.200  -->  00:03:51.920
I'll see you in the next one
