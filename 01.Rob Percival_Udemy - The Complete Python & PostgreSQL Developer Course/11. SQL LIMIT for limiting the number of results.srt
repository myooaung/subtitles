00:00:00,160  -->  00:00:05,820
Final comeback in this video we're just quickly looking at the limit command the limit command is used

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:10,960
to just to that limit the number of rows returned by query.

3

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:17,340
So I'm here with a last query that had zero rows returned and I'm going to remove the WHERE clause.

4

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:19,540
Just so we are not doing any filtering.

5

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:25,850
If I press play then we get 5 customers back which is all there is in our table.

6

00:00:26,680  -->  00:00:31,990
However after the from customers part of the Select I can put a limit.

7

00:00:32,220  -->  00:00:38,400
For example if I only wanted three customers back or potentially just one customer back I could do limit

8

00:00:38,920  -->  00:00:39,680
one.

9

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:43,780
And then they'll give me just the first customer in that tape.

10

00:00:44,250  -->  00:00:50,760
Normally this is not very useful just by itself but it can be especially useful if you are looking at

11

00:00:51,030  -->  00:00:58,380
for example the first customer with a specific address or phone number or e-mail address.

12

00:00:58,740  -->  00:01:04,620
For example in an application that allows users to log in you may want to allow users to type in their

13

00:01:04,620  -->  00:01:05,450
e-mail.

14

00:01:05,550  -->  00:01:12,900
And then you'll find the first user that has that e-mail and you log in with that is just a way to make

15

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:17,260
sure that you're not selecting multiple things at the same time really.

16

00:01:17,340  -->  00:01:23,100
Also there's ways to implement paging nation using limit so you can for example select 100 elements

17

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:26,780
and then in the next query you can select the next hundred elements.

18

00:01:26,860  -->  00:01:31,890
And we're not going to really get into how to implement pagination in this course but that's a couple

19

00:01:31,890  -->  00:01:32,950
of uses for limits.

20

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:37,410
So it's good to know that this command exists and you can use it.

21

00:01:37,440  -->  00:01:37,830
OK.

22

00:01:37,890  -->  00:01:39,330
So that's it for this video.

23

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:41,850
I'll see you in the next one.
