00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:02,070
Hi will come back in this video.

2

00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:05,250
Let's look at variables in Python.

3

00:00:05,250  -->  00:00:07,130
Think of a variable as a box.

4

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:13,530
You can put anything you want in the box but naturally once the thing is in the box you can't see it

5

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:14,320
anymore.

6

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:21,780
So for example if you put all your kitchen equipment in a box then you no longer know what's inside

7

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:22,290
the box.

8

00:00:22,290  -->  00:00:27,660
You just know that you've got a box that maybe has kitchen equipment in it or maybe it has something

9

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:36,540
else and I say this because it's really important for you to know what's inside your box and the way

10

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:42,900
you would do that in normal life would be you would put a tag on the box you would write something on

11

00:00:42,900  -->  00:00:47,040
the box saying kitchen equipment for example.

12

00:00:47,040  -->  00:00:48,670
So this is the same thing in programming.

13

00:00:48,690  -->  00:00:55,380
You've got your boxes you can put anything you want inside them but you need to give your boxes names

14

00:00:55,380  -->  00:00:56,490
.

15

00:00:56,490  -->  00:01:04,110
And in this case your variables needs to be named Well so that's you know exactly what they contain

16

00:01:04,120  -->  00:01:04,350
.

17

00:01:04,560  -->  00:01:05,980
So here's what I mean.

18

00:01:06,300  -->  00:01:13,470
Let's create a variable called X just type X and then equal something and this something is going to

19

00:01:13,470  -->  00:01:16,040
be inside of x inside your box colleagues.

20

00:01:16,170  -->  00:01:18,430
In this case I'm going to put the value 5.

21

00:01:18,510  -->  00:01:20,830
So X is 5 the number 5.

22

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:27,790
And when I press Enter Python is going to put the 5 inside a box with a name X..

23

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:30,540
So let's accept that that's happened.

24

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:37,650
And then when we type X Python is going to evaluate x and it's going to get the value that inside it

25

00:01:37,700  -->  00:01:40,100
and it's going to give it back to us.

26

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:41,840
So there you go that's the five.

27

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:46,620
And now comes the all important question which is essential.

28

00:01:46,620  -->  00:01:49,820
I can't stress this enough how important it is in programming.

29

00:01:50,070  -->  00:01:52,190
What is five.

30

00:01:52,290  -->  00:01:54,880
What does it mean.

31

00:01:55,000  -->  00:02:01,080
Five could be at this point anything it could be 5 apples it could be five years.

32

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:04,940
It could be five blenders.

33

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:06,840
It could be anything.

34

00:02:06,840  -->  00:02:13,110
So it's very important that you don't name your variables X but you name them something useful something

35

00:02:13,570  -->  00:02:20,370
self-explanatory so that later on when you see your variable when you see X somewhere in your program

36

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:22,800
you know what it means.

37

00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:23,990
What is inside it.

38

00:02:24,000  -->  00:02:29,300
So in this case let's say that our variable x is five years.

39

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:33,530
So instead of X I would call it age and I would say age is five.

40

00:02:34,050  -->  00:02:39,000
And now you would know that 5 is probably years old or it could be something else it could be months

41

00:02:39,440  -->  00:02:39,710
.

42

00:02:40,080  -->  00:02:45,070
But at least it's got a slightly better name now.

43

00:02:45,150  -->  00:02:45,670
OK.

44

00:02:45,960  -->  00:02:51,210
So we've learned how to put a value inside a variable.

45

00:02:51,250  -->  00:02:56,190
And now let's look at something we've looked at in the previous video but using variables instead of

46

00:02:56,250  -->  00:02:58,530
normal plain values.

47

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:00,980
So what would happen just as a recap.

48

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:11,020
When I do age plus the string years what is going to happen if I type age plus years.

49

00:03:11,130  -->  00:03:15,870
What we want is for it to say five years.

50

00:03:15,960  -->  00:03:18,680
So what is going to happen.

51

00:03:18,720  -->  00:03:27,680
The answer is not what we want unfortunately is of the era and the error is in saying unsupported Opteron

52

00:03:27,690  -->  00:03:36,630
pipes for plus end and string the operand in mathematics are the different values that you are using

53

00:03:36,650  -->  00:03:36,960
.

54

00:03:37,290  -->  00:03:41,220
And the plus is the operator and that's the symbol in the middle.

55

00:03:41,250  -->  00:03:47,060
And what it's telling you is that you cannot use the plus symbol for an integer and a string or a whole

56

00:03:47,070  -->  00:03:51,140
number and a string and it doesn't know what to do with the plus symbol.

57

00:03:51,210  -->  00:03:56,880
The plus symbol doesn't have any meaning for these two separate distinct types.

58

00:03:57,060  -->  00:03:59,970
So what do we do about this.

59

00:03:59,970  -->  00:04:04,510
Well that is something we're going to be looking at in the very next video.

60

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:15,080
But before we do that let's find out how we can convert these five years into a number of seconds.

61

00:04:15,120  -->  00:04:19,710
And the reason I want to do this is because the program we're going to be building in this section is

62

00:04:19,730  -->  00:04:19,800
.

63

00:04:19,830  -->  00:04:25,470
And year to second converters so the user is going to give us their age in years and we're going to

64

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:31,530
give it back to them in seconds just to get acquainted with Python and learn a bit more about this.

65

00:04:31,530  -->  00:04:37,330
So how would we convert this age variable into a number of seconds.

66

00:04:38,010  -->  00:04:43,380
Let's start small before we are able to convert between number of seconds we need to be able to convert

67

00:04:43,380  -->  00:04:48,390
it to a number of days and then days can turn to hours hours contard to minutes minutes and turn to

68

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:49,560
seconds.

69

00:04:49,560  -->  00:04:58,050
How would we calculate the number of days in five years and you can ignore any leap years.

70

00:04:58,530  -->  00:05:07,050
And the answer is you would do age multiplied by 365 because there's 365 days per year and that would

71

00:05:07,050  -->  00:05:13,020
give you five times 365 which is the number of days in five years.

72

00:05:13,020  -->  00:05:17,170
So knowing that how would we calculate the number of seconds.

73

00:05:17,730  -->  00:05:23,250
Well you've got your age which is the number of years times 365.

74

00:05:23,250  -->  00:05:24,950
So that gives you days.

75

00:05:25,130  -->  00:05:27,660
And now what would we want to do.

76

00:05:27,660  -->  00:05:29,160
Multiply it by

77

00:05:32,670  -->  00:05:38,700
24 which is the number of hours in each of those days and then 60 which is the number of minutes in

78

00:05:38,790  -->  00:05:43,860
each of those hours and then 60 which is the number of seconds in each of those minutes.

79

00:05:43,880  -->  00:05:49,570
And when we do that we get a long number which is the number of seconds in five years.

80

00:05:49,920  -->  00:05:54,660
And this is going to be important because we're going to be using this in order to convert the user's

81

00:05:54,720  -->  00:05:58,990
age when they run our program to the number of seconds.

82

00:05:59,340  -->  00:06:04,470
And also in the next video we're going to be looking at exactly how we can fix this error and make sure

83

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:09,910
that we are not getting these unsupported operand type errors.

84

00:06:09,930  -->  00:06:10,330
OK.

85

00:06:10,500  -->  00:06:12,630
So I'll see you in the next video.
