00:00:00,200  -->  00:00:06,060
Hi and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be looking at the split method.

2

00:00:06,260  -->  00:00:13,260
This method is going to be essential when we require users to give us various values at the same time

3

00:00:13,860  -->  00:00:17,030
and also in a wide array of other instances as well.

4

00:00:17,250  -->  00:00:22,620
But especially for this section we're going to need to use the Split method when we want our user to

5

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:26,400
give us multiple data points at the same time.

6

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:32,280
The data that the user is going to give us in this section lottery numbers that they want to play we're

7

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:36,300
going to ask them how many numbers you want to play or which numbers you want to play and then they're

8

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:40,920
going to tell us six numbers that they want to play.

9

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:45,710
As you may have guessed the applicant to be building in this section is a lottery app.

10

00:00:45,870  -->  00:00:51,070
So the user is going to have to pick six numbers that they want to play and they have to give us all

11

00:00:51,070  -->  00:00:53,010
the six numbers at the same time.

12

00:00:53,010  -->  00:01:03,330
Now they could for example just type the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then give us these six numbers and

13

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:08,960
we could simply take one character and that would be each of the numbers that they want to play in this

14

00:01:08,970  -->  00:01:10,040
lottery.

15

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:16,080
However if they wanted to give us a number that has two digits such as number 11 then we can't really

16

00:01:16,080  -->  00:01:18,240
do that with that method.

17

00:01:18,270  -->  00:01:29,460
So once the user is going to give us is a string in the format of five 16 twenty 3 four and one for

18

00:01:29,460  -->  00:01:30,560
example.

19

00:01:31,050  -->  00:01:35,350
And these are the six numbers that are usually one to play for example.

20

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:40,030
And what we have to do with that is extract each of the numbers.

21

00:01:40,980  -->  00:01:43,910
Let's assign this to a variable.

22

00:01:43,910  -->  00:01:45,650
When to Call numbers.

23

00:01:45,730  -->  00:01:55,710
And now we've got our numbers string that contains these things here every string has a method called

24

00:01:55,710  -->  00:02:04,770
split and the split method allows us to just do that generate a list from a string by splitting the

25

00:02:04,770  -->  00:02:08,130
string at a specific character.

26

00:02:08,130  -->  00:02:14,570
So what we want to do now is say numbers don't split and then the comma.

27

00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:18,720
So take your guess as to what this is going to do.

28

00:02:18,900  -->  00:02:26,860
It's going to generate a list but what is going to be each of the elements of that list.

29

00:02:26,910  -->  00:02:28,650
Think about that just for a moment.

30

00:02:28,870  -->  00:02:31,170
And now I'll press enter.

31

00:02:31,170  -->  00:02:35,280
And as you may have guessed each of the elements is the number itself.

32

00:02:35,330  -->  00:02:39,210
Five twenty five and so on but they are all strings.

33

00:02:39,220  -->  00:02:40,840
This makes sense.

34

00:02:41,030  -->  00:02:43,300
The parent is a string.

35

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:46,380
Each of the numbers is a string as well.

36

00:02:46,440  -->  00:02:51,350
So this is how our user is going to give us the numbers.

37

00:02:51,450  -->  00:02:57,480
It's going to be something along the lines of use on those phone numbers is going to be equal to input

38

00:02:58,250  -->  00:03:09,990
into your numbers separated by comments and then they are going to enter the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 for

39

00:03:09,990  -->  00:03:11,550
example.

40

00:03:11,550  -->  00:03:19,200
And then we're going to split that string user underscore numbers split on the comma and that is going

41

00:03:19,200  -->  00:03:21,850
to give us a list of numbers.

42

00:03:21,960  -->  00:03:24,200
But do note is that each number is still a string.

43

00:03:24,210  -->  00:03:26,760
So we may have to do some work with that.

44

00:03:26,760  -->  00:03:33,780
We're going to have to convert each of these numbers to an actual number so that we can then do some

45

00:03:33,780  -->  00:03:37,180
protesting with it calculate winnings and things like that.

46

00:03:37,200  -->  00:03:42,890
So let's try to convert that into numbers in the very next video.

47

00:03:42,960  -->  00:03:43,440
That's either
