00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:07,380
Hi We'll come back in this video we're looking at the nested select and the nested select is extremely

2

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:12,920
useful because it lets us nest queries inside other queries and you're probably wondering.

3

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:18,000
That sounds a bit like complex and I agree it is.

4

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:23,580
But let me give you an example as to why the nested select is useful and how you might go about using

5

00:00:23,580  -->  00:00:23,850
it.

6

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:26,230
Going to give you a couple examples in fact.

7

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:34,800
Let's see if we want to find out what items we own in our business which are above the average price

8

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:36,150
of our items.

9

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:44,160
For example we could do this if we wanted to figure out whether those items sell less well here's how

10

00:00:44,160  -->  00:00:54,030
the English language would try select store from items where price is greater than the average price

11

00:00:54,060  -->  00:00:56,480
.

12

00:00:57,230  -->  00:01:04,120
And I agree it would be very nice if this worked but it doesn't.

13

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:11,610
And now you're probably wondering well what about that having construct was having not useful in these

14

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:18,440
scenarios and having is not useful in this scenario because having is to be used with put up by.

15

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:21,860
And here we don't have a group by just selecting from one table.

16

00:01:22,380  -->  00:01:28,720
So having is not the answer the answer is the nested select.

17

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:33,830
We want to make sure that price is greater than the average price.

18

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:36,720
So how do we calculate the average price

19

00:01:40,090  -->  00:01:42,210
and we put that inside brackets down here.

20

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:50,840
So how do we calculate the average selling price of our items.

21

00:01:53,310  -->  00:02:04,020
And I may just look weird and wrong to do this but we just do what we've done before.

22

00:02:05,370  -->  00:02:10,450
Select average items price from items.

23

00:02:11,050  -->  00:02:12,430
There you go.

24

00:02:13,260  -->  00:02:19,770
So what that's doing is it is executing this select average items range from items and is putting the

25

00:02:19,770  -->  00:02:21,870
result in there.

26

00:02:22,080  -->  00:02:27,360
So we're going to see a select start from items where price is greater than the result of this query

27

00:02:27,360  -->  00:02:30,360
.

28

00:02:30,360  -->  00:02:34,760
And these are the items that are above average price.

29

00:02:35,340  -->  00:02:40,520
It's quite nice but I mean it's nice we can put it in the where.

30

00:02:40,560  -->  00:02:46,860
Which means that we can do more advanced filtering and based on values of other tables or indeed the

31

00:02:46,860  -->  00:02:51,050
same table and that's nice.

32

00:02:51,600  -->  00:02:52,970
What else can we use it for.

33

00:02:53,400  -->  00:02:59,260
Well let's find out for these items or indeed for any item.

34

00:02:59,430  -->  00:03:07,290
How much above or below the average price they are just really give us a bit of a deviation from the

35

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:08,350
average.

36

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:21,540
We're going to do select items name items price and the price we want to subtract from it the average

37

00:03:24,480  -->  00:03:27,170
from items.

38

00:03:27,810  -->  00:03:28,200
Okay.

39

00:03:28,200  -->  00:03:29,730
So let me explain what went on here.

40

00:03:30,150  -->  00:03:37,050
We're going to select items not name and items not price from items but we are going to subtract from

41

00:03:37,050  -->  00:03:38,180
items on price.

42

00:03:38,250  -->  00:03:43,710
The average selling price of our items and we know how to do that we're just done it in the last query

43

00:03:43,710  -->  00:03:44,280
.

44

00:03:44,490  -->  00:03:51,390
It's just going to be as you know select average items price from items

45

00:03:55,680  -->  00:04:04,140
pego expenses some of them are quite expensive but that is how you would go about that.

46

00:04:04,210  -->  00:04:06,140
And notice how I've put everything in one line and here.

47

00:04:06,150  -->  00:04:11,990
But again you can put it in multiple lines if you want it doesn't matter.

48

00:04:12,000  -->  00:04:18,720
This would be the normal way to put it in indenting the sub query.

49

00:04:18,720  -->  00:04:19,390
OK.

50

00:04:19,830  -->  00:04:21,680
One more example for you.

51

00:04:22,080  -->  00:04:29,130
Let's create a view for luxury items which also tells us the price difference from the average luxury

52

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:30,280
item.

53

00:04:31,050  -->  00:04:36,630
So as you know luxury items I'm going to or rather expensive items I'm going to call expensive items

54

00:04:36,630  -->  00:04:39,580
those items that are above $100.

55

00:04:40,140  -->  00:04:48,260
So the first thing to do is to find out the average selling price of items that are over $100.

56

00:04:48,420  -->  00:04:49,740
I think you can do this.

57

00:04:49,900  -->  00:04:59,580
It is what I mean construed a complicated thing to explain but the average price of items which are

58

00:04:59,700  -->  00:05:03,930
over $100 in price.

59

00:05:06,500  -->  00:05:07,050
Okay.

60

00:05:07,260  -->  00:05:16,680
So that would be select average of items not place from items when the price of the item is over 100

61

00:05:18,460  -->  00:05:21,290
and that gives me 725.

62

00:05:21,300  -->  00:05:26,400
So that is the average price of my sort of quote unquote expensive items.

63

00:05:26,430  -->  00:05:28,490
Right.

64

00:05:29,450  -->  00:05:31,080
And now I want to select

65

00:05:33,510  -->  00:05:41,460
the expensive items and the difference between their price and the average price of expensive items

66

00:05:42,780  -->  00:05:50,820
that would be select stock and items not price minus this query

67

00:05:54,030  -->  00:06:00,280
from items where price is greater than 100.

68

00:06:00,390  -->  00:06:08,340
So once again what is happening is that I'm selecting all of the columns from items and I'm also selecting

69

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:13,100
items on price which is the price of the item from selecting the price twice.

70

00:06:13,350  -->  00:06:21,720
But this price I'm going to subtract from it the result of this query which is 725 and I'm going to

71

00:06:21,720  -->  00:06:25,830
do this for all my items with their price is over 100.

72

00:06:25,830  -->  00:06:30,640
So this of Queenie's giving me the result of the average price of items over 100.

73

00:06:31,080  -->  00:06:37,550
And this query is only getting those items that are over 100.

74

00:06:37,710  -->  00:06:40,920
So as you can see this laptop is the most expensive.

75

00:06:40,960  -->  00:06:41,830
That's right.

76

00:06:41,850  -->  00:06:47,820
The screen is the cheapest and then the volume is the most deviated from the average downwards.

77

00:06:47,820  -->  00:06:51,130
And then this one is slightly less so.

78

00:06:51,270  -->  00:06:59,910
And finally we could also create this into a view just to recap we could create view for example expensive

79

00:07:00,240  -->  00:07:11,770
items diff as all of this and now we can do select star from expensive items.

80

00:07:13,820  -->  00:07:15,370
And there you go.

81

00:07:15,750  -->  00:07:19,310
Notice how we have not named this Colan So he has a question mark.

82

00:07:19,310  -->  00:07:21,720
Call question mark which is not the best name.

83

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:28,350
So let's go back and fix that drop with you and then let's go in here.

84

00:07:29,640  -->  00:07:35,850
And this item's price minus the query of the end we can give an alias as

85

00:07:38,490  -->  00:07:41,290
average beef for example.

86

00:07:42,120  -->  00:07:47,970
And where is how because this is a column name I can use double quotation marks and then we can select

87

00:07:47,980  -->  00:07:52,550
start from expensive items.

88

00:07:53,710  -->  00:07:57,680
And now that has the name vair average if.

89

00:07:58,240  -->  00:08:06,450
Also notice that because the price was created in the table as a numeric type of 10 Colmar 2 it is limited

90

00:08:06,450  -->  00:08:09,560
to 2 decimal places but this is a calculation.

91

00:08:09,570  -->  00:08:11,940
And so it is not limited to two decimal places.

92

00:08:11,970  -->  00:08:15,020
And that way it has all these decimal places.

93

00:08:15,390  -->  00:08:16,430
There's ways around that.

94

00:08:16,440  -->  00:08:19,110
But for now it doesn't really bother us that much.

95

00:08:19,110  -->  00:08:20,840
So we're going to leave it at that.

96

00:08:21,780  -->  00:08:25,970
And that is how you might go about creating some queries.

97

00:08:25,980  -->  00:08:32,120
Remember you can use a squeeze in the WHERE clause or you can use them in the select part.

98

00:08:32,160  -->  00:08:33,460
You can use them essentially anyway.

99

00:08:33,510  -->  00:08:40,020
And my suggestion to you is if you think that you need a subplot they should query just put it in and

100

00:08:40,020  -->  00:08:41,280
see what happens.

101

00:08:41,580  -->  00:08:48,660
And that is the best way to learn and get acquainted with sequel and make sure that you know everything

102

00:08:48,660  -->  00:08:52,170
that we've been talking about just by watching the videos.

103

00:08:52,230  -->  00:08:53,630
It is not enough.

104

00:08:53,820  -->  00:08:55,470
You need to go in here.

105

00:08:55,470  -->  00:09:02,880
This is why I've gone into installing posh grenades and using it all that stuff so that you do use it

106

00:09:03,420  -->  00:09:05,040
and that is my recommendation.

107

00:09:05,040  -->  00:09:10,310
Don't stop at watching the video even though that's good.

108

00:09:10,320  -->  00:09:12,130
Make sure to try it.

109

00:09:12,240  -->  00:09:13,040
Program it.

110

00:09:13,110  -->  00:09:18,900
Write it test it in as many combinations as you can because that's what's going to make the difference

111

00:09:18,910  -->  00:09:22,310
and that's what's going to let you learn a lot more.

112

00:09:23,220  -->  00:09:25,500
OK so with that said now it's the end of this video.

113

00:09:25,530  -->  00:09:28,420
So thanks for watching and I'll see you on the next one.
