00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:06,910
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to be looking at installing psycho PGE 2 on Mac Cyclopedia

2

00:00:06,920  -->  00:00:13,250
two is a library for Python that allows Python programs to communicate with Pasqua sequel.

3

00:00:14,190  -->  00:00:16,110
So let's do that in this video.

4

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:24,690
Let's install that library first thing to do is to find out way post-career sequel is installed now

5

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:25,860
on Mac.

6

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:32,100
I've got post-career sequel here installed in my applications but this only includes a few of the already

7

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:39,930
sort of functional applications such as PG&E and three we've already executed.

8

00:00:39,930  -->  00:00:46,230
If you install POS with sequel 9.5 then it will be in the same location as mine which I'm going to show

9

00:00:46,230  -->  00:00:47,620
you where that is.

10

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,390
If you didn't install it when nine point five.

11

00:00:50,410  -->  00:00:51,730
So just a different version.

12

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:54,270
Maybe a later version or an earlier version.

13

00:00:54,270  -->  00:00:57,780
Then the location may be slightly different.

14

00:00:58,630  -->  00:00:59,640
OK let's.

15

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:05,910
Right click on Posawatz equal nine point five and go to Macintosh HD here as you can see.

16

00:01:05,940  -->  00:01:12,100
I've got a bunch of sort of greyed out folders which are hidden folders.

17

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:17,970
We want to go into one of these non hidden folders which is a library.

18

00:01:18,360  -->  00:01:23,970
And in here we want to find the Pasko sequel folder then the appropriate version.

19

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:28,740
In my case nine point five percent said if you've installed a different version then it will be different

20

00:01:28,750  -->  00:01:29,160
.

21

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:36,060
And then they've been folded in so there's been folder there is a lot of programs that Pasqua sequel

22

00:01:36,060  -->  00:01:37,200
depends on.

23

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:43,330
And more importantly there is one that is used to config the Patreus sequel and make sure that I can

24

00:01:43,320  -->  00:01:44,790
communicate with it.

25

00:01:45,000  -->  00:01:52,390
And that is pg underscore config so let's make sure that we know this path.

26

00:01:52,440  -->  00:02:01,200
And now let's go into a terminal window which I'm going to open here and we are going to do the following

27

00:02:01,220  -->  00:02:01,550
.

28

00:02:01,860  -->  00:02:08,610
We're going to do export path equals and whether this is going to do it is going to set an environment

29

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:09,390
variable.

30

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:10,370
We don't really know what that is.

31

00:02:10,410  -->  00:02:15,450
And we will cover more of the terminal and how it's used later on in the course.

32

00:02:15,510  -->  00:02:20,400
But for now let's just do this to make sure that we've installed the program and that we can communicate

33

00:02:20,460  -->  00:02:21,440
with policy.

34

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:27,110
So export path equals dollar path colon.

35

00:02:27,780  -->  00:02:29,940
And then we're going to put in the path.

36

00:02:29,970  -->  00:02:39,240
So the way we can get the path is by finding a Finder window that has this path selected and then going

37

00:02:39,240  -->  00:02:45,110
over to the terminal make sure that we've written export path equals dollar path code on.

38

00:02:45,360  -->  00:02:52,800
And then click on hold on this folder and drag it over here and then press enter.

39

00:02:53,220  -->  00:02:58,370
And now we are ready what to do is type Pipp 3.5.

40

00:02:58,380  -->  00:03:03,890
If you installed Python 3.5 if you sort by the entry point for it be Pipp 3.4.

41

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:13,680
And if you install Python 2.7 it'll just be Pip Pip 3.5 install dash dash upgrade wheel

42

00:03:18,720  -->  00:03:23,640
and then Pip 3.5 install dash dash upgrade.

43

00:03:23,720  -->  00:03:25,860
Set up tools

44

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:34,900
and finally get 3.5 install psycho Peachi too.

45

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:42,450
And once that successful it'll tell you you've successfully installed Sanko OPG to then congratulations

46

00:03:42,810  -->  00:03:49,860
you are ready to proceed and we are going to be in this section constructing an app that will allow

47

00:03:49,860  -->  00:03:53,960
us to communicate with possible sequel just to see how that works.

48

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:55,060
Without further ado.

49

00:03:55,130  -->  00:03:56,490
See you in the next video.
