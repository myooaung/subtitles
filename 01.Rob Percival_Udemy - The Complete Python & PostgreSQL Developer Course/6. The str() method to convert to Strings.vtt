00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.700
Hello and welcome back in this video let's look at the str method.

2

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:12.870
And the reason why we're making a video just for this specific method or command the same thing is because

3

00:00:12.930  -->  00:00:17.460
it's so important for you to not make this mistake in your programs.

4

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:19.700
It is a mistake that happens very often.

5

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:20.990
It's very common mistake.

6

00:00:21.100  -->  00:00:25.650
And in this video we're quickly going to learn exactly how to avoid it and something you have to remember

7

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:28.030
and when you're making your programs.

8

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:34.100
So in the last video we try to add our age to the number of two blistering years and that we want to

9

00:00:34.090  -->  00:00:37.100
be to give us five years.

10

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:41.620
However what it gave us was an era which is not ideal.

11

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:48.290
That is because we were trying to add an integer a whole number and a string.

12

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:54.050
And Python does not know what to do when we try to add those two distinct types together.

13

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:59.690
So what to do is treat the number as a string.

14

00:00:59.700  -->  00:01:07.480
Convert it to a string where we can do that is for example by making another variable.

15

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:11.470
I'm going to create a variable called Age underscore string.

16

00:01:12.510  -->  00:01:16.920
And this is going to be equal to SDR which is the name of a method.

17

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:20.000
Notice how it goes purple an inside SDR.

18

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:27.150
We're going to put our age variable which is the number five and where this is going to do is is going

19

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:33.900
to convert essentially the number to a string and it's going to put it inside this variable.

20

00:01:33.900  -->  00:01:38.390
Notice that our variable age is still the number 5.

21

00:01:39.720  -->  00:01:45.480
OK so now we've made a variable that contains the string defined essentially version of age.

22

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:49.500
And now we can do age underscore string plus years.

23

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:52.470
And this is joining one string with another.

24

00:01:52.660  -->  00:01:56.270
And you know what is going to happen when we do this.

25

00:01:56.400  -->  00:01:59.650
We saw this in the second video.

26

00:01:59.970  -->  00:02:06.810
And what is going to happen is that it's going to join them together and give us five years.

27

00:02:07.050  -->  00:02:13.640
However you have to create an entirely new variable which is essentially the same as the age only it's

28

00:02:13.770  -->  00:02:16.080
with the quotation marks around it.

29

00:02:16.140  -->  00:02:22.310
So there's an easier way there's a slightly more concise way of doing this.

30

00:02:22.380  -->  00:02:32.650
The value we're assigning to each string is essed your age which means that SDR age is this five here

31

00:02:32.660  -->  00:02:32.760
.

32

00:02:32.940  -->  00:02:35.340
And then we're just putting it inside our very.

33

00:02:35.790  -->  00:02:37.930
But we don't have to put it inside our variable.

34

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:47.610
We can simply say SDR age plus years and that is going to convert age to a string and then adds that

35

00:02:48.060  -->  00:02:54.960
two years and give us the same value so we can completely circumvent the creation of a new variable

36

00:02:54.980  -->  00:02:55.280
.

37

00:02:55.620  -->  00:02:56.640
And that's good.

38

00:02:56.640  -->  00:03:02.520
It makes this slightly more readable and it means that we don't have to create a new variable for this

39

00:03:02.610  -->  00:03:04.510
simple purpose.

40

00:03:04.560  -->  00:03:10.800
So in this video we've looked at the str method and you can use the SDR method not only with integers

41

00:03:11.010  -->  00:03:18.960
but also with a wide array of other data types and in the next video we're going to be looking at how

42

00:03:18.960  -->  00:03:25.950
we can create a program in a file and run it from the python shell as opposed to running it statement

43

00:03:25.950  -->  00:03:26.850
by statement.

44

00:03:27.060  -->  00:03:29.530
So bear with me and I'll see you in the next video
