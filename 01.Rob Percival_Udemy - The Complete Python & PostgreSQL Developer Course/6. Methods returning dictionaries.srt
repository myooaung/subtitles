00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:07,140
Hi will come back in this video we're going to look at methods that return dictionaries returning a

2

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:15,960
dictionary is exactly the same as returning an integer or a list or as we look at later on a table to

3

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:16,860
return the dictionary.

4

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:23,100
The only thing we have to do is say return and then the dictionary that we want return on a method can

5

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:25,550
do that.

6

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:34,050
In this section the app we're creating is one that will allow us to create new students and give them

7

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:42,150
a set of marks and then will let us calculate the average mark of one of the students reasonably simple

8

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:47,940
program but it is to introduce a number of things that are going to be essential for later on such as

9

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:51,470
dictionaries being one of them.

10

00:00:51,600  -->  00:00:59,940
What I'm going to start with in this video is with a method that will allow us to create a new student

11

00:01:00,000  -->  00:01:01,070
dictionary.

12

00:01:01,500  -->  00:01:09,210
This means that it's going to ask the user for the student's name and it's going to create this dictionary

13

00:01:09,240  -->  00:01:13,300
that contains a list of marks which will initially be empty.

14

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:17,030
And then it's going to return that.

15

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:19,560
Let's let's walk through that

16

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:29,040
as we know we can create a method with the death keyword and then we give it that name and then we give

17

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:30,860
it the opening and closing brackets.

18

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:36,040
And that tells them that this is a method and inside the method we can put some code.

19

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:42,810
And as we know when we execute or call the method the code inside will run from top to bottom.

20

00:01:43,200  -->  00:01:54,200
And this method is going to ask the user for the student's name and then it's going to create the dictionary

21

00:01:54,930  -->  00:02:08,130
and the format name is going to be the student name and Marks is going to be a list and then it's going

22

00:02:08,130  -->  00:02:09,540
to return that dictionary

23

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:18,150
also whenever you have a method that doesn't do anything or doesn't do anything yet you can just use

24

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:26,340
pass as a placeholder and Python accepts that if you don't type anything then Python tells you hey this

25

00:02:26,340  -->  00:02:31,620
method has no body even though it's got a few comments comments don't count as we know and then it says

26

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:34,030
that it expects there to be something there.

27

00:02:34,050  -->  00:02:37,530
So you can you just use pass and that's fine.

28

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:39,720
Or we can indeed implement it.

29

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:47,550
Now you can already ask the user for a name you know how to do that and you can certainly create a dictionary

30

00:02:47,550  -->  00:02:47,900
.

31

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:54,180
I mean we've done it appear is going to be name and then the student's name which the user is going

32

00:02:54,180  -->  00:02:57,050
to give you and then it's going to be marks.

33

00:02:57,080  -->  00:03:01,750
Remember the comma and an empty list and then it's going to return that dictionary.

34

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:04,440
I think you can do all of those things.

35

00:03:05,340  -->  00:03:12,380
So go ahead and post the video and then come back once you've attempted that.

36

00:03:14,250  -->  00:03:18,190
OK now that you've tried that let's go ahead and do it here.

37

00:03:18,610  -->  00:03:27,630
The first thing we want to do is to say name is going to be input please enter the new students name

38

00:03:28,690  -->  00:03:31,170
and we've used this plenty of times before.

39

00:03:31,320  -->  00:03:36,840
Input takes in a string and the string is what gets printed out and the user can then start typing at

40

00:03:36,840  -->  00:03:38,050
the end of the string.

41

00:03:38,070  -->  00:03:43,740
And here we would expect the name of the new student and then we're going to use that name in sign our

42

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:51,060
dictionary and would to create student data and data other funding and where you're from.

43

00:03:51,270  -->  00:04:01,080
And this is going to be name is name and remember name inside quotation marks is the string the literal

44

00:04:01,080  -->  00:04:09,390
representation of these symbols and a m n e and name a without the quotation marks is a variable which

45

00:04:09,390  -->  00:04:11,280
we have defined up here.

46

00:04:11,410  -->  00:04:14,920
Remember if we do not define a variable called name.

47

00:04:14,940  -->  00:04:16,560
For example I call it names.

48

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:21,780
Then Python gives them an error because it cannot find names so I has to match exactly but it can be

49

00:04:21,780  -->  00:04:23,900
anything you want.

50

00:04:24,010  -->  00:04:27,570
And finally Marx was just going to be an empty list.

51

00:04:27,600  -->  00:04:32,180
We know that this is how we can create an empty list and there is a list with zero elements.

52

00:04:32,200  -->  00:04:38,190
But definitely could have elements here if we wanted but it doesn't make sense when we are creating

53

00:04:38,190  -->  00:04:41,080
a student for the student already having a set of marks.

54

00:04:41,100  -->  00:04:43,650
So we just put an empty list in there.

55

00:04:44,610  -->  00:04:52,380
And finally we can return the student date and now I'm going to delete the comments and the reason why

56

00:04:52,380  -->  00:04:55,500
I'm deleting the comments is because it's really easy.

57

00:04:55,500  -->  00:05:02,580
Just from the code to understand what this method is doing is asking for a name that is creating a dictionary

58

00:05:02,580  -->  00:05:08,190
that contains that name and a set of marks and then returning that it doesn't really need any extra

59

00:05:08,190  -->  00:05:09,410
explanation.

60

00:05:09,690  -->  00:05:17,960
And if we leave the extra explanation here and then next week we come back and change something because

61

00:05:17,960  -->  00:05:21,650
it is a comment and it doesn't run and it doesn't cause errors.

62

00:05:21,840  -->  00:05:27,330
We may forget to update the comment with the new info the new things that we've written in the method

63

00:05:27,810  -->  00:05:34,370
and if we do that then it would suddenly lose a lot of value and it would indeed become confusing because

64

00:05:34,380  -->  00:05:38,380
the the comment would be saying one thing and the code will be saying something different.

65

00:05:38,460  -->  00:05:43,570
So if not necessary let's remove the comment and I don't think it is necessary.

66

00:05:43,590  -->  00:05:44,990
The method it creates.

67

00:05:45,170  -->  00:05:48,300
And as for a name put in a dictionary and then returns that.

68

00:05:48,420  -->  00:05:54,030
I think it's fairly obvious what is going on in this method.

69

00:05:54,990  -->  00:06:02,700
None that we've got the method to create A-student we can run the thing and see what happens.

70

00:06:02,730  -->  00:06:09,420
Remember because the method is defined above we need to put the print statement below it and I'm going

71

00:06:09,420  -->  00:06:14,470
to just call print or create student create student call is going to happen.

72

00:06:14,470  -->  00:06:22,260
First we're going to jump from here up here and we're going to get asked to enter the name then we're

73

00:06:22,260  -->  00:06:24,470
going to create a dictionary and return that.

74

00:06:24,480  -->  00:06:29,440
So what we're going to be printing is the student data that we've created.

75

00:06:29,990  -->  00:06:32,230
OK let's press play up here.

76

00:06:32,760  -->  00:06:38,220
Now notice how we get asked to enter the student's name so I'm going to put my name and then what we

77

00:06:38,220  -->  00:06:39,870
get out where we get printed.

78

00:06:39,870  -->  00:06:43,350
Is this dictionary that we have created.

79

00:06:43,410  -->  00:06:45,380
I would always recommend you do this.

80

00:06:45,390  -->  00:06:51,390
This process of creating a small method that does something and then printing it out to make sure that

81

00:06:51,390  -->  00:06:58,110
it works the way you expect it is something you should get accustomed to doing and testing things out

82

00:06:58,170  -->  00:07:00,060
as you go.

83

00:07:00,060  -->  00:07:06,120
Now that we've got that ready however we are ready to move on to the next set of functionality which

84

00:07:06,120  -->  00:07:12,660
is going to allow us to add more marks in and because naturally an empty list isn't very useful in the

85

00:07:12,660  -->  00:07:17,280
next video we're going to be appending things to at least not to.
