1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:02,280
One will come back in this video.

2

00:00:02,280  -->  00:00:09,050
We're going to look at how we can add or append a mark in that student data dictionary.

3

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:15,300
However remember that when we create a student that is going to give us a new of these dictionaries

4

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:23,940
and we want to be able to add a mark to one of those specific dictionaries and not to all of them simultaneously

5

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:33,000
For example I'm going to give you a small bit of structure and then I'm going to ask you to complete

6

00:00:33,330  -->  00:00:37,610
the challenge in order to add a mark.

7

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:39,880
We know that we have to call the aband method.

8

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:45,450
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a method called add Mark and this method is going

9

00:00:45,450  -->  00:00:47,610
to take in a student.

10

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:50,080
And this is going to be a dictionary.

11

00:00:50,370  -->  00:00:59,850
And then what this method is going to do is it's going to append a mark to the student dictionary and

12

00:00:59,850  -->  00:01:01,720
that's it.

13

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:09,270
That's really the mark that is going to append is going to have to be another parameter student is going

14

00:01:09,270  -->  00:01:10,380
to be a dictionary.

15

00:01:10,410  -->  00:01:13,830
Mark is going to be a number an integer.

16

00:01:14,460  -->  00:01:16,740
And I think you can you can do that pretty easily.

17

00:01:16,740  -->  00:01:25,080
Remember that student is going to be dictionary in this format so I suggest pause the video remove the

18

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:33,500
pass and try to do that and then come back and we'll continue through and we'll do that here.

19

00:01:34,880  -->  00:01:35,630
OK.

20

00:01:35,910  -->  00:01:39,480
Let's first remove the past because we're going to be changing this here.

21

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:47,370
And the only thing we have to do is student and Ramba marks because we want to access the key marks

22

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:49,090
in the student dictionary.

23

00:01:49,310  -->  00:01:55,640
And I want to say append mark and that's it.

24

00:01:55,760  -->  00:02:00,240
And now you're thinking do we not have to return things we have written things before.

25

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:01,350
Why are we not returning things.

26

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:06,860
Now remember that default in Python is return None.

27

00:02:07,230  -->  00:02:13,580
OK so I'm going to make it explicit just for a moment but this is not necessary if you remove it.

28

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,960
Remember it's still there.

29

00:02:15,960  -->  00:02:22,140
This is the default in Python return None is what happens if you don't have a return statement.

30

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:28,160
So let's let's begin with treating each student with a call it s.

31

00:02:28,250  -->  00:02:28,860
Not a very good name.

32

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:31,010
But I'm going to call it s for now.

33

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:32,210
Create student.

34

00:02:32,340  -->  00:02:37,680
And remember this is going to ask me to enter the student name and then it's going to create a dictionary

35

00:02:37,950  -->  00:02:39,920
and then won't return that dictionary.

36

00:02:39,990  -->  00:02:43,090
So June and it's essentially going to be a dictionary.

37

00:02:43,110  -->  00:02:51,180
So as it's going to be a dictionary and then what I'm going to do here is print s and that's going to

38

00:02:51,180  -->  00:02:54,020
be the dictionary you remember that we've created here.

39

00:02:54,360  -->  00:02:58,510
There is a method definition in the middle but that doesn't matter.

40

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:02,760
Remember that defining a method doesn't mean work cannot execute the method.

41

00:03:02,760  -->  00:03:04,640
We have to call the method first.

42

00:03:04,650  -->  00:03:10,110
So let's let's run this first and I'm going to type in my name and notice how what gets printed out

43

00:03:10,470  -->  00:03:12,400
is empty as well.

44

00:03:12,410  -->  00:03:13,290
Market is empty.

45

00:03:13,350  -->  00:03:14,020
The name is Jose.

46

00:03:14,020  -->  00:03:21,990
So that's the dictionary that we created before and comes back to us defining the method doesn't mean

47

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:23,300
that a method gets executed.

48

00:03:23,400  -->  00:03:25,330
It just say that the method exists.

49

00:03:25,380  -->  00:03:27,460
I don't know what happened there but there we go.

50

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:37,110
The method exists after line 16 so now we can call Adam Mark after line 16 not before line 12.

51

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:41,380
So what happens if I do demarc and then I pass in S and then they say 5.

52

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:46,550
For example remember X would be the student 5 would be the mark.

53

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:53,220
So I would append the five onto Marks what do you think is going to happen.

54

00:03:53,220  -->  00:03:58,980
Do you think that X is going to be like here.

55

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:06,640
It's going to have an empty marks list because I should return a student here.

56

00:04:07,170  -->  00:04:11,100
Do you think X is going to have a 5 in the marks.

57

00:04:11,160  -->  00:04:13,250
Do you think it's going to give me an error.

58

00:04:13,980  -->  00:04:15,300
What do you think.

59

00:04:15,360  -->  00:04:23,220
Now let's run it and see what happens and I'll explain why it happens.

60

00:04:23,520  -->  00:04:27,590
I'll put the name in and there's the five.

61

00:04:27,600  -->  00:04:29,980
So there was no need to return anything.

62

00:04:30,010  -->  00:04:33,420
The tone is redundant as you know.

63

00:04:33,480  -->  00:04:37,020
Under-five nevertheless is still there.

64

00:04:37,050  -->  00:04:40,750
So what has happened is Python has got the ace.

65

00:04:41,490  -->  00:04:50,190
And we've defined a method which takes in a student and a mark and then it says student marks append

66

00:04:50,250  -->  00:04:51,440
that Mark.

67

00:04:52,080  -->  00:05:03,240
And then when we call out Mark that S doesn't get copied the value of x does not go into the student

68

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:06,630
variable but rather they are the same thing.

69

00:05:06,630  -->  00:05:17,790
So then when we modify a student we are really modifying as and this is very common is passing by reference

70

00:05:17,790  -->  00:05:18,180
.

71

00:05:18,180  -->  00:05:24,030
And this is a common term in computer science for development something you should know passing by reference

72

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:37,300
as is what we're passing here is not the value of this it's not the dictionary but rather the location

73

00:05:37,300  -->  00:05:38,820
of where that dictionary is stored.

74

00:05:38,820  -->  00:05:44,670
If you want to show where passing a reference to the dictionary and student is a reference to the same

75

00:05:44,670  -->  00:05:49,780
dictionary so s and student have both the reference to the same thing.

76

00:05:50,040  -->  00:05:56,010
So when we modify student we're modifying s because they are both referencing the same dictionary behind

77

00:05:56,010  -->  00:05:56,630
the scenes.

78

00:05:56,640  -->  00:06:04,940
It's something quite deep and quite theoretical but that is what's happening behind the scenes.

79

00:06:04,940  -->  00:06:06,120
OK.

80

00:06:06,580  -->  00:06:13,330
This is unlike for example and I'm going to just scroll down and make it clearer for you.

81

00:06:13,380  -->  00:06:20,020
Add number x and y.

82

00:06:20,700  -->  00:06:27,290
This is unlike me doing X equals x plus why.

83

00:06:28,050  -->  00:06:30,130
And then I can define X up here.

84

00:06:30,180  -->  00:06:41,050
Actually it was five when I got the and number number X and 10 and that is exactly what we've done above

85

00:06:41,060  -->  00:06:41,370
.

86

00:06:41,880  -->  00:06:48,240
But I'm sure I'm going to call this this and in fact just pilot that a complaint

87

00:06:51,010  -->  00:06:54,460
is exactly what we've done above essentially.

88

00:06:54,840  -->  00:07:01,320
But if we print that out you'll see that it is still 5.

89

00:07:01,820  -->  00:07:05,150
So you can see there five is zed.

90

00:07:05,370  -->  00:07:13,460
And the reason why that is is because Zayde the number five is a primitive value.

91

00:07:13,770  -->  00:07:20,880
And that means that it gets passed via value passing by value and that's another important thing.

92

00:07:20,880  -->  00:07:24,450
These are the only two ways that you can pass an argument by the way.

93

00:07:24,660  -->  00:07:27,080
I'm sorry about that keeps popping up.

94

00:07:27,750  -->  00:07:36,930
And what's happening is that the zid then the value 10 and it's the only five that is inside Zayde gets

95

00:07:36,990  -->  00:07:42,030
assigned to x and now x and z are completely different things.

96

00:07:42,030  -->  00:07:50,790
So when we change X up here then and nothing nothing happens essentially with Zayd because they are

97

00:07:50,790  -->  00:07:52,850
getting passed by value.

98

00:07:53,670  -->  00:07:54,170
OK.

99

00:07:54,300  -->  00:08:00,330
So that was a small aside and I'm sorry about going on a tangent there but nevertheless an important

100

00:08:00,390  -->  00:08:05,130
tangent and important thing for you to understand this student here is the same as X.

101

00:08:05,190  -->  00:08:11,090
So when we change that student we don't have to then return it because it changes the thing that's coming

102

00:08:11,130  -->  00:08:14,530
out as well.

103

00:08:14,610  -->  00:08:15,820
So that's everything for this video.

104

00:08:15,840  -->  00:08:24,330
We've learned how we can add a mark to each student and now we are ready to proceed and to the next

105

00:08:24,330  -->  00:08:24,920
video.

106

00:08:24,980  -->  00:08:30,740
We're going to be looking at how we can calculate the average mark for a given student.

107

00:08:30,780  -->  00:08:32,240
So I'll see you there.
