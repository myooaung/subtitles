00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:07.440
Hi will come back in this video we're going to look at some method some method is a built in method

2

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:16.470
in Python and what it does is just allows you to add together a list of numbers and give you a quick

3

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:20.500
example of what the method can do.

4

00:00:20.500  -->  00:00:26.760
I'm going to print and what's going to go inside the print is the same method with a list of numbers

5

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:29.200
1 3 and 5.

6

00:00:29.220  -->  00:00:36.150
So as you know what's going to happen is we are going to execute some method with this list and then

7

00:00:36.150  -->  00:00:37.080
we're going to print that out.

8

00:00:37.080  -->  00:00:43.140
So the thing that is inside the innermost thing gets executed first and the next one then the next one

9

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:43.380
.

10

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:48.640
The first thing we'll do is create that list then execute the method with that and then print that out

11

00:00:48.640  -->  00:00:49.290
.

12

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:55.200
Let's run that just so you guys can see what's going to happen and naturally what you would expect is

13

00:00:55.260  -->  00:00:58.760
as the name says for these things to be added together.

14

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:04.760
I need what you get out is 9 which is one plus three plus five.

15

00:01:04.830  -->  00:01:06.040
So this method is there.

16

00:01:06.150  -->  00:01:09.850
So you don't have to do the for loop yourself and add the things together.

17

00:01:10.200  -->  00:01:15.640
It just makes things a bit easier really using this method.

18

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:22.020
We are now going to create another method in our program to calculate the average grade or average mark

19

00:01:22.320  -->  00:01:26.330
of one of the students like in previous videos.

20

00:01:26.370  -->  00:01:30.010
I'm going to give you some structure of what the method is going to look like.

21

00:01:30.180  -->  00:01:35.490
And then I would ask you to implement it so that you can solidify your learning.

22

00:01:35.970  -->  00:01:42.940
I would call this method calculate average mark and it would take in a student.

23

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:49.680
And remember this student is really a dictionary in this format.

24

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:55.200
So you know it's going to have a name and you know it's going to have a Marx key and the market is going

25

00:01:55.200  -->  00:02:03.720
to be a list of numbers probably integers although it could be floating point numbers as well.

26

00:02:03.840  -->  00:02:14.880
Then what this method is going to do is add together all of the student marks and divide them by the

27

00:02:14.880  -->  00:02:21.360
total number of marks and that would give you an average something you may want to think about as well

28

00:02:21.530  -->  00:02:29.340
as what happens if the student has no marks yet.

29

00:02:29.340  -->  00:02:30.840
Adding together all of that you need marks.

30

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:38.130
You can do with some method you just have to some student marks and that would give you the total dividing

31

00:02:38.220  -->  00:02:42.350
the total number of marks you can do using the len method that we've seen before.

32

00:02:42.540  -->  00:02:48.540
LEN of student marks will give you the total count of marks and if you divide the total marks by the

33

00:02:48.540  -->  00:02:50.550
count of marks that will give you an average.

34

00:02:50.550  -->  00:02:56.290
However remember that if the count is 0 you would be dividing by zero and that will give you an error

35

00:02:56.290  -->  00:02:57.250
.

36

00:02:57.750  -->  00:03:00.830
I would recommend now posing the video on giving this ago.

37

00:03:01.260  -->  00:03:06.750
You may want to ignore the last what happens if the student has no marks because that's a bit of an

38

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:07.430
edge case.

39

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:13.500
You can ignore that just for now and we cover that in just a moment and just go ahead and do that and

40

00:03:13.500  -->  00:03:17.230
then come back and we'll implement the first couple of parts and then the last Bargewell

41

00:03:20.710  -->  00:03:22.480
OK number you've tried that.

42

00:03:22.530  -->  00:03:25.990
Let's go ahead and do all of these things.

43

00:03:26.040  -->  00:03:30.350
The first thing is to calculate the total sum of the student marks.

44

00:03:30.420  -->  00:03:39.270
So total can be sum of student marks and as we know this is going to add them all up and put the resultant

45

00:03:39.270  -->  00:03:42.730
value inside our total variable.

46

00:03:43.680  -->  00:03:52.680
And then we are going to divide them by the total number of marks so we could say a number is Lenn of

47

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:55.020
student marks.

48

00:03:55.030  -->  00:04:01.620
We know this is how we can calculate the count of elements in a list.

49

00:04:01.620  -->  00:04:05.850
And finally we can return total divided by number.

50

00:04:06.900  -->  00:04:11.590
However we've not thought about what happens if the student has no marks.

51

00:04:11.610  -->  00:04:13.910
What happens is that Lin would be zero.

52

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:20.170
And then we would be dividing something by zero and therefore we would get an error.

53

00:04:20.220  -->  00:04:21.620
So we want to avoid that.

54

00:04:21.810  -->  00:04:32.420
And really the only way to avoid doing that is if number is 0 returns 0 and have not returned.

55

00:04:32.420  -->  00:04:33.520
Total divide among them.

56

00:04:33.570  -->  00:04:39.390
That's the only realistic way that we could do that in a readable fashion.

57

00:04:39.390  -->  00:04:41.970
There are other ways but they're not quite as nice.

58

00:04:42.010  -->  00:04:47.690
And I won't be including them here just because I don't give you any benefit and they just make things

59

00:04:47.690  -->  00:04:48.540
a bit more difficult.

60

00:04:48.570  -->  00:04:58.710
So this is the way I would recommend you check for something and then return something if if it's required

61

00:04:58.710  -->  00:04:59.130
.

62

00:04:59.130  -->  00:05:04.470
So in this case the only case that we might encounter is that number is 0.

63

00:05:04.500  -->  00:05:08.760
So we want to do something if that case does happen.

64

00:05:08.760  -->  00:05:15.180
However just something to think about we are calculating the sum of student marks and then we're looking

65

00:05:15.180  -->  00:05:19.560
at that number and if the number is 0 we are not using the total.

66

00:05:19.800  -->  00:05:27.240
So therefore for this part of our code if the number is 0 we don't need to calculate the total at all

67

00:05:27.240  -->  00:05:27.480
.

68

00:05:27.510  -->  00:05:31.840
So therefore I would put the total under here.

69

00:05:32.310  -->  00:05:34.500
It just makes things a bit more optimal.

70

00:05:34.500  -->  00:05:38.640
You don't have to calculate the total if the count is zero.

71

00:05:38.700  -->  00:05:44.580
So you might as well put it below so that if the count is 0 you don't even get to that line at all and

72

00:05:44.580  -->  00:05:49.020
you don't have to execute that code and therefore that seems a bit of time and a bit of processing power

73

00:05:49.220  -->  00:05:53.010
does make things a bit more efficient.

74

00:05:53.010  -->  00:05:59.710
Now you can delete the comments and however make sure to lay this out nicely.

75

00:06:00.450  -->  00:06:06.880
For example something like that adding a bit of space and making sure that the code is readable.

76

00:06:06.960  -->  00:06:11.270
So the first thing we do is calculate how many students how many marks the student hands.

77

00:06:11.490  -->  00:06:13.930
And if that is zero then we return zero.

78

00:06:14.100  -->  00:06:17.570
And if it isn't zero we are continuing below.

79

00:06:17.700  -->  00:06:23.970
We add them all up and then return the total divided by the number of marks which should be the average

80

00:06:23.970  -->  00:06:25.190
.

81

00:06:25.350  -->  00:06:26.310
And now we've done that.

82

00:06:26.370  -->  00:06:30.620
It comes to testing it and seeing if what we've got works.

83

00:06:30.890  -->  00:06:35.930
And as you know in order to test a method just at the end we can print things out.

84

00:06:35.970  -->  00:06:39.690
That's what we would expect from the method.

85

00:06:39.690  -->  00:06:46.110
So the first thing to do would be to create a student and then we would print out the average mark of

86

00:06:46.110  -->  00:06:46.950
that student.

87

00:06:47.040  -->  00:06:50.810
We could then add a mark to the student and print out the average mark again.

88

00:06:50.940  -->  00:06:53.920
I would recommend once again pause the video give this a go.

89

00:06:54.210  -->  00:06:57.840
And it create the student printout the average mark which would be zero.

90

00:06:58.020  -->  00:06:59.080
Then Adam Mark.

91

00:06:59.100  -->  00:07:02.190
And then print out the average mark again which would be that Mark.

92

00:07:02.190  -->  00:07:02.570
And so on.

93

00:07:02.580  -->  00:07:09.270
Give it a couple of test cases so that you can make sure that that is work.

94

00:07:09.370  -->  00:07:10.020
Pause the video.

95

00:07:10.020  -->  00:07:13.830
Go ahead and do that and then come back and we'll continue.

96

00:07:15.600  -->  00:07:15.830
OK.

97

00:07:15.830  -->  00:07:22.230
Now that we've got that the first thing I would do is print calculate average marks for s s being this

98

00:07:22.230  -->  00:07:27.220
student that I just created and then I would add a mark to s for example 5.

99

00:07:27.750  -->  00:07:33.240
And then I would print the average mark again and then wrong.

100

00:07:33.600  -->  00:07:35.210
I would duplicate that again.

101

00:07:35.220  -->  00:07:40.230
But with a different grade with remark and now we should see seven point five printed out at the end

102

00:07:40.250  -->  00:07:40.400
.

103

00:07:40.530  -->  00:07:46.310
So let's run that and I put my name in and indeed that's what happens.

104

00:07:46.410  -->  00:07:50.750
We get 0 first because that's the average mark when we don't have any.

105

00:07:51.120  -->  00:07:58.090
And then we've Gamp 5.0 and then seven point five which is five plus 10 divided by two.

106

00:07:59.190  -->  00:08:01.050
And now we can verify that this does work.

107

00:08:01.050  -->  00:08:07.260
So we can now delete that test code and we can continue in the next video with the next bit which is

108

00:08:07.260  -->  00:08:12.360
printing out a list of students so that the user can then see the details about all of the students

109

00:08:12.390  -->  00:08:12.800
they've got.

110

00:08:12.810  -->  00:08:14.650
And this just sort of you're the next
