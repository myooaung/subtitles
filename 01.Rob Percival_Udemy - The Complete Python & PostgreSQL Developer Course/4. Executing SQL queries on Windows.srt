Hi come back in this video we're looking at how we can execute sequel code here in the P.G. Atman 3

2

00:00:07,890  -->  00:00:08,670
.

3

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:15,660
Once you've selected your database this ball up here becomes active and you can execute arbitrary sequel

4

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:23,010
queries because the aim of this course is to teach you how to use sequel code and how to write it and

5

00:00:23,010  -->  00:00:24,340
how to understand it.

6

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:31,800
We're going to be doing most if not all of the interactions with the server the sequel code as opposed

7

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:33,990
to the graphical interface.

8

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:40,830
Nevertheless this interface allows you to run the Queenie's and see some output and even this explain

9

00:00:40,830  -->  00:00:45,870
button here or there can help you understand what is going on as well.

10

00:00:45,870  -->  00:00:51,690
So whenever we want to execute sequel code we're just going to type it here and then we're going to

11

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:53,570
press play.

12

00:00:53,620  -->  00:00:59,690
There's a couple of other buttons that we can use the usual copy and paste.

13

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:03,150
We can save the result we find if the result is very large.

14

00:01:03,180  -->  00:01:05,280
In some cases we may want to do that.

15

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:12,630
And then we can also explain the query and explanations are not naturally aiming to teach you sequel

16

00:01:12,660  -->  00:01:16,800
but rather that can explain what's going on behind the scenes and sometimes back in.

17

00:01:17,200  -->  00:01:23,170
Also remember this is a database that you are writing to and that's the learning database on postgres

18

00:01:23,210  -->  00:01:24,220
at localhost.

19

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:29,140
So this is what we are interacting with.

20

00:01:29,220  -->  00:01:32,440
Finally you've also got a history of previous queries which is empty for now.

21

00:01:32,560  -->  00:01:33,010
Here's.

22

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:40,140
Just in case you want to re execute something in the past the next few videos are going to be about

23

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:43,730
installing and running post-grads on Mac bots.

24

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:45,420
Naturally you don't have to worry about those.

25

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:52,290
If you're using Windows you can skip straight to the video that starts explaining sequel code and just

26

00:01:52,290  -->  00:01:58,940
write your secret code in here and then press play and will interact with the server via this sequel

27

00:01:58,950  -->  00:01:59,960
code.

28

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:04,630
So with that said I'll be seeing you in the video that starts explaining sequel code.

29

00:02:04,830  -->  00:02:05,220
So either
