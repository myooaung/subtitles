00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:09,060
Find Welcome Back in this video we'll look at the format method before we had to add strings together

2

00:00:09,070  -->  00:00:09,440
.

3

00:00:09,810  -->  00:00:15,030
And normally when we Abz things we would expect for example two plus two to give us four.

4

00:00:15,470  -->  00:00:22,540
But when we add two strings together it's not that obvious that they're going to get concatenated and

5

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:24,710
because it's not that obvious.

6

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:27,650
I find this to be quite difficult to read.

7

00:00:27,960  -->  00:00:34,260
You have lived for and then you're adding an SDR and then you're adding in some seconds at the end and

8

00:00:34,260  -->  00:00:37,740
you have to really know that this is going to join the strings together.

9

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:43,230
You have to remember to put the spaces at the end of the first string and at the start of the second

10

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:49,590
string so that you have spaces between the string and the other strings it's a bit of a faff and somewhat

11

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:50,750
of a hassle.

12

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:56,440
So instead of doing this this is actually not what is recommended.

13

00:00:56,700  -->  00:01:01,080
Instead of doing this what we're going to do is we're going to use the format method.

14

00:01:01,940  -->  00:01:08,370
So the format method is great because it simplifies and it makes it just a bit easier to read.

15

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:12,300
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut this.

16

00:01:12,450  -->  00:01:19,380
So it's going to get deleted and then I'm going to close that here and then I'm going to do an opening

17

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:24,430
in closing curly brace opening and closing calibrates inside the string.

18

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:26,600
So now this is one long string.

19

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:34,070
You have lived for open and close Culebra use seconds and then what I'm going to do is not format and

20

00:01:34,080  -->  00:01:37,210
I'm going to paste that in.

21

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:45,370
And this is it's important to count your brackets to make sure you're not missing any brackets this

22

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:48,040
bracket here is coach with that one.

23

00:01:48,140  -->  00:01:50,010
This placket hagfish with that one.

24

00:01:50,190  -->  00:01:54,270
This bracket here goes without one and therefore we're missing one from the print method.

25

00:01:54,270  -->  00:02:01,230
So important to enter all your brackets and notice how the idealy does highlight what that bracket covers

26

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:01,560
.

27

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:02,950
So fantastic.

28

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:04,740
Not getting any brackets.

29

00:02:04,830  -->  00:02:09,570
So what do you think is going to happen when we run this program.

30

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:14,870
And the answer would be that you're not going to notice any difference at all.

31

00:02:14,880  -->  00:02:18,850
So let's see if that press function five key to run it.

32

00:02:19,010  -->  00:02:22,470
And I'm going to enter my age 30 which I know my age by the way.

33

00:02:22,470  -->  00:02:28,550
And then we get the you have lived 4 9 4 6 0 8 2000 seconds or so.

34

00:02:28,590  -->  00:02:32,410
And that's pretty much 146 million.

35

00:02:32,640  -->  00:02:33,330
OK.

36

00:02:33,540  -->  00:02:36,290
I'm glad I'm not there yet but I will be.

37

00:02:36,330  -->  00:02:39,190
So not a difference.

38

00:02:39,210  -->  00:02:41,120
So why would you do that.

39

00:02:41,940  -->  00:02:48,990
Well the first reason why we would want to do that is because now just from reading the string you have

40

00:02:48,990  -->  00:02:51,890
lived for something seconds.

41

00:02:52,050  -->  00:02:53,630
We know that this is going to print.

42

00:02:53,640  -->  00:02:58,830
You have four something seconds and this can be replaced for something and that something is whatever

43

00:02:58,830  -->  00:03:03,950
is inside the brackets of the format method.

44

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:09,720
So this stuff that is inside the brackets is going to then replace the opening and closing calibrates

45

00:03:09,720  -->  00:03:11,030
.

46

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:21,030
Not only that but the format method can implicitly convert an integer to a string which means that if

47

00:03:21,030  -->  00:03:27,650
you want to replace this by a number the format method will convert that to a string.

48

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:31,790
And what that means is that we don't need the SDR method anymore.

49

00:03:32,910  -->  00:03:36,000
We can just print the number and then the format method.

50

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:39,600
We get that and replace it into there.

51

00:03:40,440  -->  00:03:46,230
So I'm going to save that press run and I'll type in age again.

52

00:03:46,350  -->  00:03:48,820
I noticed that that just works.

53

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:54,080
So that's fabulous.

54

00:03:54,120  -->  00:03:54,840
OK.

55

00:03:55,230  -->  00:04:05,010
So this is how we can use the format method and we can in fact do more with a format method for example

56

00:04:05,070  -->  00:04:06,930
as we saw in a previous with you.

57

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:10,880
This corresponds to years.

58

00:04:11,070  -->  00:04:13,380
We don't need this because the user has given us the years.

59

00:04:13,560  -->  00:04:17,170
But nevertheless it's something we can do and we can print it out.

60

00:04:17,250  -->  00:04:27,690
So take a wild guess as to how you would make sure that the format method knows to replace this by the

61

00:04:27,690  -->  00:04:28,650
number of years

62

00:04:28,660  -->  00:04:34,320
.

63

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:43,260
So I think what is reasonable is that we are going to have to give this format method not only the number

64

00:04:43,260  -->  00:04:48,960
of seconds but also the number of years somehow.

65

00:04:48,990  -->  00:04:52,570
So the way you do that is by using the comp.

66

00:04:52,740  -->  00:04:59,400
So the coma and then age and now the format method knows that these two things are separate.

67

00:04:59,400  -->  00:05:08,100
It will replace the first set of curly braces by the first sort of argument or parameter and the second

68

00:05:08,100  -->  00:05:12,960
set of curly braces by the second argument and you can do that more and more times you can add more

69

00:05:12,960  -->  00:05:18,790
curly braces and add more and numbers or strings here and it will just keep replacing them.

70

00:05:19,260  -->  00:05:25,440
So let's say that unpressed EF 5 function 5 to run and then enter your age.

71

00:05:25,440  -->  00:05:35,730
And now we get the usual error which stems from not counting your brackets properly.

72

00:05:35,730  -->  00:05:38,030
Now you go.

73

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:40,410
We were closing the format method there.

74

00:05:40,440  -->  00:05:45,000
We have a bracket here which closed the form method.

75

00:05:45,000  -->  00:05:48,980
So then the age was not inside the format method.

76

00:05:49,020  -->  00:05:54,390
It was inside the print method and the print method did not know what to do with that age.

77

00:05:54,390  -->  00:05:56,010
So save that and run it again.

78

00:05:56,100  -->  00:05:59,130
And now let's avoid the error and indeed we get.

79

00:05:59,130  -->  00:06:04,960
You have lived for that number of seconds and this corresponds to that number of years.

80

00:06:05,790  -->  00:06:06,410
OK.

81

00:06:06,510  -->  00:06:08,220
So this is how you would use a format method.

82

00:06:08,220  -->  00:06:12,210
And there's actually a lot more you can do with the format method but we're not going to get into it

83

00:06:12,630  -->  00:06:16,000
just at this stage.

84

00:06:16,250  -->  00:06:21,580
Now we're ready to move on into the next section now that we've completed our app.

85

00:06:21,690  -->  00:06:26,010
We are ready to continue developing our python knowledge.

86

00:06:26,010  -->  00:06:33,180
So congratulations we've made the app that converts the user's age into seconds and we've learned about

87

00:06:33,510  -->  00:06:40,320
variables strings numbers printing getting user input and the format method along the way.

88

00:06:40,320  -->  00:06:41,580
So that's fantastic.

89

00:06:41,600  -->  00:06:48,380
And I see you in the very next video and the very next section with a lot more content.
