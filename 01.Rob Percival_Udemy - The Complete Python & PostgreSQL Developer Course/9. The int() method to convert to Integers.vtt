Hi welcome back.

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:05.900
In this video we're going to look at the entire method.

3

00:00:06.100  -->  00:00:11.400
So now knowing that the video is about the method you can probably guess how we were going to convert

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:13.790
this age into a number.

5

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:17.280
And you would be right we would be using the End Method.

6

00:00:17.280  -->  00:00:24.880
So just like the S-T-R method has in brackets that go around what we want to convert into E-string.

7

00:00:25.230  -->  00:00:31.140
The method has a pair of brackets that go around what we want to convert to a number an integer in this

8

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:34.290
case number into it a whole number.

9

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:35.240
Same thing.

10

00:00:35.850  -->  00:00:41.290
So here we're going to convert the age which is a string into an int which is an integer.

11

00:00:41.520  -->  00:00:45.770
And then we're going to multiply that integer by 365.

12

00:00:45.820  -->  00:00:48.500
We're going to multiply that by 24.

13

00:00:48.630  -->  00:00:53.440
We're going to multiply that by 60 and then or that by 60 again.

14

00:00:53.580  -->  00:01:00.570
If you run the program last video and your computer crashed or Python crashed then that's what happens

15

00:01:00.810  -->  00:01:02.770
when you make a mistake like this one.

16

00:01:03.190  -->  00:01:07.980
And so it's important to always remember what is a string and what is a number.

17

00:01:07.980  -->  00:01:12.030
And to convert them to the appropriate type if they are not of the appropriate time.

18

00:01:12.030  -->  00:01:17.860
So in our case age was a string and we did not want to multiply that by all these numbers.

19

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:23.530
So let's save this and then run it now well into my age which is going to be five.

20

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:27.160
And notice how that gives me that number of seconds.

21

00:01:27.810  -->  00:01:32.250
Let's go back and run it again and I'm going to end at 30.

22

00:01:32.760  -->  00:01:38.100
And on it how that gives me a larger number of seconds which I can only assume to be correct.

23

00:01:38.220  -->  00:01:40.870
I'm not going to multiply that.

24

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:42.280
OK.

25

00:01:42.300  -->  00:01:48.790
So this is how we would show the user how many seconds they've lived for.

26

00:01:49.870  -->  00:01:50.700
OK.

27

00:01:50.910  -->  00:01:57.780
So this is exactly how to convert a string to an integer and remember to always think about what types

28

00:01:58.110  -->  00:01:59.540
your variables are.

29

00:01:59.550  -->  00:02:05.510
So you're not making a mistake and crashing Python with too long a string.

30

00:02:06.150  -->  00:02:13.710
Ok I'll see you in the next video where we're going to be going over a very very nice method for avoiding

31

00:02:13.830  -->  00:02:16.410
having to add these things together.

32

00:02:16.590  -->  00:02:22.440
So I see in the next video where it's going to be a fantastic method for making this just slightly clearer

33

00:02:22.460  -->  00:02:24.110
.
