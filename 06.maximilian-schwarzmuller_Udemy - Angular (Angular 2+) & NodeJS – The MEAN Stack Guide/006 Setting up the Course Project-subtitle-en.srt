1
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:03,318
<v ->Time to get started.</v>

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:05,643
Throughout this course, we will be build an overarching

3
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:07,557
project, and in this video,

4
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:09,569
I will show you how to set up this project,

5
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,026
how to start with the seed project I'm supplying.

6
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:14,672
Again side note, you will find the whole course module

7
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:17,966
where I explain how to build this seed project,

8
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,731
and with that, let's first understand what we need

9
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,429
to successfully create our Angular 2

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,951
and Node.js application.

11
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,803
Well, first of all, we obviously need Node,

12
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,671
because this will run on the server.

13
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:31,935
This runs our server.

14
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,518
This is our server-side code.

15
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:36,566
So we need to instal Node.js on our computer

16
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:40,141
to successfully test on our local environment.

17
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,930
We will also need the seed project

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,490
which you can find attached to this lecture,

19
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,363
so feel free to download it now.

20
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:48,963
Thereafter, in the extracted file in this folder,

21
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,525
we need to run a command to instal the dependencies.

22
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,492
We've got both server-side dependencies like Express.js

23
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,339
and client-side dependencies like Angular 2.

24
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,800
So that's the theory.

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,833
Let's see all these steps in action.

26
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,310
Let's start by downloading Node.js.

27
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,799
The place to go is nodejs.org, and here make sure

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,588
to pick the latest version, 6.7 at the point of time

29
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,889
I record this video.

30
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,551
Don't take the lower one.

31
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:17,780
This will not work correctly, so make sure to download

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,872
this latest version, and after downloading it,

33
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,705
simply walk through the installer

34
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:24,248
and instal it on your machine.

35
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:25,590
It's really straightforward.

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,622
If for some reason, you're downloading the version

37
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,365
for the wrong operating system here,

38
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:32,136
normally it should autodetect the system,

39
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,597
make sure to go to Downloads

40
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,873
and pick the exact version you need.

41
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:38,227
After doing this and running for installer,

42
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:41,970
Node.js is set up your machine and with that you're prepared

43
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,215
to write Node.js code.

44
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,539
We not only need Node.js code,

45
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,793
we also need our whole project, our front-end code.

46
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,828
For that, download the seed project attached

47
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:53,776
to this video and then extract it.

48
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,599
I already did this here.

49
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,324
I will walk you through all these folders and files

50
00:01:58,324 --> 00:01:59,588
in the next video.

51
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:00,764
For now, let's start it

52
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,117
and let's see something on the screen.

53
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:05,109
On the right, I opened up a terminal,

54
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,819
or command line on Windows,

55
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,948
and make sure to navigate into this seed-project folder

56
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:12,593
or to whatever you renamed it in there.

57
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:16,042
Now in this folder, you need to run npm instal.

58
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:19,005
Npm stands for Node Package Manager,

59
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,613
and this is a command line tool which was installed

60
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,978
with Node.js together.

61
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,945
This allows us to manage the dependencies of our package

62
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:30,118
here and we conveniently don't have to download them

63
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,937
one by one from several webpages, therefore,

64
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:35,370
that's all done automatically for us.

65
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,969
So run this command, and this will take a couple of seconds

66
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,407
because we've got quite a lot of different dependencies

67
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:41,587
to fetch here.

68
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:43,941
And be aware that warnings like this one here

69
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,325
are totally fine.

70
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,684
I'll see you once it is finished.

71
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,814
With that installation finished, you may see some warnings

72
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,008
here, but as long as no error occurred,

73
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,527
that means it will work, everything is fine.

74
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,256
This created this new node_modules folder on the left

75
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,073
which holds the dependencies.

76
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,931
Now in order to see something,

77
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,043
let's run npm and then run build.

78
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:08,904
This runs one of the scripts I set up in this seed project

79
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,136
and this script will run the build process

80
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:13,857
taking all our Angular 2 code, compiling it

81
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:16,786
from TypeScript to JavaScript, and bundling it together.

82
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,495
Again I will come back to the folder structure

83
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,286
we're using in the next video.

84
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:23,500
So hit Enter, and this might now take a couple of seconds,

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,497
and thereafter it will keep running.

86
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,896
And this is important, keep this process running

87
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:30,580
because it will watch your files for changes

88
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,100
and automatically rerun and recompile

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,434
whenever you do change one of your TypeScript files.

90
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,103
This is great because it means you don't have

91
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,912
to continuously rerun this process.

92
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,337
It's not all though.

93
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,410
Open up a new window in the terminal,

94
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,503
and navigate in the same folder, in the seed-project folder,

95
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,313
and there run npm start.

96
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,914
This will start the server-side code.

97
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,552
Npm run build was responsible for the front-end code

98
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,187
and watching for changes.

99
00:03:57,187 --> 00:04:00,358
Npm start now runs our Node.js server,

100
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,571
the little server I already set up in the seed project.

101
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:07,225
So hit Enter and this will start the server.

102
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,826
And with that back in the browser, you may now visit

103
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:13,888
localhost:3000 and you should see Hello World here

104
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,310
which means it works.

105
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,264
This is Angular 2 what you're seeing here.

106
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:19,945
In the next module, we will start working on Node.js

107
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,263
though, but we'll come back to Angular 2

108
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,763
and also change this app soon.
