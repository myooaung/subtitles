<v ->So now that we get started,</v>



2

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:06.880

I want to dive into node.js and give you a brief refresher



3

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.356

on it, talk about the core concepts behind it,



4

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:12.851

or especially how a request travels through our node.js



5

00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:15.165

and express application, how we can work



6

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.239

with such requests because that are all



7

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.555

going to be things we'll use throughout the course.



8

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:22.765

Keep in mind this no node.js focus course.



9

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.379

I assume you are familiar with node.js and express.js.



10

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.410

This is merely a refresher,



11

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.930

showing the key concepts we'll be using.



12

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.975

If you want to dive deeper, or feel not that comfortable



13

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.058

using node.js and express, at the end of this section,



14

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:39.735

you'll find some links to where you get started,



15

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:42.293

or where to dive deeper if you get a feeling



16

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:44.648

that you are missing some pieces



17

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.528

or need to learn more about node.js and express.js.



18

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:50.493

Well if that, let's get started and understand



19

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:53.005

how this request travels through our back



20

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:54.922

and in our application.
