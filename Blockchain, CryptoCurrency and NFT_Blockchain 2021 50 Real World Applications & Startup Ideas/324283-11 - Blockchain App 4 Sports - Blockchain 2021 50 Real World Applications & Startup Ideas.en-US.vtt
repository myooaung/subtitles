helping him totally with both motivation and instructions.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.320
The senses and store the at Leeds data securely on the Blockchain,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.250

To improve Dickie,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.880
for instance,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.450
I distances in connected basket bone captures data about the spin rate or spot inefficiency

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.450
.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.750
It also tracks distance through and other statistics.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.950
This data will be stored on the Blockchain.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.080
On the process,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.700
Tater will be presented to the athletes exactly been pointing his improvement areas.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.250
Millions of people bet billions of dollars and sports every you.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.660
But there are challenges for bitters is been currently but doesn't know way to establish

And in such a scenario,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.850
you these websites could easily take off Germany.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.450
And most importantly,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.350
there is a risk off the exploitation off the identity or information blocked in can provide

Once the sport seventies completed,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.150
smart contracts will record the results,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.680
and an automatic payout will be too good to the video
