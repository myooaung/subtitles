00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
the aviation industry is growing tremendously with an increased number of passengers but

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.080
offering it over other modes of transport due to the introduction of low cost carriers and

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.790
to fulfill deciding demand.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.550
New aircrafts are being made operational every now and then.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.850
The average life span off a commercial plane is approximately 25 to 30 years,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.590
and it changes hands 5 to 6 times during its whole journey.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.550
Before getting the commission with such a long life span,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.450
every aircraft goes through a complex mint Dennis process.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.480
Each plane also goes to a regular oddity for it to be certified as fit to fly.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.340
This increase number off air cuffs and change of ownership multiple times makes it a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.650
challenging task who track and trace the information related to its maintenance.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.520
Some of the top officials of these aircraft manufacturers even estimate that around 90% of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.350
the maintenance records our own people,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.750
which means towns are boxes off these paper based documents.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.370
These paper based mental records lead to the Delinda pairing unwanted release and the first

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.900
off them,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.620
and increased probability of accidents due to inaccessibility of the required data.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.380
At the right time,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.050
though there has been a shift from the paper based record keeping to an electronic based

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.660
system.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.500
Still,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.770
there are many tell it is that these electronic records face these electronic records are

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.860
spread across multiple databases,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.650
which lack interoperability.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.950
This in turn leads to various process inefficiencies,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.390
a lot of wasted time for retrieving the required information and then over.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.460
No,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.250
no big systems.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.750
Let us look at the various drawbacks in the current aircraft maintenance the court system.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.170
These electronically courts are generally maintain centralized databases,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.650
which makes it vulnerable to data manipulation.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.050
That data decides locally in the database off every stakeholder.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.430
Therefore,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.630
in case of any audit or accident,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.550
it becomes a daunting task to get the complete a calf information to make sense out of it.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.010
In the current scenario,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.140
aircraft maintenance data resides with the aircraft maintenance authority,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.840
and therefore it is really difficult for air carriers and manufactures to retrieve or

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.370
exceeds this data readily.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.380
Whenever required blocks can be greatly to manage these men tennis records in a much

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.480
security further.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.330
The implementation of this share letter technology can also help to bring trust and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.750
transparency in the current OPEC and vulnerable system.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.210
All the information pertaining to an aircraft like manufacturing details.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.720
Maintainers reports.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.950
Operational US transfer of ownership at Spectra can be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.830
Smart context can be used to give the seamless access to these records to various

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.850
stakeholders involved.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.830
No legs understanding ditty.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.250
How broken can help to mitigate these issues in the aviation industry.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.650
Aviation Blokhin will have the following stakeholders Aircraft manufactures hailing company

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.770
flight auditor buyer aircraft maintenance,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.660
repair and overhaul service provider.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.120
A man effectively record aircraft manifest simulated details on the block.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.970
This could include the days in the material used for manifestly hydraulic and air

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.870
conditioning parts and other components used with the respective infection here and the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.130
tentative year off expired,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.670
they have once recorded on the Blockchain convert temper due to its immutable

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.900
characteristic as discussed earlier.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.020
The lifespan often aircraft is approximately 25 or 30 years and therefore it is very

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.230
crucial to keep it in a healthy state for the safety of passengers and aircrew,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.910
maintenance,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.140
repair and overhaul or a marrow service.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.570
Providers are the ones who men is a maintenance and safety of the aircraft,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.250
the information that they will be required to upload on the aviation blocks in in fields

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.210
last appeared date of the aircraft components which were repaired and what changed money

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.950
spent on the man Dennis activity.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.710
A tentative date for the next maintenance service,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.350
etcetera.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.100
The information stored by tomorrow.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.710
Service providers can then be accessed by all the stakeholders involved in the process,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.050
thus making the whole process transparent.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.840
Open data visibility would help to our any aircraft missile as all the stakeholders would

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.310
be able to monitor the health of the aircraft at any point throughout its life.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.890
Spent further every data stored on the Blockchain is time stamped,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.650
so any historical record can easily be fetched if the need arises.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.340
Ailing companies can use this data stored by the AMARO Service providers protect cabin and

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.550
other components before allowing the aircraft to take off.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.050
The airline companies can record flight loves,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.070
that's and just information and their inspection report on the block Flight Auditor is the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.110
next day called off.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.340
This aviation Blockchain flight auditor is responsible for auditing the health of an

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.620
aircraft and then make a judgment on its fitness to fly.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.970
He made a prove it to fly when we asked for the maintenance off any component that he

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.180
believes this 40 and request Minton's.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.370
Whatever the Dutchman be,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.680
it will be recorded on the sheer Letty an aircraft in his hands 5 to 6 times during its

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.650
four life span,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.860
and the cost of each plane runs into millions.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.360
So,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360
quite naturally,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.550
whenever it by wants to buy the aircraft,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.800
he would like to critically evaluate the essential components off the aircraft with the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.820
help of blocking.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.570
It would be much easier for him to look at the whole journey of the aircraft and taken

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.550
informed this isn't on its place and whether to buy it or pass it on to other buyers

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.230
through the use of smart contracts.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.470
Automatic scare dealing,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.050
off trendiness activities and service texts could also be done.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.440
For instance,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.800
the maintenance schedule for different components.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.230
Often aircraft may very based on the type of operation,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.550
and they're operating environment.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.270
For example,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.710
a component that operates in a harsh operating environment and is required to be

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.020
operational throughout the journey may require frequent mountainous compared to a component

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.650
that this operation in only one leg of the journey,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.960
a Blockchain ledger with information on the installation,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.480
operating conditions and utilization off each individual component could very well support

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.450
this automation and make maintenance process of very robust and transparent process.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.280
Therefore,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.550
they won't belonging as human that Blockchain technology has a huge potential to disrupt

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.750
the aviation industry in terms of backer efficiencies and easier regulatory compliance is.
