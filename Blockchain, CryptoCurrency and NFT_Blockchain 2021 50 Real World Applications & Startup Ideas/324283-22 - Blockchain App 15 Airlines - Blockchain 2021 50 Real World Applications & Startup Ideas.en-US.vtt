00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
currently traveling required to show their ideas at multiple sequence,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.280
from entering the airport to luggage.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.150
Drop off to buying stuff from the duty free shops.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.640
Further,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.750
the long queues at security checking and border control checkpoints are some of the other

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.890
key pinpoints that travelers have to go to blocked in.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.340
Technology has the potential to simplify this process and eliminate the need to suffer your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.650
bag repeatedly for taking up ideas and various other documents for verification.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.680
Now let us understand.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.750
How will this work?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.050
With bloating based system,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.250
a user will be able to create his own digital I d.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Completely controlled by him.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.890
In other words,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.630
he can decide who can view his information stored on the I.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.950
D.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.030
And he can't even decide what part of the information should be shared with any specific

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.340
viewers.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.190
First,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.840
the user will be required to download the Blockchain based Digital I D creator for

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.670
uploading his personal verification documents like passport,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.150
visa,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.320
etcetera and biometric data.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.380
Like fingerprints,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.750
ice can end voice.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.150
This data will then be uploaded on the block tin and the unique has we been generated for

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.250
the users information.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.730
Now,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.100
this data will withstand to a government at a secret verification.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.230
This agency will check and verify the user's data against the central database and will

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.050
either approve it or disapprove it.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.440
The verification status off the uploaded documents and Islay.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.100
We get stored on the bookie now,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.680
when the user needs to take a flight after eating the airport,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.390
he can don't simply go to a self taken security where the user will be required to share

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.680
his very fight digital idea.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.450
After this,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.850
the users by medics like the fingerprint or facial recognition will be captured by boot.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.930
And we'll be very fight against the verified digital I D provided by the user on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.910
verification are you A court will be generated,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.400
which can be scanned by the user to Esma violet and can be used for the launch of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.150
verification than at the airport,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.910
thus saving him a load of precious time on unwanted hazel To take out this passport and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.450
other documents again and again to verify his credit chills in case of international German

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.450
,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.050
the user can also share his verify based allied with the border agencies well before his

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.950
arrival dates.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.780
This will initiate the list assessment in advance,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.060
and that process will be much faster and smoother when they use it actually arrives at the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.580
border site as the digital ideas government very fight.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.730
The user can even be seen from the has solution.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.450
The passport.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.650
Now we look how blocked in can be used in baggage stick.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.450
What comes to your mind when you think off family packing your bags and living for that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.050
vacation you have been planning all month long?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.560
With your bags ready,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.320
you leave for the airport thinking about the wonderful beaches that you will hit or the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.150
unconquered mountains you will conquer.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.970
But as you leave your backs at the baggage drop in country,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.550
a slight sense of skepticism creeps in,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.250
and you become slightly worried about your luggage.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.650
Getting all your important stuff endears.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.990
I just wish that it gets loaded on the lightning and engaged the other connecting flight

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.580
You concerned resistant next level and all off.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.750
This happens because you have no clear visibility off your own luggage.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.510
In the current system,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.110
there is no way to pack your luggage,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.650
even at a single point during your religion.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.950
The main reason behind this is the lack of data exit.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.460
Among the parties involved in the luggage transfer,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.910
the responsibility for every legacy item is reportedly doing region and when the bag it in

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.630
his hands that 11 information is uploaded and stored in the respective local and private

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.250
systems.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.150
This information stored in the local systems is not shared with other stakeholders,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.320
thus making the back breaking off any leg.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.150
It's difficult and complicated.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.270
This is especially applicable to multi stopped flights because an increased number of

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.640
airports and authorities are involved in the luggage transfer,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.050
which in turn makes the data sharing really difficult and confusing.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.050
But very not blow till based system has a solution for this in a blocked in based system

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.120
that they don't start will be secure in your table and accessible to all the stakeholders

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.550
in bold.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.410
Each bed will be marked with a unique court or number,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.250
and each traveler would be given a corresponding unique number to break his luggage.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.450
When the bag moves to a security scan it or braking system,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.660
that data will be uploaded and recorded on the blue team.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.750
Every stakeholder the block tin can track the entire journey of the package.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.200
Through this,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.850
every passenger can see the location off their backs in real time.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.960
This will give him a member satisfaction that this bags have been loaded into the right

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.300
lane,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.450
even during multi stopped flights.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.330
Further,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.000
it will also fasten the tracking off lost packets as every stakeholder will have a clear

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.950
picture of the luggage.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.550
It's last talking point and the authority responsible for it,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.950
thus leading to a significant improvement in the customer experience with the flyers.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.540
Loyalty points and air miles are some of the very crucial ways through which a lance their

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.750
repeated customers.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.150
But in the current system,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.270
customers have to wait until they have substantial loyalty points,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.990
including there.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.530
Further,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.250
the usage of these points is limited to very specific places,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.850
which leaves a lot of points left unused or getting inspired.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.850
But adopting Mr Welte points,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.550
the points can be redeemed at various of the partner outlets.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.650
That's increasing the usage and attractiveness off these points to the customers.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.690
Very recently,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.590
a blocked investor,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.450
Welty problem has been knows best thing up with a length for its players.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.710
They have developed our digital bullet named Crispy in partnership with Microsoft and KP

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.290
anti Well,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.250
this flies can convert their air miles into units of pain that can be used it.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.980
Partner outlets in single customers are provided with the mobile.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.170
Let using this at the customer center on Monday,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.650
miles into units of payment,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.680
and use these units to pay a consistent outlets by simply scanning a QR code.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.450
Last but not the least,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.650
Lowton can be used in flight insurance payout Using smart phone taps,

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.590
many airline carriers and their travel partners self flight delay insurance along with the

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.450
flight tickets.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.930
But when the flights get delayed,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.110
we even don't know whom to approach.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.550
To get our insurance came the whole frame processes opiate,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.580
and no one knows what are the steps involved.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.460
But what is the compensation that they will get if the flight gets delayed but looking and

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.270
smart contracts that process,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.850
we were simply find this has been implemented by Excel.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.550
We're flask and by flight bill insurance by paying opinion.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.020
Under this insurance scheme,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.750
if the flight gets delayed by more than to us,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.550
the smart contact gets executed and insurance claim a mom gets automatically transferred in

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.770
the account of the flyers buying this smart country best insurance a person needs.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.300
So first,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.120
adjust to his flight details on the service providers platform and fill their identity and

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.050
account details.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.280
Then they can pay and by the insurance plan.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.750
And if the flight gets delayed more than the stipulated time we find in the smart contract

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:53.750
,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.750
an automatic payout is triggered by the smart contact with the Flies bank account.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.630
This payout is done without any manual intervention from any of this.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.650
Take a listen would thus making it swift and aspect.
