00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
before checking in at any hotel,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.040
the person has to show his I D.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
Passport and Visa are the documents to prove its authenticity,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.950
thus leading to an increased second time,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.470
so blocked in technology.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.310
All the documents can be recorded on the Blockchain,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.960
and when a person checks in at the hotel,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.350
the verification can be done using biometrics,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.650
either by face scanning all by com print to ensure that he is the same person for which

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.610
booking has been done.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.150
This will eliminate the need to carry proof.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.550
Documents and guilt has also illuminate the chance off losing these precious documents.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.650
A smart contract can be generated between the hotel and the customer.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.690
Once the customer book says room off a hotel that meet his needs,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.200
Smart contract will get executed and money will be detected from the customers Digital

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.980
account and indeed,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.750
still key off the show will be provided to the customer.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.680
The customer on it.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.030
I've Willard the hotel can then excesses room through his digital key available on his

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.550
phone.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.790
In such a scenario,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.520
minimal confirmations from the main desk will be required this,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.660
in turn reducing the video time.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.740
The next application off locked in in hotel industry can be better redemption off loyalty

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.270
points when you complete your stay at a hotel.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.900
In many off the cases,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.250
the hotel provides you with loyalty points as a revolt.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.990
But a majority of the instances these loyalty points go unutilized due to the limited

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.320
applications into this interview.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.840
The loyalty points can only be used with that particular chain off hotels who owned that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.850
loyalty program,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.240
indicating thes hotel loyalty points with the different enough hotels or some other

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.840
business is very challenging through blocking technology.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.090
The loyalty points or tokens will be stored in the bloc team this year.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.210
Letter technology will allow Toto freely redeem,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.250
sell or exchange the loyalty token with others.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.260
It will also improper you with the provision to use your hotel tokens across other

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.150
industries.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.860
You can use your hotel or into tokens in buying your mean booking an air ticket or bangle

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.850
coffee tetra,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.310
and that the chalice that the customer faces well booking hotels is the fake all moderated

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.950
online reviews that can sometimes even be misleading on these old named review platforms

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.900
and even contrite a hotel review without having the requirement to confirm that he or she

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.850
even stayed there.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.150
Therefore,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.810
it becomes difficult for consumers to know about the authenticity on the accuracy of these

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.850
online reviews.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.640
The locked in technology can address is issue but very frank.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.970
The people giving reviews to integration off,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.750
blocked in in the hotel industry.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.460
It can easily be verified if people leaving that hotel actually stayed in that particular

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.970
hotel.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.150
This bringing transparency and reliability in online hotel reviews.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.950
Vetting at hotels for check in after a long journey can be frustrating.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.130
They can be due to many reasons.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.170
For example,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.880
the room you booked is still not checked out,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.600
and cleaning has to be done.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.200
Or it could be because off the time spent in verification of the documents,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.060
but with blocked in,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.050
this victim can be minimized.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.790
Imagine a scenario where hotels are able to track their guests and know the exact time of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.250
their arrival at the hotel.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.450
Availability of this real time information will decrease the wait time during check in on

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.450
in tone will increase the guest satisfaction.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.220
Tracking guest movements might be considered any invasion of privacy,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.280
but blocked in provide the solution for this been locked in.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.410
You can determine on lotteries the hotels a certain degree of required information without

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.850
compromising your privacy.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.440
In the current scenario,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.930
if guests arrive at the hotel and find that the room they have booked is not what was

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.830
advertised,

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.650
they have little means off grievance redress in,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.250
especially if they have pre paid for the reservation.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.320
Similarly,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.650
the ability of hotels to recoup losses for the damages caused by unruly guest is limited,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.020
so blocked in technology,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.350
smart contracts can be issued where all rules and conditions are predetermined.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.570
In case of any dispute,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.530
the contracts will get executed on the relieving.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.850
Compensation will be initiated to the suffers in 2017 but on 55 million customers became

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.350
victim of force hotel bookings to thought websites,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.750
resulting in a total front off $6 billion.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.640
But the blocked in technology such incidents can be called dizzily blocked in can be

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.080
leveraged to help customers validate if the booking is done with an authentic hotel.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.950
Now let's discuss about the applications of Blockchain in the restaurant industry,

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.380
cases of food for dot and Reis disease.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.380
Imagine the level of satisfaction that you will get if you know the origin of the raw

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.050
materials that restaurant uses to prepare your food.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.450
The food you're consuming restaurants is a part of the food supply.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.210
CI raw materials like vegetables,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.770
fruits,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.550
etcetera are produced by the farmers past the wholesalers and distributors and then

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.150
received restaurants where there used to cook those delicious dishes for you.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.520
So blocked in technology,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.880
you will be able to track the region of the food on the route.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.320
It has taken the technology,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.350
really even ensure better quality control and food safety in the restaurants,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:12.330
so restaurants deficient them from the rest because off this specialize in credence example

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.270
gluten free food,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.330
,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.050
etcetera.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.790
Currently,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.980
there is no way for them to prove their genuineness,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.650
and at the same time there is no way for a consumer to verify their claims.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.200
The restaurants can add proof and sources off the ingredients on the Blockchain.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.050
Visually establish more trust in the customers about them.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.710
Similarly,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.790
as discussed earlier in this lecture,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.890
Blocked and technology will help you in tracking and very frank if the only refuse about

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.150
the restaurant are real and authentic.
