00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
big data is upon us.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.050
Every single day.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.450
A huge amount of data is getting gentility.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.340
Facebook alone has more than 300 petabytes of data,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.960
which contains personal profiles,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.860
pictures,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.340
videos and messages over its users generation and a really beauty off.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.770
Such a huge data set has led to the introduction of various new domains,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.260
like data analytics.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.040
Big data except the collection and Data Analytics have led to the understanding of the why

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.040
,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.780
when,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.570
who,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.950
how and what off the human behavior.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.050
And this understanding has fired.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.730
Innovation and development across many fronts be economical,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.340
social,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.150
political or medical.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.750
Big data is undoubtedly a big asset for the global economy.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.170
Big data consists of a massive A limb off,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.850
both structured and unsettled later,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.230
which is so humongous that it is nearly impossible for traditional system to process and

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.850
analyze it.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.140
The complete.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.750
They're collecting data for giving a better experience to their customers.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.850
But there are very massive telling this around this data like data privacy and data

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.420
security,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.250
to name a few.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.600
They have in many cases of data tep misuse of personal later that have led to a sense of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.650
insecurity and distrust in this ecosystem,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.850
but in the same thing.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
But instead of big data in making striking contributions to the development of global

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.250
economy can't be neglected.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.700
And therefore the need of the art is to develop an equal system with the benefits of big

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.050
data can be read without compromising the security and privacy of their uses data and then

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.250
blocked in technology.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.290
Broccoli is a perfect companion for big data that can complement it.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.650
To medicate these issues,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.810
bloating further helps in better data management off huge volumes,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.650
and we're idea of data that is getting generated in season every day in and day out.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.450
Let's discuss the benefits of Blockchain for big Daytime today,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.040
as discussed earlier.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.270
Big data involves massive Will you get up and therefore it becomes very crucial to have the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.450
right infrastructure to store this big data.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.000
Besides the bottom off this day that keeps on increasing day by day storing settle eunice

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.290
data using conventional cloud storage doesn't prove to be an economical option for the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.050
businesses.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.050
Additionally,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.150
in many cases due to certain business requirements,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
multiple copies of the same data Mandela different locations,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.550
which further leads to an extra burden for the businesses,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.850
but with the implementation of blocked in,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.950
these costs can be reduced as floating provides a more economical solution for data storage

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.950
.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.750
In this digital age,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.980
there are too many text points that the consumer for the potential consumer indirectly to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.280
get a better understanding off their customers.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.750
Every business collects data from various sources like social media.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.480
Externally,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.050
search parties lists etcetera.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.720
There is always a lack of breast for such external data as the business is kind,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.240
verify its authenticity even though the external later is fed into the internal analytics

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.750
system.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.250
But the inside estimated are not foolproof and therefore not reliable.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.300
But with the implementation of blocks,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.570
it is much easier to establish the velocity off this external data as the complete part of

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.750
the data collected can be very fight using the immutable record on the letter.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.870
Therefore,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.080
implementation of location in Big Data Analytics brings in a higher degree of confidence

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.550
for the data collected from external sources.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.170
With the implementation of docked in data,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.950
sets become immutable and completely traceable,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.770
blocked in technology,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.050
right state of visibility and data consistency all the stakeholders involved in the network

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.050
,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.270
the data sex can be audited as the complete data trail is available on the shared letter

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.750
right from its source.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.000
In particular,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.100
supply it in Data Analytics required this kind of data ratification for generational battle

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.420
business insights additionally blocked in technology index and a data set that can be

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.970
verified.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.110
And it is even map suspicious because of which the insides are generated only from verified

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.920
data sets,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.080
thus making them more valuable and accurate.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.250
Data security is one of the key concerns for any Big Data analytics operation,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.300
but with broken,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.810
it can be mitigated.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.890
And that is exactly why bloating has been getting accepted by many of the financial

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.850
institutions.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.460
I personally deal.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.350
And health care industries are right for deception by Blokhin,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.670
as they are in dire need of a platform that can provide security for the sensitive

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.150
information designing with them.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.650
One of the most exciting use case of bloated in big data is its potential to protect real

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.050
time for bill and activities.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.300
In the current scenario,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.600
banking and other financial institutions have always light and reactive or a retrospective

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.050
data analytics to detect any form of fraudulent activities.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.030
Simply put,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.660
fraud can only be had in different once it does happen and there is no way to stop it from

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.750
happening in real time.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.470
But with block till banking and financial institutions can take every transaction in real

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.750
time,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.170
this predictive analytics can be carried out on this upward data to find patterns of risky

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.050
and fertile introductions of the flight and prevent any possible mishap.
