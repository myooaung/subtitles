00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
As the name indicates,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.560
blocked in metaphorically consists of blocks laid together chronologically to comprise a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.950
team known as blocky.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.050
Every time sectional data is stored in the blue,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.650
let's take a real life scenario to understand it in a better way.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
Suppose I make a transaction off some amount in Steve's account,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.850
there has to be a place where this transaction information will be stored.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.160
This place is called Bloke in the Blockchain.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.150
Let's take a closer look at the elements of a bloke,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.650
and how do these lost link with each other to form a Blockchain?

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.550
The first look in the broke chin is known as the Genesis Bloke,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.550
as it is the block from where the teen already knicks each block has three elements.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.950
The first element is data and transactions.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.170
Let's come to our example the amount associated with that transaction and all the other

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.860
later information like timestamp,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.900
sell the information deceiver.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.550
Information at sector will be stored in the blue,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.250
but the tech contained in each block depends on the type of Blockchain.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.180
For example,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.440
four supply Blockchain will have information off all the processes involved in that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.850
specific food supply tea,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.370
each book also includes the hash Ah,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.950
unique identify for the block and all of its contents.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.840
For a better understanding,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.150
you can assume has to be equal into a fingerprint.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.400
It is always unique,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.190
and no two blocks can have the same hash,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.450
just like in the case of finger pins.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.130
As soon as the block is created,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.750
it's hash gets celebrated simultaneously.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.570
Tampering with the blow the industry.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.340
It's hash.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.520
Simply put your fingerprints or hash of the block changes.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.050
It indicates that the block has been tampered with and is no longer the same book.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.010
So has can be a very powerful tool,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.120
but the debt,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.950
anything this made in the book.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.800
We even heard it.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.850
A lecture on the hash In this course,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.020
Once you go through that,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.450
you will have a better understanding off hash and how it works.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.850
Another important element that every block contains is the hash off the previous book.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.740
This piece of information is what links one block to another and makes the whole network

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.870
safe and secure.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.160
In the given figure.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.960
Blow four Contains hash broke three on Block three.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.760
Contains hash,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.750
Will Block two and so on,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.970
as discussed earlier,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.390
anything in the data off a book lives to attend in its hash in the developed figure when it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.500
seems the daytime broke,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.850
too,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.450
the hash of blow to get scenes as well,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
which makes the whole block till unstable.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.050
This happens because each block contains hash of the previous globe.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.710
When the second bloke is tempered with,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.250
the old hash becomes invalid and the new hashes generated for the book.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.650
This effects all the subsequent blocks in the team and thus making all off them invalid.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.950
This unique property of the block chill makes it transparent and secure,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.550
as in any case of bitter temporary,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.320
whole network gets to know which look what compromised in the book.
