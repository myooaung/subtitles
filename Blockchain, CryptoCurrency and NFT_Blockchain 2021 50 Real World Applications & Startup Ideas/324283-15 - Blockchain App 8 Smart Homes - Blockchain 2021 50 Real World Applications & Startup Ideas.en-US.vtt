00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.190
won't you like a smart coffeemaker that prepares a perfect coffee for you as soon as you

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.950
wake up all of my crew viz that can differentiate between a perfect lickle Pisa from a bone

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.830
Pisa on a smarter air conditioner that can send the maintenance of this request on its own

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.370
in case it breaks down.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.370
All of this sounds exciting,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.050
right?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.510
Many off.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.650
You might assume it to be a thing of the future,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.560
but this technology,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.350
the Internet,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.630
off things or I O.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.060
T.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.850
Has arrived on the steering right in our faces.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.880
It is just a matter of some more time before it gets adopted on a mass level.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.120
Smart als r I ot enabled rooms this smart devices can talk to each other as so I'm going to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.150
take over a traditional homes.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:03.730
It is estimated that by 2020 each American will have 15 devices connected to over for so it

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.090
is very crucial that the safe,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.860
flexible and robust method be explode to make coyote more user friendly.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.800
On reliable for the owners off these futures march rooms in these super connected homes,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.410
there will be many situations where you will want to give limited access instead of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.150
complete access off your room to the other party.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.920
For example.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.670
Venue.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450
Hire a peditto for paying 1/2 an hour,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.250
visit to feet and look after your dog.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.910
In such a situation,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.490
you would want him to access your lobby only and not the entire house into this.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.210
I it enabled smart homes.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.700
This pinpoint access is not visible.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.280
They can give the complete access off for home to the sitter trauma by leg,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.810
but we can choose what device is also This is he can excess and what devices and services

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.550
should be kept off limits for him but then blocked in technology this is visible.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.670
I'm blocked in powered smartphone will give more power and flexibility to the use of.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.480
After implementing this technology,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.330
the user will be able to easily front and revoke access to any off the smart devices in his

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.750
home.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.340
He can take a decision on the accessibility off.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.990
He died to device separately.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.280
He can,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.020
for the decided that duration for of it eat individual device can be exist by the third

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.160
party because of the decent,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.930
less property off the bloc team.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.100
The accessibility to these devices can be granted all vote dynamically from anywhere on the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.750
globe.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.410
And that,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.650
too,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.450
in a safe and secure mental,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.570
I'll tell,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.960
represents a technological advancement.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.070
Will multiple small devices are if I d tax sensors are interlinked and connected by a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.750
common communication medium.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.450
Often different wireless communication protocols are used by the desire to devices to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.110
interacted each other,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.550
thus making them vulnerable to hacking.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.570
This vulnerability off these devices results in serious security on privacy breach

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.450
challenges.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.120
These challenges can be classified under these major five words network security,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.690
identity management,

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.540
trust,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.650
privacy and resilience.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.170
These security issues at a big pain point for the I D devices but with the implementation

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.970
of block to these issues can be mitigated,

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.270
and the anti networks can be made more secure,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.150
reliable and robust.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.210
The first important issue there,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.370
blocked in mitigates,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.350
is trust.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770
Each device on the I.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.850
O T network is given a unique device i D,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.650
which is created to a smart contract.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.460
Similarly,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.990
each use it on the network is given a unique user writing.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.710
A user can revoke or grant access to everywhere to device separately based on his

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.750
requirements,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.780
will block two names.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.810
Mind contracts.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.030
All that I excused by the individual devices on the network is recorded as a transaction of

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.450
the shared led to for better clarity.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.030
Let us understand it through a real life scenario.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.970
You do.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.390
You mean gotta knew Tom was dead for this March 2,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.610
When the device is added on to the network,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.890
the device is given a unique fighting,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.250
said th one.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.750
His cousin Robert visits us room for the Weakened,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.770
but Jimmy had to me for a colleague spotting hey gives access off the to muster to his

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.650
cousin so that he can feel comfortable in his absence.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.100
As soon as Robert is granted access to the coma state,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.430
a unique user,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.190
I D says even will be generated for him on his interactions with the Thomas Dent will be

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.750
recorded on the ledger as immutable transactions.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.750
The second political issue that blocked in mitigates is network security.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.450
The software off any I T device is the most crucial component that support its function.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.900
Once a specific devices installed in the OT network,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.950
its software needs to be updated with time to address the identified issues or to further

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.360
and new functionalities for a better understanding.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.050
You can compare this with the update that you moved by.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.390
Let's get to fix the latest identified issues ordered New functionalities These are

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.150
treating the out to devices are not secure.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.140
Onda prone to hacking,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.150
which can result in a compromise network.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.450
This like you nine,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.690
the security can be used by any hecho to introduce a harmful update instead off the

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.900
proposed off cape by the manufacturers,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.950
thus leading to a serious security breach.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.830
But with the implementation of the Blockchain,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.550
the whole network can be made secure and robust.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.040
It is much easier to develop.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.910
Did the authenticity off The software update was blocked.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:37.320
Cheese introduced into the network blocking and further ensure that all the devices on the

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.860
network are updated and they're using the latest softer version.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.330
Released.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.450
Weatherman Pictures,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.450
the third critical issue that blocked in mitigates his identity management.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.710
Every device on the outer network is authenticated for satisfying its identity.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.210
Management required route during the authentication process.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.250
Only trusted devices are ready,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.850
don't to the network and unsecured or are not raise devices are rejected.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.210
Don't go in and out of systems don't have a foolproof mechanism to enforce these measures,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.210
but for the implementation of smart contracts,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.980
this can be made foolproof and much more.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.650
Therapist.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.950
The fourth articulation that blocked in mitigates is pregnancy.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:33.130
How did device isn't a smart home network generally capture sensitive and very posted it

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.150
off The uses.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.030
Therefore,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.650
permission handling process is a must have requirement in the network.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.800
In such a scenario,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.850
they never thought Party entity tries to extend it up with any of the devices in the Smart

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.650
Home Network.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:55.610
The user is required to authorise this exchange This exchange.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.020
Can he be approved?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.930
Are rejected by the usual.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.650
Using a smart contract,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:06.280
the user can even define a time limit for the debt exchange.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.550
After fits that they're Texan status will be changed.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.150
Let us take a scenario to understand it in a better V.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.750
Jimmy has a lovely dog named Millo.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.950
He knows that he will be late from work today.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.410
Therefore,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.150
he higher Smith a pet sitter Formulas Evening book.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:32.280
Jimmy gives a digital key of the house to Smith on that only for today,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.580
so as to work.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:40.180
Any unwanted accident this time bomb exists can only be given with the implementation of

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.280
Blockchain which is not possible.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.050
Other ways.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.420
The fifth and last,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.850
particularly shoot that block to mitigate is resilience.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:56.330
Resilient into the system is built through the detection and mitigation off unauthorized

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.750
access and intrusion.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.800
For this purpose,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.090
Ah,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.530
private doctor network can be used.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:09.670
Their network exists to any are not raise user will be prohibited this keeping the network

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.550
robust and resilient.
