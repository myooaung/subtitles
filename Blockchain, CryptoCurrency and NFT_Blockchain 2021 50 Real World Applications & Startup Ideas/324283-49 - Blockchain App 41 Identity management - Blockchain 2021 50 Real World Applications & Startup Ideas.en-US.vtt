00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
In today's digital era,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.850
we can accomplish a lot off our daily tasks,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.150
with a few taps and clicks on our Mobil's tablets and laptops.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.510
Every very transact,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.550
we're required to prove our identity,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.290
either by entering a pin or password or by scanning or biometrics like fingerprints and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.050
retinal scan.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.540
The more we transact online,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.950
the more digital footprints we leave behind.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.910
These digital footprints are extensive and include everything about us like our name,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.800
age,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.090
gender work,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.680
history,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.710
location,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.070
financial history,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.250
specific interests are addresses and other personal records.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.450
These individual peters off data when combined together,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.740
form our own land profile,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.650
which we have no control over.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.850
Once we transact,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.930
our data gets stored in the center later basis off these service providers,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.860
which may be a bank and insurance company and employer,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.950
or any subscription service like Amazon or Netflix.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.200
As we have no control and access to this data,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.650
we have no clue as to how does this data gets used and who all have access to this data.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.750
There are manageable in this with this currently off identity data capturing and story.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.140
Let us discuss each of them in the day personal data test has already discussed for you to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.440
Ah well,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.960
any service you are first required to prove your identity.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.450
The respective service provider,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910
for example,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.780
when he opened a new bank account,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.650
would apply for a loan or register yourself for the services off a digital wallet you are

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.450
required to produce and provide your identity documents with these service providers.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.750
This information then get stored in the individual centralized databases off these service

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.450
providers.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.360
These centralised databases become a soft target for hackers who can then misuse and abuse

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050
your confidential personal and private information.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.050
The second challenge is cognitive or lord for the user.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.780
They're far too many only services that one depends on to the every service platform or app

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.880
requires you to uniquely this to yourself with an i.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.050
D and password on the platform.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.750
For example,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.150
when you use a movie ticket booking application,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.090
you create a profile with the user name and password,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.830
or when you want to connect with the school friends on Facebook,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.470
you again.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.850
I required to create a user name and password,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.690
or when you want to trail in Cryptocurrencies,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.350
you can't escape this unique registration process.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.330
The list is unless for the type and number of service providers we interact with on a daily

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.950
bases.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.970
And to remember the user names and passwords for each of these platforms is a Herculean

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.450
task.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.090
The cognitive Lord is too high for the user in such a scenario where he's required to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.650
remember so many dictates.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.570
In such a case,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.950
I use it is left with only two options.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.660
Either we use the same idea password across all the service platforms or to create

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.190
different user names and passwords and not them down in his mobile phone or left toe in

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.320
case of a single user name and password.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.050
Hacking off anyone account spares the risk across all of the platforms.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.360
And in case the passwords are noted down somewhere,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.300
the security risk level reaches to the next level.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.360
The tar challenges,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.250
lack of transparency and control.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.650
The personal data collected by these service providers,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.270
Lex that require transparency I use it has no clue on various personal data is kept for

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.990
what purpose it gets used on who all can access.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.650
His data user is always left wondering about the safety and security of the data collected

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.920
further.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.430
Many of these service providing platforms.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.550
Cell uses data to various third parties without the knowledge and consent of the uses.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.450
These parties then use this data to market and sell their services and products to these

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.050
uses.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.390
This sharing of data proves that the power off data lies in the hands of the database owner

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.390
,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.010
and they use it,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.250
has no control or his own data.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.030
Simply put,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.510
the current only identity management practices are unsustainable and requires a more robust

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.110
solution.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.490
And the booking the Blocks in power platform can provide the required solution to manage

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.800
this identity in a more transparent,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.440
secure and reliable manner.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.030
A Blockchain based identity management system.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.350
What's control of the uses data back in the user's hands?

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.080
In this new self sovereign identity system,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.660
uses data can be accessed by 1/3 party to validate his identity.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.190
But that data recited the user and doesn't get stored on the service or the service

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.750
provider.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.110
That's eliminating the possibility off inappropriate use of his personal data by these

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.050
service providers.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.610
In this blocking,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.700
this sister use every very quiet to download a self sovereign identity app on his mobile

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.050
phone.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.650
He will then be required to upload all his identity.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.100
Certificates on this platform once uploaded,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.250
a unique cash gets generated for the users information.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.430
All of these certificates will then be sent to a government agency or a government approved

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.750
agency for the purpose of verification.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.720
These documents can either be approved or rejected by the government agency based on its

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.150
criteria and judgment.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.550
The verification status off the digital i D will then get stored on the Blockchain.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.670
And whenever the user's information is required for authentication by a service provider,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.860
the user can grant access to the relevant information.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.570
So that service provider that data resides with the user in an encrypted former and doesn't

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.640
get stored in the centralized databases off these service providers does mitigating the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.450
risk of data breach and hacking off your personal Later,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.140
these encrypted digital identities will replace the need for remembering multiple user

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.510
names and passwords.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.450
Does deducing the cognitive load off the uses?

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.740
For instance,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.850
if you use it wants to apply for a bank loan his first required to authenticate himself.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.770
In the current scenario,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.220
this process is a tedious task where the user is required to submit multiple documents to

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.100
prove his identity and because the process is man will.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.980
It takes days and sometimes even weeks for the bank to process the long But in this new

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.570
blocked empowered identity management system,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.680
our music and provide the required access to the bank to verify his personal details and

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.360
the bank and verifies documents then and there,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.950
it says,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.050
thus streamlining the whole process and making the experience seamless.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.500
Additionally,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.700
this system will increase the efficiency of the banks and will reduce the costs and efforts

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.150
for them.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.400
The application of this idea management platform are in finite right from ordering anything

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.750
on any e commerce website toe applying for higher education.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.860
Proper implementation off this Blockchain based idea management platform can take the data

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.360
security plan next level in this digital age where data security is an ever growing concern

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.360
.
