00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
today.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.410
Pharma companies,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.700
excluding new roofs to synthesize new jobs and therefore the raw material requirements have

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.050
become quite complex.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.730
Because of these requirements,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.610
these raw materials are sourced from various suppliers who are geographically scattered

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.750
across the globe.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.500
As the raw materials required run into tens of thousands.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.750
It becomes very crucial for the manufacturing companies to have a check on the ingredients

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.940
on to ensure that the supplier cell complain to the guidelines provided put them in the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.960
current system,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.170
there is no clear way to know if the raw material supplied is authentic.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.630
Already some cheap counterfeit verse,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.130
the raw materials are sourced from the suppliers.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.210
The manufacturing process starts.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.750
Big pharma companies generally have multiple plants scattered in various locations.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.600
This further adds to the complexity off the supply chain.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.990
The manufacture drugs are shipped by 1/3 party culture in logistic companies to local

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.550
distributor's on various other countries.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.740
In many cases,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.220
these logistic partners don't have the adequate capabilities to maintain these trucks on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.650
the required conditions.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.450
There's leading to drugs losing their effectiveness.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.880
But for manufactures,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.550
it is very difficult to insure that the drugs were moved under the appropriate conditions

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.090
as specified by them.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.510
If the drug is to be distributed within the same country,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.010
it is,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.950
she put thousands off local distributor's spread across the country.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.160
The distributor's deaths have like these drugs to,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.330
say,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.850
country wholesalers all to pharmacies who send these drugs to the patients.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.500
And in case the drugs are to be exported,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.780
they change multiple hands in various countries before reaching their final destination.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.250
In such a scenario,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.030
with lack of transparency and control,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.720
the supply chain becomes well.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.080
They're able to counterfeiting.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.950
Now let's understand how block tin can help to keep a check on counterfeiting.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.790
A blocked in bay supply chin have information on all the parties involved,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.140
like ingredient suppliers,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.440
manufacturers,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.970
logistic partners,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.050
wholesalers,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.170
distributors,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.210
pharmacists,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.070
all hospitals and each noting disa plating,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.720
drop off and pick up activity gets recorded in the shared letter,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.250
along with the times Time.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.290
The physical transfer of ownership off the goods gets recorded virtually in the Blockchain

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.270
Onley after each receiving party verifies that the shipment has been received from the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.430
correct source in a blocked in letter.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.850
No one can temperature records in the chain,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.010
including their own supplies,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.760
will initiate a blocked in by recording the serial number on the packs off raw materials

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.050
which are to be sent to the manufacturers.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.520
Additionally,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.860
location of the supply,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.350
it will also be recorded on the block tune.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.570
These suppliers also need to upload the certificates off the authenticity off these

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.850
supplied materials.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.560
This can be done by getting their facility inspected by a regulatory body on getting a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.560
legal certificate proving the same Venta ingredients treats the manufactures.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.520
The even will be recorded on the Blockchain along with the date off receiving on the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.890
respective location Waas drugs and manufactured.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.980
They will be placed in bottles,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.750
vials or strips labeled with unique identifiers and will then be grouped on packaged.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.050
These packages will have labels that will be scanned on recorded at every point road Sunni

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.090
from the factory until it reaches a pharmacy.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.510
Volume of these packets exchange hands.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.130
The Concerned party will scan the label on the packets and the transaction will be recorded

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.650
permanently on the Blockchain.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.870
If anyone tries to temper the project,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.950
all the information it can be detected easy.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.010
Similarly,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.810
the whole journey or drugs from the ingredient supplier to pharmacy will be recorded

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.350
digitally on the Blockchain.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.960
The consumer can scan the unique number and cannot a religion off the truck,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.820
the route that drunk has taken and even the ingredients used to manufacture the drug

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.650
provided the customer has been granted access to see this information by the manufacturers

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.650
.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.080
Many medical aids,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.480
like vaccines are sensitive to environmental conditions on any fluctuations in these

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.650
conditions can make them ineffective.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.370
I'll devices like temperature senses can be attached to the package.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.250
Is that record the temperature and other conditions of the package throated Sunni?

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.150
Any change in the temperature will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.000
Additionally,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.060
the smart contracts will be executed when the compliance conditions are not met on an alert

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.610
will be sent to the living parties in the supply teaching does.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.150
Through this technology,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.390
it can be ensured that the drugs remain in the suggested storage conditions through a bit

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.950
journey.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.750
Even the consumer,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.990
with the help of the share digital ledger,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.040
can easily know if the drug is active by scanning the label on the trip blockers.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.890
Transparency on disability provides a great potential advantage to the farmer industry in

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.560
case the drug shipment was missing due to counterfeiting operations,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.600
it is much easier to locate it on the chain as the complete transaction is recorded on the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.150
letter,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.550
and it can be easily known who was possessing the consignment when the issue happened.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.860
Sometimes serious side effects off a certain drug unknown only many treat is a market in

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.270
such a situation manufactures a required to withdraw the drug from the market and the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.170
ugliest possible.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.750
It is still feasible for a company to recall the drug from the distributor's and pharmacies

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.750
.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.710
But then,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.520
because challenge is to contact the consumers,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.550
we have bought this trip and intimate them to avoid using the trip.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.350
Drug recall announcements are generally made online or to advertisements,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.060
and they're very high chances that the customer maybe saw the announcement and consumed the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.450
trip.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.370
In such a scenario,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.350
you blocked in.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.910
Technology will help manufacturers and pharmacies to keep a record of the people who have

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.250
bought that particular trip.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.130
This will make it easier for them to contact these consumers and intimate them about the

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.950
tropical.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.120
The answer.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.420
Stroke off medicines by wholesalers.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.150
All pharmacies is commonly returned to the farmer companies.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.080
These companies,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.710
instead of destroying them,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.350
might opt to resent them.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.170
But before reselling the need to validate the authenticity off the return trucks.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.040
That is the need to conform if the drug is effective and has been kept.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.740
And the design storage conditions so altered Sony because any fluctuations in the

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.260
temperature humidity on any other described environmental conditions can make the drug

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.150
ineffective.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.940
The companies can scan the return drugs by the unique i D.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.250
On contract all the information off its journey.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.320
It defined the drug to be effective then only this drug can be sent for.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.950
Resending.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:49.680
It has become an urgent need to cut the counterfeit drugs for developing off people.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.180
As I have discussed,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.450
these fake drugs have CD a side effect on the human him.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.200
Blockchain technology has the ability to minimize these floats.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.190
A central authority,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:08.230
sir Company will decide who will participate in the Bloc team or in other hoods who've

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.350
electors note like suppliers,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.790
logistic partners,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.990
distributor's retainers,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.770
consumers at Sitra Onda smart contracts may be issued that will help in establishing the

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.450
proof off drug ownership.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.290
Then the drugs exchange hands.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:31.450
The unique idea will be traced and very fight every time Fake drugs and did into the system

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.320
will not be verified as they don't have original,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.550
unique I D and therefore will fail to become part of the network.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:44.110
This will even him to locate the note that allowed counterfeit drugs entered into the

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.880
supply chain.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.490
When a consumer gets a truck,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.850
he interest all the required information by simply scanning the unique idea on the medicine

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.300
with his smartphone all by entering the I.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.540
D.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.950
On the company's website,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.160
the drugs can be time stamped on the technology.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.660
Also,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.000
a shows that the drug isn't it's expected.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.070
Geographical written online pharmacies are the main culprits for selling fake drugs to the

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.950
consumers.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.240
According to wh you,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.540
50% off the drugs bought online or thick been blocked in technology.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:25.550
One can identify that the job he has received from online pharmacy is authentic or fake.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:31.390
This technology can save many lives by making them a veer off these pictures.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:38.980
Drug shortage can need to delay treatment off the patients on Does pose a significant

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.910
threat to public health to avoid drug shortage.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.940
It is very important that the drug manufacturers should get the information about the

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.750
demand on time so as to minimize the drug manufacturing and supply Talese.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.970
But because of the complex Appalachian.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:02.790
There is lack of coordination among the players to better communicate 30 months shortage of

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.930
drugs force healthcare providers and patients to shift to alternate drugs.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.960
That can lead to less effective treatment and can even lead to the introduction of

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.230
counterfeit medicines in the market as we know that blocked in technology will record all

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.130
the information of the truck from its raw materials till it reaches the consumers.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.050
Therefore,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.920
the digital nature will also record the sales off medicines from a particular wholesaler or

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.710
a pharmacy.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.990
This,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.710
in turn,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:39.060
will update the invention of drugs available with them on the sheer digital letter.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.880
This insight will help the manufacturers to keep his inventing of diluted and supplied

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.750
these drugs on time to avoid drug shortage in the market.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.250
This will be a win win situation for all the stakeholders involved.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.500
Patients will have timely exists to the required drugs at the same time,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.950
Company also wants a full financial losses due to losses because of drug shortage
