00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
appealing.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.930
But certificate in today's scenario is a tedious task as it involves a lot of paperwork in

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.130
the current scenario.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.150
Off dealing birth certificate may take days and sometimes even weeks,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.890
but with blocked in technology obtaining digital.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.850
But certificates will be much easier.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.660
The pretty sensitive information,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.290
like but certificate only,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.960
can also lead to the risk of identity theft.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.640
But with built in technology,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.900
the information can be stored in a safe,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.890
secure and immutable man.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.340
Let's understand how blocked it would work for,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.550
but that tickets,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.050
parents or doctors would love the birthdate and birth time of the child on the Blockchain.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.830
The government agencies would verified this a distant but information on the bloc team and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.730
then cryptographic.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.560
Lee signed this data related to a person's name,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.590
date of birth,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.350
blood group and other mentioned details on the letter.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.400
This whole information will be stored in a tamper proof of digital ledger that can be

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.650
accessed only with the permission of illegal guardian until the child becomes a legal event

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.960
to understand its real life implications.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.500
Let's take the case of refugees that if you just have to face a disaster situation as they

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.540
are unable to get their birth certificates because off which they are devoid off many

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.380
facilities in their asylum country two blocks in technology that you just can easily prove

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.540
that identity and can a will the opportunity to continue higher education or can do jobs in

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.390
the silent country.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.050
By implementing bloating,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.230
people would be able to prove their identity without the hassle of unnecessary bureaucracy

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.450
and undergoing time consuming paperwork.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.650
Bloating platform can even be used to start married certificates,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.840
marriage certificates at the documents,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.850
he should two couples to legally recognize their marriage.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.710
The manager distinction is a tedious stash.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.250
Cancel it.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.760
The couple has to find marriage certificate in the government office by showing the island

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.850
the proofs and producing witnesses off their marriage.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.750
The whole process of between marriage certificate take several weeks.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.120
Due to the paper based work,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.450
there is a substantial risk off road and forgery of the documents.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.240
But the Blockchain technology has the potential to address these issues by acting as a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.450
decentralized and transparent global.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.710
Maris's the street portal to a distant marriage on the block to the officer would check and

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.140
verify all the documents submitted to him once this is done,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.560
the officer for then proceed to enter the data into the low key.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.750
Each minute of this station will be given a unique hatch.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.640
This technology can even help you create immutable marriage certificates on Blockchain

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380
without relying on government organizations to keep a record of these marriages and their

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.210
corresponding certificates the information required for creating a mallet certificate or

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.270
contracting Blokhin is as following couples knee that I didn't be proof.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.910
I just contact number marriage vows.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.680
That couple is taken this process off.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.150
Resisting marriage and blocked in will please the fraud cases,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.600
and we make it much easier for the new couple to get their marriage registered.
