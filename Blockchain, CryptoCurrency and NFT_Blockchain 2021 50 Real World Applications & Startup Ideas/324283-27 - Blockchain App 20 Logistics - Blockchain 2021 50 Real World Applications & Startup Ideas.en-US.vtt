00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
in any supply to managing the transportation of products is a challenging task.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.670
Sometimes materials an improbable issue which can result in sensitive products getting

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.350
damaged.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.750
The success of any logistics company lies in the effective management to management.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.540
We're housing fast delivery and taking care,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.150
see stories of the goods.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.650
And did I empty and block team.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.810
These technologies are ready to revolutionize the logistics.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.250
To me,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.110
the transportation of food,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.750
chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs requires temperature control.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.850
I simply defined Temperature is required to preserve the design qualities of these products

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.850
,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.030
and it's fluctuation in the temporary,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.480
too can degrees.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.150
The effectiveness of these products on in some cases can even meet them unfit for

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.950
consumption.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.400
Human error is the leading cause for mishaps,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.250
but imperative electricians,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.400
some of these others at a school if the temperature sensitive container wants to be shipped

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.250
in the morning,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.110
but the shipment got delayed to native me.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.250
This delay can cause unwanted fluctuations in the temperature.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.460
If in the packaging the lid off the product bottle is not properly closed,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.060
it can cause the inside contents to get exposed to high environmental temperature.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.170
If the frozen backs and more compactly packed leaving enough space between the product

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.900
backings.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.190
The products can melt in transit because off uneven cooling and getting exposed to high

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.390
temperature fluctuation in the temperature of the cold room can damage the pharmaceutical

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.850
products in case the temperature falls below the acceptable temporary too.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.560
That's reducing the effectiveness of the projects in a locked in and i.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.150
O T base logistics system.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.170
The product that gets will have two components.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.050
The first company will be in need number assigned with the product package.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.550
This is a very distant on the bloc team.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.720
Whenever the Beckett in his hands,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.680
the in commission will be recorded on the block to does the complete Tony of the product

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.500
from manufactured till it reaches the customer will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.850
This second component will be I ot temperature senses which will be attached to the package

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.850
.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.830
These senses will record the temperature of the product during its transportation and this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.770
information will be recorded on the box.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.160
Besides,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.250
on the situation in the temperature,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.500
we'll also be recorded on the block to and in a lot of people sent to all the relevant

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.090
stakeholders involved in the supply tea these are distances can also monitor humidity

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.050
conditions and physical shop in the storage area of the shipment.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.150
Subsequent e Although concerned stakeholders,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.040
we'll be able to track this complete information on the bloc team and thinking uses in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.410
commission to notify the Trump drivers and shape was some damage shipments long before the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.950
driver difference and ask for a new and undamaged shipment.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.840
Otherwise,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.100
the senses that can be used during the transportation on those that can sense the location

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.950
of the shipment.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.570
I registered that on the block to thereby informing all the concerns.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.150
Seco this about the real time location of the shipment.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.850
These are distances.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.050
A faster shipment.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.150
Don't even improve this obliging security.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.510
I protect the shipment against theft by detecting anomalies like Rudy Aviation hijacking or

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.150
temporary.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.330
The whole information will get registered on the bloc team angles and live a lot to the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.690
stake.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.860
All this import Most companies rely on enter braces source planning Why he'll be so few to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.100
support their business.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.700
I'm supply teaching Inventor needs the combination of i o t.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.480
With me,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.920
I'll be so serious can and business in but providing real time data which didn't give

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.750
existing here piece real time visibility into the inventor of products and services.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.950
Then this whole information gets adjusted on the bloc team.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.390
The minister just can have real day Muppets about the event You of the enterprises and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.130
therefore real time orders can be placed on the basis of predetermined conditions in

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.730
suggesting that you on defense has been to see the shipment without any diddly and thereby

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.050
preventing any loss of sales.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.750
The Scinto enhancing the customer experience for these enter places.
