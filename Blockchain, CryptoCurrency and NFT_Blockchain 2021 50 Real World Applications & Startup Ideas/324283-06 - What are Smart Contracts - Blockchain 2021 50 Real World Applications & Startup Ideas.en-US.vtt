00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
one of the reasons addition to blocked in our smart contracts.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.450
It's my contacts were just like normal contracts in the real world,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.090
the only defense being smart contractors completely digital and get stored inside the

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.650
location.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.150
Unlike conventional contracts,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.510
it's My contacts,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.750
consists off a software code and then executed by the Blockchain network.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.950
The beauty of these smart contracts is that this kind of modified or oil good ones decided

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.830
these store rooms for negotiating the terms of a contract automatically very find the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.050
contact and then executing the agree toes.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.570
They do not require any manual intervention for contract,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.390
execution and implementation.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.720
Smart Country allows the parties involved to extend anything of value,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.480
like she owes money,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.900
property,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.750
etcetera in a secure and transparently,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.090
thus eliminating the requirement of a middleman and further removing any chances of a

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.250
system conflict.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.870
Smart contracts are based on a mechanism which involves digital SX and who on more

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.150
transacting parties,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.440
these parties deposited little assets into the look.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.480
These SX then get redistributed among the participants.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.550
Once pretty find terms in the contract are met the implementation of smart contracts

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.250
bringing more transparency in the system which made against the issue of fraud.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.750
Further,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.180
it also leads to reduced cost for the participants as there is no third party involved in

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.950
the transaction.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.040
Undoubtedly,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.650
these smart contracts are going to be a game changer in the future.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.440
Let us examine the benefits of smart contracts in detail.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.340
One of the basic properties of smart contracts,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.080
which make them so critical,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.710
is that transparency that they bring along with them as discussed earlier,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.450
you smart contracts containing exhausted and detailed list of terms and conditions.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.530
I read up on whether partisan world this free at work setting eliminates the chances of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.210
issues and disputes at later stages as the terms and conditions are proposed and passed by

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.450
the parties themselves.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.150
These terms and conditions remain visible to everybody involved in the transaction.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
This bringing transparency in the system,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.760
he sues,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.870
Elated to communication.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.950
Gaps are also reduced with the implementation of smartphone kits,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.190
as there is only a single version of the truck and that is visible to everyone on the net.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.200
The second important benefit off implementing smart contracts is better time efficiency in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.750
the traditional system with paperwork in world,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.520
it generally takes days to get a request processed There is a lot of unnecessary

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.150
duplication off documents at various stages of the process.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.710
Further involvement of a large number of intermediaries make the process more complex,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.450
cumbersome and time consuming.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.750
But with the implementation of smart contracts,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.650
all visit invent and unnecessary steps are eliminated from the process.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.450
With significantly,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.350
this is the time taken to complete the transactions.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.150
Smart contracts along with block to a tamper,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.580
proof,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.840
reliable and secure this characteristic off security and safety bills and more value

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.650
interest in the associated transactions.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.200
Smart contracts can lead to a significant cost savings for the partisan mood as the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.500
middleman is eliminated from the question,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.250
so we start associated with them also gets eliminated.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.010
Lawyers,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.570
brokers and other intermediaries who has the some from the parties involved have no or very

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.670
less prone to play.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.950
Then the smartphone prints are introduced.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.640
One of the real life matters that was my point right that many of you may have interacted

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.250
with is the vending machine.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.250
The smart contracts on the block in and vending machine share a lot of commonality.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.890
So does a high quartered into the vending machine that decides what happens when certain

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.170
conditions are met and based on these conditions automated actions that triggered by the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.950
vending machine.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.800
For instance,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.350
when Lila puts a dollar in the vending machine,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.010
a can of soda,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.890
along with the tale of 50 cents,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.850
is dispensed by the railing machine.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.360
And in case she puts 50 cents,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.510
the vending machine will dispense a can of soda alone in this writer for a vending machine

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.510
.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.250
Certain rules are redefined and hard coded into the machine.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.350
These rules don't get executed in the physical world by the vending machine.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.020
Similarly,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.960
smart contracts are rules define and executed by the lines off court on the block.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.810
Now let's have a better understanding off these contracts through practical,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.050
real life examples.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.050
Let's start with the insurance industry.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.770
The current issue with this industry is that claim processing thing that is,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.950
it takes weeks and sometimes even months to get the claim settled.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.320
The process is outdated,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.440
and men with this increases the overhead cost for the insurer and in town.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.850
Customers have to pay higher premiums.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:37.030
Insurance companies can you smart contracts to automate these insurance policies in these

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.680
smart contracts conditioned and rules are defined under which the plane will be approved

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.550
for resented what example in case of any catastrophic natural disaster.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.240
Quantifiable parameters off the event.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.830
Such a speed of the wind,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.170
what magnitude often earthquake can be recorded on with the election when the parameters

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.550
beat the defined conditions in the smart country.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.370
The claim processes are triggered immediately and the complete build amount is released

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.990
without any human intervention.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.150
Implementation of smartphone tricks.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.330
Not only that,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.850
this is the overhead costs for the injured,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.150
but also brings in a sense of trust and transparency in the system.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.530
Another good news case for smart contracts is supply teaching,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.350
which has become quite complex onto more porous international boundaries and involvement of

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.150
a large number of intermediaries.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.800
Supply till in wars of floor products and goods from its initial state billiards final

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.140
state,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.950
for example,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.350
from a producer who produces Domitian with consumer will ultimately consumes them.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.340
Let's take the example of farmers a play tea and understand how smart contracts can be sub

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.050
this space.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.930
Certain drugs,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.840
like vaccines,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.950
are sensitive to temperature changes.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.040
These accents,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.120
if kept at an unsuitable temperature,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.550
becomes inactive and ineffective.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.790
But in the current scenario,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.810
there is no foolproof way to establish that the vaccine has been kept at the right

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.450
temperature throughout its journey and this fit for medical use.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.380
But with the implementation of smart contracts along with I o.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.750
T.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.950
This that can easily be checked and established.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.850
Smart Coyote senses will be installed on the vaccine packets.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.950
We feel recorded temperature throughout its journey.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.080
Smart contextually redefine.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.500
For this,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.110
a plating.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:40.280
One of the conditions defined in the smart contract will be if temperature rises above the

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.250
expected range.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.150
The drugs will be sent back to the manufacturer for inspection,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.250
therefore removing ineffective breaks from the system.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.840
Further,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.350
the loss will be born by the person who is possessing the packet at that time.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:01.450
These are just some of a few examples off the limitless possibilities off smart contracts.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.150
Doe Smart contracts are still in their infancy,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.750
but the future holds great promise for them with the applications.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.630
Renzi from a regular day to day agreement to huge government and enterprise agreements on a

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.450
global level
