00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.480
it is nearly impossible to find out which specific ingredient in the product is affecting

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.150
your skin and therefore should be avoided.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.690

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.650
doesn't suit you.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.970
