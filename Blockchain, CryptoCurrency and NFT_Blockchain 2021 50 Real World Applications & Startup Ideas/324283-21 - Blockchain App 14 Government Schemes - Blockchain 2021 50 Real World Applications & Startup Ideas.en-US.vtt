00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
there s a shame,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.180
flu and storage of citizens.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.770
Data for providing services to them is a fair among importance for any government

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.650
organization.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.910
In the current scenario,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.230
centralised database management systems represent majority of the databases for storing

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.540
this information about people in the world in every country there,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.850
lot of government skins.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.350
But many challenges arise in the implementation of these kings.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.710
Many 80 people are unable to avail the skins because of the corruption involved in the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.450
process.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.650
A lot of money disposed by the government under such skins get siphoned off by Mittelman.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.470
This leaving a number of needy people.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.430
He live in unpaid riches all less than standard,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.210
which is the second challenge.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.550
US data manipulation.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.840
The situation arises when user data entry is first and in many registers at one location of

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.120
the users and then a copy of decisions to is transported to another location for entering

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.950
the Gator babies.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.190
Because of this process of data entry at multiple points and storage of getting different

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.410
central databases,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.350
third party manipulation is highly possible.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.850
Before that entry in the centralised databases,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.560
these manipulations put into changing,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.810
faking or dealing user data intentionally,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.920
even if the data manipulations are not done.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.790
Delays in availing services,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.450
my taco due to labor intensive paperwork and slow inter bureaucratic communications.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.550
Let's understand ha block tin can help in official implementation of government funds

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.450
through a real world.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.150
Example.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.150
A social welfare scheme was started by Indian government for Labour's in India.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.420
The skin ended providing 100 days of guaranteed employment to labour,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.770
some rural parts of India and in case such implement cannot be provided and unemployment

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.950
alliance has to be provided to those lepers.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.840
An effective communication between the needy people on the government that will arrange

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.850
funds for them is crucial for smooth implementation off the scheme.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.530
For this communication,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.490
there comes the third party intermediaries that handle date off.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.850
Liberals on subsequently ensure forms are disposed to the Lakers.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.400
However,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.250
then various challenges in effective implementation of the scheme.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.470
The money provided by the government for the scheme can be expected coarsely Ah,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.390
he wants number of applications received by government to provide money and job the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270
labourers on not always good.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.940
Local authorities issue more job cards.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.590
Then the number of workers employed to acquire a large amount of funding from the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.350
government these local officers then pocket the exist mint.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.420
There's also many instances off local people being breaks to the authorities to acquire a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.070
job cut.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.530
To receive the phones in such situations blocked in can help ineffective implementation of

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.650
the government's skins.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.520
The data entry would be done on distributed shared ledger rather than on centuries

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.250
databases.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.670
In case of such skins,

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.150
the data entry of flavors applying for book along with the information on the identity card

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.440
should begun directly on the Blockchain.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.460
It could mitigate the risk of data manipulation as data one centered becomes tamperproof

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.450
and immutable.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.890
Does my contracts and block shin contain pre defined terms and conditions to decide if the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.650
labors are political for skin?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.150
After entering the information off laborers,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.450
the smart contracts get executed on decide if the labor is eligible for the skin on.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.760
The result will be stored in the Blockchain in.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.720
The label is found to be eligible for the skin on notification will be sent to the central

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.140
government on the world will be allocated to the little.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.640
If work has been located to the labour,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.230
then the smart contracts early release funds in the form of villages toe.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.570
The Liberals account on the stipulated time based on the work completed by the liberal.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.500
As for the scheme rules in case such employment cannot be provided to the laborer within 15

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.780
days off a plan CO hope again,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.860
that's not contracts will be executed.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.450
Andan Unemployment Alliance will be initiated to the bank accounts off these laborers.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.730
The higher colleges would be able to view the related information for example,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.260
number of days for which book is and located.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.250
For the liberals.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.350
Don't a budget of the vote funds allocated to the livers,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.050
etcetera.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.250
There's enabling transparent floor firms.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.110
Even the social audit agencies whose work is just to tonight's government operations will

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.610
be an important part of this platform as they even have the authority to view the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.950
information updated on blocked in but any authority at any level.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.700
For though the Blockchain technology will also ensure that people who are not in need

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.560
should not a real such schemes by forging the documents similarly go,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.970
many shows up suggest to people of its countries,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.140
for instance,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.750
subsidy estelle familes to produce fertilizers for agriculture purposes.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.790
But because of the corruption in vault,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.050
these subsidies and misused and sometimes do not reach their intended Formosa Toll

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.050
Introducing blocked in technology can provide the transparency in issuing subsidies s room

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.050
.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.710
It would ensure that the farmers,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.870
all the targeted group of people,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.650
are getting the appropriate and plant proliferates.
