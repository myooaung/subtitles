00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
most off,

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.150
you might have faced the situation at least once in your life.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.550
Then you see a much higher figure on the utility bill,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.350
then what you have expected.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.450
It can be a mistake that can happen for so many reasons.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.180
In some cases,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.390
this mistaken,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.210
easily rectified violent others.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.270
There may not be a proper rectification to for it before jumping to solutions for these

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.910
issues,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.200
let's first understand how abilities and rated for the utility services the current

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.110
electricity bills.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.590
In addition,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350
process is as following.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.500
A representative from the electricity board takes a reading off the electric meter in Seoul

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.350
to your home on the basis off electricity units consumed for you abilities and rigid that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.050
you receive the Intracoastal Meal all on your emulating.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.250
Then you pay the bill either that the payment kiosk on the only importune.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.990
But the current bills immigration process has many issues because off which mistakes happen

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.550
in these utility bills,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.480
some of them are is following manual in division required from reading the units of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.560
electricity consumed to date,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.650
entry in a spreadsheet can lead to possible letters in the mail.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.450
One of the other critical challenge that utility industry faces is the utility fraud.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.000
Their customers tamper with reading off the electricity meters in order to reduce their

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.790
electricity bills blocked in.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.150
And I dont have the potential to ultimate disability process.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.460
In this new system,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.260
you will be first required to install the spot I wanted to world's installed.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.450
The electricity consumption data will be sent digitally into the bloc team.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.280
Additionally,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.880
Smart country will have pre defined truth to calculate the electricity bill from the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.650
electricity years consumed by a standard formula.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.700
After that,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.680
this my contract will get executed on the payment will be done because I'll just not me to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.050
doesn't require human intervention.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.790
Therefore,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.700
there will be few letters and you get an accurate before they look to city consumed on

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.630
utility trouble.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.750
Also decrease.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.250
There are a few more advantages off installing I artist smart meters on Blockchain

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.150
technology.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.710
Real time data on the electricity consumption can be tracked by boat Electricity Board on

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.980
Consumers Utility in the stricken also uses real time data for generating better insights

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.090
on the electricity consumption trends.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.850
Over time,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.620
I had Amy doesn't start,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.500
have many more uses,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.520
then just detecting the amount of electricity consumed these me dis can also detect system

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.230
irregularities like me.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.110
The defects,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.520
outages attempted tempering,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.880
etcetera inside scenarios and a lot will be sent to you to fix the identified problem.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.650
So I still optimize the energy consumption.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.150
Allison.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.080
Water bill payment can also be many most for using block tune.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.850
And I hope the senses I have this much water meters then measured a consumption of what to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.730
and we'll record this data on the block to the water building.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.200
Then we can polluted after looking and the state of water consumption and sparked contracts

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.650
will be executed that will automatically pay the bill.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:47.560
These smart water meters can even detect any water leakage on any tempering attempted upon

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.260
detection off.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.430
In this achievement,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.610
all of this information will be recorded on the block to thus we can say that

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.850
implementation of the senses can help us to efficiently manage our water resources and use

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.850
them optimally.
