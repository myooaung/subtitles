00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
imagine if,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.100
instead,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.860
just paying for the card in food yourself and leaving it parked for more than 80% off the D

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.860
.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.550
You can buy a car by paying only apart off it and sharing it with your friends.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.530
Peers on neighbors in such a scenario would be able to own a car at a much cheaper cost.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.650
Then he can Today.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.640
This is one of the examples of shared economy sheared economies.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.480
The few to,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.310
and we have started seeing this Indian people rent out rooms in their homes to strangers,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.580
too.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.690
On some extra books on for travellers,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
they get the chance to see and interact with the local culture.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.490
And that,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.890
too,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.850
at a more economical price.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.950
The concept of the shared economy is going to spread across the brake and meant over lives

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.950
.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.420
But for that,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.100
what's required is a more robust,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.060
secure,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.460
transparent system that can active in a blue to make this a reality blocking and I artist

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.350
systems under solution that can provide the required decentralized I'll Be utopia platform

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.250
that we have been looking for all these years.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.180
These systems will allow communities to have a transparent,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.730
and he could table framework,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.820
which will be much more energy and resource efficient as the resources will be utilised in

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.570
a more optimal be instead of gardening a single individual,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.850
the cost will pay equitably shoot and so they're better value.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.230
I don't time will be reduced and feel resources will be spent to meet the ever doing needs

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.450
off the human race.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.050
For though,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.800
the implementation of smart contracts will ensure that the devices are getting used.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.150
Where individuals in the intended onder accepted V as pre decided in the smart country,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.780
machines connected through Hyoty and managed with smart contracts and blocked in are

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.750
predicted to rule the future off the shared economy.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.420
This whole story,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.470
especially for high ticket assets as businesses would be able to get the maximum value for

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.750
the investments on these assets.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.640
Introduction of such a platform will offer the dual benefits number one convenient

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.590
fractional ownership and second ah sharing marketplace,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.950
which will lead to reduced on a ship cost and maximize utilization.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.450
Let us examine it to some real life examples for a better and clear understanding.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.960
Let us take the example of far mission free,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.870
which is very expensive,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.120
and farmers are required to pay a lot,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.150
some off money up front to buy the machine tree.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.920
But as the machine remains ideal for a significant time of the year,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.590
it leads to a decrease in the profit margins off the far more A farmer needs to buy a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.280
tractor for his fields,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.850
but it doesn't want to build the full cost of the equipment.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.580
Therefore,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.220
he approaches three office fellow farmers and big together decide to share the ownership

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.950
off the tractor and use it cooperatively.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.350
With the help of locked in on leveraging,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.420
I have to device senses installed on the tractor.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.710
They will be able to view the real time location usage,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.710
high performance off the mission dream,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.750
which was not possible before.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.600
With the help of this real time deter,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.480
they will be ableto better.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.400
Judge the share of maintenance cost based on usage off the machinery,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.850
but each individual thus bringing trust and transparency in the system.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.580
This leg.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.530
Some can even be used for renting out the tractor on the market,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.180
Please the help of smart contracts.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.410
The terms off accepted and intended use off the equipment can be pre defined on when

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.860
someone hires a tractor or any other machinery from this platform.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.480
That's my contract will be signed by the lender on borough I've been accorded on the block

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.750
to a smart love.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.230
Functionality can also be provided with the help of these smart contracts that can lock or

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.250
unlock the tractor based on the payment suitors.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.320
This would make renting off the high value equipment and machinery much easier without the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.750
intervention of the Oh no.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.400
For though this renting was sharing can even be applied to other scenarios.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.050
Is will.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.610
For instance,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.850
machine to machine sharing can be done using the Blockchain and smart contracts.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.890
For example,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.430
one device can temporarily live in doubt.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.540
It's dissed space to other devices as locked in enables.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.520
Micro Payments Border device would pay the owner device for the section off the disc space

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.240
used in simple words.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.050
Every device will have its own account on the Internet,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.210
and it can get compensated.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.250
So these micro payments for lending its resources to other devices there never required
