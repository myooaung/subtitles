00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
power is another very crucial field that go to disrupt.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.710
Basically,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.420
it will taste of a how power is stored,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.050
distributed entity.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.990
Let's understand the implications off Mary blocked in with power industry Bloating

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.490
technology can be an ideal platform hope peer to peer energy treaty where people can sell

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.840
electricity generated from renewable sources like solar energy or been energy to their

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.050
peers or neighbors.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290
In the current scenario,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.720
energy is produced in centralized electricity generation facilities and is then believer to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.250
industrial and domestic users by distribution networks operated by energy companies.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.350
But with Blockchain and smart contracts,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.220
it will be visible for anyone and everyone to trade and supply the energy generated from

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.250
renewable sources.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.660
In this proposed system,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.450
Smart meters would be used to measure the amount of energy produced and consumed.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.530
These energy trading activities in this Blockchain based system will be executed to spark

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.350
contracts.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.060
Additionally,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
automatic payments will be done to energy suppliers on the basis of energy supplied to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.950
energy buyers.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.910
For better understanding,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.750
let's take a real life scenario.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.880
Let's as you that the person has photovoltaic solar panels installed on the rooftop off his

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.250
home.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.740
These for the whole takes will generate electricity using solar energy and in case surplus

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.060
electricity is generated.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.020
It will get stored in when my copy this stored surplus electricity can then be sold to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.750
pierce or to local businesses.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.450
All these energy transactions will be managed and store on the block.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.420
Put this system to work.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.970
Smart meters will be required,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.290
which will record the energy generated and energy consumed based on the energy consumed.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.750
Payment will be triggered by electricity buyers to suppliers,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.770
thus creating a perfect ecosystem.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.210
Who Beidou penetrating off renewable energy for better and option off electric vehicles.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.450
It is very critical who have charging stations easily available and accessible.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.090
Significant electric vehicle prospects have this fear of running out of battery power on

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.160
large distance commutes where there is no electric car charging available.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.640
Lack off easy availability of electric vehicle charging stations,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.080
as compared with traditional fuel stations,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.050
is often a key deciding factor for vehicle buyers,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.170
though a lot of efforts are being put to increase the number of commercial electric vehicle

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.260
charging stations.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.140
But still there is a long way to go before there are enough commercial electric vehicle

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.250
charging stations,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.160
but using blocking an alternative solution is getting implemented To tackle this lack of

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.010
charging infrastructure blocked in based applications are enabling individuals to share the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.160
pirate electric vehicle charges with others using peer to peer electric vehicle charging

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.850
platforms.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.440
Private owners can make the charge is available for public during that times.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.270
They're not being used by them in Britain.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.870
They can,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.480
on some extra side income from their idol charges.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.250
By increasing its utilization.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.340
You think these location based applications drivers off elected vehicles can look for

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.250
available charges in the facility and child their cars before there now don't back to power

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.250
.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.290
Enabling consumers to make a charge is available for public use for a fee.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.900
Can significantly is the number of available charging locations,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.450
which in turn can lead to higher adoption of electric vehicles.
