00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.610
vine Counterfeiting is one of the major challenges faced by Vine industry and Safeway

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.290
Market,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.050
a monster assistant 1,000,000,000 US developed right.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.180
They're in various ways by which fate fine is introduced into the market.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.040
Some officers following relabeling of wine bottles is one of the most common ways through

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.850
which fake minus introduced into the market.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.730
In some cases,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.490
cheaper finds are labeled this expensive wines violent.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.550
Others vines a mislabeled with the famous origin because of the minimum it commands.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.890
For instance,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
French find label on a wine bottle indicates that the wine would be from France.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.900
But actually the original then vine is a different country,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
say spin.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.340
And this is a real scenario,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.010
which came to light recently were billions are Spanish wine bottles were being sold US

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.110
French wine for,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.170
though in some of the cases,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.150
or it's no minus adulterated with some cheap substitutes to increase their profit margins.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700
For instance,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.200
vice have been found to contain his oddest confidence like diet terrain vehicle in order to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.750
increase their sweetness,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.750
so can because may also be used to Massport's and unpleasant and removed the vine,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.000
one of the other prominent ways of fine fraud is so blending off the arsenal fine velvet

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.410
ideal divine that is stupid Toby,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.740
100% pure is blended in various other cheaper vines.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.160
For example,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.960
Ah vine,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.280
with the darker color,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880
is often assumed to be of higher quality.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.390
So blending a dark,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.050
collaborating with the people I doing going in has the market venue off the tip of wine.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.000
To put the check on the vine front,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.870
there needs to the mechanism that can assure customer that divine he's bank is authentic

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.850
and not some cheap counterfeit.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.950
Till now,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.450
there is no soul growth method to establish this fact.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.550
As many loopholes in the current line tracking system,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.200
the 1st 1 being the inefficiency do validated the authenticity off.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.100
The source information says the vice supply chain is quite complex,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.650
involves large number of stakeholders,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.050
and the vine changes multiple hands before it reaches the retailer's.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.750
It is quite physical to reproduce authorities that information at any point of time.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660
Additionally,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.650
there is no efficient method.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.410
Two unidentified counterfeit line waters,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.450
since these waters are always accompanied by faith provenance histories and a lot too

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.560
blocked in technology has the potential to mitigate these issues off the vine,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.250
industry and ensure authenticity and provenance off heat wine bottle produced.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.550
Let's understand how Blockchain will work for divine industry.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.900
All the stakeholders involved in the vine supply chain will be required to register dances

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.660
on the block to network and subsequently were very quiet to Andhra living information on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.570
the block to as why is produced from grips.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.690
Let's start with drip drawers as they're one of the key stakeholders in the vine supply

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.250
chain.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.990
Grab us.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.690
Take care of the great finds on money to the parameters such as temperature.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.590
So I almost two fertilizers that central versus grapes of rape.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.660
They deliver them to divine dream in a blocked inmate system.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.440
The great dress with very quiet.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.700
To upload information about heat,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.660
float off the grapevine Location details the altitude at which the plants are room type of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.410
the vines,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.130
fertiliser requirements,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.760
education requirements and origin.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.950
Ofoto used for the irrigation.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.000
So though the grape growers will also record information about this past eight of these

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.950
creeps through the next link in the chain that is to the manufacturing companies.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.550
Next comes the vine manufacturers who may affect your wine from these grapes.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.480
The information then they very quiet to add on the block.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.860
Tune includes receiving date of graves,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.320
the right ear grapes,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.150
record of chemical contents and internal procedures.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.520
For example,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.640
decant ation form addition,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.470
etcetera performed to transform grapes in divine the wind is responsible for and then

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.250
different each production run with the bat number.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.230
That's the applicable batch numbers.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.010
Additives,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.950
used transportation and storage conditions will also be recorded on the shared led to.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.100
After this stage,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.990
the vine is sent to but distributor's,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.850
which will also be recorded on the Blockchain along with the dispatch information.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.690
Ah,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.190
but distributor is responsible for receiving,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.920
storing,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.770
processing,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.600
sampling.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.350
Analyzing on dispatching the ball coin.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.880
Vin Divino drives the bike distributed,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.030
verifies the supply information,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.060
records all the information,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.270
including the amount of wine receipt,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.410
and then take samples for testing and analysts is irrespective of the divine buses or phase

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.050
the analysts is the results of ayn analysts.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.180
Is will be a storm on the Blockchain.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.700
In case the vine is rejected,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.940
the vine is returned to the source for the vine that has passed.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.320
Ennis's do distinct processes are performed first,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.870
but when you stood and dispatched without any blending on any other processing the bats

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.850
number in this case remains seem.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.570
All vine blending is performed that involves blending off different vines and then

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.500
dispatching the new blend in bulk.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.950
Fine.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.950
The complete information about these processes will be recorded on the Blockchain,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.550
a new batch,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.820
numbers and located,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.450
which is different from any other bats number using the blending process.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:19.270
Then the bulk line is sent to a transit celo or a Peco in different kinds of containers

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.250
that can be identified with a unique would located by the bulk distributor.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.350
They're all over transit.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.470
Celo is almost similar to that.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.850
That's about distributor.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.050
He sent batches of bulk line to a filler or tobacco.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.140
He is responsible for receiving,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.990
storing,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.940
dispatching,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.890
processing,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.750
sampling and analyzing the ball coin.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:49.870
Each container sent is I don't defend with a unique number on associated quantity of wine

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.860
in leaders.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.850
All of this information will be recorded on the bloc team.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.980
Next comes a filler,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.930
or tobacco.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.890
Who receives the vines on the boat distributor?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.900
What transit Celo and fills it into different containers such as bottles,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.150
bags or kids,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:14.350
says the identification and labelling off each fine is done and vestige therefore it is

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.890
very important to ensure the consistency off the label information with the records stored

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.280
on the Blockchain for that particular batch of fine during this step.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.520
Ah,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.750
unique one will be allocated to each vine bottom.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:36.990
The next step is the packaging all these wine bottles into cartons and pallets and then

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.540
dispatching them to the finished consist of you Do Ah Finished consisted.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.030
Butor will record the details about receiving,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.770
storing,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.800
dispatching and elementary off the finished groups Act vestige.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.180
If any re backing off the labeling is required,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.620
then these details will also be stored on the block to from the distributor,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.290
the finished corpse and then dispatched to the retailer's after receiving finished goods

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.470
from distributors.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.450
Retailers sell these to the end consumers.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.810
They have been quite a record.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.000
The received items,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.690
inventor details and sales information on the ledger ven a bottle or a cartoonist owned.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.130
The information will be recorded on the Blockchain so that it is not possible to use the

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.350
same label again.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.510
The consumer is the final ing in the wind supply chain.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.150
Who comes use this fine,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:38.860
therefore should have full rights to know about completely new of the line he's going with

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.650
the implementation of Locked in,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:46.070
he will be able to see all the information that was recorded on the digital letter

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.920
throughout it soon since everybody is assigned a unique I.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.390
D.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:56.400
The consumer can easily trace back the complete Tony of Divine by scanning the court to a

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.010
smartphone all by entering the unique i.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.950
D on the brand's website.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.160
After receiving the product i d.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.730
The system first identifies the batch of the vine and then traces back all information

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.830
recorded by different stakeholders.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.650
For that corresponding batch,

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.320
says the details off a soul vine also recorded on the Blockchain,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.670
it is not possible to sell another wine bottle with the same idea.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.110
Thus,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.650
the proposed system makes wine counterfeiting almost impossible.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:35.030
This is whole Block two and shows transparency and security in the vine supply tree.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:40.510
Other advantages that locked in technology can offer to fine industry.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.850
I was following health invalidating shipping temporary too.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:51.130
The vitamin infection takes special care in maintaining control conditions to protect them

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.250
and affected vine.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.510
Similarly,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.640
at the other end of the supply chain,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.850
a consumer takes special care of the product by storing it under pre defined controlled

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.580
conditions because I wanted change in the environmental conditions can change the

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.750
perceivable characteristics off the vine.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.130
For instance,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:16.050
optimal temperature for storing white wine is between cardinal 15 C.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.720
I'm for saving.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.550
It is between 10 to 20 C it.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.050
But if the temperature rises about the desire fringe,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.050
it can deterrent the vine quality and change its color.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.300
In the current scenario,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.860
there is no effective matter to ensure that the vines remained in its desired conditions

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.960
during its transportation blocked.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.190
And I auntie can offer a solution to this issue I have.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.580
The sensors can be attached to wine bottles and cartons,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.260
which can then capture the temperature of wine during its transportation and uploaded on

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.050
the lottery.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.020
Consequently,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.820
any change in the temporary two will also be recorded on the bloc.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.280
Team this through blocked in detail.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.580
Every stakeholders can ensure if the Vine State and its try temperature during its

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.450
transportation find ways have traditionally been bought based on trust for a particular

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.150
manufacturer or a brand,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.250
although the by shells out the fearsome off money to buy a fine line.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.530
But he himself is no Mr Validated.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:29.780
If the wine has been made straw opening under the desired conditions during the aging

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.770
process off Fine undergoes a series of different chemical reactions to improve it stays and

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.550
quality.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:43.290
These reactions can easily be affected by physical and chemical changes taking place in the

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.150
environment.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.910
The stories conditions should be appropriate for vine maturation,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.180
including the desired humidity,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.710
temperature and darkness during the wine.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.130
Maturation off.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:02.020
I should be kept in the dark conditions because the UV light can damage fine but degrading

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.620
stable organic compounds present in it just as directs and like a negatively affect your

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.180
skin.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.550
It can also damage fine wines.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.350
Another very critical factor for aging off fine is temperature.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:21.350
Very commended temperature for aging vines lies the think cardinal 15 C,

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.420
though if temperatures increased,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.510
maturation process speeds up,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.850
but it causes undesirable changes in the vine is been.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.450
Therefore,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.940
it is very important to maintain the recommended temperature range for perfect maturation

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.650
of the vine.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:45.950
The next important activities Humidity 60 to 70% humidity is a station to ensure that the

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.450
vine ages gracefully,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.210
the humidity levels are too low.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:56.430
The Vine Bottle Corp will dry out and become brittle because of which ever sneak into the

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:02.970
bottle and will oxidize the wine that's spoiling its taste and in case the humidity levels

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.930
are too high.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.350
It also has underside herbal effects on its eating.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.900
But the question here is,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.950
How can a customer no and validate all of this information?

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.750
I want a along been blocked in has a solution to this issue.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:26.350
Heidi Senses will be installed to sense all of these conditions under which a wine ages and

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.860
these are.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.520
The sensors will then record this details on the bloc team Subsequently,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.230
Falcons.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:38.580
You might be able to see all this information regarding the vine aging best standing,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:45.500
the unique i D present on a vine bottle so fine manufacturers it would now be much easier

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.350
to keep their invent tree and to optimum level,

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.220
says all the sales information will now be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.550
This one important design manufacturers to bridge the demand and supply gap in the market.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.960
I let the same thing will ensure that they do not hold excessive inventory.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.650
They still convert someone into losses for them.
