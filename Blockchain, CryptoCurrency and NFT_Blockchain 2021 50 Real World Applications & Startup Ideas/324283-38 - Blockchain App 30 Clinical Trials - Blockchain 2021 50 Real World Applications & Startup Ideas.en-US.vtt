00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
behind every new drug discovery,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.340
their enormous number of researchers who conduct clinical trials and enormous number of

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.710
people who volunteered to be a part of these clinical trials to prove the safety and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.950
efficacy off the truck.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.390
And after going through such rigorous processes and approvals,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.550
a drug gets approval from FT.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.950
Therefore faces to every clinical trial.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.600
Phase one.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.070
Clinical trials assess the safety off the drug in a small group of healthy volunteers,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.550
say 2200 face to clinical trials involved on 300 patients.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.350
These patients are evenly divided into two groups.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.530
One group of the population off volunteers receives experimental drug and the other group

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.750
disease placebo.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.650
This helps the investigators,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.640
farmer companies and a deal to understand the effectiveness of the new drug.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.340
Around 1/3 off the experimental drugs successfully complete both face when Anthony's two

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:11.370
trains Phase three clinical trials is a large scale testing that involves several 1000

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.150
patients.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.000
This face testing provides more total understanding off the drug and its adverse side

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.690
effects.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.230
About 50% of the drugs that entered this phase three clinical trials are able to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.290
successfully complete it verse.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.440
The faces completed the farmer company can request FDA approval for marketing the drug.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.520
Phase four studies are done after the drug has been approved for the consumer Sin phase

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.010
four clinical trial studies suggest How will the drug books,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.950
when used with other treatments,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.450
some rare side effects of the drug may only be found in large groups of people,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.460
says Forster.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.960
This can also result in a drug or device being taken off the market or restrictions off

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.030
youth being imposed on it if it is found to be ineffective and impacting the quality off

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.250
life of patients.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.450
But there are many challenges in conducting clinical research and clinical trials.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.470
The biggest challenges.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.950
Data report disability.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.730
This may be due to several letters research,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.750
misconduct or fraud that undermines the research quality.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.630
Inefficiencies in clinical trial.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.750
Data management is another major pain point.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.630
This leads to treatment at least less conducive results and sometimes even in the complete

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.050
failure off a trial that could have succeeded had it been managed more efficiently.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.890
The interval between initials any contesting and product approval has been estimated to an

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.250
average of eight years,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.750
with only one in six drugs ultimately obtaining approval.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.450
The average cost of successfully developing a single drug is about $2 billion.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.860
Many dreads do not receive approval,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.040
not because they're unsafe are ineffective but because the information supplied this

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.490
unsatisfactory to prove the efficacy of federal anti blocked in technology locked in

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.450
technology can have a greater impact on sharing on tracking off detail.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.290
The sheer distributed letter can help to keep a record off all the data interactions that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.350
occurred during a clinical study.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.000
This will lead to an increased credibility in the clinical research,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.590
as in many cases,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.460
the efforts are undermined because off civil frauds implementation off lock in would be a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.550
step towards transparency.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.460
This would help to improve trust within the research communities on between research

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.550
institutions and patients.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.030
First and foremost,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.210
all they even seen,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.350
a clinical research can be tracked through block to this will eliminate data falsification

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.550
on data beautification cases.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.090
The block Children record and time stamp.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.560
All the information,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.140
like researchers involved in the study designed protocols sample size way off.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.260
Administering the drug to patients will data collection on data analysts is and in case at

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.040
a later phase during the study,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.700
the research of wants to change the sample size or want to revise the protocol.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.950
All this information will be fully documented and easily accessible on the Blockchain.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.500
Eating.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.650
Every transaction related to clinical research will be time stamped on the block tune.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.340
It will also enable the researchers to manage their data in a more efficiently before

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.620
clinical trials begin.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.350
It is mandatory to take the consent off a patient.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.870
The research protocols should also be in accordance with the guidelines off the regulatory

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.550
bodies.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.210
According to empty,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.720
around 10% of clinical results,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.680
trains have issues related to consent collection from patients,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.780
failure to obtain written consent on approved forms,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.350
expired consent,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.950
consent form without it and failure to get re consent to revise protocol.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.430
Even the documents order also reported,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.620
for example,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.650
backdating the consent forms.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.550
Taking consent is crucial for the safety off patients,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.550
according to a report in 2016 and energetic killed a patient,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.940
the investigation proved that re consent was not sort from the patient before and mystery

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.050
drug to him when the major neurological side effects of the truck were reported in some

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.850
patients,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.870
even the re consent has to be taken from a patient.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.390
If the protocol has been redesigned in a block tin based system.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.640
All the information about the drugs designed protocols revised for two calls as well as

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.350
consent and re consent forms will be stored on the block to patients can exist.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.080
All this information through the shared led to besides different ensure patient safety and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.550
protection of the rights.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.760
A smart contract will be executed there never any change in the protocol.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.550
Locals on the consent form will be sent to the patient for his re consent.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.530
After getting the re consent,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.480
the patient will get automatically enrolled for clinical trial.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.220
Now the proof of existence of consent Andriy Consent will be available to all the

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.240
stakeholders,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.840
including investors.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.510
Pharmaceutical companies,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.750
research organizations on regulatory bodies involved in clinical trials.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.550
Blocking can make it possible to track all patient doctor encounters.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.150
Still did all the clinical trial results are not reported,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.240
but with the implementation of blocking,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.950
any such data will be recorded on the shared ledger and can also be reviewed by other

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.850
researchers.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:26.440
Recruiting people for clinical trials is a major task which accounts for nearly one thought

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.750
off the total time laying off a clinical trial.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.290
The patient it is largely secured in siloed individual databases with limited

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.050
interoperability on transferability.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.450
This makes a recruitment off patients very difficult.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:48.980
Pharma companies have to reach out to physician offices individual on attempt to recruit

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.750
patients.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.650
It is also very difficult to find sufficient number of patients,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.250
many clinical trials candid late because of insufficient number of patients.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.480
Patients who may be interested in going for clinical trials on largely una veer off such

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.450
opportunities.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.930
According to a study by the Journal of Community Oncology,

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:18.490
only 16% of cancer patients knew that clinical trials were an option for them at the time

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.750
they were considering treatment options.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:28.750
It means that around 85% of the patients had no idea that they can explore the treatment

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.880
options offered.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.450
But these clinical trials this dichotomy,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.870
resulting financial losses for the clinical trial administrators and missed opportunities

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:45.980
for patients to try These new therapies blocking these distributed ledgers can address this

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.850
issue of patient recruitment.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:53.220
Patients who are willing to go for clinical trials will be stayed on a distributed data.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.550
Pees on drug companies can directly reach them on recruit them for the clinical trials,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:06.590
thus skipping the Hesser to visit physicians personally they can reach last numbers off

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.640
potential participants and can't get enough information about them to contact on recruit

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:12.950
them.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.850
This can speed up the recruitment thing.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:22.870
The distributed ledger technology can be proactive for drug companies to prove that they're

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.050
compliant with all legal on human rights issues.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:32.430
Because the complete timestamp procedure off performing clinical trials will be available

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:39.620
on the block to the respective organizations can easily verify that no an article and

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.750
illegal means are being used by farmer companies for these strikes,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.280
this thinking,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.850
trust and transparency in the system.
