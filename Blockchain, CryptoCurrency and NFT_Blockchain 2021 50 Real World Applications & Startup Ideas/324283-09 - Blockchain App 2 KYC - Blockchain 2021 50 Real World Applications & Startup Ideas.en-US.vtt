00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
knowing that home their trading is one of the most important jobs off banks and other

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.240
financial institutions,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.810
like an insurance company stock exchange,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.550
etcetera.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.130
These financial institutions rely on gave I see or know your customer process,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.850
as this process provides him with a sense of security.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.260
For,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.850
though gave us a verification also ensures the authenticity of the other parties involved.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.520
The cave I see processes initiated when the customer intends to work with a financial

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.300
institution,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.090
for example,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.650
of bank.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.070
Initially,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.050
the financial institution under custom agree on certain terms off relationship.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.710
Then the customer sensor required documents like i D proves credit card information utility

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.070
bills,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.950
etcetera to Dad Institution to contact the cave acidification trusses.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.010
After receiving these documents,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.760
the institution analyzes them and generate certification where the customer is either

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.050
validated or ejected to avail the services.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.240
The process is repeated every time a customer initiates a relationship with any financial

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.050
institution.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.650
For example,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.040
if a customer wants to open an account in Banke,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.680
he has to exchange his documents with Banky and has to go through there.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.780
Gave a Cyprus is after receiving his documents,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.590
then given verified them,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.750
and after that he is allowed to open an account in Banke.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.860
But when he intends to work with other banks,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.150
let's say Bang B and Banksy.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.520
He has toe again,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.440
exchanges documents and has to again Goto gave us a verification process with respective

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.750
banks be dancing.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.720
These multiple validations are time consuming and at the same time lead show unnecessary

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.050
increase in the cost of care by civilization.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.710
So quite naturally,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.150
there is a need for a solution that can make the gave I see process easier.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.040
Blocked in technology can provide the required solution and can act is a single point of

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.450
truth in this case,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.900
after the implementation of blockage in a customer will be required to undergo gave I see

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.850
process only once this gave.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.790
I see information on validation will then be stored on the Blockchain and later on he

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.770
initiate this cave.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.550
I see verification result with the other financial institutions with which intends to book

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.210
Now let's discuss in detail how gave us a verification will happen on the Blockchain To

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.400
understand this.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.140
Let's come to our example If the customer approaches Banky for the first time the bank,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.500
every contempt the court gave.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.150
I see verification trusses.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.120
The customer will share his documents with the bank,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.350
which will then be analyzed by the bank.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.260
Worst bank analyzes these documents.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.100
These will be stored as digitally signed documents in the smart contract off that customer

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.450
created by Banky.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.790
For though this will also include the result of the court gave icy verification done for

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.870
that customer,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.380
that is,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.680
that the very fight or rejected this might conduct for the customer will also hold details

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.950
about other banks,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.190
all financial institutions that will village it gave.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250
I see off that customer in the future.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.310
Additionally,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.040
each off the documents off the customer that have been used for gave.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.250
I say verification will be stored in local databases off the banks.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.610
They're never the customer in dance to vote with Bank B.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.970
He gets here the address off his original smart contract.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.210
Various gave us a verification Documents on verification result by Banke has been stood.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.550
The verification result by Bank B will also be stored in the customer smart contract.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.480
Does the customer smart contract will contain the complete information about the financial

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.050
institutions with whom he has booked?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.480
So you can see that doctor in technology enables the same customer to vote with different

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.860
banks while the exchange of documents on the court gave.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.450
I say verification trusses needs to be done only once.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.080
Go.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.050
Being money laundering isn't big talent for banks.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.970
The criminals on large amounts off money from illegal activities.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.940
Such a structure faking deadest activity.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.350
The excavation drives kidnapping etcetera.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.490
Now,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.290
in order to avoid detection from legal authorities,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.640
these criminals perform money launching to create an illusion that the money they often

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.350
from illegal activities originated from a legitimate source.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.990
A bank or a financial institution is used at some point of these money laundering

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.140
procedures for converting the black money into white one of the ways that paper for money

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.210
laundering is their first dividing the accumulated some off illegal money into smaller

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.050
chunks and then depositing these mullah chunks into the accounts of unconnected depositors

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.050
.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.360
Therefore,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.690
it is obligated for any government or financial institution to create a regulatory

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.790
framework that makes it difficult for individuals to convert money obtained from illegal

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.250
activities into legitimate assets.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.110
The mainstream financial ecosystem has been developing such of a then there numerous checks

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.160
and balances that can prevent money laundering and know your customer all gave.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.380
I say verification trusses is one of the most important checks implemented by these

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.150
institutions in this direction.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.660
But the biggest challenge gave us a verification trusses.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.750
Is it increased regulatory cost that is born with these financial institutions?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.240
In fact,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.120
it is estimated that the yearly cost that financial institutions spending gave us a

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.250
verification is that on $60 million.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.900
Moreover,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.690
these causal augmented by the fines live.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.030
I didn't financial institutions do to them misconduct with regard to anti money laundering

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.850
and gave I see revolutions.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.550
These cost approximately Toby about $10 billion.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.420
Additionally,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.350
Cave I say verifications that time consuming and painful experience for the customers to

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.340
Tang feeling blocked in technology has the potential to solve this issue related to cave,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.550
I say verification.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.850
If all financial institutions and are blocked in gave,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.360
I said data of the customers can be shared across financial institutions in a secure,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.250
transparent and seamless mellow.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.750
The benefits are blocked in technology for financial institutions are huge.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.710
Specifically,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.710
the technology enables the creation off a chronological decentralised interbank ledger,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.800
using financial institutions can verify the result of the cave acidification trusses that

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.150
has already been conducted for a customer,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.080
thus avoiding the need for conducting redundant gave.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.720
I see verifications more drivel.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.160
The cost of gave a C process can be minimized and can be shared proportionally among the

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.450
financial institutions that vote with a specific customer.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.470
This technology will be very helpful for the regulatory bodies.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.190
Since then,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.400
Distributed Ledger provide the transparent record of the cave I see process that financial

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.450
institutions had undergone prior to working with the customers.
