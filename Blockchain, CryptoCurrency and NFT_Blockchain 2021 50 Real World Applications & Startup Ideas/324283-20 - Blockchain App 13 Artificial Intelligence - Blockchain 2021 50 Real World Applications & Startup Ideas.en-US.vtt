00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
whether you know it or not.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.130
But you are interacting with AI systems day in and day out when you search on your favorite

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.060
search engine or when you shop online from your favorite Ekho Moskvy upside.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.290
The suggestions that you see our business,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.650
artificial intelligence,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.350
artificial intelligence and Blockchain have been referred to as the major disruptors off

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.950
the coming indicate by many of them the state sports.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.630
In this lecture,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.710
let us examine how an interplay of these two technologies can be an irresistible

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.350
proposition for the stakeholders.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.300
The first major advantage off using Blockchain with artificial intelligence will be the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.850
rise of better Data motors.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.940
He I request data and know just data.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.170
It requires a massive amount of data.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.270
In the current scenario,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
business models created by A I depend on the data produced by these businesses and their

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.450
partners.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.190
The first thing that comes to mind when we hear the word data sharing is famous.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.160
So quite naturally,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.650
when it comes to data sharing by these businesses for the system to work,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.850
there is always a risk of data bridge abuse and misuse off the organizational later.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.350
But for a the more data you feed the more level insights and predictions it produces.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.990
Therefore,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.380
the requirement for a system to work in a business setting is an unlimited barrier free

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.450
access to information from the complete business ecosystem.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.560
For granting this uninterrupted data access to the AI system that required data security

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.050
assurance can be provided by the Blockchain to these businesses,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.130
the stakeholders would be more comfortable to share that element data since it will reside

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.260
in a decentralized network with no single entity being,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.450
it's on data from all the relevant stakeholders and departments can be integrated with a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.080
common data mining platform and then the 11 insights can be accepted by the analytical.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.350
Do Further smart contracts would be implemented would be find a way of usage off the sheer

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.750
gator,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.390
hence mitigating any chance of data losing its credibility or its value.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.250
Once A systems gets access to this uninterrupted decentralised full of data,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.190
it can deliver smart insights based on the study patterns,

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.150
behaviors and other relevant aspects of the lit.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.450
This large pool of data will ensure that the inside more closer to the reality,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.260
thus delivering real business value to all the stakeholders in board.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.780
Second,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.850
he advantage we we better data insights and secure personal litter.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.250
Bloating is a safe heaven for storing personal and private Daytop individuals,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.440
which meant smartly processed by that be,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.450
A systems can provide really great insights.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.160
For instance,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.750
insights from a smart A health care system can tried an exact diagnosis off your issue

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.050
based on your medical scans and medical reports,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.750
or the movie recommendations by Netflix or Amazon based on your history in these scenarios

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.750
.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.210
That data fed into the air systems off these service providers is very personal and should

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.150
remain secure in all possible scenarios.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.350
These service providers spend a huge sum of money who secured the customer's private data

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.650
as any breach off this data would wreck havoc for them legally as well as financially.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.940
But with blocked in,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.350
that data is stored in an encrypted city.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.680
And to secure this data,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.850
only parrot is need to be kept safe,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.830
thus leading to about a security management off consumers data.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.590
But these service providers,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.550
along with backer consumer insights,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.450
one of the very critical advantage off using location with a will be better understanding

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.850
other the seasons made by a assistance.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.010
Hey,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.070
I can assess a huge volume of data with a large set off independent variables based on

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.620
their relevance to achieve the desired results and because of the huge complexity in gold.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.900
Many times the humans are unable to understand the logic used by these air systems to reach

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.340
a specific result or inside,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.270
but with voting,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.350
this is made by a will be recorded on the shared ledger on a data point by Data Point bases

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.350
.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.240
This will make it much easier for US humans to order that decision off air systems by

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.550
looking at the decision tree.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.030
This transparency and that this isn't making process off a robot will increase the level of

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.950
trust in them and their decisions.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.750
Another advantage will be smarter and aspirin Predictions A helps businesses to predict the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.350
art movie this plan on unplanned events before the actual ease,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.710
though many times these predictions may be incorrect due to 40 data generated by the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.950
systems or sometimes due to defective analytical models used by AI Systems.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.250
But with the implementation of blocked in technology,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.050
it would be easier to attend to get that data generated and the working off the analytical

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.250
matters as that 11 parameters could be regularly monitored on a decent place ist this.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.180
Increase probability off The availability of Gaddafi data sets will lead to better

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.750
predictions by the air systems.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.450
For example,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.560
in tears off e commerce and physical retail outlets.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.000
Has and wish the shopping experience for show,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.150
purse and monetization for years.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.410
The smart production systems and analytic spectral is being implemented by many of these

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.150
three layers.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.390
You're a less can predict the best suited product for the customer even before the customer

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.900
walks in the store or visits there only imported.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.410
But there are many grey areas where these a prediction systems have to vikan

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:55.120
unauthenticated or unratified source of data to give these relations many times they don't

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.120
.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.450
The supplies for the quality can't be verified in the current ski movie tickets.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.450
Imagine the scene that you,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.820
with a system,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.890
predicts a product from one of these suppliers has best suited for a particular customer or

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.950
site of customers,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.250
and the product quality is not a good Emma.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.250
This could lead to a poor customer experience and a bad band application for the retail.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.890
But with the implementation of Blockchain claims about the quality and specs off a product

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.610
can be easily verified as the complete information about the sourcing transportacion on its

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.190
production would be available.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.050
On the sheer legend,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.990
this makes the supply more accountable,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.940
which results in only the best quality products are available for sale by this retailing

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.650
companies.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.750
Next advantage of marrying blocked in with a will be the birth of data marketplaces.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.050
The rise of location will give rise to personal data marketplaces.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.150
As the data stored in location is secure,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.870
users will start storing their personal later and preferences on the block so quiet.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.410
Actually,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.150
the adoption of Blokhin would first create a cleaner and better organized personal data.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.620
The Natural Progression Toe.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.910
This event would be selling off this organized data on data marketplaces to be consumed by

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.860
various companies specializing in a remotely and inside Jen Trish This easy of liberally

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.090
off diverse data set.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.650
Believe your eyes off many small piers.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.420
Every neutralize the competitive advantage off big signs who currently Amona P order uses

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.880
it last but not the least,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.850
the interplay of location and a believed to increase trust on autonomous virtual agents.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.260
Sometime in the future,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.940
a power or don't know most virtual agents will be able to perform tasks without human

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.450
intervention.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.580
You must have seen many sci fi movies.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.950
When machines take over the world of humans,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.770
though that is the extreme end of the spectrum,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.270
but still a plausible to avoid any such catastrophic event.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.440
A set of rules directives,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.980
instructions that are secure tamper proof and no owned by a single entity will need to be

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.450
defined.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:09.350
Blocked in along with smart corn trips have the perfect solution for this.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.150
With the implementation of smart contracts,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.050
predetermined conditions will be defined for these air systems to operate.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.470
This will reduce the probability of any faulty operational outcome by these order.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:27.010
Nomis virtual agents as the whole system would be going by smart contracts deciding on

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.690
decentralized and immutable ledger.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.870
In such a transparent,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.720
secure and control system,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.670
the probability of things going haywire at any point of time are minimal even without any

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.550
human intervention.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.110
Therefore,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.270
we can safely assume that implementation of Blockchain with A I can create the future where

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:45.270
,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.100
instead of imagining those dreadful sci fi movie scenes,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.450
we can imagine a much better and secure human machine collaboration
