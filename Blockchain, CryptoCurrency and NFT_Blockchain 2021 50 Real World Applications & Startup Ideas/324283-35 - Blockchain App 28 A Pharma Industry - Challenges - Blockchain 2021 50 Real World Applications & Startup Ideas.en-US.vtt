00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
trust is the foundation of the medical profession.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.790
When we fallen,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.160
we trust advice off a doctor on.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.600
We consume the prescribed medicine with the trust that the medicine will help us recover

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.650
from her illness.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.000
And by and large they do.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.270
However,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.050
neck may not always be true.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.560
The medicine you bought might actually appear counterfeit with visual appearance similar to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.650
the actual one.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.630
Some fraudsters out of their person interests and monetary gains,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.450
exploit the Lacuna Zoff Pharma supply teaching to introduce these fake drugs in the system

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.450
.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.440
Here in this class,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.450
we will study the challenges that far mine does is facing today.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.010
Then they will see how blocking is going to disturb this industry and bring about a better

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.400
time shift in how it books the farmers ability is quite complex and has multiple entry

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.050
points.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.320
Even then,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.250
there is no robust and secure system to track the movement of these drugs.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.100
Tracking these drugs can be challenging due to many reasons,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.590
like companies today no longer work inside those andare not limited by the physical

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.350
boundaries.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.650
The trade internationally on did a part of the global network.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.280
For though the farmers ablation is highly fragmented has various stages on involves

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.790
multiple hands from product manufacturers to product packages to logistic partners and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.050
finally to a pharmacy from where V by these drugs.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.510
Still,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.650
the current system in farmers placing is not interoperable and unified,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.190
very drudging his hands.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.240
There is no system for the receiving stakeholder to verify that the drug he received is an

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.450
original product from the manufacturers.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.960
Therefore,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.590
an increased number of stakeholders and not in the supply chain results in a complex system

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.150
with very less control and nearly no transparency.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.560
One of the biggest pain point for these stakeholders is to track the products journey that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.450
can reveal its point of origin.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.910
It's real time location at any point of time on the route it has taken to a driver.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.570
The pharmacy.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.930
Additionally,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.630
several drugs remain active below a particular temporary to and therefore during its

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.130
journey,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.000
it is mandated lamenting the desired temperature change for the job to remain active and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.750
effective.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.030
Any fluctuation in the temperature above the desired range can hamper the effectiveness of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.150
the drug and make it unfit for medical use.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.850
And there is no way for the consumer all the company to know if the drug has been

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.730
maintained on the property and preacher throughout.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.600
The journey on dissed elective in this or base of light instructor are manufacturers has no

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.670
clear visibility into the inventor of distributors and wholesalers doesn't becomes a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.250
tedious task for the manufactured toe efficiently manages inventing to a level where any

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.300
spikes in demand can be handled without an issue.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.450
Drug shortage leads to delay treatments off patients,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.160
and this poses a significant threat to public health.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.350
The issue of drug shortage demands attention on collaboration from everyone involved in

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.450
providing these life saving medicines to patients.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.340
This includes pharmaceutical companies producing medications,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.490
wholesalers,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.660
distributors,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.550
pharmacies and health care providers.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.680
But because of this complex supply chain,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.050
there is lack of coordination among the players to better communicate their demands.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.360
The manufacturers don't get accurate information about the demand on time that results in

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.350
delayed man infection and supplying off drugs.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.410
Short ISM drugs can even force healthcare providers and patients to shift to alternate

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.930
drugs.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.360
That,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.970
in turn,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.150
can lead to a less effective treatment.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.330
Sometimes certain drugs lead a serious side effects,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.710
and therefore removal of such drugs from the market becomes very crucial to protect the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.900
customers in such a scenario manufactures a required to withdraw the drug from the market

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.550
on the ugliest possible.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.850
But the biggest challenge in such a scenario is effect then there is no direct contact

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.550
between the company and the consumers who have bought this joke.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.750
Drop recall announcements are generally made tolling or to advertisements.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.260
Therefore,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.780
customers are subject to their of your NUS,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.950
and they're very high chances that he can miss out the announcement off this drug record.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.960
It is very challenging for a regular to body like FD to monitor and regulate various

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.910
players involved in this,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.650
a plating.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.440
Therefore,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.160
it becomes very difficult to we don't the illegal companies who claim to me legal entities

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.450
through false paperwork.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.540
Counterfeit trucks is one of the biggest challenges that this industry faces to to the void

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.540
.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.800
Contrave Job Market Is Valued Over $200 Billion Counterfeit drugs are responsible for

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.900
killing more than 500,000 people every year,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.050
according to W H O estimates,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.150
one out of every 10th medical products sold,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.500
including pills,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.780
vaccines and diagnostic kits this fake or substandard,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.890
according to European Pharmaceutical Review.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.690
I don't 30% of drugs sold in developing countries are fake.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.400
Do don't this growing challenge of contra fitting?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.840
Many countries have introduced strict regulations for tracking off the drug in a farmer

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.720
supply teaching,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.450
for instance,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.680
Drugs Ablation Security Act passed by the US government,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.220
which meant it all.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.750
The drug manufacturers to provide a unique idea on the drug for reading out the counterfeit

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.350
drugs.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:29.640
Now let's discuss how counterfeit drugs affect our health in the counterfeit drug contains

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.100
no active ingredient.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.450
That drug fails to treat the patients and therefore harms them indirectly.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.930
In case of contra fit antibiotics.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.720
Patients don't respond to first line drug,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.620
which makes their physician to prescribe them a stronger antibiotic.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.860
This unwanted use off a stronger antibiotic lead.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.550
So antibiotic resistance in these patients,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.700
the second scenario use if the counterfeit drugs have harmful ingredients like toxic pains

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.700
.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.200
Contaminated water colored eyes,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.210
floor Vicks boric acid antifreeze,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.950
its literal.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.390
This leads to an adverse effect on the health of the consumer.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.750
On proved to be fatal in many cases.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.640
For instance,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.550
more than 500 Children around the world died after consuming counterfeit cough syrup

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.010
containing an ant.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.930
If is agent a clink like oh,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.980
in another case,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.250
counterfeit inhalers for the treatment of patriotic lung disease were found to contain

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.250
contaminated bacteria that hospitalized him.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:40.540
Wrong concentration off the active ingredient in the drug also has adverse effects on the

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.710
health of patients,

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.910
counterfeit drugs,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.900
hiding the brand and inferences of patientsrights off legitimate pharmaceutical

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.950
manufacturers.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:57.080
Contra fittest just copied appearance of the products and take advantage of the money that

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.820
has gone in the research on development off these original and authentic medicines and for

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.560
consumers to This is a big menace as counterfeit drugs lead to both health and financial

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.500
loss for them.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.090
When they pay their hard earned money for these fake products on that do with a substantial

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.350
threat to the health.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.110
Now the question arises.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:25.510
How do going to fit drugs enter into the supply teaching as discussed earlier?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.870
You,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.030
The farmer supply chain is quite complex,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.350
and the drug changes multiple hands before reaching a pharmacy near you.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.370
It may happen that one or more parties in the supply chain are unethical and I involved in

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.760
illegal practices.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.350
They may introduce counterfeit contaminated products in the supply teaching to increase

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.000
their profits.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.270
You,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.430
for any talk to be manufactured,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:58.110
the basic requirement is the Romiti to it may happen that the raw material itself is coming

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.450
from a nun authentic.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.150
All answer to for tools.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:08.450
Certain companies on trading partners claim to be so different legal entities By using

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.920
false and forged papers and using these certifications,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.910
they can easily introduce fake drugs into the supply.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.410
Teaching,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:23.030
online distribution and Internet sales are the most common vase for the counterfeit drugs.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:30.910
To enter into this a plating and reach the consumers according to W to more than 50% of the

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.980
drug sold all night.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.630
And counterfeit drug shortages can also open the doors for counterfeit drugs to enter into

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.450
the market.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.610
In addition to the above reasons,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.090
social stigma is also another reason,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.280
which makes it easier for counterfeit drugs to enter into the market.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.030
For instance,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.760
Viagra is one of the most widely produced counterfeit drugs.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.750
Patients may be too ashamed to concerned a physician for this truck,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.590
therefore de ville unknowingly by the fake versions off this drug on Lee.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.450
Conditions that favour counterfeiting are faith.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.450
Drugs are relatively cheap to an effect.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:11.760
You,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.310
you will be shocked to know manufacturing fake drugs is a more lucrative business than that

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:23.490
off narcotics because of higher profit margins and lower risk in developing countries.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:29.750
Lack off adequate regulation on enforcement is a reason that Anchorages contra features to

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.750
fade drugs.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.430
Even in the developed countries,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:40.820
the penalties for counterfeiting are inadequate and Alesci view lack of transparency and

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.050
overall complexity off the farmers supply chain makes it very easier for the counterfeit

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.150
drugs to gain entry into the market.
