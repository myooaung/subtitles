00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
In the current scenario,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.590
getting payment from insurance companies is a big pain point for the patients and health

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.450
care providers.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.720
At the same time,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.860
it is also difficult for an insurance company toe valued the verity of the claims submitted

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.550
because of the rising medical insurance forts.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.500
The culprit for all off these issues is today's complicated,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.150
inefficient and outdated medical and payment system.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.790
Millions of dollars and an unaccountable number off ours are vested due to claim matters

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.950
and unsettled disputes owing to the lack of transparency in the system.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.950
Whenever the medical claim is submitted to any health insurance provider,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.620
he's required to inspect and analyze a lot off information to Eller.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.490
The authenticity off that plane and the reason for this is the increasing number of

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.550
fraudulent claims.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.530
The whole process off claims of mission and approval is very exhaustive and takes a lot of

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.850
time.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.550
The health care providers have to do a lot of paperwork before submitting a claim to the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.180
insurers.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.850
This leads to an increased probability off human ADDers because off which there's a good

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.380
chance that some fields may not be correctly feel in the claim for,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.840
and some might even be completely missing in case off in complete submission.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.620
That claim gets rejected by the in shorter and the health care provider has to really share

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.800
the whole process,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
thus leading to a delayed payment cycle and an increased overhead coast.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.370
It may happen that the patient hasn't expired or outdated insurance.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.550
The current system is quite complex and the information is not readily available because of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.300
which it is not always physical.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.200
For health service provider to verify a patient's insurance status before rendering the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.950
services,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.070
let's understand it to a real life scenario.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.550
Steve make with an accident and got admitted to a hospital.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.460
The hospital takes good care of Steve,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.270
and within a couple of days he gets discharged from the hospital.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.930
Now the insurance claim is prepared and submitted by the hospital to Steve's Health

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.470
Insurance.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010
After receiving the claim request,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.570
that insurer verifies the patient's details in its database.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.940
Upon processing the request,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.870
it finds out that the policy is outdated and therefore rejects the claim.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.870
In such a scenario,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.540
the hospital context a patient to know about the latest health insurance company as it is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.270
required to resubmit the claim to the new insurers which again is a Landy process in many

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.150
cases healthcare provider and patient.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.470
Both are not aware off all the conditions and situations that are covered in the insurance

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.650
policy of the patient.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.960
This becomes a major pain point for both parties involved.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
For hospital,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.550
it leads to a wasted time and efforts on filling and submitting the claim.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.740
And for a patient it leads to an extra burden as he's liable to pay the medical bills out

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.970
of his own pocket.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.400
Blocked in technology is the link which has been missing till now and can provide a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.920
required solution for this.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.040
With the implementation of this technology,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.820
all the stakeholders involved will have access to the same information or in other words,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.460
there would be a single version of the truth without any discrepancy is the shared and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.070
distributed.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.530
Ledgett allows all the parties to monitor and analyze the submitted claim,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.420
and the services ended against that team through blocked in a single literally shared among

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.100
the healthcare stakeholders and smart contracts are issued that in court all the conditions

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.050
and situations in which health insurer provides a medical coverage.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.450
These smart contracts get executed when they're defined conditions are fulfilled.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.150
This leads to an improved cash flow due to faster transaction documents.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.510
The only treatment of patients.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.000
Accurate payment of the service provider election in the overhead costs for both health

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.670
care providers and health insurance companies.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.280
When information about patients health insurance is readily available or the shared legend

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.280
,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.730
it becomes easier for health care providers to check the patient's current insurance takers

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.880
and validate the conditions and situations that companies provide.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.560
Coverage for this would even cut down on unnecessary,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.290
has a low filling and submitting claims for an uninsured patient or condition.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.850
And the patient can be directly asked to pay for the medical bills out of his own pocket.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.260
If a patient and this is medical insurer Britain with it,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.550
health care provider can easily access this information by a Blockchain.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.520
This,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.150
in turn,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.950
will help the health care provider to some of the medical claim for dead patient to the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.250
right insurance provider,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.300
thus eliminating the need to resubmit that Lee,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.710
the smart contract shared on the Block 10 provides the claim and reinvestment rules off the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.950
medical insurance.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.590
Proper data format requirements are also provided so as to ensure that the claim form is

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.560
correctly filled before submitting to the insurer.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.940
The health care provider therefore exactly knows what information is required to be filled

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.850
prior to submitting the claims,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.950
thus eliminating the chances off claims to be returned due to missing information or known

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.510
adherence to the required format.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.350
This intern will save the time and effort for both health care providers and insurers.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.220
Let us understand it.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.090
Through an example,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.670
a patient gets admitted to a hospital for his heart surgery as the patient gets admitted,

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.410
and only Landry on the Blockchain is initiated by the hospital for that person.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.650
After the surgery is done,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.900
healthcare providers submitted a claim to the insurer on the block.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.100
To and simultaneously Patient gives excess of the required information to the insurer.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.370
Insurer validates the identity off the patient and the information provided to him.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.560
If all the predetermined conditions are met and the claim is submitted in the correct form

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.560
,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.220
it smart contract gets executed,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.420
which initiates the cash flow.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.450
Does settling the claim Bradley.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.680
The patient's data,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.170
stored with various health care providers and insurance companies,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.150
makes it vulnerable to leaks and theft through blocked in technology.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.740
The patient's data will be stored under decentralized database where the patient will on

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.360
his data.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.790
The tempering and stealing off data is very difficult.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.150
Does making it safe and secure?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.650
Fraud and force claims are one of the biggest challenges that this industry faces.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.200
Though insurance companies have devised various tools and techniques toe award such

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.100
situations.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.850
But fraudsters still find a way to do these insurance.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.750
This,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.430
in turn,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.430
leads to an extra due diligence by the insurer while validating a real claim as well.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.590
But with the implementation off blocked in a single version off,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.150
the truth will be accessible to all the stakeholders involved.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.080
And as a result,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.250
verifying these claims will be a much easier task for the insurer.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.870
Blocked in technology,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.280
with its innate property of being transparent and tempered.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.250
Proof makes it nearly impossible for fraudsters to do the insurance companies.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.350
Blockchain is going to empower and make life easier for the patients.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.450
A key role in making this a reality will be played by the smart contracts.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:47.760
These contracts won't require any manual intervention and will be completely managed to

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.950
rule based operations defined in the court.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:56.700
Let us understand it through aerial escenario ah person met with an accident and died on

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.350
the sport.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.180
In the current scenario to claim the insurance money,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.050
his know many needs to go through Landy and time consuming procedures.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.120
The nominees required to present co pays off various documents toe get that link,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.550
which takes several weeks and sometimes even months.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.300
The person is already in pain due to loss of the deer One and on top off that these

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.760
insurance procedures and processes further aggravates his agony instead of supporting and

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.870
helping him a customer and rolled himself in the insurance plan in order to alleviate this

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.290
pain.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.020
But with such a complex system in place,

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.350
the whole point off insuring life and health becomes useless and ironic.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.590
But with the power off smart contracts,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.380
situations like these can really be simplified.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:51.930
Smart contracts can easily be implemented for Lord dispute claim settlements like in case

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.150
off that of the policyholder.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.750
This contract will ensure an automated payout to the resistor nominee.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.070
This automated processing will reduce the effort involved in filing a claim,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.450
and in turn will lead to a world class customer experience.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.350
When new claims a play for the health insurance,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.260
the providers must collect and validate the concern patients data like his name,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.390
date of birth,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.350
address,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.460
health and economic status to meet the compliance requirements.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.850
Such escape by sea.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.850
This collection of data is a time consuming process.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:34.250
The person has to summon all the documents and providers must review the data to complete

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.750
the verification process.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:43.430
Sometimes the extent of documents and information has to be done multiple times in case any

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.280
required information is missing through blocked in technology,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.100
the whole process can be simplified.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.740
The patient can give permission access to the insurer so that the essential documentation

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.830
required for verification can be easily accessed by then.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:04.260
Sugar Buster in Shorter can efficiently verify the eligibility off a new plane for a

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.550
particular insurance policy in the reduced time frame.
