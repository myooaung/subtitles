00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
block has been the talk of the town recently.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.140
It's applications,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.250
spells multiple industries and sectors and that is why it has been even referred to as the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.550
next big thing after Internet.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.850
In this lecture with will discuss how blocking can be implemented in the defense sector

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.240
defense.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
It is a very critical and crucial sector for every country off this world.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.940
This sector is generally considered a very resource intensive sector,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.770
with a lot of countries spending a substantial share of the DTP on the sector.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.160
Defense sector has always been a French.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.420
I know in implementing the state off,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.050
our technology solutions and blocking is no different.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.640
Blocking with this innate characteristics off security,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.980
audit ability,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.130
accuracy,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.630
transparency on detained mutability proves to be a great match for the defense industry.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.650
Vision was a lot of complex processes.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.350
Multiple stakeholders on requires the highest level of security for its data and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.750
communication tunnels.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.550
The first and the most basic requirement off the defense sector is to have a robust and

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.440
secure communication platform,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.060
a platform that can help the agencies and defense officials to maintain secrecy off the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.560
information shared on transmitted.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.250
As for the protocols later,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.500
on blocking can be a positive solution for these requirements as it can provide a platform

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.850
for secure and resilient communications in a highly contested environment.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.220
Effective information tracking and it does also authentication are very crucial

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.340
requirements off defense sector military officials.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.320
Just this information to make important,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.550
sometimes even life and death decisions,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.320
the the implementation of locked in.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.280
They can make these decisions more confidently as it ensures that the authenticity on data

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.610
integrity diastolic messages the day in the table audit trail,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.760
including the additional source,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.850
makes them more trustworthy and reliable.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.210
For though blocked,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.350
any neighbors data inputs to be appended to a single distributed letter,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.750
thus reducing the risk off errors.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.350
I simultaneously improving detail I building.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.460
Recently,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.800
U.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.130
S military has partnered with the technology phone IT Tanko to develop a Blockchain based

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.550
secure messaging app.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.610
The goal of the APP would be to provide a robust,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.850
efficient ONDA much more secure platform for the Department of Defense Communications.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.250
This secure messaging platform has several use cases inside the defense services,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740
for example,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.110
for communication between the troops on the ground and the headquarters,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.690
or sending information between intelligence off issues on the Pentagon complex.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.700
A plating is the next big challenge that borders this industry consistently.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.160
The defense supply chin,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.150
like any other supply chain,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.090
requires transparency and traceability for straw business blocking with this feature of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.150
emit ability,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.550
providing immutable trail off the products and goods moving through the supply chain.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.350
This is a great feature for the sector as defense officials can now track and trees all the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.450
subletting transactions across various departments and supplied partners.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.390
This in turn,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.050
saves a lot of time and makes the whole system more efficient.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.360
Cyber defenses one of the most promising solutions that block tin can provide for the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.090
sector.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.270
Defense industry has been constantly trying to find a solution for the issue of cyber

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.050
attacks,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.640
effects of data manipulation and hacking.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.160
All this give defense sector on its tools as these activities can lead to a breach of the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.280
critical data,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.350
which in turn can leave the defense services off the whole country vulnerable.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.690
The security protocols on databases currently used for the defense sector needs should be

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.020
upgraded to fend off the global cyber traits.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.150
Lot in technology provides a perfect solution for these requirements off the defense sector

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.500
in the traditional systems completely from becomes one rebel.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.030
Even if one day dissenter is hacked into or is disabled by the inning but then blocked in

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.410
on its recent less ledger system,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.460
there is no single point of failure.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.760
You an enemy needs to take down all the dissenters on devices to disable the complete

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.250
network.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.870
Well,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.230
more application of Blockchain technology is in the military drone operations A M blocked

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.090
in couple.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.950
Even John technology can be used for various applications.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.940
In the defense of this is these drones bothered by a can fly independently without

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.550
requiring any information from a human.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.100
For the blocking technology can be used to record data collected by these drones in real

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.550
time and in an immutable a Jew.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.750
Some days it becomes very difficult for us humans to understand that data points used by a

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.680
systems to reach to a particular decision in such cases blocked in really helps to

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.730
understand the decision made by the A as the complete trail of the decision process will be

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.750
recorded on the block to for a better understanding,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.250
you can even refer to the lecture on application of block tune in artificial intelligence

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.720
so extending this concept to on a power tools blocking technology can be used to record the

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.980
actions and flight decisions taken by the drone during its whole Joan that don't make it

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.360
destroyed or attacked by the enemy.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.950
But the information is captured and recorded will still be available on the block to.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.880
Hence,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.150
it won't be incorrect if we,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.250
as you then blocked in technology is a natural match for the defense sector.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.690
The peculiar characteristics off mutability,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.950
transparency and security the election provides has made it a perfect solution for solving

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.450
many of the issues off the defense industry.
