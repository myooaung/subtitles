00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
cases off contamination and dilution of milk are on the rice.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.200
Nowadays,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.140
consumers are even ready to pay a premium for the jail in quality.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.020
There are certain questions that border every customer while they're buying a packet or a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.640
can of milk.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.850
What is the source of the make is the mid genuine comic has mentioned on the packet.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.190
Whether the make is from a helicopter and is the meat for consumption as in many cases,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.090
may get spoiled during its stance.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.740
Partition due to lack of favorable environmental conditions blocked in has the potential to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
provide them with the solution to which they will be able to trace the whole journey of the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.750
milk from the farm to the amount.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.070
There are multiple stakeholders involved in supplying the make from the farm to the retail

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.880
show from AARP by army.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.060
All of these stakeholders need to distance each and every information about the mid

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.440
throughout its journey toe big transparency,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.000
the supply tea starting from farmers,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.850
they will be a distant on the block tin and a unique idea will be assigned to eat one of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.010
them.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.150
They will be required to take their cows using an electronic that or an R if I did it so

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.890
that each car becomes uniquely identifiable.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.240
The information about the health off a cow vaccination see received her feet etcetera needs

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.550
to be recorded on the Blockchain along with their 11 proofs.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.300
Farmers will also be required for a distant other related information on the block tin like

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.660
how the cows are raised.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.570
Are they allowed to get in the fields?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.090
That's it.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.850
The next piece of information to be captured on the bloating will be doing the making face

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.850
.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.090
The process of meeting can be automatic or men with which will be recorded on the block him

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.650
along with the Eloff make from each cup.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.350
Then this make is sold by the farmer to milk processing company.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.810
In the current scenario,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.650
before buying milk from the farmer,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.030
these processing companies ran a quality tests on the milk and once approved,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.350
the parents are released to these farmers after a few days.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.750
But with the implementation of blocked in and smart contracts,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.050
the payment cycle can be shortened for these farms.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.960
Once the quality of the week is approved,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.420
the farmer will be notified about the acceptance of the milk and the smart contract will be

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.550
executed that will release an automatic payment,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.750
does shortening the payment cycle for him.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.110
And in case the mill doesn't pass the quality tests,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.850
the farmer will be audited for quality complaints.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.450
Since the milk is a perishable product that needs to be kept at a lower temperature,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.090
it becomes very crucial to maintain and more enter or low temperature variance during its

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.380
stance.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.270
Petesch to monitor the temperature off the milk During its Transportacion i O tee

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.680
temperature sensors will be installed that will recorded stand picture throughout the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.060
journey and in case off any temperature fluctuation,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.470
the information will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.620
Helen Alert will be sent to all the permission stakeholders on the network on receiving the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.560
mix apply.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.850
The processing company will process and packed them milking boaters or packets.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.970
This whole processing information will then be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.050
Each meal bottle or packet will be given a unique identification number,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.950
then the milky shipped to supermarkets.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.430
During this phase as well,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.310
the storage and transportation temperature needs to be recorded on the Blockchain and once

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.780
a week,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.250
which is the shelves of a retailer,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.120
The retailer is required to keep the week at the required conditions before by that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.570
consumer can scan the unique idea in the milk bottle or packet by his smartphone and can

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.250
trace the completely of them.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.230
This information will help him to attend,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.250
ticket and decide if the milk is fit for consumption.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.240
Similarly,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.370
other dairy products,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.860
like butter aunties,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.250
can be very fight by scaling the unique I this present on their label colors.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.790
This transparency in the supply T will stand on the trust between companies and their

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.550
consumers.
