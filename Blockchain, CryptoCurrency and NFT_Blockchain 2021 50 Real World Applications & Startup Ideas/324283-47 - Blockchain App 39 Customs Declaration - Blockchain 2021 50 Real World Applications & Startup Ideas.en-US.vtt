00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
any cross border trade involved a large number of stakeholders,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.670
including producers,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.550
logistic companies and distributors through whom last amount of goods and wealth to him

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.610
cross border really also in most man illegal formalities like contracts,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.720
certificates,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.850
customs and approvals from various regulatory bodies,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.750
even though there are many authorities involved in any course for the trait.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
But the most notable authority in any cross border trade is customs.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.750
Not all of the customs is to ensure that all the permits obtained a valid all the goods

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.850
have been lawfully declared and that all the defined regulatory requirements have been met

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.850
.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.550
Customs duty is a very crucial component off any Internet sinti.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.170
It is an indirect Tex live.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.450
I don't both imports and exports by customs authorities for international shipments.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.360
This Texas collected whether government to generate revenue that is,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.950
useful countries development and economic growth off the citizens.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.240
Another very important reason for imposing customs duty is to maintain domestic

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.750
manufactured products equally competitive with imported groups,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.090
U.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.280
S.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.080
Customs handling the quest,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.680
significant manpower to maintain safety,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.150
customs valuation and revelations.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.910
Moreover,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.550
customs clearance is a tedious task and takes a lot of time,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.050
sometimes even weeks if proper documentation is no provided or some paperwork is in Garrett

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.290
and the blocky this share letter technology can have a huge impact on custom services and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.450
can help to make the whole process super and task here.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Let's understand how bloated record all the reproductions chronologically,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.950
that can then be shared with all the concerned parties involved in the supply tea.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.050
This minimizing the risk off roads.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.990
The complete information about the shipment,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.600
including the proof of parties clearance form below,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.960
flaky and insurance will be recorded on the block,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.820
and we'll be accessible to supply us transporters,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.670
buyers,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.450
regulators and auditors.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.780
Therefore,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.110
true blotchy customs authority would be able to see the necessary data like the seller,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.690
buyer price quantity,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.520
carrier insurance except ER that has been tied with the goods that need to be declared for

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.650
custom spirits.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.450
With this task in and see provided by blocks in technology,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.680
customs authorities and other border agencies would have realtime updates off any trade

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.050
happened,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.490
which would significantly improve the efficiency for risk analysis and will reduce the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.750
burden off manual verification to validate declarations.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.760
This,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.280
in turn,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.340
would lead to faster custom declaration and reduced,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.650
and to end processing time,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.320
they're going concerns about product quality and authenticity off the products that are

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.700
treated.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.340
Therefore,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.950
11 licenses,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.670
permits,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.510
certificates and other authorizations are required at the time of customs clearance,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.310
depending on the major of the declared goods and related national regulatory requirements.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.830
To keep a check on the illegal.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.920
Treating all of these certificates,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.380
if uploaded on the Blockchain,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.750
can be accessed easily from anyway.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.410
Once implemented,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.550
this would also minimize the risk of data manipulation.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.290
Moreover,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.260
as the Customs Authority will have access to all the shipment related documents present on

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.950
the Blockchain,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.050
it can automatically clear the goods that have been pre screened by them on the shared

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.550
letter at an earlier states.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.990
This would eliminate the need of withholding these goods at the time of declaration,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.320
which is that he is currently where the shipment takes a lot of time to get customs clears

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.270
on because of which the ability of goods get believed further.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.420
This would also decrease positing an accounting costs as well in many cases of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.130
international trade text or occurs in which there is a wide gap between the expected value

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.360
added tax revenues and they have a new that is actually collect when goods are imported

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840
into a country with the Vata.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.550
Jane Import back is charged as a percentage of the value of the imported groups.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.400
Because of transparency,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.350
the supply chain provided by Blokhin,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.630
Fruits and others will be much easier to detect because the system we provide here and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.350
aspirant information about all the conditions,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.750
thus making the whole system more robust and reliable.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.650
Additionally,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.450
all their transactions between an importer and exporter can be handled by smart contracts,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.650
which is self executing contracts and get executed when the pre defined conditions are met

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.650
.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.380
These micro antics can be used to automate the wear collection process and just bring more

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.650
transparency in the system.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.300
In this set up an automatic payment equal into the amount of that people will be deducted

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.730
from the bias payment to the cell and will be released to the Concern Department at the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.250
time of clearance of the goods.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.050
The remaining pull off money after directing backed can then be sent to the seller of those

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.550
this minimizing any terms of food or force declarations
