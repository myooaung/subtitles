00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
when it comes to international shipments or international treat their really steps on

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.050
documentation stages that need to be completed for a trade to be successful.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.610
Don't give you a clear Batou off how international trade works.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's walk you to the whole process in detail.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.160
The first day basic scored college that it was the movement of goods from the shipper or

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.950
exporter to the Freight Forwarders warehouse.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.960
Afraid for Hodo is a connecting link or an intermediary who is responsible for transporting

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.650
goods from one destination to another.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.120
Export hole is usually takes place with the help off a truck or a train,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.540
or,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.330
in some cases,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.650
book,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.810
the export college can take so few others too.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.640
Few days,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.740
depending upon the distance between the exporters premises,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.140
Onda freight forwarders,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.750
warehouse.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.700
Then goods reached the warehouse of Afraid for Hodo,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.960
he inspects.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.330
Annan shows that everything is transported without any damage now,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.170
before the good can be shipped off from the country,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.050
they need to receive customs clearance from the export country.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.520
This process is generally performed by the customs brokers on require submission of cargo

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.710
details and various other important documents like beloved leading commercial invoice

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.830
packing list certificates off Origin Statement Backing declaration form on manufacturing

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.150
declaration Next is inspection on loading off the cargo on the ship.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.390
This is coordinated by the Fed for her do First,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.830
the shipment arising the Importance country.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.400
The authorities in the destination country said the import customs documents It is the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.000
responsibility of the freight forwarder order nominated Customs Roco to perform this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.680
clearance.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.320
By the time Kagwe rights was the ship,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.690
Mika go arising the importance country,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.690
The cargo is handed to the destination warehouse along with the carrier bills on handling

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.950
bills off the shipment.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.060
Next step is the transportation of the goods from the V warehouse.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.250
So the final destination off the intended receivable.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.950
This can be facilitated by afraid for voodoo or in some cases,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.110
the consigning.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.350
All the important can also choose to collect the Kabul pencils.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.500
This process is followed in God,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.250
ocean and ear fridge.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.930
Now let's see what other challenges faced with this sector and how can blocks in him in

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.650
making international treat a large single?

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.390
Tracking the problems off any shipment is a complex process that is prone to human error,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880
fraud and smuggling.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.950
But the doctor in this issue can result.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.950
Blocks invent record all the transactions of shipping in an immutable in clippard form it.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.100
This information can then be shared with all the stakeholders involved in international

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.590
trade,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.730
including exporters,

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.280
importers and customs authorities.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.200
And that,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.560
too,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.150
in almost real time,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.520
that's true.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.690
Blocked in all,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.720
the stakeholders will have real time access about the status on the variables off the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.450
shipment.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.430
At eight states off the transaction,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.270
there's a living.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.450
Participants will update the bloc team,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.050
and that information will instantly be available to all the parties.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.010
This instead,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.540
availability off information would eliminate documentation.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.240
Deles,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.450
for example,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.990
Customs clearance delay can be eliminated through blocked,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.350
too.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.060
If you want to learn more about how blocked and then facilitated customs clearance,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.830
we haven't detailed lecture for that as well.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.650
In the schools,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.450
you can refer to the lecture blocked an application in customs for this purpose.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.850
So then very shapely lightens like pharmaceutical drugs,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.750
vaccines,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.630
chemicals,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.450
daily products remain effective only if kept in the desire temporary to throw digital.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.720
Any fluctuations in the temperature can decrease the effectiveness off these coots and can

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.050
even make them unfit for consumption.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.440
From this corpus,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.110
i d senses will be installed on the cargo that can measure its temperature on record.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.000
The same on the block to any situations in the temperature will also be recorded on the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.650
block to.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.660
Thus it will help them by to ensure that the goods received when maintain that their

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.890
desired temperature.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.270
According to the manufacturer's guidelines on deceptive the day implementation of smart

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.050
contracts,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.150
Payments I kiss will be reduced on manufactures in Get Paige for the shipments much faster

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.150
.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.150
An international treat involves a lot of complexity or into various factors such as

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.880
distance,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.630
different set off rules and regulations in different countries.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.250
On difficulty in knowing the other party personally,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.360
Do you think this complexity involved the use off?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.650
Letter of credit has become a common no in international treat.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.770
A letter of credit is a little some a bias country bank guarantee that the bias payment to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.150
a celo will be received on time.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.860
I'm for the correct amount in the event vendor buyer is unable to make payment for the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.520
purchase.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.950
The bank will be required to cover the full body meaning amount of the purchase.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.930
For instance,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.350
accompanying you S E C extreme board good from a supplier in Australia,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.320
the important needs to pay for those goods,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.800
but he's hesitant to pay in advance as he wants to issue that don't Go table receive will

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.520
be as good as he ordered at the same time Next port.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.770
It is also hesitant to ship the groups as there is no assurance that,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.250
remember,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.250
very seemed for the goods supplied in such cases.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.680
The Importance bank issues a letter of credit promising to pay exporter must.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.150
All the documents of shipment are provided by the exporter.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:32.250
Those letters of credit provide effective risk litigation for the trading parties,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.820
but still there are fewer talent is that leads to the late payments to the exporters.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.030
For instance,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.450
letter off creditor evaluated on the basis off trained documents.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.250
I'm not on the actual delivery or quality of goods.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.910
Therefore,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.930
any adding terminology or interpretation off the compliance requirements often lead to

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.250
disputes between the trading parties.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.770
For the,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.450
the letter also mandates the bank to ensure that the documents presented by the seller

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:12.240
completely and here to the letter of credit terms and conditions does the issuing bank must

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.570
carefully velvet valid in a document submitted by the seller complies with the letter of

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.150
credit.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.980
Therefore,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.250
a mental is a CO if there is any error in the data entry in the letter of credit contracts

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.250
,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.060
but this can be simplified with the Blockchain based system using lots him.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.300
A letter of credit can be issued as a smart contract between the bank on the seller to get

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.750
anti payment to the seller,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.480
the network consensus mechanism off locked in,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.460
he shows.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.070
Then there is only a single version off the letter of credit drop at any given time and

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:56.450
that all the parties are able to view and work on this version based on the exist rates.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.240
After being reviewed and accepted by the exporter,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.140
the letter of credit is finalized as a contract between the issuing bank and exporter.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:13.850
Now all the 11 stakeholders will have visibility into the letter of credit process and they

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.990
can easily highlight on resolve discrepancies,

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.650
if any,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:24.550
since all the shipment and related documents will be available on the Blockchain dear full

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.550
.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.450
If all the conditions defined in the smart contract R Mich.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.400
A smart contract gets executed and an automatic pay out will betray good to the exporter

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.850
without any release.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.960
Cargoes that move internationally either by sea or ill,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.350
are insured against losses that occurred during the transportation,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.910
though even today,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:55.220
this process of cargo insurance has many challenges around it and unlocked you blocked in

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.150
can provide a number of benefits to cargo insurance and can make it a better experience.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.880
The global Locked in platform.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.230
We collect all stakeholders and insurance companies to share distributed legends that will

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.040
capture data about the loss of Congo on exposure of Chicago to unfavorable conditions that

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.650
can make it ineffective.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.880
For this,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.370
I have.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:26.680
The senses will be attached to the cargo that will upload the information about any loss on

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.750
the should lead to,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.470
For example,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:35.620
in case a ship sinks or the temperature fluctuates above the desired ridge that can spoil

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.450
the cargo.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.550
This information will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:46.130
This recorded information will help the insurance companies in better assessment on

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.950
calculation off the insurance claim coverage.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.080
True,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.930
locked in all the stakeholders involved,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:59.050
including the in shorter's will have access to all the documents related to the shipment.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.450
Therefore,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.220
in case off any claims for insurance,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:09.250
this will reduce the time taken to receive the living documents from the concerned parties
