Hello everyone and welcome to the spark and Python with virtual box installation lecture this lecture

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.800
will walk through how to download and set up virtual box with Ubuntu.

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.030
Then we will walk through installing Sparc and Python as well as the Jupiter notebook system on this

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.760
virtual box aboon to the resources for this lecture has a link to a written form and these instructions

5
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.540
that you can reference in case you want to just copy and paste anything we do here.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.310
OK.

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340
So the first thing need to do is actually download virtual box and a Bluetooth.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920
Let's hop over to the browser and show you how you can find these

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.410
OK.

10
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.930
The first thing you need to download is Virtual Box virtual box is basically going to like you to have

11
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
a virtual computer on your own physical computer and this virtual computer is where we're going to be

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.340
downloading Ubuntu if you're running already on an beento or Linux system you can basically just skip

13
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.920
ahead until we actually start downloading SPARC in Python.

14
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.140
On this virtual box but for Windows users and Mac users Let's show you how you can get a virtual box

15
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.520
first you just come over here to downloads and this will take you to the downloads page and we're just

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.540
that virtual box.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.600
Org slash wiki slash downloads or you can just Google virtual box download and you'll see these download

18
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.340
options.

19
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.820
So there's options for Windows host and OSX hosts as well as Linux distributions.

20
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.310
But if you're on Linux you know you can just do it on your actual system not on a virtual box.

21
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.390
And then just click on Windows hosts affair on Windows and or download an executable file already have

22
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.520
it.

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.920
I'm going to cancel this.

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.550
And if you're on OSX you click on that and this will download a dmg file.

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.280
So either way once that's done downloading and it canceled that one as well you just double click it.

26
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.480
Follow the instructions.

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.460
Do everything with the defaults and have virtual box set up on your computer.

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.660
Then once you have downloaded virtual box and gone through the installation process again it's really

29
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.850
simple just executable file or GMG essentially just double click it and follow the instructions it tells

30
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.990
you to do with everything as a default.

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.070
You need to download Ubuntu once you've done that.

32
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.510
So you've downloaded virtual box you've run through the basic installation process and then you come

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.790
over here to Ubuntu dot com.

34
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.810
That's going to be the Linux version that we're going to be using.

35
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.240
And you go ahead and download Ubuntu.

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.560
So just come up here you'll see downloads click on that and there's a couple of ways to download it.

37
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680
We're going to be using Ubuntu desktop.

38
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.450
There's a server cloud etc. but click here on a Bluetooth desktop and this is the one we're going to

39
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.220
download.

40
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.350
This version is sixteen point zero 4.2.

41
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.580
Really doesn't matter what version you use as long as it's relatively recent and you can just click

42
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.100
Kear on download and it's eventually going to download.

43
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
They'll ask you if you want to help shape the future of some donations totally up to you or just kind

44
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.690
of put everything to zero right now to walk through the process and then eventually I can just say downloadable

45
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.000
to desktop.

46
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.130
You'll click on it and it will download the ISO for you.

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.700
All right.

48
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.180
So this is what it should look like.

49
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.950
It's going to be an I O file and it's quite a large download it's about 1.4 gigabytes which kind of

50
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.080
makes sense it's an entire operating system.

51
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.890
So this will take some time.

52
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.430
I already downloaded in a boot flavor so I'm going to cancel this and then I'm going to hop over to

53
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.410
virtual box.

54
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.440
So once you've downloaded installed a virtual box then you have U-Boot to this ISO file ISO extension

55
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.230
ready to go.

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.980
You're going to run virtual box either on your Mac or on your Windows computer.

57
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.830
So already a virtual box installed.

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.390
Then go ahead and grab it.

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.150
So I'll type virtual box and here I see virtual box.

60
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.830
I'll click on that and it should bring up a virtual box.

61
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.970
Once you open up virtual box manager it's going to look something like this you'll click on new and

62
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.870
then it's going to ask you the name and the operating system.

63
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.420
So we'll call this my Sparke or whatever you really want to call it doesn't matter.

64
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.110
And then the type we're going to say Linux and we'll say Ubuntu 64 bit.

65
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.560
Now if you're running a older computer you may have to choose 32 bit and when you're Ubuntu that you'll

66
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.060
have to look around and holiday 32 bit version.

67
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.920
So make sure you understand whether your computer's on 64 bit or 32 bit.

68
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.890
If it's a relatively newer computer it's probably a 64 bit so that's why we're going to be using it

69
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.480
will hit next and then you have to choose the memory size.

70
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.880
So this step kind of depends on your computer's amount of RAM but you'll want to give access to a reasonable

71
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.020
amount of RAM here for you to operate.

72
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.020
Bluetooth virtualization without any trouble and depending on your applications I would suggest choosing

73
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.220
somewhere between four to eight gigabytes.

74
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.050
If you only have 8 bytes total on your computer then just give virtual boxes access to about half of

75
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.730
four gigabytes which is 4000 megabytes So we'll kind of do what I would say is a good amount like 4

76
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.110
megabytes or half the RAM I believe.

77
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.410
So this is the max on my computer but I would suggest if you have eight gigabytes give it 4000 megabytes

78
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.230
so hit next.

79
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.100
And then there's the hard disk.

80
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.510
So you can choose create virtual hard disk and the default 8 gigabytes.

81
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.950
So will say create a virtual hard disk now and the default is it could get bytes.

82
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.320
Click create and it says hard disk file type.

83
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.940
You're going to choose VDI Virtual Box disk image click next and then it's going to say storage on physical

84
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.530
hard disk.

85
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.180
So we're going to choose a fixed size dynamically allocated can slow down your input output speed a

86
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.600
little bit so we're going to choose a fixed size and after we choose fix size say next and you want

87
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.460
to choose a decent amount of space.

88
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.740
I would suggest anywhere between 20 and 50 gigabytes depending on how often you think you're to be using

89
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.160
the virtual box.

90
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.200
But remember that you also have to account for the actual OS itself.

91
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.660
So we're going to just give it something like 20 gigabytes kind of a fair amount you can see I have

92
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.220
plenty of room here so this kind of has to be a personal call for you but make sure at least has enough

93
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.680
gigabytes to hold the entire operating system.

94
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.930
So I would say something like five or 10 minimum but I really suggest something like 20 to 50 gigabytes

95
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.340
just so you don't have any problems you'll hit create.

96
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.000
And this may take a little while the penny if you have a hard drive.

97
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.560
If you have a solid state drive will be a lot faster.

98
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.130
But I'm going to jump in time.

99
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.750
I have this phone to take me about two minutes so can forward in time until it's done.

100
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.230
All right.

101
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.770
Once that process is done it's going to revert back to this screen and you'll see your machine.

102
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.220
So you're going to right click on this and then go to settings.

103
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:40.690
Or just control S and then you're going to go to System and you're going to click on the processor tab

104
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.610
and the pending on your computer you can allow access to the maximum amount of C-p is in the green zone

105
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.080
so you can also see that if you got really plans on what you're going to do or how have you going to

106
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.790
push this.

107
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.500
But I usually just push it to the max on the green and then we also go to display and we want to assign

108
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.120
a little bit more video memory so it looks a little nicer when you give it up to about like halfway

109
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.730
of my max which is like 80 megabytes and then optionally you can enable the acceleration.

110
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.110
So I recommend you do that and then you're going to hit OK.

111
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.400
It's going to set up those settings and then you're going to double click on your virtual machine and

112
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.280
then that might take a little while to set up.

113
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.690
But eventually you will see this pop up that says Select started this and this is where you're going

114
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.530
to point to the Ubuntu that I O that you downloaded.

115
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.390
So we're going to click over here and I already have Ubuntu 16 points or 4.

116
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.850
So I click on that and then I'm going to click start.

117
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.260
And this is going to essentially install Ubuntu onto your virtual machine.

118
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.730
Now this may take a while depending on how you install it or if it's going to run off of this but we're

119
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:55.670
going to keep running this and we're going to basically go through into installation process so you

120
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.890
can see here it's starting up.

121
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.940
Ubuntu based off the iso file and then eventually you're going to see something that looks like this.

122
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.260
You'll see these little pop up saying it's grabbing your keyboard and mouse action.

123
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.460
You can go ahead and close those.

124
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.630
And I'm going to expand this just a little bit so we can see more of the screen here and it's going

125
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.290
to say either try Ubuntu or install it too.

126
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.120
So you actually want to install Ubuntu.

127
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.580
Again this is only installing it onto this virtual machine.

128
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.640
So will click here.

129
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.330
Install and then it's going to say download updates while installing Ubuntu.

130
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.280
We're going to do that.

131
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.140
So select that as far as third party software.

132
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:30.970
Don't worry about that.

133
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.210
We don't need to do it.

134
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.200
We're going to continue

135
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.820
and then you get this warning here says erase this and install Ubuntu so that actually is what you want

136
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.480
to select.

137
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.620
Don't worry it's like erasing the disk of your actual computer.

138
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:53.470
It's only going to clear the memory that we set aside when installing the virtual box virtual machine.

139
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.380
So that is already empty memory because you selected it.

140
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.900
So feel free to select erase disk and install it onto the or it's totally safe and you're going to click

141
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.740
Install now.

142
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.540
And it says right the changes to disk.

143
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.720
Go ahead and continue

144
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.550
then eventually it will take you to a time zone asking you where you are.

145
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:23.000
Just select what it said or select your own time zone hit continue and then select your keyboard layout.

146
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.220
I'm in English USA so I'll just continue with the default

147
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.790
and then it's going to ask who are you.

148
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:37.420
So go ahead and put your name computer's name is fine username that's fine and then we can choose a

149
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.400
password if you want.

150
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:49.810
I'll say test password and then let's confirm it test password and then I'm going to say log in automatically.

151
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.040
Obviously it's a weak password explicit test password but this is just on my home computers.

152
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.380
It doesn't really matter.

153
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.400
It continue.

154
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.680
And then what's going to do is go through the installation process.

155
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.480
So it's going to take a little bit of time.

156
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.760
So we're going to jump forward in the video until this is done.

157
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.170
Eventually you'll see installation complete and I'll ask you to restart the computer.

158
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.740
That's the virtual box computers.

159
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.430
Click on restart now and it will restart.

160
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.930
This virtual computer and if this takes too long sometimes there's an error in the virtual box will

161
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.480
allow itself to restart.

162
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.950
You can just close this window and then start over again just the right click and then restart it from

163
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.750
the actual virtual box environment.

164
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.260
So Tir says please remove the installation medium then press enter so you can go ahead and press enter

165
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.450
there then once you press enter eventually you'll see it auto log in for you.

166
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.920
Kind of see some command line things and the window will pop up again like this.

167
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.110
Now if for some reason it's staying on black Kristan on the command line for a really long time that

168
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.960
is something like more than 10 minutes.

169
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.770
You can always just come back to a virtual box right click and then reset it and then started up again

170
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:57.820
from here.

171
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.120
But right now we'll just go ahead and close this keyboard shortcut.

172
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.000
So click on your computer and that will go away.

173
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:05.720
All right.

174
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.710
Once you have this actual Ubuntu virtual box running and ready to go the next step is to actually download

175
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.060
install Python that Jupiter notebook as well as Sparc and we're going to continue with that.

176
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.660
In part two of this virtual box installation lecture series.

177
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.450
So I will see you in the very next lecture.

178
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.400
Are you going to continue to write for my Ubuntu desktop.

179
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.810
Thanks.

180
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.690
I'll see you there.
