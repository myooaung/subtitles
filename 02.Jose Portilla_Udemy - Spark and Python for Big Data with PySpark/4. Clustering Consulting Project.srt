00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:13,090
Welcome to the K means clustering consulting project you're beginning to become world famous due to

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,600
your machine learning skills and the technology startup in California needs your help.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,380
It's time for you to go to San Francisco to help out this tech startup.

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,860
They've been recently hacked.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,550
I need your help finding out about the hackers.

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,770
Luckily there are forensic engineers have grabbed valuable data about the hacks including information

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,270
like session time locations word permanent typing speed etc..

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,500
The forensic engineer relates to you what she's been able to figure out so far she has been able to

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,990
grab meta data of each session that the hackers use to connect to their servers and she has that data

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,250
with features here the following features in the data that you're going to be provided.

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,970
There is a session connection time feature which indicates how long that hacking session lasted in minutes.

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,120
There's the bytes transfer which is the number of megabytes transferred during the actual session from

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,510
the company computer to the hackers computer.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,740
There is another feature called Kalli Tracys which is a binary feature indicating that the hacker was

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,400
using the Kallio Linux operating system.

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,970
There's another feature called service corrupted that's number of companies servers that were corrupted

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,170
during the attack.

18
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,710
Then there's pages corrupted which is the number of pages illegally accessed by the hackers.

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,380
Then the location feature column indicates the location the attack came from.

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,690
However the forensic engineer believes this is probably useless because the hackers were using virtual

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,620
private networks or VPN.

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,920
Finally there's the word permanent typing speed feature column which is the hackers estimated typing

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,220
speed based on session logs.

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,540
Now the technology firm has three potential hackers that perpetrated the attack on their list.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,240
However they are certain of the first two hackers but aren't very sure if the third hacker was involved

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,660
or not.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,020
And this is where they've requested your help and where K means clustering can come into play.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,550
So they want you to help them figure out whether or not that third suspect had anything to do with the

29
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,750
attacks or was it just two hackers essentially.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,990
Was it two hackers or three hackers.

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,060
It's probably not possible to know for sure but maybe what you've just learned about clustering can

32
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,640
help.

33
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,900
And there's one last key fact which is going to help you determine the answer.

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,890
The forensic engineer knows that the hackers trade off attacks meaning they should each have roughly

35
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,280
the same amount of attacks.

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,070
So for example if there were 100 total attacks on their servers then in a two hacker situation each

37
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,350
of the hackers should have about 50 hacks in a three hackers situation.

38
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,160
Each would have about 33 hack's the engineer believes this is the key element to solving this but doesn't

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,300
know how did the single wish this unlabeled data into groups of hackers.

40
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,810
Best of luck with this project.

41
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,930
It should be a fun one.

42
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,160
If you get stuck feel free to go straight to the solution lecture.

43
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,530
We're going to code along an example solution.

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,440
I hope you enjoy this consulting project.

45
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,920
I'll see you at the next lecture.
