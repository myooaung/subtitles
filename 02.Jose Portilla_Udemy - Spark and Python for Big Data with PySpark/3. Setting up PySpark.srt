Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on sitting at Paice park.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,250
So this is just an extra lecture based off the press to lectures and if you noticed Right now we can

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,920
only use Paice park if we're in the correct Sparke directory folder.

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,440
And this lecture will show you a quick way that allows you to import Paice Park from any directories

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,960
so don't have to worry about changing directories that SPARC home directory.

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,260
Let's jump back to our terminal and show you how to install that fine SPARC library and then use it

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,530
to go over to my virtual desktop.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,190
Now OK here I am at the virtual desktop.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,290
Personally I want to do is open up the terminal and see already have it here.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,070
So I'll open up my terminal and the next thing I want to do is show you how right now.

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,440
Hi Sparke is working.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,580
So I call Python 3 I hit enter.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,880
Notice that if I ask to import Paice first here I'll get back an error it says No module names Paice

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,670
spark.

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:10,310
However if I quit out of this if I move over to spark and then CD into all we can list everything C.D

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,870
then it's a python.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:21,240
And then if I list this and call iPhone 3 here and then say import Paice SPARC.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,860
Now I get no errors.

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,450
So the main thing I want to do is instead of having to change directory every time I use this fine SPARC

20
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,370
library that we're going to install to actually do this sort of connection process for me there are

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,450
other ways of doing this.

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,360
You could just export the paths to your bash RC file but this way is a little more clear and it's a

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,110
little easier.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,490
So that's what we're going to do here.

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,550
If you're familiar with aboon two systems you can probably just set up an expert pass yourself.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,380
I'm going to quit this so I'm just directly at my terminal and then I'm also going to hit CD.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,320
So I go directly home and I'm going to install this fine SPARC library.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:08,140
So let me hit clear here so I can clear everything and then I will say Pipp 3 install find SPARC enter

29
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,750
and then it says collecting fine spark and it's going to install it for you.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,200
So now the idea is to actually use to find Sparke to do that connection for us.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,850
So what we need is the actual path to that SPARC home directory.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:30,310
So let's get it going to list this which shows sparks are going to see into Sparc and then going to

33
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,930
type WD which is going to print my working directory.

34
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,550
So here I have it under home Jose and then Sparke etc. Hadoop.

35
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,810
That's the actual path I want.

36
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,590
So I will copy this.

37
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,810
I'm going to highlight that and then right click and copy now to explore.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,260
How do we can actually use find Sparke.

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,790
So I'm going to hit CD again.

40
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,330
So I'm back in my home directory and then I will type python 3.

41
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,830
So right now since I'm at home if I try to import PI SPARC you'll give me an error says no module named

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,720
PI spark.

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,230
So let's use find the spark to actually make this all work.

44
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:18,890
I will import fine spark enter and then I'm going to call find spark got in it and then I'm going to

45
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,820
paste my actual stream here of the file paths so I'll put a little quote there for the string say that

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,630
it looks like I instantly set this over.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,120
So if hit paste I accidently hit enter there.

48
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,020
So let me try this again find spark got in it.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,640
Quote The actual path and so close parentheses enter.

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,180
And now I told find Sparke where it can actually find Sparke for me.

51
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,100
So once I've done that I can hit import.

52
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,930
Spark.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,810
And now it's working even though and that my working directory.

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,080
So that's all you have to do and I can use Paice bark from any directory.

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,150
So let's go over those key steps again especially because I messed up a little bit here.

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,010
All you had to do was check first the import price Sparke work.

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,080
If it doesn't if it gives back no module named PI spark then call import.

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:16,040
Spark and then we have to do is pasan this directory appear where your actual Sparke home is.

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,590
So if you copy and paste and then hit enter.

60
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,210
You might accidentally get this error which just means you accidently ran that code a little too soon.

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,810
Well you have to do is copy and paste it as a string inside of this init call and then say import Paice

62
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,370
part and then everything should be working for you.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,910
So that's it.

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,060
I'm going to do this one more time to the Jupiter notebook.

65
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,770
You can feel free to just continue and skip to the next lecture if you're done with this.

66
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,400
But I just want to walk through one more time.

67
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,460
How this would look.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,390
Using the Jupiter notebook system.

69
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,480
So I'm going to quit python here.

70
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,290
And then I'll start my Jupiter note book again I'm starting this directly from the home directory.

71
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,250
And then if this is your first time running Jubran notebook remember you have to copy and paste this

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,000
token.

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,960
By now this should not be your first time.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,860
So we're going to say new iPhone 3 notebook and then right now if I say import Paice SPARC I should

75
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,340
expect an error.

76
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,970
So I get that error.

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:18,620
Now to use find SPARC to fix it so I will say import fine spark shift enter and then say find spark

78
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,100
in it.

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,750
And then I'm going to copy and paste that path to my actual SPARC home shift center and now for import

80
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,870
Paice Fark.

81
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,790
I don't get any issues.

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,330
All right that's it.

83
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,270
Make sure you do that.

84
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,680
If you're ever dealing with the lectures and you have this module named PI spark issue you can just

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,930
use find Sparke pass in your home directory where spark is located and it should easily fix that.

86
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,450
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
