00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.650
Hello everyone and welcome to part one of the Twitter projects for the sparks streaming section of the

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.290
course.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.740
So now it's time for your final project which is probably the most ambitious project we've done so far

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.700
in this course.

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.010
We're going to create a simple application that plots out the popularity of tags associated with incoming

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.890
tweets streamed live from Twitter to do all of this.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.730
We first need to create a Twitter developer account to get our access codes.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.980
Then you'll need to install tweet the library as well as Matt Cutlip and seaborne.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.850
So we're going to walk through all of that set up in this lecture.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.570
Let's get started by going to a browser and going to apps start Twitter dot com or go to that Web site

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060
now.

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.450
All right.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.300
Here an app start Twitter that COM and to actually get started with application management.

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.140
With Twitter you first need to sign in with your Twitter account.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.580
So if you don't have a Twitter account you'll need to sign in.

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.790
So go ahead and create a Twitter account then come back to this page and sign in.

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.860
Go into that now.

18
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.350
Click on sign in.

19
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.380
Then you're just going to log in.

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.630
And then once you're logged then you probably don't have any applications yet if you haven't used this

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.010
you're going to come over here it's create new app.

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
Click on that then you'll be on this create an application page and we'll start off by giving application

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.160
details.

24
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.040
So just give your application a unique name.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.040
You may need to change it depending on if the names are already taken.

26
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.440
All do spark Twitter and new app see if that works.

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.620
I may have to change it a description.

28
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.020
I'll just say my Sparc app the Web site.

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.990
So this Web site is your application is publicly accessible home page.

30
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.000
However we don't have a Web site for our page or application yet and if you don't have a URL you just

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.110
put in a placeholder.

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.960
So I'm going to put in HTP colon slash slash W.W. the Google dot com and we'll probably HTP us just

33
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.520
to make sure we don't get any errors there.

34
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.720
And then scroll down agree to the Twitter developer agreement and then say create your Twitter application.

35
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.000
All right.

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.750
So once you're at your applications page you want to click here on keys and access tokens and that will

37
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.770
open up a new tab.

38
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.430
So here in our application settings you'll see a consumer key and API key and then the consumer secret

39
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.870
an API secret key.

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.570
So make sure you write those down and you don't want these things publicly available.

41
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.770
So write those down somewhere make sure you know where they are saved into a text file.

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.690
Cetera and then scroll down until you get to this.

43
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.330
So you scroll down till you get to your access token.

44
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.980
And then once you're at your access token click here where it says create Maxxis token.

45
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.820
Once that is done on the same page if you scroll all the way down you should see something that says

46
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.610
access token an access token secret so the access token is going to be used to make the API request

47
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.560
on our Twitter accounts behalf and make sure you don't share this token seeker if anyone.

48
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.100
But basically we need is that consumer key the consumer secret key the access token the access token

49
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.740
secret.

50
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.590
Once you have those for basically hash codes you are ready to go.

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.810
So make sure you write those down.

52
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.190
Copy and paste them somewhere.

53
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.820
And we're going to be using those the next lecture.

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.780
But we've done everything we need to do for our actual Twitter setup.

55
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.250
Now we're going to install all the libraries we need.

56
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.890
So I'm going to hop over to a terminal inside my virtual box and install those libraries right inside

57
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.100
my terminal here.

58
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.390
The first thing going to do is say pick three install and I'm going to install tweet pie which is kind

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.180
of this library that connects Python with Twitter.

60
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.760
So that will collect download and install it for Python 3 here and let me fast forward until this is

61
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.770
finished downloading and installing.

62
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.450
Once that is done the next thing you want to do is import the visualization libraries or I should say

63
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.220
download the visualization libraries.

64
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.970
There were going to be using the first one's called Matt Partlet and the second one is called Seaborn.

65
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.940
So we'll say pick three install that plot Lipp answer

66
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.860
and then I'm going to fast forward until this is finished installing and then finally when my plot lib

67
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.510
is done we'll say Pick 3 install and we will install Seaborn.

68
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.530
Which is another visualization library.

69
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.630
OK.

70
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.610
So just let that download and install and that's basically it.

71
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.650
So once you're done with those steps getting you're a Twitter developer account set up and then downloading

72
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.290
those three libraries that sweepy by plotless and seaborne you have everything you need for the next

73
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.930
lecture.

74
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.880
OK I won't have to just cut it off here and I'll see you at the next lecture.
