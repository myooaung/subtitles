Welcome to spark in Python for big data with PI spark my name is Jose Portsea and I'll be your instructor

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,030
for this course and one of the most popular Python instructors here on you to me where he teach over

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,340
a hundred and seventy five thousand students on various topics including python data science machine

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,630
learning and more.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,210
I also conduct in-person training on these topics for some of the world's largest companies.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,790
In this course we teach you how to harness the simplicity of the Python programming language with the

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,150
power of Apache's spark for working with big data.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,900
So why learn Python and spark spark has been reported to be one of the most valuable tech skills to

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:46,580
learn by in the dot com with the man for sparking big data skills exploding in recent years as one of

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,020
the latest technologies in the big data space.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,590
SPARC is quickly becoming one of the most powerful tools for analyzing big data with the ability to

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,490
run programs up to a hundred times faster than Hadoop map reduce.

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,020
In this course you'll be learning the latest SPARC 2.0 methods including the latest updates the spark's

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,230
M-L live library for machine learning and working with SPARK and data frames will also cover additional

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,290
Sparke topics such as Sparts streaming.

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,900
Let's get a quick overview of the course curriculum.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,110
We'll start off with full set of installation guides that reflect a realistic deployment setting including

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:30,710
local installation guides of Linux and virtual box using Amazon Web Services elastic map readers utilizing

19
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,170
Amazon and easy to instances and even the data Brick's notebooks service will be free to choose whichever

20
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,740
one best suits you or your company's needs.

21
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,050
Or you can try them all out.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,930
We'll continue on a crash course in Python programming.

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,700
In case you're coming in from another programming language or you feel a bit rusty on your Python and

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,120
want a quick review then we'll move on to learn about the latest shift SPARC syntax working the spark

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,840
2.0 style data Frings then we'll continue by learning how to use Spark's and lib library for machine

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,920
learning utilizing the latest data Frain API then will also cover some advanced topics such as gradient

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,780
boost to trees and Spark's stream all of this content is presented in clear video format as well as

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,760
carefully detailed notebooks that include explanatory text and code.

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,740
You'll get chances to test your knowledge all along the way with exercise.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,840
We've also included maake consulting projects based on real data sets and real world companies.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,670
She can get experience solving real problems not only do you get fantastic technical content with this

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,190
course you will also get access to her online question and answer forums where fellow students I myself
