00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Welcome to the linear regression consulting project so we're going to set you loose on your first consulting

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,630
project you've been contracted by Hyundai heavy industries to help them build a predictive model for

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,540
some ships.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,740
You've been flown out to their headquarters in South Korea.

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,650
Hyundai Heavy Industries is one of the world's largest manufacturers of large ships including cruise

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,340
liners.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,060
They need your help to give them accurate estimates of how many crewmembers A ship will require.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,730
They are currently selling ships with some new customers and want you to create a model in these it's

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,220
predict how many crewmembers the ships will need.

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,780
That way once they sell the ship to the customer they can accurately report it estimate of how many

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,070
crewmembers will be required for the new ship they provided you data with these features.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,490
The ship's name the name of the cruise line the age of the ship the tonnage of the ship the number of

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,580
passengers the ship can hold the length of the ship the number of cabins on the ship the passenger density

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,840
that the ship can hold.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,310
And then the number of crewmembers needed for that ship your job is to create a regression model that

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,690
will help predict how many crewmembers will be needed for future ships.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,170
In other words use the features you think will be useful to predictive value inside the Crew column.

18
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,840
So if we come back here you have various features and you want to predict using those features.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,570
The very last bottom value the number of crew members needed the client has also mentioned that they

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,650
have found that particular cruise lines will differ in acceptable crew accounts.

21
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:46,290
So it's most likely an important feature to include in your analysis the cruise line value is a string

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,350
however and we haven't covered exactly how to convert strings the numbers with Python and spark yet.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,620
So I want you to see if you can discover how to use string indexer from the documentation.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,500
Google around the documentation see if you can find how to use string indexer and see if you can apply

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,640
it to the cruise line column to help with your analysis.

26
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,900
As in any real world project there are no 100 percent correct answers here.

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,540
Just try your best to build a predictive model and that optional aspect of it is to figure out how to

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,460
use string indexer on your own.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,990
We'll cover more formally in future lectures as well as a possible solution lecture.

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,350
Coming up next after this one again this is a pretty open consulting project.

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,920
Feel free to either try it out on your own or if it's more your style.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,990
Go straight to the next lecture to the solutions to do a code along of an example solution for this

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,160
consulting project.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,960
There can definitely be more than one way to create this model.

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,650
OK.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,120
Best of luck with the project.

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,730
All the necessary information for the project can be found in the following files.

38
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,120
The linear regression consulting project that notebook has everything you need to know and the CSP file

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,020
that goes with this project is called cruise line info.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,620
If you're looking for the solutions notebook it's called linear regression consulting project underscore

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,790
solutions and that's a notebook we're going to be walking through in the very next lecture.

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,260
Best of luck and approach.

43
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,940
This however is your style to either try it out on your own or to treat it as a code along with the

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,600
next lecture.
