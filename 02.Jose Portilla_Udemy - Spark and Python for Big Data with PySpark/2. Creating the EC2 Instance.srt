00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:13,030
Hello everyone and welcome to the E.S. to instance set up lecture now that we have on Amazon Web Services

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:20,650
accounts set up we can go ahead and create E.C to instance Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or easy to is

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,090
a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,770
In layman's terms you can basically think of this as just a virtual computer that you can access through

5
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,210
the Internet.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,040
So here is our overall plan.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,370
The first thing we're going to do is use the AWOS console Web site to create an easy to instance then

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,250
we'll use S-sh or secure shell to connect to the E.C to instance over the Internet.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,970
However you should note that S-sh is a little different for Windows versus Mac and Linux.

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,760
And we'll discuss those differences in the next slide.

11
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,690
Once you've connected we'll go ahead and set up Sparc and Jupiter on the ISA to instance let's discuss

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,330
secure shell S-sh stands for a secure shell connection.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,910
If you're on a Windows computer what you will do is you'll watch this lecture all the way through.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,240
We'll go ahead and show you how to set up the E.C to instance and then we'll show you how to connect

15
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,680
through S-sh on a Windows computer.

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,950
If you're on a Mac or Linux computer you're going to watch the first half of this particular lecture

17
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,560
where we set up SETI and then all that you know when you can stop watching and skips the next lecture

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,850
or the S-sh set up for Mac or Linux Mac or Linux actually has a much easier time using S-sh.

19
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,650
It's already built into the operating system so it's just too simple command lines or Windows.

20
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,490
It's a little more complicated than that which is why we're going to show it all in this one lecture

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,050
and I'll let you know when you can finish watching if you're on a Mac or Linux computer.

22
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,820
Basically our overall goal is just to remotely connect to the command line of our virtual machine on

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,390
Amazon too.

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,010
So regardless of what operating system you are using right now.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
Go ahead.

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,200
And go to your U.S. consulate AWOS on Amazon.com and logon.

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,190
I'll let you know when you can stop watching if you are on Mac or Linux if you're on a Windows computer.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,080
You're going to watch this entire lecture.

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,320
Let's go ahead and jump to a though we asked on Amazon.com and log in.

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,220
OK here we go to Amazon.com.

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,320
Where are you going to go ahead and do is click sign into the console.

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,570
Will usually be some sort of button either here or on the top right.

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,410
Go ahead and click on sign into the console and then fill in your e-mail address and your password.

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,350
I'm going to go ahead and do that now.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,650
All right.

36
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,140
Here I am logged into the console and you should see something similar to this.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,450
Now the interface may change but basically what we want to do is figure out how to get to the E.C to

38
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,130
service sometimes silly shortcuts here or quick starts such as launch a virtual machine easy to instance.

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,590
But in case you can't find the here on the main page you can either search for under services will be

40
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,970
under compute easy to or going go in and zoom in a little bit.

41
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,810
You can just click here on the services tab go to compute and you should see E.C to it's under all AWOS

42
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,220
services as well.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,220
If you go too easy to here.

44
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,780
So obviously there's a lot of services but SETI is the one that we're most interested in.

45
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,680
So go ahead and click on that and it will take you to a link that looks like this what you're going

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,260
to go ahead and do is then click on launch instance then you should see some options here.

47
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,200
And it says Choose an Amazon machine image this machine image is basically what operating system you

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,250
want on this virtual computer that we're setting up.

49
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,140
We're going to go ahead and do a scroll down and click on U-Boot to make sure it says free tier eligible

50
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,520
but we don't get charged.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,810
So we're going to go ahead and select Ubuntu then you'll see something that looks like this general

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,800
purpose.

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,230
And these are all the instant types.

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,110
You can create.

55
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,920
We're going to use the free tier micro which is the smallest available besides Nano that it's totally

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,360
free has once you and then one gigabyte of memory.

57
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,500
So it's quite small and it has low to moderate network performance.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,390
You can see later on if you actually do want to pay for higher performance instance types that the actual

59
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,080
memory or gigabytes essentially the RAM goes up to 160.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,010
So there's quite large instances available to you.

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,440
Right now we're just going to use the micro since it's free.

62
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,500
So make sure you use free to you're eligible Otherwise you'll have to pay.

63
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,990
Then I'm going to go ahead and say next configure instance details and here we're going to say a number

64
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,440
of instances is equal to 1.

65
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,920
As I mentioned earlier when we were dealing with SPARK are distributed systems you may have a cluster

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,020
of instances when you're dealing with real huge dataset.

67
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,010
You will put more than one instance here but since we want everything to remain free we're just going

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,890
to use one instance to make sure this is one.

69
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:48,250
Everything else can be on the defaults and we'll go ahead and add storage next the default storage is

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,610
just eight gigabytes.

71
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,140
Go ahead and keep that everything detail everything is the default here and click next tag instance.

72
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,860
And here we can go ahead and create a tag instance.

73
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,610
Go ahead and set this key.

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:10,620
So you something like my Sparke and will set the value equal to my machine.

75
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,410
Doesn't really matter.

76
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,270
But just write these down your key my spark and value my machine.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,030
Next we're going to configure a security group and here you'll see a drop down for a type.

78
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,090
Go ahead and scroll down here click on it and click on all traffic.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,410
You should see create new security group and change types all traffic.

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,310
Everything else can be kept the same.

81
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,770
You'll click on review and launch and you should see a little prompt here that says improve your instances

82
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,790
security your security group is open to the world.

83
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,010
Don't worry about that because you're going to want to be able to easily accessed your instance.

84
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,180
However if you're actually dealing with some sort of company platform you probably don't want your security

85
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,340
to be this open.

86
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,480
But for now since it's only going to be you using it you can just go ahead and leave your instant security

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,030
totally open once you have everything ready.

88
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,270
We have our aboon too.

89
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,150
It's on microdots here once EPU one memory.

90
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,520
You have your security groups.

91
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,990
It's set to all traffic.

92
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,170
Everything's basically just defaulted except the all traffic.

93
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,410
Let's go ahead and launch this by clicking watch.

94
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,350
Here's an important step it's going to say select an existing key pair or create a new key pair where

95
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:32,700
you're going to go ahead and do is say creates a new pair and then you're going to say key pair name

96
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,490
here.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,680
Let's go ahead and type new spark.

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,540
And this is incredibly important.

99
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,950
Click download keep your.

100
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,000
Now you have to download this private key file it's called a dot PTM file.

101
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,230
You can see it pop the pure on my lower left.

102
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,960
You're not going to be able to download this file again after this window.

103
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:59,210
So whatever you do make sure that you say create new key pair type in a key pair name and say download.

104
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,320
Keep hair is absolutely important.

105
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,860
If you don't do this step you'll have to start all over again because there's no way to come back to

106
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,380
this.

107
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,210
So make sure you download the stop PM file.

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,470
Once you've done that you're ready to launch for instance it'll say initialing launch.

109
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,710
And it says your instances are now launching an old man I'll say something like the following.

110
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,250
The following instances launches have been initiated so you can go ahead and click on this instance

111
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,090
and it should take you to something that looks like this.

112
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,490
Will be spending a little while if you actually pay for a larger Amazon web service instance.

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,800
It'll probably be a lot faster than this but here we're going to just wait till it's done.

114
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,980
Implementing in there we have our instant state is running and we have an instant site.

115
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,830
We have a public DNS and those are the things we need.

116
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,920
We have our dopy file.

117
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,100
You can also perform actions on this instance.

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,900
The most important one to know is this terminate.

119
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,030
So this terminate instance is the one you're going to use when you're done with this instance and you

120
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,970
don't want to be running the risk of getting charged anymore.

121
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,290
Now as I mentioned on the free tier you have 750 hours a month for 12 months.

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,510
That's an entire year.

123
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,480
So you can basically keep this thing running for an entire month but really you should terminate it

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,030
once you're done that we don't run any risk of getting charged any extra money.

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,530
You should note extremely cheap to run these things but it can add up over time.

126
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,710
All right so now if you're on a Mac or Linux computer this is it you're done.

127
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,740
We've done everything as far as setting up our easy to instance.

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,330
All you have to do is follow the steps for launching the instance and download the PM file.

129
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,310
Go ahead and skip to the next lecture so you can see how to S-sh connect to your instance.

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,750
All right.

131
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,090
If you're on Windows keep watching we're going to go ahead now and show you how you can connect to this

132
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,950
instance command line.

133
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,810
Now what I want you to do is go ahead and go to Google dot com and a new tab.

134
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,090
So I'm going to go ahead and go to a Google tab and what I want to do is let me zoom in here.

135
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,390
Search for this term.

136
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
S S H.

137
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,240
Space windows space e to.

138
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,010
And it should take you to this connecting to your Linux instance from Windows using putty and I'm going

139
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,420
to leave this link as a resource for the lecture but go out and click on this link.

140
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,300
And you should see a guide here to connecting to your Linux instance from Windows using putty.

141
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,380
This is exactly all the steps we're going to do to actually connect to our Linux instance using Windows

142
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,240
computer when those computers have a little more involved of a process in order to connect.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,770
Mac and Linux it's very easy.

144
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,340
But let's go ahead and walk through all these steps.

145
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,440
I would recommend that you keep this documentation page open while you follow along with me.

146
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,060
That way you have a reference for everything you can do and you can search for this link on Google or

147
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,350
you can actually just click on the resource link in this lecture.

148
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,700
All right.

149
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,390
So let's go ahead and walk through the user guide and I will show step by step what we need to do.

150
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,410
First there are the prerequisites.

151
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,930
Since run a Windows computer we need to install Huddy this is going to allow us to do a secure shell

152
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,660
connection to our easy to instance.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,540
We can do it from the download page.

154
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,880
Go out and click on this link or just google search puttee download.

155
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
You should see a page that looks like this.

156
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,210
You're going to go ahead and click on it go ahead and zoom in here on this download link.

157
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,350
This will take you to a page that looks like this.

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,110
You're going to scroll down so you see these binary.

159
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,710
We need installed to these programs.

160
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:34,360
X-C and then Huddy or he gender X-C to that we need and then we're going to go ahead and save these

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,670
here and call on them when we need them.

162
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,220
So going back here we're going to need to get the idea of the instance you can actually just find it

163
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,290
here and there the instance ID column will need that series of letters and numbers.

164
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:55,470
We need the public via the s name that's located right here Public DNS and then we need to locate the

165
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,920
private key remember that was the dot M-file.

166
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,630
I have that saved under my downloads folder.

167
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,350
And then you need to enable inbound S-sh traffic.

168
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,440
We actually already did that when we select that all traffic when we created the instance.

169
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:09,730
All right.

170
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,740
Next step convert your private key using putty gen so putty doesn't natively support this PM format

171
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,750
so we need to do is follow these instructions to convert it to a private key.

172
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:27,230
So I'm going to click here on puttee Jen launch it and you'll see that you get Windows protected your

173
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,920
PC if you get this message.

174
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,010
Go ahead and click more options and run.

175
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,990
Anyway and then you should see the key generator.

176
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:44,540
So we'll go ahead and start putting Gen and then under type of key to generate will select S-sh to RSA

177
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,360
and then we're going to go ahead and click load in order to find the Dopp M-file.

178
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,760
So click load here.

179
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:07,460
And I'm going to go to my downloads folder go all files and search PTM And here's new spark PTM.

180
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,620
You should see it that it successfully imported the foreign key click OK.

181
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,510
And then I'm going to go ahead and say save the private key.

182
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,290
So I'm going to save private key in a pop up will say Are you sure you want to save this key passphrase

183
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,030
protect it.

184
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:36,630
Go ahead and say yes and I'm going to just save this to my desktop with file name is spark and save

185
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,940
that.

186
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,750
OK so now are private key isn't the correct format to use of putty and we're good to go.

187
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,140
You can then go ahead and close the key generator.

188
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,030
Next we want to start a putty session so we're going to go ahead and use that PPK file that we just

189
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,560
created.

190
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,950
That's our private key.

191
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,730
So go ahead and skip step 1 which is optional say start Huddy.

192
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:06,310
So here we have Ex-Sea in a go ahead and click on that to start it should look like this.

193
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,150
Then the category pain which is this pain right here select session and complete the following fields.

194
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,500
So I'm going to go ahead and come over here.

195
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,030
Notice in the category pain we have session is actually the default here.

196
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,880
We're going to go ahead and say in the host name box enter user name at Public DNS name.

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,280
So if we look over here we have the public DNS name.

198
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,340
I'm going to go ahead and grab that.

199
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:41,750
So in a copy that and then go back to my puttee instance and then paste it here.

200
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,770
And now we need to put in the username for incumbent to user.

201
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,930
You go back here we can see that Ubuntu the user name is Ubuntu.

202
00:13:52,970 --> 00:14:01,650
So coming back to the puttee I tip I paste in this whole DNS address and then say you boon to at that

203
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:10,290
whole address select the under connection type S-sh we have that there ensure that port is 22.

204
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,300
That's correct in the category pane.

205
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,970
Well we're here again expand connection expand S-sh then select a TH for authorization.

206
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:27,630
So category pain expand connection expand S-sh and click on authorization here.

207
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:34,190
We'll go ahead and click Browse and we want to select the PPK file member it was on my desktop and we

208
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,570
call the Huddy spark up PBK.

209
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,110
There it is.

210
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,030
Open it up.

211
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,670
This is an optional.

212
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,240
See but don't worry about it.

213
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,640
We'll go ahead and go to letter d click open to start the session.

214
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,250
When it clicked open here and you should see a security alert.

215
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,660
The service host key is not cached in the registry.

216
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,520
We can trust this so go ahead and say yes obviously you trust that you created this yourself.

217
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,730
If you don't trust this you know you can get a virus or something you were connecting to someone else's

218
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,510
instance.

219
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,510
But this is our own since we created it.

220
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,020
So of course we trust it.

221
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,920
And there you go.

222
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,960
Now we're able to connect directly to Ubuntu.

223
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,410
So this is our virtual server.

224
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:24,420
So if you type in python here you can actually just start using Python so you can say Crantz Hello enter

225
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,110
and there you have hello and then we can go ahead and quit Python.

226
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,110
All right so this is basically a real connection to a virtual computer hosted somewhere through our

227
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,850
command line.

228
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,780
This is the S-sh we're talking about.

229
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,610
And that's all we have to do.

230
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,430
So again you can go ahead and post any questions you have the Q&amp;A forums but basically just follow this

231
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,220
Amazon guide it tells you step by step what to do.

232
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,290
And we just did it step by step on our own computer here.

233
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,030
All right.

234
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,310
Hope you enjoy this lecture.

235
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,750
Hope it was useful to you and feel free to post any questions you have and check out the documentation

236
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,540
in case you get stuck anywhere.

237
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,080
If you're a Windows user go ahead and skip the next lecture because the next lecture just talks about

238
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,600
doing this S-sh process on Mac or Linux computers.

239
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,050
After that lecture we're going to show you how to set up everything through this command line con..

240
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,910
So make sure you keep this open this command line con..

241
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,550
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
