Hello everyone and welcome to this installation options overview lecture.

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.770
It's not time to get your system set up with Python and spark in the Jupiter notebook system.

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.010
This section has lectures covering four main installation options and you're free to choose whichever

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.940
one you want and works best for you.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.610
Or if you already have your own personal setup with SPARK in Python you can basically feel free to skip

6
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.830
this entire section.

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.670
All of the installation options will work on any operating system.

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.490
So if you're in a Windows a Mac or a Linux computer all of these installation options are going to work

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.030
for you because we're either going to link you online to a Linux based system such as a Amazon Web Services

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.000
hosted notebook and you just S-sh into that instance or we'll use a virtual box to set up a Linux based

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.140
system locally or if you're on Linux already you'll just follow the directions.

12
00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.430
So let's explain why we do this and when we focus so much on Linux based systems realistically SPARC

13
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.090
won't be running on a single machine.

14
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.050
That's basically the whole point of SPARC.

15
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.040
Your data is so large that it no longer fits on a single machine and you're going to need to run on

16
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.470
a cluster on a service like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services and these cluster services will pretty

17
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.220
much always be on a Linux based system.

18
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.330
So while you yourself are probably going through this lecture and going through the exercises on one

19
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.700
single machine realistically you're going to be running on a cluster of machines and all those cluster

20
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.560
services are pretty much always running on a Linux based system.

21
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.760
They're not running Mac OS or Windows so understanding the very basics of setting up something through

22
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.860
a Linux command line is really essential to getting smart going in the quote unquote real world.

23
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.000
So we're going to be going over various options that are based on Linux instead of showing you how to

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.360
directly install SPARC on a Windows or iMac because employers in really the real world is really focused

25
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.050
on Linux when it comes to spark which makes sense because they're running on a cluster.

26
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.700
It's going to be in a Linux based system.

27
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.150
But to be clear all of these options will work regardless of your operating system.

28
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.250
So there Linux or buntu based and they're going to work either locally or through an online connection.

29
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.720
So don't think like oh I have a Windows computer or a Mac OS this course is going to work for me all

30
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.200
of the options that are going to show you the four of them will work regardless of your operating system.

31
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.100
The four methods we're going to be covering are setting up Ubuntu SPARC in Python on a virtual box on

32
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.790
your local machine having Amazon E.C to with price on and SPARC showing you a company called data Brick's

33
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.160
which his own notebook system and then also showing you the Zeppelin notebook system on Amazon Web Services

34
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.270
elastic map produce.

35
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.680
Now note this one is not free but let's dive deeper into each option so you can choose the one that's

36
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.460
best for you.

37
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.170
So Ubuntu on a virtual box so this option is going to set up a virtual box on your local computer.

38
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.050
And this works and the operating system and it's going to walk you through having Ubuntu spark in Python

39
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.680
all installed locally on this virtual machine.

40
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.240
So you'll open up either Windows or Mac or Ubuntu and you'll click on this little virtual box and it's

41
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.710
going to act like a virtual computer that's running inside of your computer.

42
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.520
Then there's the Amazon E.C to have Python and spark.

43
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.440
And with this installation process we'll walk you through setting up a free micro instance of Amazon

44
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.740
Web Services of easy to which you can then connect to online through something known as esus H.

45
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.830
And this falls under the Amazon Web Services one year free trial limits.

46
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.510
So it is a micro instance you're not going to actually run any big data on it because we want to keep

47
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.720
it free although you could expand the instance to go beyond micro and have it be a large instance.

48
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.700
But keep in mind you'll have to pay for that.

49
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.420
So in this installation lecture will just kind of show you the free limits and if you want to expand

50
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.230
more than that it's basically just the dropdown menu where you click on a larger instance size and then

51
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.490
we'll also show you the data Brick's notebook system data Brick's itself is a company founded by the

52
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.070
creator of SPARC and currently they have a freely hosted notebook platform the office of a paid version

53
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.520
that supports a variety of SPARC API such as Python or Skala or Java but it's a notebook system that's

54
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.600
freely supported on their platform and we'll check that out and walk you through how to set that up

55
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.670
as an option.

56
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.660
And then finally there's the Amazon Web Services elastic map reduce notebook option which runs on zipline

57
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.890
notebook and the AWOS elastic mapper this platform allows you to quickly set up clusters.

58
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.000
But no this is not a free service.

59
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.720
I think the minimum you have to pay is a dollar an hour but it does allow for a really quick set up

60
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.190
of a large cluster.

61
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.980
So we will walk through this and this EMR notebook does have the ability to connect to an Amazon storage

62
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.560
distance on S3 and we'll walk through that.

63
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.660
But keep in mind you will have to pay money.

64
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.750
You'll have to supply a credit card to actually follow along with that installation lecture.

65
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.100
All right.

66
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.200
So jump to the curriculum page and choose the installation lecture you prefer.

67
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.910
You don't need to go through all of them.

68
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.460
Personally I would recommend the virtual box that we can run everything locally but it's really up to

69
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.880
you.

70
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.970
Whatever works best for your needs.

71
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.970
Okay.

72
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.200
And one last note I really don't feel restricted just to these four options.

73
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.630
The code we work through will work on any platform that has support for Sparc and Python and we have

74
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.760
both the dot PI files and the notebook files for you.

75
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.990
So if you already have something that runs SPARC in Python and just needs those that py files those

76
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.040
are in the zip file notes.

77
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.090
Feel free to use them.

78
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.530
You don't need to use any of the options we describe here but I would recommend they check out the virtual

79
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.420
box to get everything set up locally.

80
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.190
If you don't have that sort of set up yet.

81
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.850
All right with all that being said.

82
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.750
Let's go ahead and get started.

83
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.490
We'll begin auto playing through the installation lectures.

84
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.490
So I would recommend you click on that curriculum tab and jump to whatever lecture you want.

85
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.010
So it doesn't seem like you have to go through all of them and leave yourself about 20 to 30 minutes

86
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.110
for the set up depending on which one you're doing.

87
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.450
Some are much faster than others like the EMR map.

88
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.150
This one is actually really fast but you have to pay for it.

89
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.320
The Virtual Box 1 which is the one I recommend.

90
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.350
Those take a little bit of time to make sure you go through all the steps in order.

91
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.230
So make sure you have enough time to actually walk through everything correctly.

92
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.770
All right.

93
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.330
Thanks.

94
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.110
And we'll see you at the installation lectures.
