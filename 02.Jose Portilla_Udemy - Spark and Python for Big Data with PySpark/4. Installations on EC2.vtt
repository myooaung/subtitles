00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.700
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on insulation on easy to by now you should have already been

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.400
able to S-sh and connect into your E.C to instance either using putty for Windows or directly at the

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.500
terminal for Mac or Linux users.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.900
Everything will do now will be directly through that command line interface.

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.650
So make sure to follow along carefully our tasks for this easy to instance or the following.

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.230
Firstly to actually download and install Sparc and all its dependencies.

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.940
Then we need to install the Jupiter notebook system.

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
We also need to connect it with Paice park and then we'll need to access the easy to do but notebook

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.220
in our local browser.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:49.250
So let's get started by hopping over to our S-sh connection to the actual E.C to instance.

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.410
All right here and connected into my E.C to instance the first thing I want to do is type sudo apt get

12
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.310
update.

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.850
And this is going to update my ability to install certain things such as Pipp 3 for installing accesses

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.020
into Python once said then sudo apt get update.

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.580
I can clear my console here to give myself a little more room and then all I need to do is say sudo

16
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.680
apt install and I will type in Python 3 dash Pipp hit enter and what this is going to do is it's going

17
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.620
to install Pipp 3 which will then allow me to install Python packages so his wife.

18
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.940
Yes and then I will fast forward in time for this to be finished installing Pipp 3.

19
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:41.800
Once that is done installing Pipp 3 we can clear the console and then type Pipp 3 install Jupiter hit

20
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.390
enter and then that's going to collect the uninstalled Jupiter for us.

21
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.900
So I will fast forward in time for this to finish.

22
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.070
OK so that finished installing Jupiter.

23
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.320
Now I just want to install Sparke get that set up do a few things with configuring Jupiter notebook

24
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.420
and then we should be ready after that to hop over to the browser and for the full connection.

25
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.770
But first let's focus on installing Sparc and going to clear my console again.

26
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.110
Just search things nice and clean and then I will install Java in case we don't have it yet.

27
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.480
You can just say sudo app get install and then type in default dash.

28
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.040
J R E.

29
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.230
Hit enter hit y for continue.

30
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.210
And then this is going to install Java for us.

31
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.880
So Java needs to be there in order for Scollard to be there and Scotland has to be there in order for

32
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.490
Sparc to be there so we'll let this go and I'm going to hop forward in time for Java to finish installing

33
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.060
once Chavez finished installing he should be able to confirm by typing Java based bash version enter

34
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.190
and it should say something like.

35
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.530
Open open JDK version etc..

36
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.330
Some sort of output like this.

37
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.980
So the next thing to do is a really similar command.

38
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.440
Sudo apt get.

39
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.930
Except this time we're going to install Skala.

40
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.980
So say sudo apt get install Skala hit enter.

41
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.470
So like why to continue installing Skala and let that go again.

42
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.660
I'm going to hop forward for this to install.

43
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.000
Looks like it have to is pretty quick and we can check on this by saying Scala.

44
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.570
That version should be attached to the version hit enter.

45
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.890
You should see some sort of report back like two point eleven version of Scala.

46
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.760
Great.

47
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.570
Now we want to do is actually install the PI for J library though we need to connect Python to Java

48
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.730
and then we also want to install Sparc and Hadoop.

49
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.920
So to install PI for J say pitte 3 install py for J and enter and then that's going to quickly install

50
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.970
PI for J and next thing I want to do is just install the actual SPARC library so I'm going to clear

51
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.300
my console and then type in the following and this is basically going to be a connection to a U R L

52
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.850
So it's going to be a bit of a long typing spree but don't worry it's not so bad.

53
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:13.900
First you need to do is say W get than say HTP colon forward slash forward slash archive Apache dot

54
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:24.700
org slash DSTO for distribution slash Sparke slash spark to point one point one you can change that

55
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.990
version number if you want.

56
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.000
If you're doing this in the future time and then will say spark dash to point one point one dash bin

57
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.280
Dash could do and will be using two point seven and then say Dot T GZ.

58
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.700
All right so once you've done all that you'll hit enter and basically what this is going to do is it's

59
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.210
going to dilute that TGT file from the Apache or archives.

60
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.810
So this may take one or two minutes so I'm going to fast forward in time until it's done.

61
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.280
Once we have that TDC file we can unzip it.

62
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.000
So I will say sudo tar.

63
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:12.140
Dash z x the F and then if you begin typing Sparke you can hit TAB autocomplete to get that entire file.

64
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.790
Hit enter and it is basically going to install SPARC for us as well as Hadoop.

65
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:24.170
So once that's done you should be able to ls and list everything and what I want you to do is CD into

66
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.850
SPARC.

67
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.960
And then once you're CD into that spark folder type P.W. the print working directory you should see

68
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.110
something that looks like this home Ubuntu and then whatever version of SPARC you have.

69
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.830
This is a really important file path that we're going to need to use later on when we actually are dealing

70
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.160
with the Jupiter notebooks or remember that file path right here.

71
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.870
OK so I'm going to see the back to my home directory clear my console and our ready for the next step.

72
00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:03.350
And then once this is clear I'm going to type Pipp three install and then find the spark enter and sort

73
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.040
of find spark module is going to help us connect Python with SPARK really easily.

74
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:16.680
So once that's installed the next thing to do is type Jupiter notebook space dash dash generate dash

75
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.750
config then hit enter.

76
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.820
So that's going to generate this Jupiter notebook config that PI file inside of home.

77
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.920
Boon to that Jupiter slash and then the actual PI file.

78
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.760
What I want to do now is in my home directory going to create another directory called certs for certification.

79
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.620
So in case you're not in your home directory and following along you should be there but type CD to

80
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.270
confirm that you're there and then say M-K DJR for make directory and then type inserts.

81
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.410
Then we're going to change directory into service and then we're going to type in the following command.

82
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.670
You'll say pseudo open.

83
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:13.800
S S L R E Q space dash x 5 0 9 dash nodes dash days 365 for 365 days a week then we'll say dash Nuki

84
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.560
then say our as a colon.

85
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.040
1 0 2 4.

86
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.650
Then the next thing you have to do is space bash key outs.

87
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.740
You can say mine are pm and then say dash out my Sir P..

88
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.920
So be careful with this one.

89
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:41.170
But basically what this is doing is creating some PM files that we're going to use for our Jupiter configuration

90
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.840
file.

91
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.320
So hit enter and it should prompt you for some information like the country name so you can type in

92
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.410
something like US state or province I'm in California.

93
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.490
If you don't want to fill these out you can just enter and it will just leave blanks for you there and

94
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.680
that's totally OK.

95
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.300
So if you don't keep hitting enter and then eventually you'll get back to your actual command line.

96
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.240
So we've created the certifications and we generate a configuration file.

97
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.310
We need to do is edit that current figuration file.

98
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:17.390
So type CD then this tilt symbol forward slash Jupiter forward slash enter.

99
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.310
And now we're in that hidden directory for Jupiter and we are going to use a visual editor or vi to

100
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.460
edit the file.

101
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:31.380
So type VI and then start typing Jupiter and you should be able to tab autocomplete to say Vi Jupiter

102
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:39.370
underscore notebook underscore config that PI hit enter and then what we see here is the actual PI file.

103
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:46.080
So it may look a little dark but basically this is a PI file and everything in blue here is commented

104
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.380
out.

105
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.460
So we wanted to insert some things into the file in order to do that we need press on her keyboard and

106
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.050
that will allow you to insert things.

107
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.120
Notice how the bottom changed there and we're going to type in the following at the top of this file.

108
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:12.110
C is equal to get underscore config close parentheses then see the notebook app the search file is equal

109
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:28.390
to you and then single quo forward slash home to boon to slash certs slash my Sir PTM and then close

110
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.200
that single quote.

111
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.420
So we have that string basically telling it your certification files over there.

112
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.820
Then we're going to do is tell it to run an all IP addresses of this instance.

113
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.380
So see the notebook app.

114
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.150
The IP is equal to.

115
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.050
And then in single quotes again as a string just put an asterix there which essentially saying OK run

116
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.730
this on all IP addresses.

117
00:09:51.730 --> 00:10:00.000
We also don't want to open the notebook browser by default to say See Dot notebook app open underscore

118
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.630
browser.

119
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.400
So let me make sure I type that right.

120
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.800
Browser is equal to false.

121
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.890
And then finally we will fix this to port 8 8 8 8.

122
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:20.220
So I'll say See that notebook app that Portes equal to 8 8 8 8.

123
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.210
OK once we've done this in order to escape out of this insert method you hit escape on your keyboard

124
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:33.530
and that will end this escape or excuse me and the insert method and then we want to do is type a colon.

125
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.510
So that's two thoughts.

126
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.460
And immediately you'll see at the bottom of the console you have these two colons or the colon there

127
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.960
and then type w q.

128
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.260
So that's right quick and then an exclamation point to actually execute this enter.

129
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.290
And this will essentially write that information to that Jupiter notebook config file.

130
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.900
Great.

131
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.750
So now we should be ready to go.

132
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.530
So what I will do is type CD to come back home and then I'm going to run Jupiter space notebook hit

133
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.450
enter.

134
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.540
And we should see something that looks like this.

135
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.340
And notice that it says copy and paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time.

136
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.530
So that's exactly what we need to do to copy this entire ordeal.

137
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.600
So if you're using putty on windows you can't really do a right click or a control see.

138
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.730
You need to do it just highlight this and then that's it.

139
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:30.400
Once you've highlighted it should be copied and pasted into your actual clipboard.

140
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:37.280
So now what we need to do after we copy and paste this is replace this local host with the actual AWOS

141
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.890
DNS address that's located in our console on a.

142
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.520
So let me show you how to do that.

143
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.880
So basically again just highlight this if you're on Windows you're ready to go if you're on a Mac or

144
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.620
Linux just copy and paste this you are l and let's upload it to the browser and show you how to finish

145
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.410
everything.

146
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.780
OK here I am at my browser and I've pasted this HD local host a.

147
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.330
And then plus that long token into my browser right now and nothing's going to connect because I need

148
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.220
to change this local host into my actual E.S. to address.

149
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.330
So come over to your easy to con..

150
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.700
And down here if you're easy to instant selected you should see the public DNS which is the sky right

151
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.280
here.

152
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:23.560
So you're going to copy this guy and then put it in here and replace local host with that address so

153
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.120
paste it in and then we're going to hit enter here.

154
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.330
You should see something that says oh this is not secure because it doesn't know whether or not are

155
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.580
easy to instance is actually trying to steal information from us.

156
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:41.140
But we created this easy to instance we know it's safe so click here on advanced and then click on proceed

157
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.600
to E.S. to and eventually you will find your Jew Bruno book system perfect.

158
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.450
So here we have our Jupiter notebook system I'm going to zoom in a little bit so it looks more readable

159
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.310
to you guys.

160
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.330
And let's practice this so I'll create new Python 3 notebook.

161
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.060
And then once this is loaded up we're going to be able to import PI spark by using the find that spark

162
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.980
library.

163
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:10.240
So remember previously I said remember that specific file path of where SPARC is saved you're going

164
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.470
to need that in order to successfully connect Python with SPARC.

165
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:19.690
So I will say import Paice Sparc and if I just run this I should get an error and it says hey no module

166
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.560
named PI Sparc and that's where we're going to use find a spark to connect it.

167
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.250
So we're going to import fine spark.

168
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.990
Now we just need to find spark where our spark is located.

169
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:40.510
So what we do is say find spark in it to initiate and then as a string I'm going to paste in that specific

170
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.240
file path.

171
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.090
And if you've been following along you should have the exact same file path I have which is home Ubuntu

172
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.670
and then that SPARC folder do shift enter to run that cell once you've run that you should be able to

173
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.490
say import Paice spark shift enter.

174
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.070
And now we don't get any errors.

175
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.910
It's been able to successfully connect with fine spark and that way don't have to deal with any of those

176
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.770
export commands that you may see in other tutorials if you're familiar with exporting stuff and setting

177
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.250
bash RC as your source.

178
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.690
You can go ahead and do that method.

179
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.090
I find this method a little more flexible and just easier because it's simply two lines of code and

180
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.010
you can just put it straight in the notebook.

181
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.720
OK.

182
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:23.200
So congratulations you've successfully set up Amazon C-2 as well as SPARK and WS with Python and Sparke.

183
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.700
So how do you actually end this process.

184
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.560
Well remember that this is still running on free tier but there are limits to that if you want to just

185
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:40.540
turn this off or you can end up doing is as an action in this state you can select stop if you're ready

186
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.730
to lose everything lose all your data just kind of terminate and delete this instance completely.

187
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.840
We end up doing is hitting here on terminate.

188
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.230
So that's what I'm going to do right now.

189
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.070
If you intend to come back to this you're going to stop and start it if you want to just end everything

190
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.240
hit terminate.

191
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.190
So that's what I'm going to do.

192
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.280
And then it will ask you if you want to terminate.

193
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.250
And I'm going to terminate this.

194
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.190
All right.

195
00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.730
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
