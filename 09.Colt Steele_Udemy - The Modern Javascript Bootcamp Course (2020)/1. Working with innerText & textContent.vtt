00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.460
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.870
Now that we've seen step one of this process where we select elements we saw a bunch of different methods

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.100
that we can use to select elements once we have them.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.760
Once we have selected them we usually want to do something with them instead of just putting them in

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.970
variables for no reason or cancelled out logging them.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.520
Typically we manipulate them in some way.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.930
Manipulation is it's not exactly the best term because sometimes we are manipulating the elements.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.900
We might be changing their styles.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.690
We might be inserting a new element inside of them.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.420
We might be removing that element.

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
But other times we're just accessing data and that's not I wouldn't call that manipulation.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.710
We're just trying to figure out what is the contents of this div or what number did the user just click

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500
on or what.

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
What information is in the form that is more accessing.

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.050
And we're also going to cover that in this section.

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.610
So manipulation is just the umbrella term.

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.000
The unfortunate thing about the dome is when you're learning it you take a look at any document and

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.740
or any element that you select.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.930
There are so many properties so many methods as we've already seen a couple of times.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.950
It definitely can be overwhelming.

21
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.830
But we're going to narrow it down to some of the most important methods and properties you need to know.

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.810
And these are the ones that nine more than nine times out of 10 probably I don't know.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.170
Forty eight times out of 50 I guess I could reduce down.

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830
Let's just say most of the time you end up using these methods.

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.140
These are the methods and properties that we use to style elements to create new elements to change

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.800
attributes to add a class to an element or remove a class.

27
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.440
There's so many different things that we do.

28
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.590
This subset of methods and properties what do we have like 18 maybe 20 this subset is the majority of

29
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.700
what you'll need to make most projects and to get by using the dump.

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.690
So in this section we're gonna just take these piece by piece.

31
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.820
We're gonna start in this video by talking about accessing text from an element.

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.010
How do we get the contents of an element.

33
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.410
So we're gonna focus on this corner here.

34
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.830
Enter text and text content.

35
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.410
All right.

36
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.890
So I'm working with the same dummy Web page.

37
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.210
It doesn't matter I'm just doing something simple but this applies to any any web page you could open.

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.820
We could do it on MDL and we could do it on Wikipedia on Facebook although I just wouldn't want to show

39
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.150
you my Facebook account but we could we open up the console or we run code from a script where we select

40
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.590
an element.

41
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.220
So why don't we start there.

42
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.630
Let's select this H1.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.770
So how do we select it.

44
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.320
Document dot.

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.140
And we have a bunch of options but I'm going to do query selector.

46
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.410
There's only one H1 and I want the first one anyway.

47
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.590
So we'll do this we'll save it to a variable cost H1 and the first property we'll see is called inter

48
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.100
text so enter text is going to give me the text that is in between the tags right there.

49
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.080
So here's the opening H1 here's the closing inter text is this right there.

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.380
So that's how it behaves on a simple element like an H1.

51
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.990
But what if we have content nested inside.

52
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.430
Let's see if we have a good example of this scroll down.

53
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.530
We do have this.

54
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.750
Well if I were to run you l dot inter text.

55
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.680
Let's see what we get.

56
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.520
So I mean I select the UL with my query selector on UL there's only.

57
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.220
Well there's multiple actually.

58
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.020
So we'll just take the first one because all the wells have allies inside and then we'll call this variable.

59
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.110
Well so if I do you well that inter text here's what we get.

60
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.110
First thing second thing third thing.

61
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.620
So this was the well that we selected.

62
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.650
You can see it highlighted when I type you well and my console and the text that was located inside

63
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.610
of it was nested.

64
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.840
It's not a direct child of the well it's inside of an ally.

65
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.910
So we have carrots we have peas we have broccoli or actually we have first thing second thing and third

66
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.820
thing they're not directly located in the well they're first instead of an ally.

67
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.440
But when we use inner text on an element we get all of the text inside of it.

68
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.750
So we could also do this document dump body which is a reference to the entire body.

69
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.540
We don't have to do query selector of body although that should work if never done that before.

70
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.140
But I'm sure that does work.

71
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.110
Yeah but we have a shortcut which is just document our body.

72
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.330
It's a property that's always on the document.

73
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.180
And if I do enter text on that we get all of the text from my web page.

74
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.980
It doesn't matter how many elements deep it is if it's buried or nested down it extracts all the text.

75
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.340
So this is the text from my web page.

76
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.580
Now reading enter text is great.

77
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.340
That's useful sometimes.

78
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.090
But also we can change elements we can manipulate the text.

79
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.440
It's just another property on an object.

80
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
And if we change it the browser is going to update to reflect that.

81
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.540
So we have our each one dot enter text if I want to change it I can change it to how about I'm hungry

82
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.940
Let's do double quotes I'm hungry and there we go.

83
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.300
It updated.

84
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.880
Now this change obviously is in the console.

85
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.680
It's not permanent.

86
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.860
If I were to refresh my page it's gone.

87
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.870
I could add it to a script like I have over here and then it would run each time and I would see it

88
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.670
but it's kind of silly to update the entire text of an H1 as soon as the page loads.

89
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.230
Why not just update the HMO.

90
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.140
But that's where events come in where we can update something based off of an event.

91
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.640
User clicking a hover.

92
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.750
For now we're just learning the basics of changing elements.

93
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.630
So that's the basics of inter text.

94
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.160
If I were to do something like document body or any element let's do that you know you well dot in our

95
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.800
text.

96
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:46.140
Remember that the U.S. has nested content inside it has allies and this text is coming from the allies.

97
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:55.720
If I do you well don't enter text equals I am a big well and I hit enter all of that stuff is gone.

98
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.650
So what we had originally was this we had to do well with three allies when I changed in our text even

99
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.620
though the inner text we see is only this we're not seeing those elements when I set inner text on something

100
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.380
it just puts the text right there.

101
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.530
So not a great idea to do that if you're actually trying to preserve the content you had before but

102
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.300
we can use this when we're trying to update you know a heading or a caption or if we just know that

103
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.680
there's not content inside that we're going to lose.

104
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.600
Now there's also a second property we can use to access the inner text or the text content of an element

105
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.300
and that property is called text content.

106
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.220
So on the surface it seems exactly the same as inner text if we like the H1 again I'm going to scroll

107
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.870
up I refresh the page by the way.

108
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.660
So we lost the change when it said I'm hungry but if I look at each one dot enter text it's my web page

109
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.000
each one does text content which is the other property we're about to see.

110
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.720
We get the same thing.

111
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.610
So it seems like they both are identical.

112
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.660
I can set text content I'll change this to I am not hungry and an update.

113
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.030
OK.

114
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.330
Same as enter text.

115
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.100
But now let's work with this paragraph here.

116
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.070
This paragraph has an idea of Main and for some reason it's spaced really oddly.

117
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.470
Some of this stuff is on separate lines.

118
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:23.320
Let's say that I'm going to leave that I'll indent this here I'll add an extra return let's save I'll

119
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:30.970
format it oddly like this and I'm also going to add in a script tag not that you really should put a

120
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.430
script tag instead of a paragraph but I'm going to to illustrate something I'll put a console dot log

121
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.330
here.

122
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.970
Hello everyone and save.

123
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:48.020
So now we have our formatted HMO or our formatted text with some weird returns and indentation.

124
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.360
And then we have a script tag.

125
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.950
Let's refresh the page.

126
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.270
Let's select that paragraph.

127
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.680
Here's our constant log.

128
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.460
Hello everyone.

129
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.270
So we'll do a document that query selector of the idea of Maine.

130
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.130
We could also do get element by I.D. save this to a variable or call it p and let's look at p dot inner

131
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.600
text.

132
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:08.910
Okay.

133
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.110
So it's purely the text no formatting.

134
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.860
We don't get anything about that script.

135
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.770
It's just the text.

136
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.820
Now if we look at PDA text content.

137
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.020
Okay so it has the same text but it also has that spacing.

138
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.610
It knows about the returns we had in there.

139
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:33.140
It knows about this script text so it doesn't include the script element or the tags but the text in

140
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.000
there is considered text.

141
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.100
So that's probably not ideal.

142
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:43.810
Most of the time at least and we end up getting it all with text content so that is a significant difference.

143
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.040
Also if I had something that was hidden in this paragraph.

144
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.100
A good example would be if I added a bold tag maybe or a span or some other tag let's do a bold tag

145
00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:02.510
around some of this content like that and then let's say for some reason I decide to do an inline style

146
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.800
just to make it easier.

147
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.520
I'll say display none so we should not see this phrase here.

148
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.440
Whatever percent Tim autumn autumn.

149
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.390
If I refresh it's gone we don't see it showing up here.

150
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.230
But if I run those same lines I select AP I look at Inter text.

151
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.210
It's not here.

152
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.400
Now if I do the same thing with text content it's right here.

153
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.110
Percent tiem Autumn.

154
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.640
Same thing with our console dot log.

155
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.860
So enter text is going to be aware of what is actually showing up on the page.

156
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.630
For example our script text does not show up.

157
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:46.730
Nobody sees this in the browser window unless they open up the inspector or the dev tools versus with

158
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.800
text content.

159
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.980
It doesn't care at all.

160
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.590
It just gives us the inner text of that element from the actual HDMI file.

161
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.080
It goes into this element and it just takes all the text and all the text it can find.

162
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.170
It cuts out those tags.

163
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.300
Cuts out the B tag.

164
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.680
So this and we get the text including the script text.

165
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.310
So I almost always use enter text.

166
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.190
It's good to know though that text content is faster.

167
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.150
Another one of those situations where it really doesn't matter but I feel like I should say it.

168
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.460
It's such a tiny difference.

169
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.110
Most of the time it would be imperceptible but the reason it's faster is because it doesn't have to

170
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.410
do any of this stuff where it calculates what's actually showing what's on the screen right now.

171
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:32.330
It just gives you everything it vomits it out so that's inner text and text content you can use both

172
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:38.030
of them to access the text but there are some differences as we saw and you can use either to update

173
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.580
the text within an element.

174
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.590
You just have to be careful if there's other stuff in there and you update it using either one you're

175
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.520
going to overwrite.

176
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.900
What was there before.

177
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.290
All right.

178
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.680
So those are two new properties inter text and text content.
