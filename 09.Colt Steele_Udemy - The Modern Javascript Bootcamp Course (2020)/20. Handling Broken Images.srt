1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,110
OK.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:05,140
So our autocomplete definitely looks great but like I just mentioned there's a couple more things we

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,540
need to do for it.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,440
So first off we need to make sure that whenever we fetch a new list of videos we clear out the existing

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,800
ones inside there.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,170
That's gonna be pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,480
So let's take care of that task first.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,770
So the big question here is when should we clear out the existing list.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,350
Well remember inside of on input we are making a request to fetch our data right here after we fetch

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,950
some data.

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:33,370
We should probably clear out any existing items before we attempt to add any more in the right above

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,960
or we have dropdown class list.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,170
Add let's add in some code to take a look at our results wrapper.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,030
Remember that is the thing that is going to eventually contain all the different rendered results that

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,620
we get the right above dropdown class list.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,670
Add I will add in results wrapper and to clear the thing out we could do a simple enter each CML is

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,200
empty string like so let's save that.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:07,190
I'm going to flip back over do a refresh and I'll search for Avengers and I'll do a search for Dark

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,560
Knight and there we go.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,990
That's much better.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,700
Now one thing you might notice as I search for Dark Knight and you might see this or you might not.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,340
It looks like the last result in here has a broken image and inside my console I also see an error as

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,000
well.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,990
So you might not see that.

25
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,190
It really depends upon the movie that you are searching for.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,610
Let's take a look at the API response so we're getting inside of our network request tab and try to

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,630
understand why we are seeing a broken image there.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,600
So I'm going to open up my most recent request to the API.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm going to take a look at the list of results we get back.

30
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,290
I'm going to select dark knight right there.

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,470
Do you notice that in this case we have a poster property of an eight.

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,300
Which means that there is no poster image available.

33
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,390
Normally that poster is going to be the link to the actual image.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,270
The reason that we're seeing this error is that we're essentially throwing in the string and a as an

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,570
image source and we can actually confirm that by inspecting that element inspecting the image you'll

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,930
see that the image very plainly has an S or C of N A.

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,420
And that's why we're seeing this nasty error down here.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,650
So to get this fixed and again you might not be seeing this yet but you probably will eventually.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,820
We just have to add in a check or an A essentially and make sure that we ever see it.

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,710
Well we probably just don't want to show the image at all so to do so I'm going to go back over going

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,780
to find where we create the inner each team L for each individual option.

42
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,580
So that's where we create the image right there so all we have to do is add in a quick check beforehand

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,260
to decide whether or not we want to show this image to do so right after we create the option.

44
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm going to say const image S R C like so and I'm going to use a little ternary expression here.

45
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:06,230
So going to say if item dot poster remember the capital P is equal to N slash a then I want to assign

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,240
a value of empty string to image s RC.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,720
Otherwise if it is not equal to N A.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,290
I want to you assign item dot capital P poster to image as RC instead.

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,810
So again this is a Turner expression.

50
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,500
We're going to first evaluate that expression right there.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,390
If that is a truth the expression then we're going to return whatever is between the question mark and

52
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,380
the colon.

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,560
Otherwise if that is false C we will assign item not poster over to image that s RC.

54
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,280
So now we can use image as our C in place of movie poster.

55
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,480
If we show an image element with an empty string it's essentially just not going to show up inside the

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,820
dom.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,310
Well it's going to technically show up on the dom but it won't show up on the screen which is going

58
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,820
to solve this issue.

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,890
Going to put image s RC inside there like so.

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,770
All right.

61
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:01,400
So going to refresh I'm gonna look for dark knight again and it looks like I probably made a typo inside

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,570
there.

63
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,460
Sorry I called it item it is not item it is movie that is better.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,740
My mistake.

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,890
That's better.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,380
I'll do Dark Knight and the last one down here.

67
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,430
Don't have an image fully fine.

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,030
That's life.

69
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,670
There is no image to show but we are not trying to show some like non existing image and showing a broken

70
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,200
image ranking like that.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,860
So this stuff looks good.

72
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,800
I think the last big thing we have to take care of is to make sure whenever user clicks out of the input

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,610
like I'm clicking over here right now we need to make sure that we close this thing up.

74
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,740
So let's figure out how we can do that in the next video.
