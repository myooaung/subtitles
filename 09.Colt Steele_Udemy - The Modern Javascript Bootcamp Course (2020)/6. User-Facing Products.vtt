00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.470
In this video we're going to start to work on our main landing page for our application.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
So from a data standpoint this is going to be pretty straightforward considering everything that we've

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.080
already done inside this course.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
Essentially all we have to do is get a listing of all of our different products and display them on

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.820
the screen.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.670
The only hard part of this landing page is going to be figuring out the cart mechanics.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.860
So really the Add To Cart button right there.

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.380
But to get started let's just start to create a couple of different files that we know that we're going

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.080
to need to show a listing like this.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.420
So first off inside of our routes directory inside of routes directly as opposed to admin we're going

11
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.470
to create a new file called products that J.S..

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.870
So this is going to be our set of root handlers related to products that are exposed to all users of

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.330
our application up to this point we've been working on admin products not us and that had all the different

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.030
root handlers related to the admin dashboard so I know that having these two files named very similar

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.100
will be very confusing.

16
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.700
But at the end of the day this really is the best approach we are delineating between the purpose of

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.850
these two different files with the same name because one is inside the admin directory so inside of

18
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.630
our new product store J.S. file we can create a new router.

19
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.310
We're then going to associate some different routes with it export it and wired up to our main express

20
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.600
app back inside of index dot J.S..

21
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.890
We've gone through this process once before.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.320
So let's go through it rather quickly now.

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.300
It's at the very top I'm going to first require an express

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.690
I'll then use that to create a new router

25
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.090
and then I'll associate a root handler with get.

26
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.830
So we're gonna say that the root root of our application so forward slash is going to show this big

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.240
listing of products.

28
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.210
So this is our home page to show a home page with express the root handler we're going to write out.

29
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.150
Is this right here.

30
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.980
So it's a get request to our root root then it pass in an async function.

31
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.460
I know it's going to be async because we're going to eventually want to get a listing of all of our

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.140
products out of our products repository inside of your then at the bottom.

33
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.920
We'll leave this thing empty for right now.

34
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.780
We'll do a module that exports of router let's save this.

35
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.240
Let's go back to our root index dot j ust file and we will wire up this router just as we have the other

36
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.760
two so inside of my root index not J.S. to get my products router roots products.

37
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.490
And now in this case you'll see that our naming terminology actually is a little bit harmful.

38
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.730
We have two routers that are really dealing with products.

39
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.910
So are we going to call one products router and the other products router.

40
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.340
Well no.

41
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.580
The first one is for our administrative functions.

42
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.290
So going to add in products admin router or better yet admin products router like so the first one because

43
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.030
it is dealing with admin administrative functions we'll call that one admin products router and the

44
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.390
new one will be simply products router to make sure that you require statement for the router we just

45
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.160
added is going to routes slash products no admin.

46
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.080
So this is the user facing products router then go down to our apt use we don't have to update the existing

47
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.500
apt use since we kind of just took over that variable name so instead I need to add in a new app not

48
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:29.600
use for admin products router so inside of here I'll do apt use admin products router OK let's save

49
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.790
this now we can go back over to our products file inside the roots directory.

50
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.430
So this is the one we just created and for now I'll just do a quick dot send of products like so let's

51
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.160
save this we'll go back over to our browser and test out this route route very quickly so go to a local

52
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.970
host three thousand and once there I'll see the text products appear on the screen.

53
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.440
Okay.

54
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.380
Simple enough.

55
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.410
Let's take a pause right here.

56
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.400
When we come back the next video we'll start to work on some different views for listing out these products.

57
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.560
We'll need to probably make sure that we also display a different layout as well because we want one

58
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.050
layout for our administrative functions and probably a different one entirely for all of our user facing

59
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.650
stuff as well so quick we'll get started on that in just a moment.
