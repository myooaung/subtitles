00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.110
Now that we have done a little bit of project setup I want to give you some high level notes on the

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.580
matter J J.S. library.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.770
Just so you know matter J S has some really good documentation and you can always read it by going to

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.010
the main page the 3M dot Io slash matter dash J.S. add in funding documentation on the left hand side

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.890
on the left here.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.390
You're going to see all the different objects inside of this library.

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.030
I'm going to tell you about all the different objects you need to be aware of.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.640
But if you get get stuck at any point in time throughout this application you can always come and check

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.390
out the documentation to get a better idea of exactly what we're working with inside this library.

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.840
I want to give you a couple of highlights of the different things we're going to be working with in

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.420
here.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.490
In general this is just going to be some terminology so that you understand some of the code that we're

13
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.830
going to be writing very soon.

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.220
OK.

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.310
So here are some of the important pieces of terminology that you need to be aware of.

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.290
The first piece of terminology that is used inside the matter J.S. library is world.

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.190
This is an object that contains all the different things or shapes inside of our application.

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.860
So if we go back over to the official docs or the official page and take a look at all the demos and

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.200
look at the mixed shape demo you're going to see a bunch of different shapes all over the screen.

20
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.750
The entire scene that we see right here is essentially represented inside of that world object.

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.590
So this world thing that we're talking about right here it tracks the location position speed because

22
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.840
see how these things can move.

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.280
So the velocity of each item as well they all get tracked inside that world object the next piece of

24
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.680
terminology we need to be aware of is engine.

25
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.470
This is a object that has a bunch of different functions in it that's going to read in the current state

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280
of the world from the world object.

27
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.330
So the world object knows where every shape is right now.

28
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.480
It knows every shapes velocity weights and so on.

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
The engine is going to read in all that data and it's going to calculate changes in positions for all

30
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.930
those different shapes so we can imagine that the world is kind of like a snapshot of everything.

31
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.750
As it stands in an instant in time the engine is responsible for transitioning from one snapshot to

32
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.790
another the runner is what makes the world an engine work together.

33
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.000
So the runner is going to essentially run about 60 times per second until the engine to process all

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.100
the data stored inside the world object the next big thing is the render object.

35
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.070
So when ever the engine processes an update and says OK here's a new snapshot of data here's a new version

36
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
of the world the render object is going to take a look at all those different shapes and it's going

37
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.170
to show them all on the screen to the render object is essentially what takes all of our data and shows

38
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.080
it in this little element right here that we're playing around with finally last piece of terminology

39
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.550
is body.

40
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.160
This is going to be a shape that gets displayed.

41
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.540
There are many different types of bodies available to us when we're making use of matter J.S. so we

42
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.780
can create a body that represents a circle or a rectangle or an oval or a triangle or just about anything

43
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.470
else.

44
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.860
Any kind of arbitrary shaped polygon can be created using the body object to the application that we're

45
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.550
going to create.

46
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.940
The Maze game is going to have many of these different bodies inside of it.

47
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.880
Now what we're going to mention here is that I'm going over this terminology rather quickly because

48
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.040
at the end of the day you don't really need to understand the terminology here to right a matter J.S.

49
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.260
application that's kind of beauty of it.

50
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.650
The only reason I'm telling you about these different pieces of terminology is that we're going to very

51
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.460
quickly start to write some kind of boilerplate code to set our application up.

52
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.360
And so I just want you to have some idea of what all these different terms mean for the purpose of writing

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.730
that boilerplate code.

54
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.630
But honestly it's essentially write that code once to set up the application and that's pretty much

55
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.030
it.

56
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.480
After that the only things that we really need to be aware of is the body object because the vast majority

57
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.470
of code that we're going to write inside our application is all about showing different bodies on the

58
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.290
screen essentially the different walls of our maze and the bald at the user is going to be manipulating

59
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.870
and this green square at the bottom every shape inside of this diagram right here will be represented

60
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.150
inside of our our app with a body.

61
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.010
So again we really just need to understand what a body is and all those other pieces of terminology.

62
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.370
I'm just throwing out there so that you're vaguely aware that they exist okay.

63
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.550
So now we've got a little bit of terminology put together.

64
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.650
Let's take one more pause.

65
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.690
We'll start writing some code in the next video.
