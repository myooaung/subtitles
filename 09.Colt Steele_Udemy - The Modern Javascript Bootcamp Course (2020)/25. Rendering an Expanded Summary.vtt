1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.630
Like I just mentioned now that we've got this expanded piece of information about the movie.

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to start to write out a lot of different HCM L to get that kind of structure right there.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.970
We're going to end up printing out several different properties about the movie that are not shown inside

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.080
this mockup.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.960
So in reality we're not going to only show the box office taking critic rating.

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.080
We're also going to show stuff like the awards that the movie won and the number of votes that it's

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.530
gotten on MTV.

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.010
The rating on MTV and so on.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.620
So couple other elements besides what is just pictured inside of your now I'm going to tell you right

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.850
up front that we're going to write out a lot of each team out to get this structure inside this video

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.980
all the e-mail that we are about to write in all the class names are essentially taken directly from

12
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.990
the boma CSX framework.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.480
Remember we discussed that this project is using this framework a little bit ago.

14
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.300
So essentially I went through I looked took a look at all the documentation and I figured out some HMO

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.510
structure and class names they would give us something that looks like this right here.

16
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.620
So I'm not making up all these class names and whatnot off the top of my head instead.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.290
These are all corresponding to styling sets that are included inside of home.

18
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.060
OK.

19
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.520
So let's go back over year on movie select right here.

20
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.810
That's where we just got our response with all the information about one particular movie.

21
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.720
So we're going to take that object right there pull off a ton of different properties from it and stick

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.250
it into some big HMO snippets.

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.390
This is going to end up being a lot of HDL.

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.530
So rather than stuffing it all inside of on movie select I'm going to instead make another helper function

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.860
called Movie template.

26
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm going to receive an argument to this function that I will call movie detail.

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.560
I'm calling it movie detail right here.

28
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.100
Just to be clear that argument is going to be this really big object with all the specific properties

29
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.460
of a movie just to distinguish between the movie objects that we had back up here.

30
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.030
This movie object right here is more like a movie summary.

31
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.650
It just has the title the poster and like year and one or two other properties.

32
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.520
That's pretty much it.

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.770
So I just want to have these two different variable names movie versus movie detail to indicate that

34
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.880
this is just like an abbreviated object of all the different movie properties.

35
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.120
This is like the detailed object about all the different movies properties then I'm going to inside

36
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.490
of here movie template I'm going to return a multi line string.

37
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440
So once again set it back ticks.

38
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.350
And inside there we're going to write out a whole bunch of HCM CML.

39
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.700
And again this is all about getting that content right there on the screen.

40
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.520
So let's get to it.

41
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.380
Lot of writing they're going to write that out rather quickly.

42
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.850
Please triple check your spelling as you're going through this.

43
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.080
I'm going to do an article with a class of media or close off the article I'll put in a figure with

44
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.010
a class of media dash left.

45
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.540
Close up the figure I'm going to do a paragraph element with a class of image

46
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.140
and side there in image but they S.R. see I'm going to put in the double quotes because remember we

47
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.630
need those when we are trying to stick some image source inside this tag and we're going to get the

48
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.930
poster property of the movie detail.

49
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.700
So here's that object that we're working with right now.

50
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.170
We want that poster property right there with a capital P so for the source.

51
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.180
I'll do dollar sign.

52
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.930
Curly braces and then movie detail dot poster with a capital P and I'll close off the image tag like

53
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.600
so okay.

54
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.120
So that's the first block.

55
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.640
Now we're going to add on something after the closing figure tag.

56
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.830
So after the closing figure tag I'll do a div with the class of media dash content was off the div.

57
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.800
Inside there I'll do a deal with the class of content those off the div and inside there I'll do an

58
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.430
H1.

59
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.800
I'm gonna reference once again a job script variable so dollar sign curly braces I'll get movie detail

60
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.550
dot title that's gimme the title the movie as usual.

61
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:12.140
Notice the capital T for title then do an H for an inside their movie detailed dot genre.

62
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.840
That's gonna be the genre of the movie so is it an action movie a mystery horror suspense drama whatever

63
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.360
else.

64
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.620
Then after the H for a paragraph with dollar sign curly brace and you want just be consistent.

65
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.450
This really should be on the same or a single line.

66
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.170
It's a dollar sign curly braces.

67
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.830
Movie dot plot that's going to be a plot summary of the movie I want to remind you that all these movie

68
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.270
detail properties so poster title genre and plot should all have starting capital letters let's save

69
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.690
this really quickly.

70
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.030
We're going to try to call movie template.

71
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.550
We're gonna pass in our movie detail that we just got back from the AP IP up here and then we're going

72
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.860
to append that somewhere into the dom.

73
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.140
So we're essentially just going to test out just that snippet right there.

74
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.270
We're not done with all the e-mail that we need but we've got enough that we should just do a very quick

75
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.100
test to make sure that we don't have anything too crazy.

76
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.570
OK.

77
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.800
So the first thing we need to do is to make sure that we have somewhere to render this template inside

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.980
of our dom.

79
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.980
So I going to go back into my index start each simple file right after my autocomplete element.

80
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.590
I'm gonna put in a div with an I.D. of summary.

81
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.120
We are going to eventually replace this element but we're going to leave it here for now.

82
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.440
For testing purposes and then back inside of index dot J.S. I will find on Ruby select I'm going to

83
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:45.530
delete the console log I'll do a document dot query selector and we're gonna do a selector of pound

84
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.570
and get that element that we just put in there.

85
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.080
Summary

86
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.320
and I'll say inter each CML will be essentially that string right there.

87
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.950
So to get that string we're going to call movie template and we'll pass in response dot data which is

88
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.220
that big movie object that we just saw at our console just a moment ago.

89
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.490
All right.

90
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.770
So let's save this.

91
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.310
We'll go back over and just do a quick test.

92
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.060
Again this is just to make sure that we don't have any errors in the HDMI that we just wrote out.

93
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.200
So I will again go for Avengers like it and I think I've got a typo somewhere because it says here movie

94
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.840
is not defined so I definitely accidentally wrote out movie instead of Oh yeah right there I'm mistake

95
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.980
put movie instead of movie detail that's better.

96
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
It's going to save that let's try it again Avengers click it.

97
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.980
There we go.

98
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.710
All right.

99
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.150
So we've got something on the screen and it looks kind of reasonable right now and it looks very similar

100
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.440
or somewhat similar to what we said we were trying to build right there.

101
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.660
OK.

102
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.070
So this is good progress.

103
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.280
Let's take a quick pause right here.

104
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.620
When we come back the next video we're gonna start to write out another block of HD e-mail to show all

105
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.670
the stats about the movie underneath what we have so far.

106
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.590
So a quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
