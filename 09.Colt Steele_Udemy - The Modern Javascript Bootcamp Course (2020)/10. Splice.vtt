00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.180
Next up we have another method called Splice.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.910
It's quite a bit different than sliced.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
Even though they sound similar Splice is also a little trickier to understand.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.180
There are at least three different values that we can pass it.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.650
So in short what it does is it either removes elements or replaces elements or adds in new elements

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.580
in an array.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.440
So usually you would do it in the middle of an array because if you were just trying to remove or add

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.280
to the beginning or end we already have pushed pop shift and unchecked.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.580
But if you want to update the middle of an array or add something like right here you could use Splice.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.470
So there are three arguments.

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.290
We have the start index.

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.880
Then how many things you want to delete.

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.910
And then whatever you want to insert.

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.760
So you don't have to insert anything and you don't have to delete anything but those are the three values.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
So let me show you a couple of examples here I have this same animals array.

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:03.240
Let's say I wanted to insert something after shark so I can call animals dot splice and then the first

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.260
argument is where I want to start either removing or inserting and then the second argument is how many

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.100
things to delete.

19
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.800
You can see the hint I'm getting here in my console.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.980
So the start index how many should you delete.

21
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.350
We're going to delete zero because I'm simply adding in something at index of 1.

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.210
And what would make sense to add here.

23
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.130
Let's do another thing that swims.

24
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.340
How about octopus okay.

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.130
We'll look at animals and now you can see shark then octopus.

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.410
Also notice splice returned an empty array.

27
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370
This is because I didn't delete anything.

28
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
If I did delete something it would return to me those deleted values.

29
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.570
So let's try using it just to delete not to insert.

30
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.540
So how about we delete.

31
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.890
Let's go with a whale and bear.

32
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.480
So we want to start at this index which is 0 1 2 3.

33
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.170
So animals dot splice starting at index of three.

34
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.310
How many things do we want to delete too.

35
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.190
And we won't insert anything.

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.950
So if I do this you can see it returns to me an array containing the two deleted items and now animals

37
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.740
is two item shorter.

38
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.010
OK.

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.380
So we've seen two use cases you can insert values we just inserted one but we could insert multiple

40
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:36.040
if I did the same thing animals dot splice and Let's insert How about in between salmon and lizard we'll

41
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.550
add a couple values so we would do index of 2 because 0 1 2 gives us salmon.

42
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.000
Actually if I want to go in between salmon and lizard I should actually start inserting an index of

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.030
three so that I can keep salmon where it is.

44
00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.750
We will remove zero and then let's add in a snake and what's another I guess a frog.

45
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.190
Okay look at animals now.

46
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.930
And we have octopus salmon and then snake frog and then back to Lizard and tortoise.

47
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.720
So we've seen how to use it to insert something or multiple values.

48
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.840
You just make sure you remove zero.

49
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.260
You do have to put that zero there.

50
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.700
Otherwise you would confuse splice because it would see snake as the next value and thank you.

51
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.630
This is the number of items to delete because the second argument is always supposed to be the number

52
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.040
of things to delete.

53
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.010
It's not smart enough to figure out oh that's a string.

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
It's all order dependent.

55
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.050
We can also use it to delete as we've seen.

56
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.660
Like here you start with index of three.

57
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.230
We want to delete two things but we can also use it to replace.

58
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.140
So for some reason let's say I want to replace shark an octopus with uppercase versions.

59
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.930
I could do this.

60
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.350
Animals dot splice here I'll clear this.

61
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.410
So we have more room up top.

62
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.060
OK so animals that splice and I will start an index of zero.

63
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.140
I want to delete two items.

64
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.790
And here are the replacements shark and octopus.

65
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.440
There we go and let's look at animals.

66
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.170
Now we have shark and octopus at the start all right.

67
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.050
I wrote up a little bit of notice here for you take a look at the downloaded code of the downloadable

68
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.470
code up top I have the basic pattern we need to follow.

69
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.830
Start index the count of how many things to delete and then optionally a bunch of items to insert or

70
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.480
one item.

71
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.920
So here's the first use case we saw inserting with Splice where you want to start inserting we'll delete

72
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.250
nothing and we'll add an octopus.

73
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.890
So we end up with this.

74
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.880
Then we start deleting where we don't insert anything we just say started index 5 delete count is 2.

75
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.390
So we end up deleting two items the lizard and tortoise.

76
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.080
And then replacing with Splice combines all of that where we start with an index.

77
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.920
We say delete two things and then also add two things in at that same index.

78
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.870
So we're effectively replacing items in the middle of the array.

79
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.220
So Splice is very powerful in my experience.

80
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.440
You still use push and pop and shift and on shift far far more often than you will use splice but Splice

81
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.270
is nice in those situations.

82
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.710
Splice is nice in those situations when you need to do something in the middle of an array or you need

83
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.050
to delete a big chunk or replace a chunk instead of working with one item at a time like push and pop.
