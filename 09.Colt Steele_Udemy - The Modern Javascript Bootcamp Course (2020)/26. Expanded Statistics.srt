1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,310
All right let's keep writing out some HCM L to show all the stats underneath this movie.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,530
It's a back inside my coat.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,000
I'll find the movie template function.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,960
We will go down to the bottom and we're going to add in just a little bit more each female here.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,940
So after the closing article element I'm going to place another article I'm going to give it a class

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,110
of notification and then a space is Dash.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:33,800
Primary and then close off the article and inside of here I'll do a paragraph tag with the class of

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,320
title was it off and inside there we're going to reference movie detail dot awards.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,580
So this is going to be a string summary of all of the different awards that this movie has won.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,290
We'll see exactly what it looks like in the dorm and just a second after that.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,210
I'm going to put in essentially a label for this statistic.

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:01,410
So I'll do another paragraph element with the class of sub title and inside of there I'll say simply

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,620
a words like so OK.

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,510
So this right here this article element we're going to essentially duplicate this down several times

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,610
and inside of every duplicated version we're going to be referencing a different property off of movie

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,450
detail and b giving each them a different label as well.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430
So I'm going to take this article element.

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,130
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to copy it down four times.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:36,150
So here's one to read and for now we'll go through each of these and update some the different properties.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm going to go up find the first one I'll go to the second one and I'm gonna change the second one

21
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:52,480
from awards right there to box office I'll change the label right underneath that to box office as well.

22
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,950
Next up I'll go to number three.

23
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:00,650
I'm going to change that one to awards to medal score I'll change the label to Metta score.

24
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,370
So again this is like a rating essentially of the movie the next one.

25
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,370
So a second last one I am D.B. rating.

26
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,030
Notice how in this case I has a lower case as opposed to all the other property names that start with

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,000
the capital a label will be I am DV rating.

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,370
So this is the rating of the movie according to the website.

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,690
I am D.B. and finally on the last one will change it to.

30
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,830
I am D.B. boats and I am D.B. boats.

31
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,480
That's the number of votes that this movie has gotten on.

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
I am DV By different users of that platform.

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,510
That's pretty much it.

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,410
Let's save this.

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,210
We've got five different properties here.

36
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,890
Like I said a couple added beyond just the two that we had mentioned over here back in our original

37
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,140
mockup.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,350
I'll save that file.

39
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,550
I will refresh a look for Avengers like it.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,880
And there we go.

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,500
Now I see the Avengers.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,610
I see the awards that this movie has won box office take metal score the rating on I am DV in the number

43
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,940
of votes that the movie has gotten on I am DV as well.

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,840
That's pretty much it.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,990
That's like stage 1 of our application.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,820
We now have the ability to search for a movie.

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,050
We've got some autocomplete functionality in there.

48
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,110
Once the user selects the movie we show a lot of information about it on the screen.

49
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,170
So now we essentially just have to do a lot of duplicate work.

50
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,630
We essentially need to duplicate everything we just did and show a second auto complete on the right

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,440
hand side of the screen and then once we have all the same functionality for that auto well then just

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,270
need to make sure that when we search for two different movies we compare all the different statistics

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,520
and highlight the higher ones in each category.

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,140
That's some pretty good progress.

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,500
Let's take a pause right here and start on this next phase in the next video.
