All right my friends we've pretty much handled the entire authentication side and it actually looks

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.210
kind of reasonable at this point as well.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
So in this video we're gonna start to get back on track and focus on the original application we were

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.540
building which is this kind of e commerce application so we still have to put together the entire product

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.330
listing functionality the shopping cart stuff we have to finish up the admin panel and allow users to

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.810
create edit and delete products as well.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.550
I know that seems like a lot of work considering how much time we spent on this stuff so far but honestly

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.950
we have covered just about 90 or 95 percent of everything that you need to understand about Express

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.540
J.S. so everything that we're going to do from this point on is mostly just a bunch of typing.

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.090
It's really just repeating everything that we've already learned everything is going to be really just

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.780
very repetitive from this point on.

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.820
So we're still gonna have forms that require validation.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.250
We're going to do some H generation to list out elements like so all that kind of good stuff just repeated

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.840
over and over the next we're going to focus on is the product listing and product creation features

15
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.630
on the admin panels specifically.

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.160
We really have to finish up the admin panel before we worry about listing out products to our users

17
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
or even implementing these shopping cart is it doesn't make sense to try to list our products or implement

18
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.190
the shopping cart until we have some actual products added to our application.

19
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.450
Let's take a quick pause right here.

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
When come back the next video we're gonna start to work on the ability for a user to list out products

21
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.250
and create them edit them delete them and so on.
