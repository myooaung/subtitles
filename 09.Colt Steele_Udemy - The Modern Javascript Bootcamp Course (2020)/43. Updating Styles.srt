1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,100
All right.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,730
Let's get to it.

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,980
Let's run our comparison on both sides.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,850
The first thing you've to do is select all these different articles and we need to make sure that we

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,850
keep the two different sets separate as a quick reminder if we open up our element inspector again the

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:20,270
entire summary on the left hand side is enclosed inside of a div with an I.D. of left dash summary.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,780
So if I want to get all the articles that have a statistic inside of there I can select a document query

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,000
selector I.D. left dash summary that's going to give me essentially the entire left side and then I

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,730
can find all of the elements inside there with a class of notification.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:46,560
So I'll do inside of that a query selector of DOT notification.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,970
I want to do a query selector.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,830
My mistake on do a query selector.

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,870
All that will give me all of them.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,730
There we go there's my list of five.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,740
I've got all five on the left hand side the three clear we don't actually have to run the two separate

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,510
query selectors.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,410
We could actually reduce that down to just one.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,240
So I could do.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,890
Document doc query selector all and then say inside of the Left summary element find all the elements

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,710
with notification and that will still give me all five on the left hand side.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,690
So that's how we're going to make sure that we get all five on the left and all five on the right.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,940
So back over here inside of run comparison we're going to get all the elements on the left and right

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,380
I'll say How about left side stats that's like the statistics being rendered out on the left hand side

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:45,580
will be document dot query selector all and then we want I.D. the left side would we call it left or

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:55,240
left summary my mistake not notification then we can do the same thing for right side stats.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:09,360
Now the document dot query selector all right dash summary not notification.

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,460
All right.

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,400
So now we can loop over either one of these and at each step we can take the corresponding element from

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
the other pair or essentially you'd like the right hand side and we could do our comparison by retrieving

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,680
the data set values.

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,420
So I'm going to try to iterate over each element inside of left side stats.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:39,050
So I'm going to do a left side stats dot for each so I'm going to get my callback function right here.

33
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,130
I'm going to receive each article element I will call them left stat.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,110
So again that represents an article element that is going to have that data set value that we really

35
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,020
care about.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,540
And I'm also going to get the index of that element inside of left side stats as well.

37
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,130
The reason I'm getting the index right there is that I can retrieve the appropriate corresponding stat

38
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,010
from right side stats.

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:10,340
So I'll say right stat is right side stats at index and then again just to make sure we're doing everything

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:18,660
correctly here I'll do a console log of left stat and right stat it's all safe.

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:29,400
Go back over to the refresh I'll look for Avengers Dark Knight and there we go.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,890
We've got our console logs so we can see that each of these console log peers are the two corresponding

43
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,240
article elements that go with each other.

44
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,610
So like that one and that one and then the box office box office metal score metal score I'm DV rating

45
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,310
and so on.

46
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,310
Then inside of here we're going to do first get the actual value property off of each of these.

47
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm gonna say left side value is going to be left stat and to get a data set property remember we refer

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,630
to data sets and then the name of that data property on that element.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
So in our case we call the data property's value.

50
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:14,850
So we would reference that value property with data set dot value and then we can get the right hand

51
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:23,120
side with right side value is right side or something right stat dataset not value as well.

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,240
So now inside of here we can do our comparison directly between the two.

53
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,750
Again take note that this comparison process right here because we assign the stats up front inside

54
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,790
of our movie template we don't care about the order in which these different stats occur they can occur

55
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,380
in any different order.

56
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,250
We can have the box office value then the rating then the better score or the totally opposite.

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,350
And it just doesn't matter.

58
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,810
All we have to do is make sure that we are iterating through the same properties on both sides at the

59
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,750
same time some of the words we could not show like first of words over here and then first box office

60
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,520
over here.

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,480
That's the only thing that we could not do inside of here.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:09,640
I'll say if right side value is greater than left side value that means the right side is greater.

63
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,830
And that means that we want to add a class to the left hand side.

64
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,330
That's going to turn it yellow instead of the default green.

65
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,750
So to make sure that we turn the left side yellow we would run left stat which remember is the actual

66
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:31,200
article element I you look at the class list I'm going to remove the is primary which is what makes

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,640
it green.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,200
Again this is some class names coming from bonus SS and then on the left stat class list.

69
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,170
I will add in is Dash warning and that's what's going to turn yellow.

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,820
Now we can repeat the same process for the opposite case as well.

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:06:01,040
So I'll say else right stat class list remove is primary and right stat class list add is Dash warning

72
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,430
all right.

73
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,080
So that should be it.

74
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,690
So here it is.

75
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,190
This is our moment of truth.

76
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,340
This should be like the entire application all put together.

77
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,280
Let's do our final test so I will do a refresh.

78
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm gonna look for Avengers look for dark knight.

79
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,660
There we go.

80
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,130
And all right that is it and it's looking pretty good.

81
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,330
So we can look through all these different stats and we should see that these stats that are green are

82
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,770
greater than the ones in yellow.

83
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,530
So first off we've got like 118 wins versus the like 300 and change.

84
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,640
So definitely the correct one is green while the Avengers had a higher box office value.

85
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,540
So that definitely won out.

86
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,010
However dark knight has a better medal score better idea rating and more votes as well.

87
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,410
So that's pretty much it.

88
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,650
That is the whole application.

89
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,790
Well I hope you enjoyed putting this thing together.

90
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,780
Let's take a quick pause right here when we come back next video we're going to do a quick review on

91
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,180
some of the important points around this application.
