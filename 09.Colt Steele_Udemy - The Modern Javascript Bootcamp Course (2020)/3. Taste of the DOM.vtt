WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.300
Now that we have all that housekeeping out of the way all the Tim Allen CSX prerequisites we can now

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.430
dive into the dam.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.550
Very fun stuff.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.410
We're going to start in this video with kind of a taste of the dam.

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.150
I'm going to show you some code different snippets we'll play around and tweak a web page.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.680
And the goal is not for you to understand every line or remember it because I'm showing you code that

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.200
we'll see in this section later on or two sections from now.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.460
We're kind of looking ahead.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750
So it's it's more of a sneak peek.

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:38.040
OK so the Document Object Model or the DOM is our window into H2 mounts the SS and the web page in general

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.580
through javascript.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.950
It is our portal into the world of a web page so we can write JavaScript that can figure out how many

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.820
each ones are on a page or how many inputs or in a form or we can get the value from a form if a user

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.140
is typing into the form.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.160
We can change the value of a form.

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900
We could change images make them bigger.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.060
We can change styles of anything we could add animations.

19
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.450
We can listen for clicks or drags or hovers or any sort of event that a user could trigger and then

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.660
have some behavior that happens in response a user clicks on a game piece.

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.440
And it will change color or if a user clicks and drags a chess piece when they drop that chess piece

22
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.430
you should check.

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.960
We should write code that checks.

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.520
Is it a valid move if it is then move that chess piece to the square.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.200
If there's a piece there already then replace that piece and remove the captured piece from the board.

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.640
We add logic in with javascript that controls that interacts with that reads and understands the contents

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.920
of a page and the key thing to understand about all of this is the object part Document Object Model.

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.130
When you're web page loads up whatever the web pages.

29
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.860
This simple one that we were doing here in the last video when it loads up the browser is going to turn

30
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.700
it into a bunch of objects just JavaScript objects and these objects are all constructed and put together

31
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.140
to form the Dom.

32
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.830
It is a virtual representation or a javascript representation of the content on a page and it consists

33
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.900
of a bunch of JavaScript objects.

34
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.930
So I probably spent way too long making this image but we have each team LCROSS and some other stuff

35
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.460
that goes in and the browser interprets it it reads it and it creates the DOM for you it spits out JavaScript

36
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.510
objects representing the H came out and representing the CSX.

37
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.670
So here's a simple example of what I'm talking about.

38
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
If this was our HMO a very simple Web page we have an H1.

39
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100
We have a well we have two allies.

40
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.640
The browser will read this in which on its own doesn't mean anything it's just text its text content

41
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.990
the whole job of the browser is to display it in a way that makes sense to humans to make this larger.

42
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.320
To make this a bullet point if it's inside of a well so the browser reads it it does all that.

43
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.020
And at the same time it creates a virtual representation a javascript object of the H1.

44
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.880
There's another object for the well another object for the ally and another for the ally.

45
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.460
So that's what this is representing over here.

46
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.310
Each one of these little circles or nodes is an object.

47
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.130
They're telling you that I'm an object.

48
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.950
Me too.

49
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.580
In case you had any doubts.

50
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.750
So there objects and those objects have a bunch of different properties.

51
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.640
The simplest one that we could see from here would be what their content is what text is inside the

52
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.660
object water plants.

53
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.010
OK.

54
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.700
So we have one that has a property called text or something like that.

55
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.550
It's actually called inter text set to water plants.

56
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.210
We also have tons of other properties for different attributes CSF styles.

57
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.140
We have methods that we can use so that I could delete one of these with JavaScript and it would be

58
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.700
deleted from my web page.

59
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.490
I could update one of them and change the text.

60
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.280
I could even change the type of element I could instead of having an H1 I could replace it with an H2.

61
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.940
All of that is done through javascript where we interact with these objects.

62
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.210
All right.

63
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.580
So now for the part that is the taste of the Dom a little preview of where we're going.

64
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.280
So among Google dot com just the regular home page I mean I just type some code in the console.

65
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.570
The first thing we'll see is proof that we get a bunch of objects that Dom just consists of objects.

66
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.100
So why don't we pick something maybe this button right here.

67
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.460
It is an input does it have an I.D..

68
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.500
It doesn't have an idea.

69
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.840
OK.

70
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.700
This one has an idea.

71
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.840
Is this the I'm Feeling Lucky button.

72
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.840
I'm going to copy this idea and use that to select that element.

73
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.900
So this is new.

74
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.850
You haven't seen it before.

75
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.980
Or at least not in this course.

76
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.510
Don't worry about it.

77
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.280
I hate saying that but don't.

78
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.780
Don't stress about what it is.

79
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.370
Okay.

80
00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.160
So if I save this to a variable contact button object if I look at that button object I've selected

81
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.180
based off of some I.D. and I have a representation of it.

82
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.420
Unfortunately in the console it looks like it's not an object it looks like it's just HMO.

83
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.890
But if I do console dot DVR which you've seen a couple times.

84
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.550
Button object and open this up you can see it's just a regular javascript object.

85
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.330
It's massive.

86
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.330
It has tons of properties tons and tons of methods and properties here and they all relate to this one

87
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.980
button.

88
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.600
Let's take a look at one of them.

89
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.850
How about the value of the button.

90
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.430
If I scroll down go down to value it's set to I'm feeling lucky.

91
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.160
We also have things like classes and ideas.

92
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.830
If I go up to I where are you.

93
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.670
H I J K.

94
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.420
There we go.

95
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.430
Here's the I.D. We have attributes like hidden.

96
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.320
So this is not a hidden element.

97
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.350
So it's set to false.

98
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.790
We have tons of other things that we're not going to get into right now but you can see that it's an

99
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.590
object and everything we see on this page is represented with his own javascript object.

100
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.750
But let's start with this one.

101
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:13.730
So we have our button Obi J and I can read the value of that button which is I'm feeling lucky.

102
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.290
I could also change it.

103
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.410
I could set it to something else.

104
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.760
I am not lucky.

105
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.580
Does anybody use the I'm Feeling Lucky.

106
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.190
I haven't.

107
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.480
Not on purpose at least.

108
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.470
And we can see we just changed it.

109
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.740
It now says I am not lucky.

110
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.000
So that's our first interaction with a.

111
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.090
The page loaded all this HMO was turned into stuff we see visually and at the same time it was turned

112
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.650
into JavaScript objects.

113
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.760
We can select and interact with those objects.

114
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.930
We can change them in JavaScript.

115
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:52.520
It's just like if I had an object here where I had a value set too for just call this oh and then I

116
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.760
said Oh Dot value is now equal to 56.

117
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.520
The main difference of course is that when I change 0 dot value nothing happens.

118
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.740
Oh is different.

119
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.280
But there's no side effect.

120
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.530
The browser doesn't care.

121
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.530
It's not changed.

122
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.350
But when I change one of these objects from the DRM there is an impact.

123
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.640
It's reflected in what we see.

124
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.440
So changing this javascript object is linked to seeing that change in the page.

125
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.810
So when we change a style when we change the text when we add new elements we do it through JavaScript

126
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.340
objects and then the browser knows about it the browser knows hey this thing just changed.

127
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.010
I better update it for the user or in the browser so that we can see that change.

128
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.720
And we'll try one more fun mildly fun thing not not exceedingly fun.

129
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.620
We're going to add an event.

130
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:46.310
So when I hover over this button I want to console that log something or change the text although it's

131
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.700
already being changed here.

132
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.070
We get this nice animation that's from Google.

133
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.220
We're not going to deal with it.

134
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.070
So why don't we just start by alerting something.

135
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.370
So we have our button object B10 Obi J.

136
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.420
And again this is something we haven't seen before.

137
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.850
But we will see it.

138
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.740
So we're not going to go into detail here but this says at an event listener ups add event listener

139
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.950
to the button the event we're listening for is a mouse over and then here's the function I want to run

140
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.090
when I do mouse over and I'll just do an alert.

141
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.280
Hi OK.

142
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.830
Let's see what happens.

143
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.430
There we go.

144
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.410
I get high every time I hover over that button anywhere else.

145
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.360
It doesn't change nothing happens but I go over that button.

146
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.700
We get a nice alert so we can replace that code with anything else.

147
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.010
Usually we don't alert.

148
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.080
We might change the content of the button.

149
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.230
We might instead.

150
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.840
We could I mean we could do anything.

151
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.880
We could change the color.

152
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.780
We could add new elements to the page.

153
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.180
We could delete every single thing from the page.

154
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.520
We could animate things.

155
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.460
We could send a request to get information from an API.

156
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.060
It doesn't matter what we do.

157
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.560
But the point here is that we can do it.

158
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.030
We can run code when an event happens or when it occurs based off of a particular element.

159
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.130
In this case that button.

160
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.220
So we will get to events in due time.

161
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.940
First we've got to start with the basics of the Dom and in the next video I'm actually gonna do one

162
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.130
more kind of fun demo where we're really going to just wreck this home page for Google.

163
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.230
We're going to animate everything so that it just randomly bounces around and rotates.

164
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.900
It's gonna be kind of fun maybe.

165
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.110
But if you don't feel like watching that you just want to get to code and you want to start from the

166
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.910
beginning.

167
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.510
That will be two videos from now.

168
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.800
The next video is just another taste of the Dom part two.

169
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.070
All right.

170
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.880
So to summarize everything we saw here the dumb document object model is just a bunch of objects.

171
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.080
Plain old JavaScript objects we've worked with them before but not ones this large not ones that have

172
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.790
so many methods and properties.

173
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:55.490
These are made by the browser based off of the incoming content the H2 mount and CSX other information

174
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.540
about a web page.

175
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:02.180
It's all turned into a javascript representation of objects that we can use we can interact with and

176
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.960
we can change.
