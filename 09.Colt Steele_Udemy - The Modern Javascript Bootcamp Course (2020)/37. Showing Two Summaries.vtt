00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.440
All right.

2
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.320
Last thing we really have to do here is to make sure that when a user selects one of those movies we

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.790
show a summary on the appropriate side of the screen.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.890
So the first thing we have to do is to make sure that we have some div elements to render the summaries

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.730
into.

6
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.020
Remember at the bottom the index not just file.

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.350
We still have the movie template function.

8
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.840
So we essentially know what content we want to show.

9
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.770
We just need to make sure that we have someplace to put it inside of index not.

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.620
I'm going to find where my div of left autocomplete is right after it.

11
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm gonna add in a div with an I.D. of left dash summary and close it off and I'll do the same thing

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.060
right after the right autocomplete as well.

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.490
So it did with an idea of right dash summary

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.960
now all we need to do is to make sure that whenever on movie select gets called we render the summary

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.130
into the appropriate element under the left side or the right side.

16
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.150
Let's make this happen.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.830
We're probably going to have to have two versions of either on movie select or two versions of on option

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.930
select up here.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.280
Remember right now we're using the same version of On option select between both the left hand side

20
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.710
autocomplete and the right hand side.

21
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.930
So I think that we should probably take on option select and then throw it down into each individual

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.310
call to create autocomplete and that will allow us to make a customized version for each one to do so

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.160
and to go up to my autocomplete config.

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.620
I'm going to cut on option select out

25
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.550
then go down to my calls to create autocomplete one into and I'm going to paste that thing in so paste

26
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.620
and paste I'll make sure that I get a comma on the line right above otherwise I'll see an error very

27
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.030
quickly.

28
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.070
Now this one right here is for the left hand side and this one right here is the right hand side so

29
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.670
to make sure that we actually render these summary into the appropriate element.

30
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.320
Let's make sure that when we call on movie select in both cases as a second element I'm gonna pass in

31
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.350
a reference to an element of where to render the summary to So on the first one which is responsible

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.940
for the left hand side.

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.890
I'll get a document where he selector or pound left dash summary and I'll do the same thing for the

34
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.330
second one as well.

35
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.680
Document dot query selector hound write dash summary so now inside of on movie select we can receive

36
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.380
that second argument.

37
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.700
So in addition to movie we received that other argument as like how about summary target or something

38
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.540
like that have a summary element that makes sense then we're going to do that request to get more details

39
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.150
about the selected movie and then instead of throwing the rendered template inside of some summary element

40
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.410
that doesn't exist anymore.

41
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.050
Instead we're going to throw it into the inner each smell of that summary element.

42
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.510
It's gonna replace that very selector with summary element.

43
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.810
So let's save this and do a quick test go back over a look for Avengers once again for the milling time

44
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.070
look at and there's my summary on the left hand side my schedule to do Dark Knight look at and see the

45
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.610
summary on the right hand side.

46
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.340
Nashville to go between both these and just make sure that they've got the appropriate values or I should

47
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.320
just say different values to make sure that we're not actually leaking data from like one side to another

48
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.350
thing looking through and yep it all looks good.

49
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.410
Okay.

50
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.740
So now the very last thing we have to do here to really complete our application.

51
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.510
Remember the last requirement of our project was to compare both the different stats and we need to

52
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.760
make sure that we colored the greater stat on each side of the screen.

53
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.330
This is going to be a little bit more challenging than it seems because in some cases comparing these

54
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.720
things is actually kind of challenging for example how do we really compare this string right here with

55
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.250
this string.

56
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.020
How do we compare this number right here.

57
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.160
This is a string when it comes back from API we know it's the string because it has the dollar sign

58
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.260
and the commas in there.

59
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.170
So how do we compare that string versus that string.

60
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.700
It's pretty clear I think that we're going to have to figure out some ways to really compare these different

61
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.320
statistics and in some cases it might require some special logic.

62
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.510
So one last pause and we're going to fear that stuff out in the next video.
