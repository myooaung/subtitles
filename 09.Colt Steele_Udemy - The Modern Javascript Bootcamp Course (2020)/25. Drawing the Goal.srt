1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,640
In this video we're going to focus on showing the goal on the very bottom right corner of our maze.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,290
The goal is always going to be exactly right.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,500
You're on the bottom right hand corner.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,070
So this calculation is going to be pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,930
We just have to be aware that we probably want to adjust the size of the goal based upon our unit length

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,260
or essentially the size of each individual cell.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,490
So in other words if we have really large cells as we do right now we want to have a really large goal

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,340
that fills up most of that space.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,840
But if we have some very small cells like back just a second ago when I showed cells of 20 or 30 then

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,010
in this case we want the goal down here to be really really small instead.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,890
So essentially we just need the goal rectangle or the rectangle that represents the goal to be just

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,750
about scaling itself with the size of our different cells it's going go back over I can go down to the

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,780
very bottom and down here I'm going to create a new variable called goal.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,250
This is going to be a body start rectangle and then right away I'm not gonna worry about the configuration

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,730
just yet.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,230
Instead I'll add in the code to add this thing to our world so we'll say World dot add world and goal.

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,830
So let's think about how we're going to calculate the arguments for the rectangle.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,110
Remember the first two arguments are going to be the x and y coordinates to the center of the goal okay.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,320
So quick diagram 3 essentially saying that we just want to draw a rectangle like right here and we need

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,550
to find the coordinates to that point.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:36,430
So something like this right here we can see how that lines up with the center and about this right

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,400
here again can see that kind of lines up with the center.

23
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,470
In this case it's really not going to be that hard.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,350
We know that the overall width of this thing is our canvas with the that's the.

25
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:59,840
Like overall width and we know that the overall height is going to be height so we want to essentially

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,950
take the full width and the full height and then subtract the width of half of a cell.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,810
That right there is one half of a cell and we are calling the variable that represents the cell dimension.

28
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:18,860
Remember we are calling that unit length so essentially the center point to that rectangle is going

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:31,710
to be our width of the overall canvas minus unit length divided by two and then the y components will

30
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,940
be the overall height minus

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,580
unit length divided by two.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,950
And that's pretty much it so let's take that information go back over it and added in so the x coordinate

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,410
is going to be by with minus unit length divided by two.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,180
And remember this with variable right here is a reference back to the overall width of our canvas and

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,300
my y will be the height minus unit length divided by two.

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,380
Once again I made a typo right there on unit length so I can get that fixed up.

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,820
All right.

38
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,510
And that's pretty much it.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,620
So now we need to make sure that the size of this rectangle so its height and width which are the third

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,000
and fourth arguments also scale with the unit length.

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,740
You can imagine that if we always had a fixed height and width to the rectangle itself as soon as we

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,560
start to scale down the maze as we have right here.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,510
Well the rectangle would be way too large inside of here.

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,890
But to make sure that this thing scales we can just do a unit length and then multiply that by like

45
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,500
point seven or something.

46
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,550
So that means I want the rectangle size to just scale with the size of a cell.

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,910
So I want the cell to essentially be 70 percent of the size of a cell.

48
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,600
I could do a unit like again times.

49
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,660
Point seven and finally I do want this thing to be static so I don't want it to move around they'll

50
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,330
say is static is true

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,190
yes I'll save this I'm going to make sure that my cell's variable back up at the top is back at three.

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,960
So we'll do a test with a very simple case to start I'll go back over refresh and there's our goal now

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,750
having the goal up here as this kind of outline and not that great.

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,550
It's really not clear to a user what that is all about re centrally going to add in a feel to it as

55
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,540
opposed to have it in a wireframe mode.

56
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,300
Once we add in a fill we can make the thing Green and will be a lot more obvious to our users that they're

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,730
trying to like navigate to that thing right there now that definitely looks good.

58
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:38,250
But I want to point out a little issue if we increase our cells right here to say like 15 and save then

59
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,670
it looks like it's just about impossible to actually get to that goal because our bottom border is overlapping

60
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,150
are kind of intersecting that actual goal that we're trying to get at.

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,530
But I think that at this point the borders that we have around the outside are way too thick.

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,690
We need to probably reduce their size so that they're not going to actually interfere with the different

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,620
elements of the maze itself therefore that's going to go back to the section where we created all of

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,600
our different walls remember we put on that helpful comment just to help ourselves find this thing in

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,190
the future and I want to change the 4D inside of here which represent the width of that wall going to

66
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,980
change all for them to about just to like so that's basically really really thin and we can just about

67
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,510
not see them but now they're not really actually conflicting with any of the elements inside of our

68
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,670
maze anymore.

69
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,770
I think that's definitely a better approach to take okay.

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,750
So that's our goal.

71
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,960
Now we do eventually have to add in some code to detect a collision between the ball that we're going

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,500
to place in that thing to decide when the user wins.

73
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,630
We'll take care of that just a little bit right now let's take a pause.

74
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,190
We'll come back.

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,820
We'll start to add in the ball that's going to start off at the top left corner so it could pass and

76
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,080
I'll see you in just a minute.
