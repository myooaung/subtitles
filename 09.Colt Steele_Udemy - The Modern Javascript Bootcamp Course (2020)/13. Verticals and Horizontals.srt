1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,320
In this video we're going to generate our verticals rate and our horizontals rate.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,590
Once again quick reminder on what both those do so we have our verticals

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,120
array and horizontals

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,540
the verticals array is going to keep track of every vertical we while we have so those right there.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,810
Remember that these arrays are gonna have some different dimensions than the grid array.

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:36,320
So in this case if we have a three by three verticals which only represents those labeled segments right

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,070
there is going to have three rows.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:48,270
So there is one row there is row two and row three but in that side of there it's going to have two

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,220
columns.

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,110
So to start off we would have false false false false false and false.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,090
So then if we started off randomly right there and decided to move right there we would find the corresponding

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,270
entry inside of verticals that represents that wall segment.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:11,890
So that would be that one right there we would take out that false and update it to true instead then

14
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,460
horizontals is very similar nature horizontals is going to keep track.

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,820
Let's change to green here.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:26,810
Of all these horizontal segments so likewise it's also going to start off as a 2D array it's going to

17
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:34,030
have two rows 0 1 and road 2 and then inside those two rows it will have three columns.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,990
So we have false false false like so.

19
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,680
So then we can imagine if we started off in this cell right here on the very bottom left hand side the

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
matching element inside of our horizontals right.

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,310
Is that right there.

22
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:56,490
If we then go up we would change that to true to say that there is now an opening right there which

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,690
would represent something like that like so okay.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,150
So with this reminder let's now go back over to our code.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,680
We're gonna create verticals and horizontals and again the big thing we have to keep aware of or stay

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,730
aware of here is that these are gonna have slightly different dimensions.

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,750
The Andy grid array gets a makeover I accrete my array of verticals.

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,140
I'm going to create this array inside were with the same style that we used just a moment ago.

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,540
So for verticals I'm going to make an array as we just discussed this thing is going to have three rows

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,500
inside of it so the outer array is going to have length three because one two and three tobacco over

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,120
here are going to create an array with like three and then going to fill that up with no and then map

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,680
over those values and inside I'll create a new array.

33
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,360
Then here's where things get interesting.

34
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,500
The inner array is going to have like to this array right here.

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,420
Two elements to it.

36
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,270
So I'm gonna make sure that I do a map and I'm going to get an array with two elements inside.

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,910
I'm going to fill that thing up with the value of false.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:12,780
Like so now I can repeat the same process for horizontals as well I'll do an array here once again horizontals

39
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,620
is only gonna have two rows so the outer array will have two elements to it.

40
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,300
I'm going to fill that up with annual value because we're going to replace it in just a moment.

41
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm going gonna map I'll do an array and I bet you can guess what goes there.

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,210
The inner arrays on horizontals has 1 2 3 elements so I'm going to go back over.

43
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm gonna make sure this thing has three elements.

44
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,650
I'm going to fill that thing up with false All right.

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,500
So let's now do a console log of verticals and just make sure we generate the thing correctly.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,990
So I'll flip back over refresh it.

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,870
So I got verticals as the three rows and it's got the two columns for each that maps up perfectly because

48
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:04,730
we are representing that segment that segment all these like so that we can update our console log and

49
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:12,720
instead do a horizontals save it go back over to the refresh check this thing out gate and this looks

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,440
good as well.

51
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,070
So we're looking at horizontals Now remember that's gonna represent that that that that that and that.

52
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,080
And so we definitely want to have row one road two in each of those is gonna have three false values

53
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,710
inside of it okay.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,330
So it looks like we've generated all of our data successfully Believe it or not this right here this

55
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,600
is definitely the hardest part.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,800
Without a doubt just understanding with the purpose of these arrays it's now we have this stuff together

57
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,850
the rest the code we have to write is actually going to be kind of surprisingly easy.

58
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,030
Believe it or not it's really not the worst thing in the world.

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,520
There is one last change I want to make to this code however.

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,900
So quick pause we're gonna come back and you'll know so we've got the value 3 and 2 inside of here all

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,820
over the place.

62
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,050
Is going to make sure that we extract that out into a configuration variable just like we did with height

63
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,060
and with up here a little bit ago.

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,350
So quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
