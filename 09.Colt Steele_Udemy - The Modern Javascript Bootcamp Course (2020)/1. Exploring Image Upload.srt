1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,460
We were just able to verify that our validation was working but the error messages that we have right

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,240
now are and title and price aren't that great.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,040
Let's very quickly just go to our validators such as file.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,400
Here it is right here.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,100
Going to find require title and require price and remember to customize an error message.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,020
We can chain on a dot with message call.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,850
I'm going to do that.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,660
In both cases I'm going to find the comma that separates these two key value pairs of then chain on

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,320
a dot with message and for title.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,210
I'll say must be between five and forty characters then for the price.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:48,920
I will also cheat on a with message and say must be a number greater than one okay.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,100
So let's save this.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm not going to do a full test of this.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,740
Instead I'm just going to refresh the form and make sure that everything still appears.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,290
If you just made a typo then you're going to see some error message something it says hey cannot connect

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,360
a server.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,880
And so if you see an error message go back over to your terminal you'll see a reason of exactly what

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,570
went wrong.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,570
Chances are obviously it's gonna be a typo related to that validators dot she has file okay.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,060
So now in this video what I really want to focus in is the image upload right here.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,130
So we've got something that we can click on it says choose file and then presumably inside of here we

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,430
can select some file to include with the form.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,400
So the first thing I want to focus on is just how do we actually access that image.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,060
How do we on our server write some code that says OK.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,380
Take the image that the user just uploaded and save it somewhere or do something with it to give it

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,440
get a better idea of how to work that image.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,420
I first want to try to access it in the same way that we access other properties contained inside of

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,750
our form so usually to access other properties inside of our form we can find our post request handler

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,080
going to delete the console log right here of errors and I will replace that with a console dot log

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,880
of DOT body.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,530
Remember that's where we usually get information from our form from flushes console log that out in

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:06,980
C.

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,430
Well what got uploaded in place that image looking to see this file.

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,340
I'll go backwards.

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,060
My form I'm going to add in some title here like a product.

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,310
I'll make sure I put in a valid price as well.

37
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,260
Now I'll hit choose file and I'm going to upload a image of a quote.

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,600
Now obviously I'd sat down ahead of time got an image of a coat to actually upload.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,720
So at this point you don't actually need an image of an actual product.

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,610
You just need an image to upload it can be any type of image.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,300
So a JPEG a PMG even a bitmap.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,850
It's totally up to you.

43
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,640
All you need is an image.

44
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,300
So hopefully you can find a image on your computer right now.

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:57,160
If you can't you can always hop over to Google image search and search for Cote and go to images and

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,090
just download one the images that you see on this page right here.

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,090
So some coats and you'll actually notice that the coat I used is was it not on here.

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,770
What was on here just a moment ago.

49
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,560
So whatever.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,130
All we need right now is an image of something.

51
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:18,120
It's going to take that image throw it into that file picture and I'll hit submit OK.

52
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,780
So let's now go over to our terminal and see what got console logged out tobacco over here I can see.

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,020
OK.

54
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,840
I got the titled The Price in for that image property.

55
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,010
All I have is the name of the file that I just uploaded.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,660
I don't have anything about well actually the image itself.

57
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,040
I don't have any image data.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,750
I just have the name so that doesn't really appear to be that useful.

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,860
Another way that we can try to inspect the request that we're making is to go back over to our network

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,900
request tab inside the browser and take a look at the request was issued when we submitted our form.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,100
If you don't have your network request tab open then make sure you open it up.

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:02,290
Go back to the form enter and a title and a price and reattach that image and then hit submit again.

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,090
And we should see the post request that is being made to our back end.

64
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,470
There it is right there.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,950
Click on it.

66
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,680
I'll take a look at headers and if I scroll down to the bottom I'll see all the form data that was included.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,380
So it's clear at this point by looking at this right here that when we submit a form or a default form

68
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,450
that has an image attached to it all that is getting communicated from our browser over to the server

69
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:33,310
is this image property that has the name of the image which is definitely definitely not useful at all.

70
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,080
So it's clear that the default behavior of a form is not really doing what we want.

71
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,250
Let's take a quick pause right here.

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
When we come back the next video we're going to get a better idea of how we can actually take a file

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,800
that has been attached to a form and submit it and receive it on our back end server.
