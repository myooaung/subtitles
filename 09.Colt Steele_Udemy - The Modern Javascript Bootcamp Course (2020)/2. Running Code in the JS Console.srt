1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,070
Before we go any further I want to stop and talk about where I'll be writing my code at least for this

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,870
section in general throughout the rest of the course.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,480
We write our code in a javascript file a standalone file.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,020
It could be one hundred lines it could be ten lines could be ten thousand lines.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,330
We write the code and we run the code afterwards or separately.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,230
For now we're going to run our code in a more immediate way.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,370
We're going to use the javascript console in Chrome so definitely definitely recommend you install Chrome

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,640
if you don't have it now.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,670
Other browsers have a console as well and you can use that.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,450
But if you want to be on the same page as me I would use the chrome console.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,250
So here I have chrome open.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,390
You could be on any Web page it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,300
And I'm going to pull up the console.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,150
So we have a couple of different options.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:51,720
I like to use a shortcut but first if you go to view developer and Javascript console right there can

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,430
click that.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,890
Also take note of that shortcut on a Mac.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,540
It is command option.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,930
Jay and takes a moment.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,550
Here is my console.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,790
Notice there's different tabs.

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,040
This is all new to you.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,030
We'll be working in the console tab so I can type code right away.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,440
This is not valid code.

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,610
I get an error message but see this flow I type something I hit enter and I get a result.

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,060
This is different than typing our code in a file.

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,530
Saving the file and then running the file.

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,270
That's the more traditional standard approach and there's a reason for that.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,970
This is not a great place to write large applications.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,430
Nothing you write is actually saved but when we're just experimenting we're just starting out.

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,650
We want to talk about numbers for example.

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,150
It's very easy for us to explore and see how things work without getting caught up in the workflow.

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,750
So just for this section we'll be working in the console.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,950
Usually the console is used for debugging for trying things out.

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,910
Like I said it's not a good place to actually write applications.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,770
The other thing is that my console might look a little bit different than yours.

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,010
I have changed the colors to make it a little easier to see if you want to learn how to do that.

38
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,760
I have a YouTube video on it but it's really not at all important.

39
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,920
It will work exactly the same as yours.

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,850
Even if you have the light theme a couple of other things I'll point out.

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,450
You can resize this.

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,510
You can close it back down by exiting or using the same shortcut you used to open it.

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,650
So for me it is command option J.

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,070
And now it's gone.

45
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,980
Also right here if you click on this three dot more icon don't know what to call it.

46
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,210
You can change where the dock appears if you want it on the side.

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,560
The right the left or you can actually pop it out into its own window like this.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,970
So now I have two windows but this console is connected to this window here and that's pretty much it.

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,300
Again we're using this for this section to make our life easier.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,700
It's too much setup it bogs us down to create new files and save them and open them up correctly every

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,690
time we learn something new early on.

52
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,120
But again that's where we're going.

53
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,450
So that's a console command option Jay on a Mac.

54
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,370
Next up we'll actually start writing code.
