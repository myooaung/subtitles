1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,390
Now that we have a better idea of what is going on inside this file.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,940
Well let's continue working on our application.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,550
The first thing we're going to focus on is the admin panel.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,400
Sign up.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,010
So we need to make sure that we have the ability to show two different forms to the user one to sign

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,520
up and want to sign in for user comes to sign up.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,980
They should be able to see an input for an email a password in a password confirmation.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,460
So in order to show this stuff to the user a first step to understand just well how to show some HDL

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,750
in general to do so I'll go back over to my editor.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,260
I'm going to find our root handler right here and I'm going to replace the rest sent or at least the

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,300
string that we pass in with a template string instead so note that this is a template string that is

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,330
a set of tactics the character till after to the one on your keyboard and inside of here I'm going to

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:56,250
place a div that contains a form inside the form I'm going to show.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,740
One would only need any more divs inside there.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,290
Let's just do some inputs directly.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:09,840
I'll give this first one a place holder of email and then going to duplicate that twice the second one.

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:18,340
I'll give a place holder of password and finally password confirmation.

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:27,150
Then after those three inputs I'll place a button with some text of submit or better yet how about sign

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,270
up

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,110
at all then save this flip back over refresh the page.

21
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,010
And there we go.

22
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,130
So I've now got three inputs that are being displayed to my user.

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,800
You'll notice that one of my inputs right here has this little icon inside of it.

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,560
The only reason I have an icon there is because I'm running a password manager inside of my browser

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,350
called last pass last pass automatically detects any time there is an input that looks like it should

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,040
be a kind of logging thing and it adds some icons to it.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,150
So you probably don't see that icon right there which is totally fine now.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,350
Above all I want to point out that we now have a form being displayed to the user or more correctly

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,450
that the browser interpreted this thing right here as being some H T email that needed to be displayed.

30
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,080
It did not take this string right here and decide instead to just show it all as plain text as we had

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,490
a moment ago when we were returning the string of hi there so express into browser work together to

32
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,620
take a look at the information that you're trying to send back if the information you are sending back

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,510
looks like each time all the browser is going to treat it as such and it's going to take all these different

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,420
e-mail elements turn them into real H.M. elements and then display them on the screen of your browser.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,180
So now inside this form a user could enter in some email password and password confirmation then click

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,940
on sign up and they do so all those different inputs kind of clear out and we don't see anything inside

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,130
there anymore.

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,840
So you might remember that earlier on INSIDE THIS COURSE we discussed exactly what a h T.M. form does.

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,310
But now it's going to start to be really really really critical for us to understand exactly how an

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,910
HMO reform works.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,490
So quick pause here.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,500
We're going to discuss in just a moment what a form really does inside the browser and how we're going

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,600
to use it to eventually submit an email password and password confirmation to our backend server.
