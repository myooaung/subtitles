00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.310
All right.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.410
Lastly I want to take care of inside our maze instead just out in a little bit of color and also show

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.210
a nice message to the user whenever they succeed.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.380
So they understand that they really did just win at the game.

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.980
We're going to take a look at some of the different shapes that we are creating.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.050
We're going to make sure that we add on a bill style to them to just color them in.

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.220
In addition I'm going to make sure that when I create my render here's our options object right here.

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.800
And also going to flip wire frames to false remember that is what's going to make all of our different

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.420
shapes solid and allow us to apply some colors to them so I can update wire frames to false.

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.300
And we're going to go down and find where we create all of our different shapes.

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.450
I'm going to leave the walls as essentially whatever random color we get assigned.

12
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.040
I don't really care about those but I really care about is the different walls the ball and the goal

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.160
so going to go down to where we create our verticals and horizontals here's the horizontals for each

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.890
right here.

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.050
I'm gonna find where I create the wall.

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.870
I'm going to add in a new property to this option's object and remember if we want to customize the

17
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.950
color we can add on a render option with a bill style we'll specify the color that we want it's going

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.850
to try out a color of red at all then go down to where we create our verticals I'll find a wall that

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.860
we create in there I'll find the options object and I'll also put on a render with a bill style of Red

20
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.170
I'll go down to where we create our goal I'm going to add on a render with a Phil style of green.

21
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.530
So just make it a nice screen that the user can understand.

22
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.900
Hey green is good right.

23
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.180
And then finally I'll find where recreate the ball and the options object I'll add on a render and a

24
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.130
feel style of blue.

25
00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.780
So blue for the ball it's let's save this I will flip back over refresh and now we've got some interesting

26
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.160
coloring going on.

27
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.860
This is definitely a little bit easier to pass visually.

28
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.730
Little bit more interesting as well.

29
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.740
The only thing I don't quite like about it is that the ball is a very dark blue.

30
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.310
So if you wanted to you could try out some different colors and find one that maybe suits you better

31
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.410
that looks good.

32
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.060
So now let's see what to do is to make sure once these are wins we show a message on the very center

33
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.590
of the screen that says very clearly hey you won.

34
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.860
So another quick pause.

35
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.340
Wrap this thing up in just a moment.
