00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.910
Next up a quick side note about the old way of making variables before Lenten concert where a thing

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.360
you had to use the VAR keyword so far.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
And then the same exact format variable name equals some value.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.390
Now I'm showing it to you not because you should use it.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.520
There is really no situation where it makes sense to use these days but you will see it all the time

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.200
if you research online.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.350
If you're looking at older code bases even if you just google variables and J.S. the first result still

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.990
uses var so it still works.

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.890
You can make a variable and do everything you need to do.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.050
It's just not ideal and it's hard to explain exactly why right now until we talk about things like functions

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.000
and conditionals and blocks.

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.090
So for now just know that VARs the old way of doing it you shouldn't really be writing var declarations

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.790
in plus.

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.760
For some reason you're working on it old code base where VAR is used everywhere but I did want to show

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.770
it to you just so that you're aware of it.

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.780
It's something we can't really ignore.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.550
So we could make a variable using var let's do var eggs equals twelve and we have eggs and everything

18
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.390
else works exactly the same.

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.530
Eggs plus two plus plus.

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.060
We now have 13 eggs.

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.880
We can reset it so it's not like const.

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.540
It's more like let let's go with eggs equals zero.

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.170
We eat all the eggs or maybe a evil raccoon eat them all.

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.680
And now we're down to zero.

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.540
So that's it.

26
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.920
It works just like let but there are some significant differences.

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.260
Once we talk about scoping so I don't want you to think that it's exactly identical to let.

28
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.590
Otherwise there'd be no reason to use let over var.

29
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.520
There are some differences in how they work in certain situations.

30
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.070
Also I just want to talk about this briefly letting concert are new as I mentioned.

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.950
The relatively new at least compared to the lifespan of JavaScript.

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.630
If we go to M.D. end let's look at let.

33
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.460
Scroll down to the very bottom you'll see a browser support her browser compatibility chart or table

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.630
and it shows you green vs. yellow and red would be for no support in certain browsers.

35
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.320
You can see that light is supported across all the major browsers.

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.660
It looks like Internet Explorer doesn't fully support it but if you click here it's a very small edge

37
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.840
case or it's on an edge case if there's a specific situation where it is not as optimized but it still

38
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.590
works.

39
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.950
So it's not going to cause any problems or errors.

40
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.440
Anyway the point here is that light is supported everywhere you'd need to use it.

41
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.120
So because of that there's not really a good reason to use VR anymore.

42
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.570
It used to be that Latin cons weren't fully supported in all the main browsers and that was a good reason

43
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.860
to at least know about VR and potentially use it these days.

44
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.390
There's not really a case for VR that's it.

45
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.930
VARs the old way of doing things.

46
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.300
You probably will see it.

47
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.490
I don't recommend you use it.
