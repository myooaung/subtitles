1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,650
In this video I want to write out just one more very quick test just a real basic one to get one last

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,440
example in and after that that's where fun things are gonna start to happen after this.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,740
We're gonna start to put together our own testing framework that's gonna work so much better than what

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,220
we've put together so far.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,700
I honestly guarantee you're gonna like this.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,600
So let's get through this last little test and move on.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,510
It's for the last test I want to do is just to make sure that we print out a number of movies right

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,310
here equal to however many that we returned from our fetch data function right here.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,580
So our fetch data function returns three movies.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,230
Let's just write out a test to make sure that three movies get displayed at the end of the day.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,740
This is gonna be very similar to the test we just wrote because we're going to want to put something

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,790
into the input dispatch and event wait for some stuff to occur and then go ahead and actually do stuff

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,440
all right.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,350
I'm going to define another statement down here.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:01,640
We'll say after searching displays some results.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,120
Then inside the first couple of lines are going to be exactly what we had before.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,740
So I'll just take that stuff directly copy it and paste it in.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:21,200
Then after that we can do a query selector all to look for elements on the screen with a class of dropdown

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,190
dash item.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,770
That's what each of these different elements has for a class dropdown dash item.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,210
We'll do a query SELECT her all and just make sure that we get three results.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:37,700
So back over here I'll say const items is document dot query selector all we're going to look for dropdown

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,730
dash item.

24
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,030
Don't forget the dot in there because we're looking for a class name

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,820
and then we can do an expect items dot length we can take a look at the child documentation if we want

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,880
to figure out how to essentially compare direct value.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll give you a hint it's simply too equal.

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,620
So we're gonna say that this value is going to equal three because we are showing it three different

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,840
movies.

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,190
All right.

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
Let's say this and do another quick test.

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,660
I'll put back over did I make the same mistake again.

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,140
Yep definitely did.

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,040
All right enclosing function market as async and remember that one of these days.

35
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,840
Okay.

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
So let's refresh this.

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,490
And there we go as usual.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,780
Let's try to make this test fail because we usually like to see a test fail at least once it's let's

39
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,900
say two equal four I'll save it go back over refresh.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,150
Yup it definitely is correctly correctly trying to find three elements.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,900
I'll change it back to three and I think we're good to go okay.

42
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,620
So that is it.

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,170
With mocha in the browser now I don't know about you but I personally thought all this stuff was rather

44
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,020
painful.

45
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,960
Chai was definitely not fun because you gotta remember all these to be and whatnots putting together

46
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,360
all these different or the test out H.M. file was kind of nasty because we had to mainly add in these

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
script tags.

48
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,700
We also had to throw in some of these like got to know that actual test file itself.

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,700
We had to throw in some extra stuff inside of here just to get the autocomplete to work in general.

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,720
So we had to really understand how the autocomplete worked and even the fetch data function we put together

51
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,880
wasn't actually reaching out to the API and finally everything we've done inside of here has just been

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,010
about the autocomplete.

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,420
We haven't even begun to test anything else around our application so we haven't even considered anything

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,000
like hey by default the application should show this big message on the screen.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,570
And then when we search for something it should go away.

56
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,010
That is something that you really should test but we don't have any ability to do that right now.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,550
Of course we could add it in but it would just be a lot of additional work to wire up some more script

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,090
tags and all that kind of stuff so it's clear that while this approach works kind of lacking and that

59
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,580
is the segway into this we're going to write our own testing framework.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,160
It's gonna be way easier to use than what I just showed you.

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,550
I think you're going to like it a lot so quick pause right here.

62
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,540
We'll get started on that in the next video.
