1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,880
The next thing to know about arrays is that they are indexed just like with strings where each string

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,920
character has a corresponding index.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,780
And I can access them.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,070
One character at a time the first character the second the third the fourth and the indices start at

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,430
zero.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,860
The numbering starts at zero.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,610
Arrays are just like that every item in an array has a corresponding index and that index is what dictates

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,320
the order.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,080
So if something is index zero it's at the beginning.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,110
If something is index 1 it is the second item.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,020
And just like with strings arrays also have a length property.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,630
So here is a colors array I've made with red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:50,640
And if I look at colors dot length it has seven items and we use the exact same syntax to access individual

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,670
items from the array that we do with a string.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,250
So to get the first item it's colors of 0 just like with the string colors of one gives me the second

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,750
one.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,170
Colors of 3 gives me the fourth one which is green.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,270
And remember there is no colors of 7 if the length is 7 and we're trying to access that colors of 7

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,250
we get undefined because the highest index goes up to length minus one.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,790
If are seven items we start labelling at zero.

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,100
So this is going to have index of 6.

22
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,780
So to get the last one.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,760
You could do this colors of colors dot length minus 1 and that gives us violet.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,680
So that's pretty much it for accessing data out as long as you have an index.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,020
And you know the number you're trying to access.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,230
How do you square brackets after the name of the array.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,110
And if you try and access something that is not there you get undefined.

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:58,640
Just like with a string string index of 1 2 3 is also undefined so that's great.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
We can access data.

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,190
We can read it out next.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,890
We have a lot to talk about as far as modifying a race data changes how do we add something new a new

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,640
common.

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,070
Or how do we reorder our playlist so that we have a new song at the beginning all of that stuff is coming

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,160
up.
