00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.680
In this video we're going to add some better styling to our application.

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.300
Attached to this video make sure you download a file called something like AECOM 050 templates dot zip

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.850
inside of this zip file are a couple of different updates to the templates we've been working on so

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.970
far so our layouts are sign in and our sign up all the javascript code inside these templates is absolutely

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.960
identical.

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.000
All I did was add in some additional HDMI elements to get everything looking a little bit better than

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.960
how it looks right now.

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.230
So in this video we're going to unzip this thing where we want to merge in some files inside there with

9
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.530
our current project.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.480
So let's get to it right away.

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.120
Make sure you download that zip file.

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.760
Once you do unzip it and then we'll take a look at this files directory.

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.000
So inside of here are three JavaScript files and one CSF file the layout sign in and sign it up J.S.

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.400
files.

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.510
We're going to merge inside of our project with our existing JavaScript files and then the main dot

16
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.250
CFS file.

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.560
We're gonna figure out how to deal with separately in just a moment.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.140
So to merge in all these files we're just going to copy paste the contents of each one and paste them

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.930
into our sign and sign up in layout dot J.S. to first start out with the layout dot J.S. file it's going

20
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.920
to find the zipped up version here's the version I just downloaded right here I'm going to drag it and

21
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
drop it into my editor to open it up so inside of here right away I'm going to see if there is a lot

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.780
of additional HMO but at the end of the day the overall structure is just about identical to what we

23
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.180
had previously.

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.340
We've got some HDL tag at the top.

25
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.220
We've got a head a body and then at some point time we're injecting some content into our layout so

26
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.030
I'm going to take everything inside this layout dot j ust file that I just opened I'm going to copy

27
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.740
it and then going to open up the layout J.S. file inside of my project directory.

28
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.900
So here's the one that we have been working on.

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.890
I'll select everything inside of here.

30
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:08.830
Delete it and then paste in the updated version I'll then save my local layout dot J as file okay.

31
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.470
Let's now repeat that process two times again.

32
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.070
So I got to close both those next up I'll find my site in J as file.

33
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.540
I'm going to drag that and drop it into my editor I'll copy everything inside of here.

34
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.460
Open up my off sign and Dot.

35
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.630
So this is my local file.

36
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.210
Here's the local one right here.

37
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.570
I'm gonna select everything inside of here.

38
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:38.430
Delete it and paste it so I'll save that now it's the last one I'm going to find sign.

39
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.070
Update us drag it and drop it highlight everything copy it.

40
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.850
Go to sign up J.S. highlight everything delete it and then paste in the updates

41
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.170
okay.

42
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.970
That's pretty much it now that we've got all these updates inside of here.

43
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.870
I can make sure I saved all the files that I've changed.

44
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.790
I'll then go back over to my browser and refresh the page right away.

45
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.120
I can see something that looks at least a little bit better than what we had before.

46
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.830
However if you look at the header it looks like a link right here is not quite where it needs to be.

47
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.490
In fact you might see something like that right there.

48
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.590
So here's the issue.

49
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.940
If you open up your network request tab and refresh the page you'll see that there is a request in red

50
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.490
right here for a main dot SS file because that request is in red.

51
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.090
It means that the browser failed to make a request to that endpoint.

52
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.410
If we take a look at the updated layout dot J.S. file that we just pasted in inside of here you'll see

53
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.150
that inside the head tag there's a link for a local may not see SS file.

54
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.240
So essentially we now have a CSX file that our e-mail document is trying to reference but that file

55
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.290
doesn't exactly exist inside of our project yet the main Nazi SS file is inside of that zip that we

56
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.310
just downloaded.

57
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.740
There it is right there.

58
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.650
So we need to figure out how we can use Xpress to somehow link up this may not see SS file in the past

59
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.710
in order to get access to a CSX file we just added in a set single link tag like so and I just made

60
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.600
sure that that CSX file is in the same directory as our index not each single file.

61
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.020
So this time around there really isn't indexed on e-mail file.

62
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.670
There's also not really any single location inside of here where I think we could drop this file and

63
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.930
have it be served up to the browser.

64
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.220
So let's take a quick pause right here.

65
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.940
When we come back the next video we're gonna figure out the correct way to reference a link using express

66
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.700
and actually serve up that C Ss file to our browser so quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
