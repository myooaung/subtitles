1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,020
We've seen how to create a.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,670
You've seen how to access individual elements using an index.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,030
Now let's talk about changing them.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,560
We can use the exact same syntax we've already seen where we use an index and square brackets but we

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,660
can assign a new value and that will change whatever is at that index.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,990
So unlike with a string where if we have haha as a variable let laugh equals haha.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,880
If we access laugh of zero we get H.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,410
Remember that strings are immutable so I can't change that to an uppercase H.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,550
If we look at laugh it's still haha.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,030
Arrays are different arrays are mutable we can change them whenever we want.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,410
So if we make a new array let's go with shopping list again and let's start off with cheddar cheese

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,690
and one other item.

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,620
How about 2 percent milk.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,850
Great.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,810
So we've made an array.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,970
We can access things out but now I want to change something.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,580
So let's say I change my mind about the milk and I actually want whole milk.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:15,730
I need to access that index which would be zero one index of one and then set that to whole milk and

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,090
save.

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,320
Let's take a look at shopping list it now only contains cheddar cheese and whole milk.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,140
We'll zoom out a bit.

22
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,290
I could also go in and add something else into the array.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,620
So this is how you could update a value to add something to the end.

24
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,990
I would need to know the last index so I could use a length.

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,550
Or we could just count manually.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,720
So we know that there is zero.

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,470
There is one so index 2 would be the next index shopping list of 2 equals.

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,540
What else do I need.

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,910
How about ice cream we'll save refresh.

30
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,860
Shopping list now has three items cheddar cheese whole milk and ice cream at index of two.

31
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,310
So this works.

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,240
The problem with this approach right here is if you don't know how many items are in there it's a little

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,860
clunky.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,320
You have to calculate it.

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,180
Let's say the shopping list is out of view.

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,670
It's written in in code dynamically.

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,860
Data is coming from a database or from users.

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,030
We don't know if there's 10 or 20 items.

39
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,430
We would have to do something like this to always add to the end shopping list of shopping list dot

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,590
length equals and then whatever we want to add to the end.

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,950
Let's go with tomatoes like that.

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,070
Is there any proof.

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't know.

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,680
OK.

45
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,190
Yes there is.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,550
Just had a minor stroke.

47
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,780
There isn't either.

48
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,620
And this should work no matter how long shopping list is.

49
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,830
This will always add to the end.

50
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,110
So let's refresh.

51
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:58,280
We'll look at shopping list again now has tomatoes at the end and I could do this multiple times further

52
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,160
so we could verify that instead of tomatoes.

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,410
Let's also add potatoes are fresh and it still works.

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,380
So this is great.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,790
And it works but it's not ideal.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,130
There are easier ways to add to the end which we'll see in the next video.

57
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,650
There is a built in method to help you add new items to the end of an array.

58
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,450
Really the only time I use this syntax is when I'm trying to change a value that's already in an array.

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,900
So instead of cheddar cheese or instead of 2 percent milk I want whole milk.

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,790
But I'm not adding in a brand new item even though this does work.

61
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,610
You just have to be very particular about where you put something and be cognizant of the fact that

62
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,670
when you add something at index of 1 or let's say something an index of 0 shopping list of 0.

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm not putting this at the beginning and shifting everything over I am changing the very first item

64
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:58,800
so a shopping list of 0 is now going to be bread if we look at shopping list cheddar cheese is gone.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,450
So I'm completely rewriting it or overwriting it.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,550
There is a way to add to the beginning but we haven't seen it yet.

67
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,210
That's in the very next video.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,910
So we've seen how you can use an index to change a value.

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,120
You can use a length to add to the end.

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,900
We're going to see a nicer way of doing this.

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,410
Up next.
