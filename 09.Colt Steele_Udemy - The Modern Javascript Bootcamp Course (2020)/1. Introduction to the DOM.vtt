00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.510
Hey welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.750
We've made it to my very favorite topic in the course and honestly my favorite topic in all of teaching

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.820
web development the dorm.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.070
So this is very exciting stuff in my opinion.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.810
I look forward to it every time I teach and when I teach Boot Camps In person it's my favorite week.

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.190
Favorite two weeks.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.180
It's really fun stuff because we start to connect javascript with each team out and CSX.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.200
This is where I think javascript starts to become a lot more exciting and certainly more visual.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.000
You can start to make things with interfaces things that you can see enough of the console not logging.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.630
So I always look forward to it.

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310
Hopefully you're excited about it especially if you've never worked with the DRM.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.640
You don't know what it is.

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.200
There is a lot to cover here.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.610
It won't fit into one section.

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.120
We have multiple sections.

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
I have a couple of examples I'd like to show of things that we could build after you learn how to manipulate

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.260
and work with the DOM.

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.650
So there's some simple ones like here's a form where as I start typing notice the place holder text

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.010
here that says Last name.

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.530
If I put something in here like Chaplin.

21
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.290
Notice how the text went down below as a label.

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.550
And then if I delete it.

23
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.740
It goes back up.

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.200
Very simple little tiny touch but that's done with javascript.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.450
So we have the form that is just H2 Mel and CSX.

26
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.550
We don't need javascript to make that work if I comment the javascript out.

27
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.540
Well I just deleted it.

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
That's commented out.

29
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
We still have the form here but now we're not getting that interactive element.

30
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.720
It still looks the same but we don't get that behavior.

31
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.620
Here's another example.

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.250
This is a fun Well fun is relative.

33
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.570
It's a game that is a memory game where you have to match different cards and flip them over.

34
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.780
I'm terrible at it but I really like the interface at the beginning when you start you get this nice

35
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.010
little flip of the card when you click instructions and then you can click here to actually begin the

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.030
game and select a level.

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.690
So the content itself is HD here amounts to assess if I comment all of that out select it commented

38
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.140
out.

39
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.670
We still have the exact same interface.

40
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.860
It just doesn't do anything.

41
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.510
I'm clicking maybe you can hear that through the mike but we don't get any behavior.

42
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.990
We're just seeing that content.

43
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.490
It's basically static.

44
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.940
Little blocks of color with some letters but we add JavaScript in and now they do something when I click

45
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.370
and I can play the game go to casual like I said I'm horrible at this game.

46
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.680
But the just very act of clicking on something and having it change in any way changing the color having

47
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.580
it flip revealing the symbol that is all JavaScript.

48
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.500
The cards themselves are HD amounts.

49
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Yes it's very hard for me to even attempt to play this while talking.

50
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.710
So I'm already terrible to begin with.

51
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.270
But as you can see we've also got this time we're going across the top highly stressful.

52
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.120
I'm just clicking randomly at this point and one more match before the end.

53
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.450
All right.

54
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.980
So again this is all javascript functionality.

55
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.760
This is javascript that is making the game logic that it is checking if we get a match.

56
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.170
It's checking oh jeez it's checking to see if a card has already been clicked on or if the timer has

57
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.590
finished.

58
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.140
If you still can play or if it's game over here's another example.

59
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.990
This is another nice form where we have different steps of the form little animations that are triggered.

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.510
So we go from step 1 to step 3.

61
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.120
Each time I click I'm just seeing each timeouts assess if I remove all javascript one more time.

62
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.240
We still have the exact same content.

63
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.790
It just doesn't do anything.

64
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.010
I can't go from one step to the next.

65
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.420
We add JavaScript in and it's now an interactive almost like a different set being shown on a stage.

66
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.250
When you go see a musical or performance a new set being swapped in and the colors are changing up here

67
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.430
to tell you which step you're on.

68
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.260
So nothing crazy but this is all done with JavaScript all the interactivity and then now for something

69
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.020
a little crazier much more complex.

70
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.350
This is on YouTube.

71
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.360
This is a recorded livestream of really cool musician.

72
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.840
Very funny guy Marc rabbit.

73
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.320
It doesn't matter who it is anyway.

74
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.840
Over here we've got comments.

75
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.760
Hopefully nothing super inappropriate and as I play the video you can see these comments start to come

76
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.680
in and there sinks to when they were actually submitted.

77
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.840
Back when this was live I can click to hide.

78
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.090
I can show it again.

79
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.820
This is all happening through javascript.

80
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.030
These elements are being added to the page in conjunction or in time in sync with this video.

81
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.640
They're being added here so even something just like hiding and showing is done with JavaScript being

82
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.310
able to pause video and have this stop.

83
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.400
We don't get those new comments now that's done with JavaScript.

84
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.780
If I fast forward I get new comments.

85
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.030
That's done with JavaScript So javascript the DOM.

86
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.110
Very exciting stuff.

87
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.200
This is where we start to take each team agency assess and control it update it or even just read it

88
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.250
and understand it.

89
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.970
Using javascript so something like this is made by a team.

90
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.770
Obviously a huge team at YouTube but things like a form or a memory game.

91
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.130
The code is really not that bad but the thing about the DOM that I'll tell you right now is that you

92
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.350
have to use tons and tons of methods and properties that we haven't seen before.

93
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.210
So remember when we saw arrays or we saw strings and I talked about here's 20 methods set arrays have

94
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.720
when we work with the DOM we have at least 20 maybe 50 different methods 50 different properties and

95
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.180
it takes time to get to know the one to use the most.

96
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.340
And it's also imperative that you don't try and understand and learn every single property.

97
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.980
That's something I'll bring up as we make some more progress.

98
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.770
The Dom is just a huge thing.

99
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.370
There's so much to that you could stress about trying to learn and memorize.

100
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.470
Don't approach it that way.

101
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.910
We're gonna go step by step and in the next video we'll take our first step into this Beautiful promised

102
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.060
land of the Dom.
