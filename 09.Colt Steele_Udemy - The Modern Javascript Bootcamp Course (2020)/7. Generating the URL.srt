1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,900
In the last video we spoke about how we can put some information after the hash character inside the

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,150
URL that is specific or intended to be shared with the browser.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,960
That's what we're going to stick our encoded string.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,850
Now we have to think about how we're going to get the first part of the url.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,850
So in other words everything up to that hash character to do so.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm going to go back over to my application.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,100
Open up the console and write out window dot location.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,730
This is an object that has a bunch of different properties inside of it.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,960
That describes the current year L that we are looking at.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,890
So we want to take this current you are L right here and we essentially want to add onto the very end

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,000
that hash character to do so we can use a little trick with how window dot location behaves when we

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,190
print out just window location by itself.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,620
You'll notice that it is a big object but if we tried to put window dot location into a string it's

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,050
going to automatically turn that object into essentially just the current year l.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,640
Let me show you what I mean.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,630
If I take a set of back ticks so I want to use a template string here.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,280
So set it back ticks not single quotes and then do a dollar sign.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,720
Curly brace and window dot location we'll see that instead of printing out a big object.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,280
It's going to take just the current year L and put it inside of a string so to actually get the final

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,470
your l that we want to share with a user and allow them to give to our friend and get back to our application

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
with the hash at the end.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,300
We're going to do something like window dot location hound and then our encrypted string at the very

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,160
end and that's going to generate our final your l that we want to share with the user.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,970
So now we understand that let's go back over to our editor and update the code that is going to generate

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,510
that encrypted string and toss it into the link OK.

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,490
So I'm going to update where we assign the value to the input.

27
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,510
I'm going to use a set of tactics

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,310
then at the very start.

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,290
I'll do dollar sign curly brace window dot location then a pound right after outside the curly braces

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,920
and then a another dollar sign curly brace around encrypted I'll save this and it's gonna reformat it

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,370
just to make the line all that shorter okay.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,100
So now let's save this.

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,480
I'll go back over and do another test I'll put in my secret message and there we go.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,770
I've now got the full year L that I'm going to use to share with a friend and I can see that at the

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,610
very end there's the pound and then the actual encrypted string or kind of base64 string in this case.

36
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,250
Once again this link right here is only going to be usable by you and me for right now on our local

37
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,180
machine because we have a reference to a direct file on some folder on our computer.

38
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,670
But again we are going to eventually deploy this thing and get a version of this link that actually

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,700
can be shared with other friends.

40
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:51,990
All right.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,890
So I think the last thing that would be kind of nice around this whenever user types in a message and

42
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,640
hits create or in the enter key a user asked you click into that input and then select all the text

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,250
inside and hit control C to copy it.

44
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,500
So I think that it might be kind of nice or just a little bit convenient for our users if after they

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,690
hit the enter key to generate the message we automatically select all the text in there for them so

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:23,450
that they can very easily hit control C on their keyboard themselves to copy that link to do so we can

47
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,670
add in another method call on the input element that we are setting the value on.

48
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,630
Let me show you what I mean rather than doing that select right there and then immediately setting a

49
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,710
value on it.

50
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:40,130
I'm going to instead assign the result of that selector to a new variable that I'm going to call input

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,580
or then update the line right after that to say input value.

52
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,360
And then finally right after that I'll do input dot select the select method right here is going to

53
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,840
select that input and all the text inside of it.

54
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,410
So that's what's going to make it really easy for a user to copy the link that we have generated for

55
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,910
them.

56
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:10,750
So going to say this again I'm gonna go back over refresh and loops I duplicated the input element declaration

57
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,000
you know change the name on the second one to link input that's better and I'll change both those as

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,780
well.

59
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,980
Much better yet refresh and I'll put in my secret message again.

60
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,720
And there we go.

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,690
Now that text is automatically selected.

62
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,040
So I would have to do is hit control C and then boom I've got the link that I can easily paste or share

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
with my other users.

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,260
All right.

65
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,220
That's definitely a good improvement.

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,150
Now the last thing we should probably do if we really look back at our mockups over here of what we're

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,730
trying to built after a user enter some text and hits that create button really supposed to hide that

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,580
existing form right there and show just the input and the text that says sure this link with the friend.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,890
So essentially we just need to kind of toggle what is actually visible on the screen at any given time.

70
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,900
So let's take care of that in just a moment.
