1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,160
All right.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,890
In this video we're going to make sure that we show a really big sign on the very center of the screen

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,580
that tells the user that they won once they actually will win but to do so.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,340
Going to go back over to my index dot HDMI file inside of here.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,920
We're going to add in a div element within each one inside of it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,650
Now as a quick reminder Hey I said a billion times this course is all about the javascript.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,540
So this is mostly all about styling.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,840
So we're going to kind of speed through a little bit of styling to make sure that this message shows

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,290
up in the correct location right above my script tag.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,060
I'll add a div with a class of winner and hidden

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,680
and then inside the devil place in each one that says you win then inside my style tag right here I'm

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,650
going to add in some styling properties to just style that thing.

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,230
So first select during an add in is for the hidden class.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,910
It's going to say that if an element has the hidden class then I don't want it to be displayed at all.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,710
So I'll say display none.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,640
Important to make sure 100 percent.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,120
This thing should not show up on the screen and then go into it like the H1.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm gonna give it a color of white and a font size of how about thirty six pixels nice and large and

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,690
then finally to get this thing centered I'm going to select the winner.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:34,200
Class that's essentially this div right here I'm going to add on a couple of different rules to it.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:43,950
So going to say display of flex I'll add on a justify content to justify dash content of center and

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,230
a line dash items of center so that's what it's going to get it to be centered on the screen I'll give

23
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:57,800
it a position of absolute and a z index of 1 to make sure that shows up on top of our canvas element

24
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:06,410
and then finally I'll give it a height of 100 the H and a width of one hundred VW and that's going to

25
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,380
make sure that it stretches out a full height and width of the screen

26
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,880
it's and how we save this.

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,870
No need to go refresh because right now if we refresh we're not going to see anything because we've

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,360
got the hidden class on there.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,770
Remember the hidden class hides that div and everything inside of it.

30
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,190
It's now in order to show this message to our user once they've hit our wind condition we just have

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,270
to select this element and remove the hidden class.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,060
Now we'll get that div in each one side of it to be displayed there for that I'll go back over to my

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,010
index dot J.S. file.

34
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,550
I'm gonna go down to the very bottom where we are handling our win condition right now and then inside

35
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:52,310
of our if statement I'll add in a selector so document dot query selector I'm going to select the element

36
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,750
with a class of winner

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll get the class list and I will remove the class of it in

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,120
all right I'm going to save both these files I'll go back over I'll refresh so I don't see it on the

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,890
screen right away I'm gonna chase change my maze dimensions so you don't have to sit here and watch

40
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,930
me solve this maze forever it's really quickly gonna change two cells horizontal of six and vertical

41
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:34,210
four there we go nice and easy to solve now I can go on over solve it and there we go.

42
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,050
I see you when I think that text could be a little bit larger so what the heck I'm going to dial up

43
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:48,970
that font size inside of our style tag right here I'll go to just a know 64 arbitrarily save that

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,580
when again and that's good enough I'd say Okay.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,330
That's pretty much it.

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,830
That is our main game really downside to this thing is that once a user wins they essentially can't

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,930
do it do anything else until they refresh.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,110
So one way you could easily fix that is to just add in a button maybe to recall or wrap all the code

49
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,330
we wrote together and throw that all into a function and then once the user wins maybe show a button

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,680
then a user can click to build out the entire grid and verticals and all that kind of stuff again but

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm going to leave that up as a exercise to you you mean something that you can implement on your own

52
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,260
if you want to as we've definitely spent a pretty good amount of time on this application already.

53
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,710
Okay.

54
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,030
So I hope you enjoyed this app.

55
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,560
I think that it looks pretty interesting and hey who doesn't like a good mace to play around with so

56
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,290
let's take a break here and continue on the next video.
