1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's do some practice with functions.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,090
So in this example I'd like you to write a function called average a v g or just average the word which

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,360
accepts an array of numbers and you can assume it's all numbers.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,450
You don't have to check to see if each thing is a number.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,190
So it accepts an array of numbers and it should return.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,120
The average value of all those numbers.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,180
So in a simple case like 0 and 50 it should return twenty five but it should work for an array of any

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,720
length one hundred numbers twenty numbers two numbers return the average.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,080
Okay.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,410
So give it a shot.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,800
There's many ways of doing this.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,980
There's many ways of doing this including some functions and some helpers we haven't covered yet.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,890
That would make this even easier but we're just gonna start with a good old fashioned loop and division.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,340
So let's define our function function a veggie and let's give the parameter a name of array a r r so

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:08,910
are you can also call it names values and our main approach here is going to be loop over each num add

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:17,370
them together divide by number of numbers divide by the length of the array.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,520
So we need a place where we can tally or sum all of the values we give.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,520
We need a variable.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,450
So I'm going to make a variable called Total and I'll start it at 0.

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,690
Then we're going to loop over each number.

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,860
We could do a for loop.

22
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:44,510
I like 4 of so 4 let num call it num or X or Val value of the array we want to take that NUM and add

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,480
it into total so total plus equals num.

24
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,620
So we start with 0 and 50 total starts at 0 num is 0.

25
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,290
The first time we add 0 to 0 then now is now 50.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,680
So we're going to add 50 to total total is now 50 and we've hit the end so we're not done because right

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,110
now we would be returning the entire sum if we returned to total.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,950
What we need to do instead is return the total divided by the number of elements in the array so we

29
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,760
can do this.

30
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:31,980
We can make a variable left result equal total divided by a write out length and then return result

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,400
or rez.

32
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,600
Let's see if it works.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,120
Average of 0 and fifty is twenty five eighty five point two for this array of test scores.

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,330
We could also just return this line without a variable.

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,210
It's clear enough we're just taking the total dividing by the length of the array and that's it.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,030
We start with a total of zero.

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,730
We loop over each element we add that into the total.

38
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,820
So we end up with this sum and then we return that sum divided by the number of elements.

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,140
Like I said there's many ways of doing this.

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,960
You could have used a for loop at regular for loop instead if you know about things like for each which

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,060
we haven't covered you could use that but the main idea is use some things together using a loop and

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,750
then divide.
