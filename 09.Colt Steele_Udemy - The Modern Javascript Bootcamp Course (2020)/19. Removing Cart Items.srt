1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,520
Well that's why we have to do is allow a user to click on this button right here and delete the given

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,640
item out of the shopping cart.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,940
So the first thing we need to do is to make sure that clicking on that little button is going to submit

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,970
a POST request using a form element.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,530
We're then going to implement a root handler inside our application to receive that post request and

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,420
use it to actually delete an item out of the cart.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,920
So to get started I'm going to go and find where each of those buttons gets rendered.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,520
So inside of my views carts showed up J.S. file.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,260
Take a look at.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,460
Rendered items.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,140
This is where each of those items is being assembled inside there.

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,590
We can scroll down a little bit.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,040
We'll see a David class remove inside there is a form element already and there's a button inside there

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,410
that has an icon inside of it.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,730
So this is the form that is going to be submitted.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,200
Anytime a user clicks on that red x button.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,460
So this one right here so we need to add in some properties to the thing to make sure that our server

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,560
understands exactly which item we want to delete out of our cart.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,350
You might recall that just a little bit ago when we were working on our views products index not J.S.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,400
file we spoke about the form over here as well.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,810
And we said that we needed to somehow communicate exactly what product we were trying to add to our

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,750
cart.

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,350
So in an identical scenario this time around as well we need to somehow communicate during this form

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,280
the middle which item needs to be removed.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,010
There's two different ways we can do that.

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,210
As we discussed with the product stuff just a moment ago we can either reflect the items idea inside

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,710
of the form action property or essentially inside the U.R.L. of the post request we make the other way

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,690
we can communicate this is by adding in a hidden input element we can assign a value to this thing of

29
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,920
the ideas of the product that we want to remove out of our cart and then our server can take a look

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,770
at the form body or the body the post request to figure out exactly which item needs to be removed through

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,340
once again once again going to use this input strategy.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,680
So inside the farm I can put an input element with hidden so the user doesn't see it for value I can't

33
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,700
specify the item I.D..

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,840
So this is going to be the idea of the item like this item right here that we want to remove out of

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,070
our cart.

36
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,950
I'm also gonna put a name on the thing of item IDEA AND THEN I'LL CLOSE OFF THE INPUT element like so

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,070
now.

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,560
One other thing I'm going to do on my form element I'm going to also define the action property.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Remember action specifies where we are going to make this post request to.

40
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm going to put in an action of slash cart slash products slash delete.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,620
This is not required at all.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,140
The only reason I'm doing this is to make sure that's really clear to anyone who starts to look at this

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,450
form to understand that or to help them understand that submitting this form is going to trigger some

44
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,650
deletion of something and that's going to be evident by the fact that we're going to be referencing

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,480
a path here of slash delete

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,120
okay.

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,450
So let's go back over to our root handler file.

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,550
We're going to make sure that we've got a post request handler to handle a POST request made to cart

49
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:18,380
slash products slash delete so back inside of my routes cart start j ust file I'll find the last comment

50
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:26,230
we have inside of here and we'll add in router dot post and we're going to watch for a post request

51
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,140
to well we were just discussing cart products delete

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,900
then as a second argument I make sure that I put in my function for request in response we're definitely

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,940
gonna have some async code inside this thing so second market as async.

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,240
All right.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,310
So right now let's just do a quick counsel log of req dot body dot item I.D..

56
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,420
So this should be the I.D. of the item inside of our current that we want to remove.

57
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,940
So again it's gonna be like that I.D. right there.

58
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,070
So we're going to have to iterate through a list of items find the appropriate object and just remove

59
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,900
it out of the list of items and save our card back to our repository it's going to save this.

60
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,420
And let's test this out really quickly.

61
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,450
Just make sure we can get that console log so I'll go back over I'm going to refresh the page and then

62
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,910
click on one of these red Xs when I did so the browser is just going to hang and that's just because

63
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,630
we're not doing inside of our request handler right now.

64
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,990
But if we go back over to our terminal we will see the idea of the item that we're trying to delete

65
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,230
console logged out right there.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,190
OK.

67
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,910
That's definitely very good.

68
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,910
So let's take a another quick pause we'll come back and make sure that we implement the logic to actually

69
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,570
take a look at all the items inside of our carts and remove the appropriate item.
