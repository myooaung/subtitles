00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.050
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.700
We saw the first part of a conditional where we can write if and then a condition and some code will

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.680
run.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.030
Next we're going to talk about a second component which is called else if you can think of else if as

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
if the first condition was not true maybe this other thing will be true.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.070
It will only be attempted if the first part if the if was false.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.840
So if we try it out over here I'm in a new file again.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.580
I kept my code from the last section or the last video where we're doing a performance review.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.220
Let's say this is our guide if rating is three.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.670
That person is a superstar.

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.880
If rating is two they meet expectations.

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.510
So with what we know right now without else if we could just write a second condition if rating equals

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.250
equals to console that log meets expectations like that.

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.900
And this does work if I make rating too.

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.730
We'll only see meets expectations but this is not the same thing as using an.

16
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.580
Else if if we have two separate ifs there's certain scenarios where both of them could be true instead

17
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.190
of checking if rating is equal to three.

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310
But if we said if it is I don't know.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.160
Equal to three and then this one was greater than or equal to two.

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.590
If we change rating to three both of these will be true and we end up with both of them printed out.

21
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.340
Now that's kind of an arbitrary example because in our case rating is really just three to one or something

22
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.150
else.

23
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.120
But the point is this is a different structure.

24
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.660
We have two conditionals first one runs if it's true this code runs and regardless of whether this one

25
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.140
actually worked if this was true or not.

26
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.420
The second one will be attempted but if we change our structure and we use an.

27
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.830
Else if only one of them will ever run.

28
00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.570
So if we add else if it follows the exact same format where we have our parentheses and a condition

29
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:12.600
we just add else instead of purely if so else if rating equals two we'll console that log meets expectations

30
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.220
we'll save refresh the page and when rating is to this prints out the first one is tempted.

31
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.150
It's false.

32
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.670
So we try this one if that one didn't work.

33
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.910
Try this if this one didn't work we can add in multiple else ifs.

34
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.370
I have a side on it.

35
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.100
We can have as many as we want.

36
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.120
You probably don't want to have a ton of them.

37
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.200
Your code can get pretty long and there might be a better way to refactor or rewrite your massive conditional

38
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.250
but it is valid javascript so we could add in the same thing.

39
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.480
I'm just going to duplicate this.

40
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.320
I'll select it and then shift option down arrow and I'll say if rating is equal to one or else if rating

41
00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.560
is equal to one needs improvement refresh we get the same result.

42
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.030
If rating is one we get needs improvement it attempts this it's false it moves on.

43
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.050
Maybe this one that's false.

44
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.890
It moves on.

45
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.810
How about this one.

46
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.230
In our case it's true when rating is one.

47
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.150
So we get this printed out so elusive is a another option to try after the first one does not work and

48
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.450
else if it's only valid if there is an if before it otherwise it doesn't make sense in JavaScript will

49
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.120
freak out at you.

50
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.870
You can see it's highlighting it for me and V.S. code it's expecting some sort of conditional to come

51
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.710
before it meaning it wants.

52
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.830
So they have to be paired.

53
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.200
We have our if and then optionally a bunch of else ifs.

54
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.640
So that's pretty much it for else.

55
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.670
It's relatively straightforward if you understand if it's the same idea.

56
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.190
It's just a second option or third or fourth or however many you need after the first one if it was

57
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.790
false.

58
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.220
We have one more piece of the puzzle.

59
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.980
We'll talk about it in the next video.

60
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.450
Else.
