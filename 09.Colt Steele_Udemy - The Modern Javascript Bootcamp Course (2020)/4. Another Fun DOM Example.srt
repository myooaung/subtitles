1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,650
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,720
This is part two of our taste of the dumb little demonstration.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,990
So I'm going to go ahead and play around with Google the home page of Google again.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,090
But I'm going to do something a little bit more visual more intense.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,790
I'm going to take every element that you see on the screen and animated around randomly so it will just

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,660
end up being a huge mess to try and use.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,220
And yeah just to show you that we can do things like change dials and move things around and animate

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,120
them.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,350
So I'm going to open up my console almost their command option Jay.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,380
There we go.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,240
And the way I'm going to write my code instead of just typing it in the console because I'm going to

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,980
have probably 10 or 20 lines I'm going to make a snippet.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,220
And in Chrome to make a snippet we go to sources.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,110
And then there's a tab called snippets.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,060
If it doesn't show up for you you can click the arrow and go to snippets.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,330
This allows me to write some code.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,510
I'm going to click new snippet I can write code and then run it at any point in the browser without

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,010
having to make a separate file and it will be evaluated and I can do things with the current web page.

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,060
So I'm just going to try something like console dot log two plus two.

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,690
I mean I save it and then I can run it either by hitting Where's that button right here clicking this

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,760
or using the shortcut which is what I use command enter on a Mac if you're on the P.C. it will tell

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,820
you what to use right there.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,660
So I just ran it and if I look at my console you can see four was printed out.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,550
So we're not going to be using console that logs or anything right now.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm instead going to interact with the elements over here on the DOM get rid of that triangle.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,280
Some fun top Google searches how to make French toast jobs hiring and funny cat videos can argue with

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,070
that.

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,300
All right.

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,380
So the first thing I'll show you is that we can create new elements.

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,680
Super easy.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,950
Well it's relatively easy.

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,980
Don't worry about any of this syntax will go into the details about how all of this works.

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,680
But I'm going to make a new image.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,430
I'm going to give it a name.

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,000
My image.

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,880
I'm going to give it a source.

38
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:12,200
My image source equals and I have a you are all I've copied from on Splash a free image.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,260
We can use.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,640
And then I'm going to add this image to the DOM I'm going to insert it.

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:28,780
So I'll do document top body dot append my image and if I run this code I'll hit command enter.

42
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,470
Hope there's my image.

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,930
Very large image but it's showing up.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,820
If I want to amend it to be smaller my image dot style dot with equals.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,380
Let's do 200 pixels run this code again I'll have to refresh my page and run it.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,420
Now we have this image of a dog wearing goggles.

47
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,120
OK.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,850
So that's first.

49
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,200
But now if I want to move it around there's a lot of different ways of doing this.

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,880
The best way would be to do it mostly VSI RSS.

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,090
But what I want to do is in JavaScript I'm going to generate some random numbers an X and a y coordinate

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,330
or a position and use that to move the image to that location using a CSX transform.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,440
So if you haven't seen transforms and CSX this is going to be new but it's really just a demo of cool

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,200
stuff we can do.

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,680
So don't worry about it.

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:28,800
What I'll do is get my image my image dot style dot transform and before I animate anything I'll just

57
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,490
assign a transform like.

58
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:38,700
How about translate and then I give it a number like three hundred karma two hundred.

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's see how that looks.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,620
If I run it up I think I forgot the pixels that I need to add three hundred and 200 pixels.

61
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,590
Let's try that again.

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,350
OK.

63
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,410
So now I transformed the image I moved it over here I translated it.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,590
So that's how we can do it just once.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:01,500
Now if I wanted to do this randomly and I want to repeat it I could do it using a set interval so set

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,700
interval I pass in my function I'll use an arrow function just for some diversity here.

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,720
And we also need the duration or how long that interval should be.

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,420
So every two seconds will run this code and we will transform that image.

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,350
But let's generate two random pixel values and I'm going to use the dimensions of the screen which I

70
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:35,650
can access using document dots body dot client width and client height height.

71
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,280
So that's something we will see and talk about in greater detail.

72
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:47,160
Document dot body dot client with times math dot random.

73
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,390
Make sure I add my parents and then I'll floor that whole thing as we've seen before to get a whole

74
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,330
number.

75
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,950
So this will give me a random number between 0 and whatever the width of the window is which changes

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,010
depending on the actual width.

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,760
So here we get a different width versus here we would be getting 400 pixels.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,050
All right.

79
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,190
So mess up floor.

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm going to save that to a variable called X and then duplicate this and do the same thing for a variable

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,040
called Y.

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm just getting two random numbers.

83
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,060
Top for document out body.

84
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,430
I mean I do client height here and then I'm going to plug those numbers in right here.

85
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,040
So this does need to be a template literal not single quotes.

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,580
So I'll put that around my string and then interpolate X pixels and then Y pixels.

87
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,090
And the moment of truth Let's see what happens.

88
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,110
Okay we're getting something.

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,400
It's not pretty.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,420
It's very jerky but every two seconds it is moving around.

91
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,780
And if I wanted to make it smoother in my CSX I would add in a transition property although right now

92
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't have a CSI style sheet.

93
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,000
This is Google's website so I'll just show you that you can do it through javascript my image DOD style

94
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,770
dot transition equals and then I'll say one.

95
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,240
What is it.

96
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,140
All one second.

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,280
Let's do two seconds.

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,290
If this interval is two seconds I'll have it take two seconds to translate.

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,870
And does it work.

100
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,730
Oh look at that.

101
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,200
It's moving all over the place.

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,660
Okay.

103
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,950
So kind of fun.

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,340
We're picking a random X and Y on the screen and moving the image.

105
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,520
That image for the record was not there when the page loaded.

106
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,670
We're adding it in so we're seeing a whole bunch of different features already.

107
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,370
We created a new element.

108
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,080
We updated its source attribute.

109
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,630
We added it to the page.

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,620
Then we added some CSF to it.

111
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,450
We changed the width to make it smaller.

112
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,280
We changed the transition property to make it smoother when it moves.

113
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,800
And then in a interval we're picking random numbers and using that to generate a translation transform

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,310
across the screen every two seconds.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,840
Now for the extra fun part let's do it to every single thing on the page.

116
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,040
So this same logic but I wanted to happen for every element and there's a lot of ways of doing this

117
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,980
but I'm going to do is select all the elements using this document dot body dot children.

118
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,850
Again this is getting to stuff where you have not seen we haven't seen any of this.

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,890
So please don't worry about it.

120
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,070
We will get to every every single line of code rewriting here.

121
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,520
We'll have at least a video addressing it and how it works.

122
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,060
So document updated our children will give me all the elements that we're seeing on the page.

123
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,850
I don't want to select every element in the DOM because there are elements like script tags and link

124
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,460
tags in the title tag.

125
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,420
We don't want those.

126
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,530
We want just the stuff showing up so document dump body dot children.

127
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,470
I'll just call this all else.

128
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,370
All elements.

129
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,100
And then I'm going to loop over all elements inside of my interval.

130
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,250
So for.

131
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:06,790
Let go of all else I'm going to pick an X and Y I'm going to use that x and y to update the transition

132
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,700
excuse me the transform of that element.

133
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,130
So let me make this easier to see instead of my image dot style.

134
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm going to do l so I select everything on the page and then for each one I'm going to give it a new

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,970
transform with a new random x and y and we'll do it every two thousand seconds or two thousand milliseconds

136
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,780
we'll be here quite a long time if I did it to everyone else.

137
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,590
All right let's go back try it again.

138
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,730
Run my code fingers crossed.

139
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,220
All right.

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,380
So we only have the dog image that is transitioning smoothly.

141
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,640
Everything else is just jerking around.

142
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's also rotate everything so we could pick a random rotation here we'll call this rotation which

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,270
needs to be a number between 0 and 360.

144
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,990
So we'll do math at random times 360.

145
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,820
That should give us a random rotation and then the way that transform works and CSX is that it wants

146
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,810
us to pass in a number of degrees so we'll do it just like this.

147
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:15,710
Dollar sign rotation and then afterwards we need to write DG for degrees like we had to do for pixels

148
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,670
and this should be rotating not rotation.

149
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,940
Let's try it out.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,700
And there we go.

151
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,770
Things are rotating they're just not animated except for our one image.

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,630
So the last thing we'll do is apply a style to everything in the body will add a new part to the style

153
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,810
sheet and I'll just paste the code in for that.

154
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,370
Here what I'm saying is make a new CSF style sheet.

155
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,820
Basically that's what I'm saying and then adding a new selector select everything VRC assess give it

156
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,100
transition of two seconds and then I'll add that style sheet in again.

157
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,770
Don't worry about any of this code whatsoever but let's just see if it works.

158
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,900
I'm going to run it.

159
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,180
Fingers crossed.

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,570
Hey look at that.

161
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,440
Everything's all rotating and going crazy moving across the page.

162
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,890
It is kind of annoying that this whole thing is treated as one element.

163
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,700
This I think it's called viewport is the element.

164
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,400
So you might be able to break that up a bit.

165
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:24,510
Well you can see what I'm trying to show you is how we can select things we can screw with them in maybe

166
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,820
not so nice ways like animating them but these principles apply for everything we would do.

167
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,190
We can interact with the form get the value out or change an image source to make a slideshow widget

168
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,610
we can add events like we saw in the last video we can pick random things and mess with them with random

169
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,960
numbers and transformations maybe not all that often but you can't do that.

170
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,910
We can add new styles to a style sheet we can make things have a transition.

171
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,870
We can create an image out of nowhere and added to the page.

172
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,160
OK.

173
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,640
So I tweeted ever so slightly before what was happening so I was getting every element in the body which

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,940
is really just this one div and it contains everything and I was animating this one div.

175
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,930
So this whole piece of content was animating together.

176
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,490
But now what I've done is updated it so that I'm animating these elements inside that div instead which

177
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,770
you can see here.

178
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,730
This is what this line does.

179
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,300
If I run it now we end up with some independent rotation and moving around anyways the whole thing is

180
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,500
useless and silly but it illustrates this idea of changing objects and seeing those changes reflected

181
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,880
in the actual browser.

182
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:39,180
So everything we've done has been manipulating JavaScript objects hence the object model part of the

183
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,580
Dom.

184
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,390
So really really important idea behind all of this the page loads and all of the juicy content is run

185
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:52,380
through the DOM machine the DOM maker 3000 obviously not what it's called but it takes that content

186
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,870
it understands it digests it and it spits out a bunch of JavaScript objects some of which we interacted

187
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,240
with in order to make this happen and some of which we created from scratch and then told to the DOM

188
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,530
or told javascript to insert them with the rest of the content.

189
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,230
Okay so now that we've had is somewhat overwhelming taste of the Dom now we're going to go into the

190
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,850
basics and start from the beginning.

191
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,700
How do we do some of the stuff we just did it go into detail around selecting and changing styles and

192
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,540
different attributes and events.

193
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,490
There's a lot to talk about.
