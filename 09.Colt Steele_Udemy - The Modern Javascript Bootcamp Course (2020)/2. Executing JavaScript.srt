1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,660
Now that we've got no jazz installed we're going to set up a new little project and just figure out

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,180
how to run code with node inside of a workspace directory inside of my terminal inside of here.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:16,400
I'm to make a new folder called simply node 0 then change into there and I'll start up my code editor

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:26,050
inside once I have my code editor open I'm gonna create a new file called index dot J.S. and inside

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,800
of here I'll do a very simple console log of hi there like so usually to run some javascript code that

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,900
we run right inside of our Ed throughout this course we've been creating an index on each team I'll

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,790
file but like we just said we don't have to worry about each HTML anymore now that we're making use

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,570
of node.

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,620
So in order to run this file we can now go back over to our terminal we can verify that the index dot

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:57,940
J.S. file is right there and then we can run node index dot J.S. like so that's going to read the contents

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,420
of the index dot J.S. file and execute everything inside of their I believe it or not.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,350
This is just one way that we could run code with node is actually two different ways we can use the

13
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,870
node CLIA to run some javascript code.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,790
The first is to run node and then the name of the file in the same directory.

15
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,750
We can technically execute files in different directories.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,090
We just have to provide a relative path.

17
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,720
The vast majority of time however you're going to be running code inside of a file in the same directory.

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,050
That's how we run code inside of a file.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,510
We can also run javascript code with node by entering the node rebel.

20
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,070
We can do this by just running the command node by itself.

21
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,640
So if I go back over to my terminal I can run node by itself without any file name you'll notice that

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,580
it kicks me to kind of a prompt right here.

23
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,320
So again this is called the node rebel and we can use this to execute one off javascript statements.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,430
This is just about identical to the console that we've been making use of inside the browser throughout

25
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,480
this course.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,200
So for example I can define some variable called say message sign it a string of Hi there and then print

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,310
out that string like so I can also add numbers or do just about anything else I can create a data object

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,140
just about anything you can possibly imagine.

29
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,440
We will very frequently be making use of the node rebel which we're using right now.

30
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,730
Any time that you want to just test out little snippets of code but usually in general we almost always

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,840
make use of node by executing a distinct file that has some amount of code inside of it.

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,060
Now one thing I want to mention right now and I'm going to mention this several times throughout the

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,900
course as we continue using Node if you ever want to stop a node program yet one is being executed through

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,820
a file or the rebel.

35
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,110
All you have to do is press control see on your keyboard.

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,030
So if I go back over and to the replay right here I can press control C twice and I get kicked back

37
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,240
over to my terminal.

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,610
All right now you've seen the basics of writing some code.

39
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,260
Well let's start to dive into some more advanced stuff around node in the next video.
