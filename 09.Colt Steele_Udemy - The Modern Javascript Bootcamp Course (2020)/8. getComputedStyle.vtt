00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.870
In this video we'll see a different way of accessing style values.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.500
So not to set a value but to retrieve what the current value is for color or background color or display

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.610
position with all these different properties we might want to access on an element.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.260
We couldn't really do using these style property as we saw for example we take any of these allies we

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.980
select them I'll just do document that query selector ally just to get the first one it has that class

6
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.480
of special if I do dot style dot color it's empty and we saw why that happens in the last video it happens

7
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.470
because the style property only contains the inline styles it does not contain any calculated styles

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.510
any styles from a style sheet anything from a class which is what's going on here we have a class of

9
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.040
special that is turning this ally teal.

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.640
So if I want to get that calculated or computed value we have a method called Get computed style and

11
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.400
we pass in an element that we've selected so I'm gonna have to select this ally and save it to a variable

12
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.770
or pass this in to get computed style.

13
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:18.190
I'll call this ally and then get computed style of ally and I'll save this to a variable and this will

14
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.150
return to me an object called a CSF style declaration.

15
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.210
And if I open it up what you'll see is a ton of stuff.

16
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.230
Keep scrolling down here we have key value pairs for all CSI as properties.

17
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.250
Notice there are actual values here.

18
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.470
Most of them are just the default values in your browser.

19
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.070
So the default background color is down here which is where are you.

20
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.300
Background.

21
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.180
Background color RGA 0 0 0 0 which is just nothing.

22
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.410
The default background image is none the default background positions 0 0.

23
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.680
Then here's one that we applied border one pixel solid teal which is coming from the style sheet.

24
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.030
Here's the class special border one pixel solid teal so you can see that this object that we got from

25
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.150
get computed styles if we scroll all the way back up is actually going to contain all of the properties

26
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.220
in the SS for a given element all the possible properties and all of their current values.

27
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.070
Now when I say current values they could change.

28
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:29.380
So if we change something the easy way using the style object which we could do ally dot style dot color

29
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.740
now equals pink okay.

30
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.910
Now let's look at that style object that we got when it clear my console.

31
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.790
It is not happy with the style objects that I had printed out.

32
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.640
So we have our styles here that we got from get computed style.

33
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.740
If we do styles dot color we now have a different color.

34
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.770
This is the color I just set.

35
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.530
Pink.

36
00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:03.080
If I change the ally dot style dot color is now equal to red and we do styles that color again.

37
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.270
Now we have the RG B for Red 255 red 0 green 0 blue.

38
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.560
So this object now that we got from get computed styles.

39
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.740
I'm calling it styles will contain all of the current updated styles and computed means that sometimes

40
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.080
these styles may come from a style sheet.

41
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.170
Sometimes they may come from javascript but we can also have things like a hover style on my H1.

42
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.000
If I add in a style based off of hover and I give a color of purple and a font size of 80 pixels instead

43
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.260
of 60 pixels.

44
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.440
If I refresh my page I hover.

45
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.690
It grows.

46
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.210
It's not actually turning purple.

47
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.780
Oh I don't know why it did purple twice but it doesn't matter because in my index I had a inline style

48
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.430
declaration and that's a perfect example of why inline style declarations suck.

49
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.710
They override everything so you can write a bunch of styles and they won't work so it should be purple

50
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.640
now and instead of making it purple again when we hover let's make it orange all right.

51
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.220
So now I have her.

52
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.730
It goes orange and it gets bigger.

53
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.400
So what I could do to illustrate get computed styles and the fact that it works on any sort of styles

54
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.390
that would be applied.

55
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.470
Let's figure out the computed color and font size when I hover.

56
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.660
Now this is it's kind of tricky because in order to run that code from my console I have to be typing

57
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.250
over here although I guess I can move my my cursor over here as I do it.

58
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.380
So let's try it.

59
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.930
Let's select the H1 console H1 equals document that query selector H1 and then I'll run get computed

60
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.830
styles.

61
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.980
Let's make a variable called comp styles equals and then get computed style of that H1 that we just

62
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.480
selected.

63
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.260
OK so let's start by looking at comp styles dot color.

64
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.230
That's the purple color we have.

65
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.950
And if we look at font size remember we have to use camel case it is 60 pixels.

66
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.000
So already this is much better than using the inline style property because we're able to actually get

67
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.420
a value for color and font size versus doing H1 dot style dot color gives us an empty string H1 dot

68
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.140
style dot font size also gives us an empty string.

69
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.170
So now if I type my line let's do comp styles dot color.

70
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.680
They're not going to hit entering when a hover first and then hit enter.

71
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.540
Take a look.

72
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.050
I hovered and we got a new computed style value and now it goes back to what it was before.

73
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.830
Same thing with font size.

74
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.640
It starts at Nope not that version.

75
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.090
This one starts at 60 pixels.

76
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.420
And if I run it again.

77
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.210
But first hover and hit enter.

78
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.970
Now it's 80 pixels.

79
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.840
So it's kind of cool computer computed styles is a great way to figure out what's actually going on

80
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.120
on your page.

81
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.300
You can have a whole bunch of styles being applied to one element.

82
00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.730
But to know what is actually winning what is actually showing up in the DOM and taking effect.

83
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.350
You can use get computed style.

84
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.650
All right.

85
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.710
So that's pretty much it.

86
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.730
Get computed style returns a massive object containing every property that has been calculated since

87
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.270
the USS.
