1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,670
The next thing to know about conditionals is that we can nest them inside of one another so we can have

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,490
multiple layers deep of conditionals where we're checking for a certain condition to be true and we

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,730
can nest them as much as we want whether it's if and elses.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,600
We can throw an LC FS we just nest them inside the curly braces so let's try an example we'll go with

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,780
this example I've been using in the slides of a password so let's say a user type some password and

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,380
we don't know what it is.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,000
So that's gonna be invalid.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,180
Just gonna make it undefined for now let's say we don't know what it is we want to make sure the password

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,370
is long enough so we would check if password dot length is let's say it's greater than or equal to maybe

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,420
6 8.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,690
Not super strong.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,630
It should be longer but just to make our lives easier if it is greater than or equal to 6.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,800
We'll check something if it's not.

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,160
We'll consider it log.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,810
Password must be longer.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,480
Great but if it is greater than or equal to 6.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,620
We're not done.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,710
We also want to make sure there's no spaces in a password so we can check if password and the easiest

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,110
way to check if there's a space anywhere in there.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,510
At least with what we know right now would be to do an index of the space character.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,710
So that's an empty string.

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,550
There's a space and remember if it is found in the string password we'll get an index like two or seven

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,960
or twenty or zero.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,180
If it's not found we'll get negative 1.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,020
So if we find negative one that means there is a space.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,810
So if password that index of space is equal to negative one that means there is no space.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,280
We can then console that log.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,240
Valid password

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:01,920
and then otherwise we can consider that log password is long enough but can not contain spaces.

30
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,180
So let's test it out right now password is undefined.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,170
Let's give it a value password will be Hello Kitty.

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,710
So that is long enough but if I refresh we see password is long enough but can cannot contain spaces

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,530
and there is at least one space in there.

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:26,480
If I get rid of that refresh valid password now if I get rid of some of these characters it's too short

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,940
we get password must be longer.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,200
So the main takeaway from this video should be that we can nest conditionals instead of other conditionals.

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,870
We could add in another.

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,420
Else if somewhere although I don't really think I can't think of a good scenario at least now with a

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,080
password or an else it would make sense but we could continue to nest instead of else instead of if

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,100
but there is a point where it becomes a little bit difficult to read.

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,350
If your code is super nested and there are different solutions or strategies you can take to alleviate

42
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,360
that we're about to start learning one of them at least where something like this could actually be

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,170
written as a single condition because in order for a password to be valid we need the length to be greater

44
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,190
than 6 and we want there to be no spaces.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,670
That means it's valid.

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,990
What if we could just write a single conditional that said if it's long enough and there aren't spaces

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,070
it's valid.

48
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,680
That's what we'll see how to do next.

49
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,190
There's nothing wrong with nesting.

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,440
Sometimes you cannot get around it but you just don't want to have like five levels of nested conditionals

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,170
especially if they all have if an elses.

52
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,500
It just can be a bit of a headache to understand so that's nesting.
