00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.850
I was able to successfully search for some videos at the very end the last video and then show them

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.150
as a list on the screen with the title of each.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.910
However as I was typing out Avengers I saw a little air up here at my console right here.

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.930
So this is an area that you might or might not be seeing right now if you're not seeing it.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.170
Let me show you how you can get that same error very quickly.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.960
Try refreshing your app and select your search bar right there and then enter in a long random string

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.100
of characters.

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.520
As soon as you do you're probably gonna see an error just like that.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.390
So what's going on here.

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.060
We are successfully making our request.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.510
You can see that if you still have your Network tab open.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.370
But we definitely are seeing something around movies not being editable.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.850
Well let's take a look at the actual response that we're getting back inside this request and we can

14
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.980
figure out why we're getting this error.

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.240
So if you select that you're going to see a response object that looks like that right there it has

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.150
an air property and a response.

17
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.070
So essentially we entered in a search term for a movie that has no results whatsoever so rather than

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.650
giving us some kind of response that says hey here's the list of movies that we found 0 like an empty

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.370
array.

20
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.110
This API chose to tell us inside of this kind of error message right here that no movies were found

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.570
whatsoever.

22
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.530
So we need to make sure that we go back over to our fetch data function or somewhere inside of our code

23
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.960
and handle this case in which we make a request and don't get any results whatsoever.

24
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.890
One other thing I want to mention at this time as well is that these search functionality with these

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.550
API is not quite as great as you might expect.

26
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.870
So for example we've seen several times we can put in Avengers and get the correct results.

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.360
But if I only put in the word like a V N ABN like so unfortunately well that wouldn't happen to like

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.380
actually turn out.

29
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.860
There we go.

30
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.150
So if I do AVP and G it's only part of the word Avengers on any normal search engine or search functionality

31
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.890
I would still expect that to give me some results of like The Avengers because that's part of the word.

32
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.060
But unfortunately this API doesn't really consider partial terms like a V E and G so it doesn't match

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.100
that with the movie Avengers.

34
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.170
So when I put that in I still get the same kind of response it says movie not found so that's just something

35
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.310
we need to be aware of as we are testing out our application.

36
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.000
We really do have to put in a reasonable title of a movie in order to see any kind of results whatsoever

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.390
okay.

38
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
Let's go back over to our code and we're gonna figure out some way to fix up our code and handle the

39
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.540
case in which we don't get any results at all.

40
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.830
So back over here I think the most reasonable way to handle this would be to go to our fetch data function

41
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.290
go inside a fetch data right here right after we make our request.

42
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.670
Let's try to look at the response we're going to inspect response dot data and we're going to see if

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.170
there was an error that we're getting back when we made the request.

44
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.340
One thing I I kind of mentioned here is that the errors that we're talking about right now are not like

45
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.580
actual request errors a real request error would be like if we typed in an incorrect U.R.L. and we didn't

46
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.710
get any kind of response whatsoever.

47
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.060
That's not what is happening here.

48
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.430
In this case the request has been issued successfully.

49
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.630
We're getting back a status code of 200 which means that everything with the request went OK.

50
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.820
So this is not really an error in the strictest sense of the word.

51
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.980
So in my opinion this is not the best designed API.

52
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.930
Nonetheless it's what we're working with the rather than handling an error in a classic sense.

53
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.130
We're just gonna check to see if the response has an heir property and if it does then we're just going

54
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.970
to return an empty array and say well turns out we didn't find any results whatsoever tobacco over here.

55
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.190
I'm going to say if response dot data got error like so and again notice that we have a capital E is

56
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.890
that is what the response is giving us.

57
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.130
So if there is an error let's just return an empty array and essentially say we didn't get any movies

58
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.990
whatsoever to show to the user okay.

59
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.890
So now let's try this again.

60
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.570
I'm going to refresh and I'm going to put in a very strange search term here.

61
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.290
So just a bunch of characters.

62
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.640
Now I don't see anything on the screen and I don't have an error either.

63
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.260
So this is definitely what I would really expect if I don't get any results I don't show any content

64
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.610
whatsoever that might seem a bit odd.

65
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.250
But remember this is kind of the a system that we agreed with.

66
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.930
Right here we had said that if a user finishes typing and we find no results we're just not going to

67
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.580
show any content in a perfect world we would show the user some kind of error message and tell them

68
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.020
that or like a warning or something like that and tell them Hey we didn't find any content but for right

69
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.060
now this is definitely good enough okay.

70
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.440
So we got that era fixed up.

71
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.030
So another quick pause right here and we'll continue in just a moment.
