00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.660
Last we have to do inside of our event listener is make sure that whenever a user presses on the appropriate

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.520
key we change the movements of the ball.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.290
So how are we going to do that.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.520
Essentially what we're going to do is take a look at the current velocity of the ball.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.120
When I use the word velocity that means the speed in which the ball is moving so we're going to take

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.340
the velocity of the ball and then we're going to update it or add in some additional velocity in the

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.970
up down left or right directions to change the velocity of a shape.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.370
We have to get another object from the matter j ust library.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
So I'm going to go up to the very top of the file where we are currently D structuring a couple of properties

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.100
we're going to d structure another property called body like so this body object has some different

11
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.110
functions on it that allow us to update the different properties inside of a shape so he can use it

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.540
to change the dimensions of a shape it's position velocity its rotation and so on.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.390
Now that we've got that body object let's go back down to our event handler down here.

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.080
We're going to first take a look at our ball and get its current velocity.

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.500
So I'm going to say const X and Y with some curly braces because we are doing some deep structuring

16
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.210
here.

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.000
Ball dot velocity so X and Y are going to be the current velocity of the ball.

18
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.410
Let's do a quick console log and to see what those values are printed out as now go back over refresh

19
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.800
and I'll refresh once again and right after I refresh I get a press on the w key which should trigger

20
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.720
that code to go essentially right here like go or print out the console log in refresh and then press

21
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.260
a couple of times and we can see the console log of the x and y values so we'll see the very first console

22
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.960
log right here as the ball was falling down.

23
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.970
We had an x coordinate or an x velocity of zero which means that the ball was not moving side to side

24
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.760
at all at the Y value was eight point two three.

25
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.310
Which means the ball was going downwards or it was moving downwards over time once the ball kind of

26
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.950
hit that block right there and started rolling slightly.

27
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.050
We can see that these numbers got very very small until now if I press again.

28
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.780
They're at 0 0 because the ball is not moving at all okay.

29
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.420
So now we've got these values we can use those and add in some additional velocity to either the X or

30
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.250
Y coordinate it's going to take care of moving the ball up first I'll remove the console log and I'll

31
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.610
say body set velocity This is how we update the velocity of a shape we'll say ball and I'm going to

32
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.110
get the same X so we have right now.

33
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.970
So I'll say X is X and remember we can use that key value shortcut.

34
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.410
When those variables are identical to reduce down to just X and then my Why is going to be whatever

35
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
the Y currently is minus five.

36
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.010
We are subtracting five here because we want to move the ball in the up direction and move it up.

37
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.680
We want to have a negative velocity so every single time that the user presses on the w key which is

38
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.120
key code eighty seven.

39
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.370
We're going to take whatever the current velocity is we're gonna subtract five to it and set the velocity

40
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.540
to that new y velocity.

41
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.870
Let's now say this and do a quick test of flip back over refresh.

42
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.870
I'm gonna refresh a couple of times until I get a nice column like this right here.

43
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690
Like lots of space to work with.

44
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.360
I'll press w a couple times and every single time I do the ball moves slightly faster and faster as

45
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.610
every single time I press it.

46
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.420
I'm accelerating five additional or soon I'm adding five units of velocity in the upwards direction

47
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.040
okay.

48
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.990
That looks good so let's now repeat the same process for each of our different directions.

49
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.630
I'm going to copy that set velocity and we'll take care of going right next.

50
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.210
So in this case I'm going to clear out the x and y inside of here if I want to move right I'm gonna

51
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:08.390
do X of whatever the current x velocity is plus five and the same y and ideally that console log then

52
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.860
to go down I'll delete the council log.

53
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.480
In this case I still want to adjust the y value but to go downwards faster I want to do a plus five

54
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.330
and then to move to the left faster I'm going to do

55
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.670
same y and an x of X minus five.

56
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.150
So again to move to the left we subtract from X all right.

57
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.220
So I'll save this I'm gonna flip back over once again.

58
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.710
Now we should have full control of the ball so I can go to the right left.

59
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.770
I can go up and I can go down as well and that's pretty much it.

60
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.450
Now if this thing feels laggy right now that's totally fine.

61
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.830
You can always try to close your developer console and when you do so you're going to see that the map

62
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.070
or the maze is slightly more responsive and just a little bit less laggy.

63
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.290
It's not a total solution but definitely having your developer console open adds in a little bit more

64
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.190
of a performance penalty.

65
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.010
Now we can easily start to navigate through our maze okay.

66
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.120
So this is looking pretty good but I think that having the gravity turned on is a little bit distracting.

67
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.640
So let's take a quick pause right here.

68
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.670
When we come back the next video we're going to disable gravity inside of our maze which is going to

69
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.830
make controlling that ball just a little bit more easy so quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
