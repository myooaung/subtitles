1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,960
All right.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,100
So in the last video we saw that we could add an event listener by using an on click or on some attribute

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,370
in line which I said I'm not a fan of because I don't like writing javascript in a string in our HMO.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,100
And then we also saw that we could do it in our javascript by selecting an element I'll call it El.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,470
I haven't actually selected it.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,700
And then setting the on click property or the on mouse over or on Double Click property whatever the

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,520
name of the property is on something.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,100
And I also mentioned this is not great in my opinion either but I didn't go into a ton of detail why

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,820
I'm going to show you quickly why it's not great and then we'll see the alternative which is called

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,910
Ad event listener.

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:49,860
So if we add in something to select a simple button we'll do a button click me and then select it over

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,270
here so document that query selector button save it to a variable.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,560
And I set the on click to be some function nice and simple will console that log you click me.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,900
All right.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,990
So this is review.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,070
It should work.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,630
And thus I mess up any syntax here.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,890
Let's refresh the page and it does work.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,700
Now if I wanted to have a second quick listener I don't have that option with what we've seen with on

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,050
click.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,440
It's a single property just like if we have some object constant thing equals this object.

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:36,420
If I set thing dot color equal to purple if I'd try and change thing dot color instead of equal to some

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,160
other it could be a function.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,350
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,490
Only the most recent value is there.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,580
I don't have purple anymore.

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,680
It's a property and we're doing the same thing here.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,360
So if I were to add a another click listener button on quick equals function this time will console

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,250
dot log.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:06,630
Second time let's try it all we get is second time I'm not getting the first event listener or this

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,500
function is not running because we overrode that property.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,200
Now it seems stupid to do two different council dot logs based off of a click but there are times when

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,910
you might want different listeners or multiple functions to run on a given event.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,710
Sometimes you want them to run dynamically so you may not have both of these functions running every

35
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,600
single time something is clicked.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,950
But you could have it turned on and off if that makes sense.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,520
So it's possible you could have more than one handler running for a given event.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,010
Now that doesn't work with the two options we've seen but we have a third option which I've been hinting

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,610
at a lot.

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,620
It's called Ad event listener.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,580
Now our event listener is great because for one thing it's one method and it will attach any type of

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,220
event listener you want to click a double click.

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,250
What do you call him mouse wheel scroll.

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,100
That's not the official term a drag a mouse over any of them.

45
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,290
A prince before Prince for some reason you needed that event and also it will attach as many as we want

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,420
to a given element.

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:18,420
So if we want to use it we select our element and then we call the add event listener method.

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,290
We have it on all elements that we can select.

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:29,130
So I have my button I've selected I call button does add event listener and if I hover but there's over

50
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,560
100 different options here you can see it.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,340
It's been condensed.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,890
It says 81 more or 91 more.

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,730
So what I can do is pass in one of those event names.

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:47,820
Now I don't pass in on click I pass in click and instead of on mouse over I would pass in mouse over

55
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,110
as a string.

56
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,460
So let's do a quick start there and then I have a second argument which is a function and this function

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,460
will execute when this event occurs.

58
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,220
So I'll do an alert clicked and save.

59
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,550
Let's check it out.

60
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,110
I click the button and we get our alert.

61
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,790
I could add a second event listener if I wanted to to the exact same button.

62
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,530
Also listening for a click and all console that log.

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,680
Second thing let's see what happens.

64
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,720
So we get our alert and I get second thing printed out.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,150
So what we're doing here is not setting the on click property.

66
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:41,340
If we actually look at a button over here button dot on click it's not set to anything.

67
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,130
We are attaching an event listener which we can have multiple of for a given event on a given element.

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
So I could attach as many as I want.

69
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,930
It's probably uncommon to do that at least to do multiple clicks.

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,910
So let's try a different type of event.

71
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,700
How about a Mm.

72
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:06,890
What should we do a mouse over so button Dot had event listener mouse over again not on mouse over which

73
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:14,630
is the name of the property we could set but mouse over and a function and you can do an error function

74
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,720
although I'll show you times or a situation where you wouldn't want to use an error function.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,940
It has to do with the keyword this but we're not there yet when this happens.

76
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:34,790
Why don't we change the inter text of the button so button dot in our text equals stop touching me and

77
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,050
save zoom in for you.

78
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,920
There we go.

79
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Now as soon as I leave it still stays because I'm just listening for the mouse over and I'm permanently

80
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,810
changing the inner text.

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:56,390
Fortunately we have a another event we could attach which is a mouse out so mouse out and I'll change

82
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,220
the text back to what did we have originally we had click me originally.

83
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,680
So I'll do that here.

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,230
Click me and save.

85
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,930
Let's see if it works.

86
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,590
I hover.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,680
Stop touching me.

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,710
Back to click me.

89
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,420
Stop touching me.

90
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,950
Back to click me if I click it.

91
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,290
We get our first click function running.

92
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
And the second one runs as well.

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,470
At event listener is our Swiss Army knife for events.

94
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,420
We don't have to set individual properties.

95
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,910
We don't do it in line.

96
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,570
Instead we can just use the exact same method but we pass in the type of event we want.

97
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,340
We can have multiple of the exact same event on one element and then we give a callback function.

98
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,880
This function will run when this event occurs on this button.

99
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,070
So I've got a mouse over a mouse out a click a second click.

100
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,400
Why don't we try one more something that is a little different.

101
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,190
Not a mouse event so not a click or a mouse over mouse out.

102
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,280
Let's try a scroll event when we work with scrolls.

103
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,100
We have a couple of options as far as where we attach the event to.

104
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,730
We can listen for a scroll on the entire window.

105
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,300
So that would be you know a scroll bar over here.

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,300
I don't actually have enough content to scroll so I could quickly rectify that by adding a ton of H

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,610
ones and if I now do it I do have a scroll bar on the right side.

108
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,090
We could also listen for scrolls within a single element.

109
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,620
So if you had like a text box that was very large or an eye frame or some element that you could scroll

110
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,980
inside of then you could add a scroll event to that.

111
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,880
But I'll do it on the entire window.

112
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,070
I'll also move my button to the top so that it's easier if you are just coming to this code and trying

113
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,010
to figure out what the heck's going on.

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,460
So to add a scroll event to the window I have access to the window I just open up the dev tools.

115
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,680
I can just type window so the global scope of the global object in the browser and JavaScript window

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:04,770
dot add event listener and the event is scroll and then I'll add a function.

117
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,720
And in here why don't we just cancel that log stop scrolling

118
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,030
same exact pattern.

119
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,000
Select something.

120
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,630
Or in our case with window we don't have to select it.

121
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,750
We already have window available and then Dot had event listener.

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,050
What kind of event what to do in the event of a scroll on the window.

123
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,060
So we will refresh and I'm going to scroll.

124
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,840
There we go.

125
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,630
So you probably noticed how many times this is printing out one of the most common things to do with

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,240
scrolls is to do something called throttling.

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,880
You may not want to run this function every single time you know the scroll event happens.

128
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,870
It will fire if you just change your scroll position by like a single pixel.

129
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,790
Usually what I've seen at least is there's some position you want to scroll past and that will trigger

130
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,280
something maybe an animation if you get down to the bottom of the page something will happen but you

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,380
normally don't want something to happen like 100 or 300 times in the course of scrolling from the top

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,560
to the bottom of the page but that's beyond what we're talking about here.

133
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,770
All we need to know is that we can use an event listener to attach all sorts of different events you

134
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,050
pass in the event name and a function to be called and that function will run when the event occurs

135
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,920
on that given element on the window on a button.

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,740
And also remember not only is this nicer to write in my opinion one method but we can also listen for

137
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:39,390
multiple events of the same type on one element versus with our old fashioned on click either in line

138
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,820
or through javascript.

139
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,690
We don't have that flexibility.

140
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,720
So our event listener is your go to way of adding events definitely five out of five stars recommended.
