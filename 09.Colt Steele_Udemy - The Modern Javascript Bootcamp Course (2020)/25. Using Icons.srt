1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,830
Now that our timer is working pretty well we need to apply a little bit of styling.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,270
Just make sure that everything shows up inside the actual timer.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,260
The first thing I want to do is replace the start and pause buttons with the icons for like pause and

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,960
or start and pause right there so to show those icons.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,710
We're going to use a free icon library called font awesome.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,590
I'm going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to font awesome dot com.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,640
This is a free resource that we can use to show tons of different icons inside of application.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,760
The first thing we have to do is wire up this library to our app to do so we're going to open up one

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,930
other page.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm going to go to C.D. J.S. dot.com once here.

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,550
We can search for font awesome and we'll see a link right here.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,640
So notice that this is a CSX file.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,930
That's how we make use of fun awesome inside of our project.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,820
We're going to hook it up as a CSX file.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,470
So going to copy that link will then go back over to our HCM l document.

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,890
Here it is right here.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,270
I'll go to my head and I'm going to add in a link tag.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,550
So I'll say link.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:19,650
We're going to use a rail of style seats and then an H riff and we can paste in that link that we just

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,070
copied

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,080
okay.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,190
So now that we've wired up font awesome we can take a look at the fun awesome documentation and figure

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,120
out which icon we want to show so I'll go back over to the font.

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,590
Awesome documentation on the top left hand side is a little search box.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,050
So when you first get sort of icons of course you're probably going not going to know exactly what the

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,850
name of any icon is.

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,460
So it's really up to you to just kind of take a guess.

28
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,580
When I look at these icons the words that come to my mind are play for that right there.

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,150
It's like a play icon and pause.

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,630
So I'm going to take a guess and I'm going to search for play when I search for play we're going to

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,330
eventually see some results.

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,910
Here we go.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,340
So these are all the different icons that match that search string.

34
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,250
Looks like that one right there looks pretty good.

35
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,560
So I click on that one to figure out how to use it sometimes sometimes font awesome Web site is a really

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,910
slow.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,870
So I'm going to give this a second to load up.

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,190
Hopefully it resolves quickly.

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,530
OK.

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,490
Very good.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,890
So now you actually make use of this icon you'll see right underneath play is a little eye tag right

42
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,600
there.

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,030
So that's the e-mail that we're going to show in order to show that icon.

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,680
So I clicked that thing to copy it.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,060
I'll go back over to my HMO document.

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,230
I'm going to find my button that says start I'll delete the text it says Start and replace it with that

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,880
I tag so I can save this.

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,260
Go back over to my browser refresh and I'll see the play button right there OK.

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,050
So that's definitely good.

50
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,730
So it could definitely repeat the same process to get the pause icon as well.

51
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,480
It's all search for pause wait another couple seconds to for it to load.

52
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:00,920
Yep.

53
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,880
That devil looks good.

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,610
So click at

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,760
and click on the eye tag again.

56
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,780
I'll go back over to my e-mail document find where we have paws inside the button.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,550
I'll delete it and replace it with the dog as well.

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Yes I'll say this the second time refresh.

59
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,500
OK.

60
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,740
Well that looks pretty good.

61
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,420
All right.

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,560
So for the rest of the styling I'll be honest with you it's really just a bunch of CSI s and whatnot

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,250
that we're going to throw into our anal document.

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,280
We're going to take a quick pause right here in the next video attached to the video.

65
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,940
You're going to find a zip file inside that zip file is going to be an HMO document and SPSS file.

66
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,920
Make sure you download that zip file.

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,060
It's going to be called something like timer 0 2 5 templates or something like that.

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,490
So make sure you download that zip file and find the HDL and CSF file inside it.

69
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,540
So make sure you grab that and we'll start to integrate that or merchant into our project in just a

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,270
moment.
