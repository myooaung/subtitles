1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,110
Before we move on.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,820
There are some prerequisites some things that you need to be comfortable with before you can really

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,570
master the.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,090
Before this content will make sense to you.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
Those topics are basic.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,250
Each team L and C assess the good news is that each team out and c assess are really pretty easy to

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,890
learn the basics of at least.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,730
We're not talking about making beautiful websites we're not talking about crazy complex layouts that

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,990
are responsive.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,330
You just need to understand how to create simple elements on a page had a nice things together how to

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,620
work with ideas and classes how to write simple CSF selectors to select based off of elements in classes

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,430
and ideas maybe attributes you need to understand how to change color to see assess and fonts and how

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,290
to resize something the basic properties.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,490
So if you don't have that understanding right now I recommend you take an hour or two to go follow a

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,930
tutorial online.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,190
You can check out my youtube channel.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,450
I have a basic HD mounts SS intro but there are also tons of great courses paid and free and books and

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,830
free blog posts.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,550
You don't need to go buy an expensive course or even buy anything just take some time and set it aside

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,590
so that this section in the next few sections actually makes sense to you because this stuff is really

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,210
exciting.

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,250
It's fun but if you don't have that understanding of HD humility RSS it's just going to be intimidating

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,770
and make it a lot more challenging than it needs to be because this dumb stuff is actually not hard

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,700
where it gets tricky is when people try and learn it before they understand each team L and C assess.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,120
So I'm gonna do a little demo slash assessment that you can self assess based off of.

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,810
I'm going to write some simple h t amounts to assess to show you the level of understanding I'm looking

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,890
for.

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,330
So I have an HMO file already created.

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,780
I'm going to add some simple elements in here will add an H1 and this will say my webpage.

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,290
I'm going to add a simple l an unordered list with a couple of allies.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,770
First thing second thing and third thing.

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,660
So I have an ally.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,710
Here are three allies in an unordered list.

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,310
To add an image.

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,930
I'll set the source to be this nice grizzly bear image from on Splash dot com.

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,730
Nice images that we can use for free and I will also go ahead and add in maybe a paragraph tag or two

37
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,810
paragraphs just let's do some warm Epsom so I can just type lower them in V.S. code and then I'll add

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:39,820
another one of those Lorem just random text I'll add an idea to my image and I'll call this image.

39
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,670
We'll just call it bare photo.

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,840
So if you're still with me if this is all making sense and feels like very basic stuff that's good news.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,170
If any of this is confusing you're not sure what these elements are.

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,660
You don't know what an idea's or a source.

43
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,480
Take some time.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Go learn that stuff because you'll need it.

45
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,540
You absolutely need it for the next couple of sections.

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,100
I don't want you to feel bad or get lost.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,430
All right.

48
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,670
So we have our H one.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,140
I'll also add a class to my allies.

50
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,750
Two of them at least this class will be called special okay.

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,550
So I have two paragraphs.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,140
I have my H one I have allies that have a class of special I have an ally that doesn't and I have an

53
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,980
idea for my image of bare photo.

54
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,940
Now I'm gonna make a style sheet so I'll just make my file here.

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,300
I'll call it apt C Ss and I'm going to start by styling my H1.

56
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,950
Just something simple.

57
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,500
Color Purple font size 20.

58
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,440
That can be very small.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,780
How about 60 pixels.

60
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,200
So I haven't connected my style sheet but let's just make sure my content is showing up all right now.

61
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:56,210
I'll connect my style sheet using a link tag and the address is app that see SS in my H1 should change

62
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,490
it's purple now and larger.

63
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,150
So if this syntax is new to you you haven't seen it.

64
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,580
You don't know what font size does or color.

65
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,990
I guess that's pretty self-explanatory but if you're not sure about the syntax here then take some time

66
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,760
and review that.

67
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,360
Let's also go and select the bear image.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,860
So here's the first part of the assessment.

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,950
How would we styled this bear image to give it a width of two hundred and fifty pixels using the idea.

70
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,990
All right so I'm going to come in here and select it with Bear dash image and I need to make sure I

71
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,020
add in a bear photo.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,730
Jeez horrible name I can even remember it.

73
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,780
Need to make sure I add in my hash symbol there to make it clear.

74
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:48,690
It's an I.D. and I'll give it a width of two hundred and fifty pixels refresh my page much more manageable.

75
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,690
The next part of the assessment I'd like for you to make the class of special these two allies.

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,850
I'd like them to be teal and 30 pixels font size and give them a 1 pixel border.

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,130
Also teal so we'll select the class which was called special.

78
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,140
I need to use the dot because it's a class and I'm going to start with color.

79
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,700
What do they say.

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,810
Teal and then font size.

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,100
I think I said 30 pixels and border was one pixel teal.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
Let's see what we get.

83
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,620
All right so there is my special class so I've styled the H1 the image with the idea of bare photo and

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,500
the two items the two allies that have a class of special it looks horrendous.

85
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,500
It's very gross but this stuff is very important.

86
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,390
Don't worry about the styles but if you feel like any of this was new or confusing you need some clarity

87
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,020
on it.

88
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,850
Go look online and get some practice.

89
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,380
Now here's one more thing that you could use as a little assessment.

90
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,210
Let's add in a form.

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:05,110
All right so I'll add a form element right here and in this form I'm going to add an input type equals

92
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,050
text.

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,590
I'd like to give it a place holder of what should we do.

94
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,200
Bear name and then another input follow that.

95
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,870
And instead of type equals text what are our options here.

96
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,040
Well do you type equals.

97
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:36,140
How about password and then give it a place holder of password and then one more input will do type

98
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,010
equals submit or refresh.

99
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,950
And we have our form here.

100
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:49,550
What I'd like you to do is select only the input that has type of password and give it a different with

101
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,980
you can change it to smaller larger.

102
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:58,130
Just give it a different width and height so you'll have to select based off of the type not off of

103
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,910
input.

104
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,120
Don't add an I.D. don't add a class selected as is so I'm gonna do that over here.

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,850
If I just did input like I did for H1 that will target all three and if I do height let's do 50 pixels

106
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:24,350
with 100 pixels that does work but I only want to target this one right here so I can add in an attribute

107
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:34,260
selector type equals password and now only this one is affected the other inputs are unchanged.

108
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,490
So that's it for the stuff.

109
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,510
I mean that's not everything you need to know but that's a general sampling of the kind of H2 Mal and

110
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,430
c assess experience you need.

111
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,750
You need to be able to do basic styles understand CSF syntax.

112
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:54,750
Key value pairs semicolons selecting based off of classes ideas elements attributes.

113
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,690
There's a bunch of other selectors and we may come across some of them in the course but this is most

114
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,700
of what we'll be selecting based off of in our javascript.

115
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,590
And then as far as elements things like inputs definitely paragraph tags H ones all the headings buttons

116
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,860
list items all the different text elements paragraphs semantic elements like block quotes sections articles.

117
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,520
You don't have to be an expert in everything just I want you to be comfortable enough where you're not

118
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,190
focused on the H to mount to assess so much and trying to understand it that you're missing out on the

119
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,130
DOM stuff which is fun.

120
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,760
All right.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,060
So now we're gonna move on to the DOM again please take this seriously.

122
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,560
I mean you're obviously able to make your own decision and do what you think is best and if you want

123
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,050
to just plow ahead without HMRC assess experience it's definitely possible you'll pick it all up at

124
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,930
once but for the best experience I recommend that you you get some practice first take some time away

125
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,600
if you're just a bit you're not going to miss out too much.

126
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,060
The course will still be here for you to get better with age demands to assess and then come back.

127
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,490
All right.

128
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,800
So let's get going.
