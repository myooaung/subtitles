1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,530
Well let's get started with our project setup.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,170
So we're going to go through the steps you see right here inside this video.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,360
So to get started I want to go back over to my terminal and once again at a workspace directory of sorts

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,450
inside of you're going to create a new project directory that I'm going to call AECOM short for e-commerce

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,440
all that change into that directory.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,850
And then inside there are gonna generate a package dot JS on file.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,930
Remember we can do so by running NPM in it Dash y

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,710
that will create a default package not just on file and I can see the contents of it printed out at

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,580
my console right away then inside of here we want to immediately start to install one or two dependencies

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,120
into our project to install these dependencies.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,820
We're going to run npm install and then I'm going to list out the different dependencies that I want

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,140
to add in.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,090
So in this case we're going to add in one dependency called Express and another called Node mod we'll

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,720
discuss exactly what these different dependencies do in just a moment.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,220
But right now let's just go ahead and install them okay.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
Site installations can take just a couple of seconds.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,280
I'll let it do its thing while that's running.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,820
I'm also going to start my code editor inside of this project directory as well.

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,480
I can now open up that package dot Jason File and very quickly as soon as that installation finishes

20
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,670
we'll see a new section appear inside of here called the dependency section.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,470
Remember that records all the different dependencies we've installed into our project and the versions

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,580
we installed as well.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,400
And there we go.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
I can see them up here right there.

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,160
So what are express and Node man express is all about helping us create a web server.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,120
We're going to very quickly get very familiar with Express.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,320
So I'll just hold off on explanation of what it does right now Nordmann is very similar.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,900
Well really identical to one of those projects we just put together that command line tool called Watch

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,180
it essentially node man is a little development tool that will automatically restart our web server

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,900
anytime one of our project files change.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,260
This is a very handy tool to use and I expect you're going to use it on just about every single node

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,760
project you ever work on because if we don't have a tool like that it means that every single time we

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,950
make a change to our code we have to go back over to our terminal stop our running application and then

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,620
restart it manually which gets very tiring very quickly now that we've got these two things put together

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,120
are going to create a route JavaScript file for my project.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,230
So inside of my code editor I'm going to create a new file called index not J.S. and inside of here

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,870
I'll just do a little console log of hi there

38
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,010
I'll then go back over to my package not just on file and then inside of you're going to find that script

39
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,180
section.

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,940
So we're going to add in a script that is going to automatically start up our project for us.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,570
The script that we're going to write is going to seem very simple and very basic in nature.

42
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,770
You might think Steven why aren't we just running our application ourselves directly from the command

43
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,410
line.

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,510
Why are we instead writing out a script for this.

45
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,140
I'll tell you why as soon as we write that script so inside of here I'm going to delete the section

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,370
that says test and I'm going to replace it with a set of double quotes that say def and then another

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:29,200
set of double quotes with a colon in between and inside that second set I'll say node man index dot

48
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:36,330
J.S. so this right here is intended to get our project up and running if we want to run this script

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:43,840
right here and start our project up we can go back over to our terminal and inside of our project directory

50
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:52,000
we will run NPM run Dev the run command right here tells NPM that we want to execute one of the scripts

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,940
that we define inside of our package not just on file.

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,620
And in this case we want to run the script called Def so when we run NPM run Dev what it really does

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,360
is execute behind the scenes kind of invisible to us node Mohn index dot J.S..

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,700
So again you might be curious why are we creating the script right here as opposed to just directly

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,990
running something like node man index dot J.S..

56
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,930
The reason is very simple.

57
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,520
Anytime some new engineer might start working on your project they can very easily open up this package

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,340
start J some file and use this script section right here to understand very quickly how to manipulate

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,290
or work with your project.

60
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,480
So traditionally even though we can start up projects directly from the command line by running commands

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,160
like node indexed dot J us or whatever else.

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,700
Instead we will very frequently define some these different scripts you see inside of here and the whole

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,950
goal is just to communicate to other engineers how to start up our projects.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,850
Now if we want to start off our project we're going to run NPM run dev so I'll execute that all very

65
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,430
quickly see hi there appear once again node man is a tool that's going to automatically restart our

66
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,930
application every single time there's a change to a file inside of our project.

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,370
So in general as we're working on our project when we first get started we're going to execute NPM run

68
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,420
Dev pretty much one time and that's pretty much it until we decide to stop this process and maybe go

69
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,550
on holiday or it's the weekend or whatever.

70
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,560
When we come back on Monday we're gonna open up our terminal again and run and run Dev a second time

71
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,860
if you ever need to stop this process you can hit control C on your keyboard and that will kick you

72
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,090
back over to your terminal and then to start a backup NPM run dev so as you're taking this course and

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,790
as you're working through this application which is going to be a pretty good amount of time I do expect

74
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,780
that you're going to take many breaks throughout here and have to stop working on the project.

75
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,130
Just remember any time you come back and you need to start the project backup you're always going to

76
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,000
come back to your terminal go to the project directory and execute NPM run Dev.

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,950
And that's pretty much it okay.

78
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,100
So now that we've done a little bit of basic project setup we'll take another pause right here.

79
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,630
We'll come back the next video we're gonna start to understand what this express library is by writing

80
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,000
out some code inside of our index such as file.
