00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.400
Now that we've got this project loaded up let's discuss what we want to test about it.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450
It's on the left hand side you'll see there is a search input right here.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.360
Once again if we type inside there and then just wait a second we'll see a list of movies up here.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.930
So what we want to test is this little search widget we're going to write some number of tests to make

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.160
sure that the widget starts out closed.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.970
And then after we type something in it should open up and show a list of results to the user.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.530
That's the functionality we're going to focus on testing.

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.390
We're not going to worry about trying to test using both inputs or doing a comparison or anything like

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.600
that.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.670
We're just going to focus on that little input it might be curious why is that why are we going to focus

11
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.900
so much on just that thing.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.080
Well remember what I told you just a moment ago very frequently when people set up testing stuff they

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.490
spend more time setting up a testing framework than they do actually writing tests.

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.160
And so as we start to set up MOCA to work with this project we're going to see that it really is a big

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.790
pain.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.690
It's like a configuration nightmare.

17
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.710
There's going to be several different files that we're going to have to create.

18
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.500
We're going to have a bunch of links between them.

19
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.980
There's Give me a lot of special code just to make things work.

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.910
And just in general it's going to be confusing as we start to set up Moka to test this widget.

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.650
They might be curious why is that.

22
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.360
We just spent like 30 seconds to use Moka on our last project we installed it with NPM at our terminal

23
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.520
and executed it.

24
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.390
That entire process took like 30 seconds and there was really no challenge whatsoever.

25
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.760
Well the reason that it's going to take a lot of time to set up Moka here is the difference in environment

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.500
when we ran MOCA.

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.240
Just a moment ago at our terminal and we ran to smoke directly like so we were executing Moka from the

28
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.300
command line.

29
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.010
When we execute Moka from the command line it runs our test files and the node J.S. environments testing

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.990
no J.S. code is really easy and really straightforward but testing code in the browser.

31
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.570
That's the difference.

32
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.490
We're testing a widget right here that has to be used inside of a browser.

33
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.950
And doing that with MOCA is much more challenging.

34
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.680
There's a lot more setup involved.

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.200
Now you might be kind of curious why do we have to test this in the browser.

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.300
Well it's really simple.

37
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.050
Let's go find the file that implements this little widget right here.

38
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.300
I'm gonna go back over it's my code.

39
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.370
Ed inside of this new movie's testing directory that we just created where we have all these new project

40
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.970
files I'm going to find the autocomplete J.S. file so this right here is the function that creates an

41
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.500
auto complete widget.

42
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.500
I want you to scroll around this thing a little bit inside of here.

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.710
You're going to see a reference to a lot of properties like inner HDMI HDL query selector class list

44
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.100
create element add event listener append child and so on.

45
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.640
Every single one of these properties are properties that only exist inside the browser.

46
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.040
If you start up no J.S. Right now there is no interpretation of the Dom in there.

47
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.190
There is no Dom with no J.S. so all everything about this autocomplete is setup to function inside the

48
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.420
browser and that's it.

49
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.320
So if we want to test this thing effectively we have to get Moka to work in the browser and that's what

50
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.060
this setup pane is.

51
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.000
That's what I'm talking about right here and just so you know there are some solutions out there and

52
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.520
we are going to take a look at one in just a little bit.

53
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.710
They'll allows us to run this kind of browser based code with node so there is technically a workaround.

54
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.470
I just want you to know that like not all hope is lost.

55
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.670
Nonetheless we're going to walk through the process of getting MOCA to work inside the browser because

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.050
it is a great learning experience and you're going to see that there are many many companies out there

57
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.330
that test code in the way that I'm about to show you.

58
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.210
So it is an important skill to know even though there technically is easier setups out there okay.

59
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.570
So with all that out of the way let's take a quick pause right here.

60
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.330
When we come back the next video we're going to discuss how we're going to get MOCA to work inside of

61
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.000
our browser and then ultimately test that little widget right there.
