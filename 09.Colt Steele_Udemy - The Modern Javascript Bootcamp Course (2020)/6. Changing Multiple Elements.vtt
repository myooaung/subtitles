00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.770
We'll take a quick break from learning new properties and methods just to talk about how we can use

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.020
what we've already learned on multiple elements.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.100
Everything we've been doing so far is one thing at a time.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.530
We've been changing the Inner Temple or the value of one input or one dev or whatever it is at a time

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220
but often we want to effect changes in multiple elements.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.290
And we know how to select multiple elements.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.950
We use query selector all get elements by class name get elements by tag name.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.430
That gives us an array like object.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.530
So all we need to do is iterate over that object and then call whatever method or change whatever property

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.920
we want.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.470
So why don't we start by changing the inner text of all allies on the page.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.660
So we need to select all the allies.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.970
And I'm going to do this in a separate file because it takes a couple of lines.

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.990
So I have a script arpeggios.

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.330
I've included it at the bottom of my HDMI file and I'm going to select all the allies.

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.760
So I need my document that query selector.

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.220
All I want allies so I'll pass in the string ally and then I'll save that to a variable.

18
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.300
But to go with const all allies all these.

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.770
OK now we want to iterate over all allies.

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.880
So for we could do a regular for loop for let I equals zero I less than all allies doubt length I plus

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.110
plus.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.200
And then we can access all allies of 0 and we could start by just constant logging all allies of zero

23
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.100
dot let's do inner text okay.

24
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.740
Let's see what we get when I run this.

25
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.040
So I'll refresh the page.

26
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.150
Mm hmm.

27
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.590
No idea why I did zero.

28
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.280
It's supposed to be all allies of I whatever that loop iteration is we'll access that one and get the

29
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.930
inner text.

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.720
And if we run it We go first thing second thing third thing.

31
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.410
Carrots peas broccoli.

32
00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:03.910
So if I want to change them all I can just set there in text all allies of eye dots in our text equals.

33
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.490
And then this is our hardest part always.

34
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.700
How about we are the champions.

35
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.570
I don't know why but we'll just do it.

36
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.700
Okay.

37
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.130
What happens when I refresh the page every single ally now has been updated.

38
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.350
So this is the common pattern we select a group of things and we iterate over that array like object

39
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:37.570
using a for loop or we could easily do a for of loop which I prefer for let ally of all allies we will.

40
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.170
What should we do.

41
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:49.270
How about Ally Dot's inner team this time and let's pass in a string and we'll say we are.

42
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.820
And then a bold tag the champions okay.

43
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.480
So now we're setting inter HCM HMO which means that this will be treated as H.

44
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.280
It will be passed and turned into an actual bold element on the page.

45
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.600
Let's see if it works.

46
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.350
There we go.

47
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.810
We are the champions on every single ally.

48
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.250
So we're overwriting the changes we did here.

49
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.630
But this also worked.

50
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.920
It's just annoying to have to deal with I.

51
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.680
So why not use a for loop so we can do things like this.

52
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.480
Obviously we can change styles once we see how to change styles which we will see very shortly we can

53
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.370
access attributes.

54
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.940
We can set attributes.

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.740
We could do all sorts of things but the pattern is the same.

56
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.240
You select and then loop and then do something versus what we've seen so far where we select one thing

57
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.070
and manipulate it directly without having to loop if you have multiple you have to loop.

58
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.250
There's no easy shortcut to just impact all of them at once.

59
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.580
All right.

60
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.230
So that's it for this video.

61
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.840
Next we'll move on to some other properties and methods.
