1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,360
Now that we can detect a wind condition so whenever a user goes and hits that kind of completion area

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,590
right there it would be kind of fun to tell the user in a interesting way that they have won the game.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,520
So something a bit more interesting than a console log.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,520
I've got an idea for kind of an interesting way of doing that.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,750
I think that when a user wins and they hit the ball against that kind of goal rectangle right there

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,020
let's try to turn gravity back on and simultaneously we'll also take all the different wall segments

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,600
we have and remove these static flag from them.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,570
The net effect of both those changes is that essentially the entire maze is going to kind of fall apart

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,220
and fall down to the very bottom all to like the bottom edge of the screen.

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,900
So again we're just doing this to make sure it's really clear to a user when they win a game.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,260
So let's give this a shot.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,160
The first thing we'll do is find the if statement.

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,250
We were just working on going to replace that console log right there so inside of here I'm gonna turn

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:02,620
gravity back on by writing out world dot gravity dot y equals one that's going to accelerate all the

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,210
different shapes we have down towards the bottom edge of the screen next year I'm going to do is to

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,440
a loop over all the shapes inside of my world.

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm going to try to find all the different wall segments.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,520
So like these walls right here and I'm going to remove the static flag from each of them to make sure

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,190
that we can easily find all the different wall segments.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,600
I'm going to go back up to where we create all of our walls so the two or each loops here's one right

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,630
here or verticals.

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,870
I'm going to find the options object and I'm going to add on a flag to it to say label of wall.

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,130
So as we saw just a second ago we can use labels that are being applied to a shape that we create to

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,300
easily figure out what type of shape it actually represents.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,140
So if I save this just for verticals right now we can then go back over refresh and I can get a better

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,800
idea of exactly what shapes our verticals by printing out world dot bodies this is telling me that I

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,710
have ten different shapes inside the world and if I look at the different label properties or see the

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,940
label right there I'll see that one has a label of wall that represents the one vertical piece that

29
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,260
we have right there.

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,240
So we can repeat that same label and throw it onto our horizontals as well.

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:29,990
So I'll go back up to the horizontal section and I'll add into that option's object a label of wall.

32
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,680
It's now if we go back over again refresh print out world dot bodies we can see that we've got several

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,430
different walls inside of here.

34
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,550
There are many rectangles are the actual kind of barriers or borders around the outside edge of our

35
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,470
canvas.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,180
And of course we have the goal and the ball as well so now whenever a user wins we can iterate over

37
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:57,170
world dot bodies and we can update the is static flag for each of the wall labels or these live wall

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
objects to false.

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,290
And that's going to essentially allow gravity to affect all the different wall segments that will cause

40
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,220
them to kind of collapse down to the bottom edge of the screen so to actually write out the code for

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,580
that.

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,620
I'll go back over.

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,690
I'm going to go back down to where we are computing our wind condition and after I update my gravity

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,930
I'm going to do a world dot bodies dot for each and for each body where I am iterating over I'll say

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:33,910
if body dot label is segment so this is awesome not a second but a wall.

46
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,190
I had previously used the word segment but figured Wald made a lot more sense so I'll stick with that.

47
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,690
And then to update the static property we're going to once again use that body object that we spoke

48
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,540
about just a little bit ago.

49
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,190
I'm going to call the set static method on it as you could guess that's going to update the static flag

50
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,020
on an object.

51
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,510
So we're gonna take the body and we're going to update the static flag to false to say this thing is

52
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,420
no longer static.

53
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:08,000
So gravity and other forces can now effect it going to save this go back over refresh.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,590
And now if I go ahead and win everything kind of falls apart.

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,620
So again this is just kind of a fun little animation that a user can see once they actually win the

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,610
maze.

57
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,990
We will eventually put on a big message to the user that says hey you won right on the very center of

58
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,910
the screen to make sure that it's just super clear that they won but will add in one or two other features

59
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,810
before we take care of that.

60
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,470
Now for a really fun test we can go and update the number of cells we have so might go to like six or

61
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,850
so just to make my maze a bit more complex.

62
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,890
Now if I win

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,620
everything falls apart and then a user can still kind of mess around and move all these different segments

64
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,840
around okay.

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,370
So this is looking pretty good.

66
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,910
So the last really big thing that we have to accomplish inside this app is to make sure that it's not

67
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,510
limited to this fixed size right here at present.

68
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,480
We've been saying many times that the height and with are always going to be identical.

69
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,970
So we start to change one these values like let's say I change the height to a hundred and refresh well

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,910
everything doesn't quite work as expected so we're going to make sure that we can have rectangular mazes.

71
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,180
We're going to in particular make sure that we kind of a maze that fills up the entire screen.

72
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,110
And so we're going to have to update several sections of code to accommodate for that.

73
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,070
So let's take a quick pause right here and start that refactor in the next video.
