You've now got the ability to create new products and tie images to each product that we create.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,490
Before we move on I want to open up our views admin products new DOT J.S. file.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,190
So right now the form that we are displaying is very simple and kind of ugly to be honest so attached

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:23,290
to this lecture is going to be a zip file called something like AECOM 0 6 7 template that's it.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,430
Make sure you download that file again it is attached to this lecture once you download that zip file

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,160
extract it and inside there you're going to see a new dot J.S. file.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,950
So this is essentially the same exact new DOT J.S. file that we've been working on.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,810
I just added in a couple more HDMI elements and some class names as well.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:48,660
So I going to take that extracted file I'm going to drag and drop it into my editor right away we can

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,610
see that all the javascript is identical.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,170
Just some additional markup I'm going to copy everything inside this file go to my old new DOT J.S.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,230
here it is right here I'm going to select everything inside of here and delete it and then paste in

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,600
what I just copied that I'm going to save that's going to go back over to my browser and refresh the

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,750
page and I get something that looks like this right here.

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,850
So definitely a little bit better looking than what we had before all the validation still works.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,500
So if I click on Create right now without any title or price we'll see some validation messages like

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:31,140
so it's just a little visual improvement and there's one last little thing that I want to fix up inside

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,400
of our post request handler so quick pause and we're gonna take care of that in just a moment.
