00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,810
Back to our products listing right now we can show the different product titles but they're all kind

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,240
of ugly in nature.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,140
In addition they don't really give us any links to the ability to edit create or delete any products

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,630
whatsoever as well so attached to this lecture.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,730
You're going to once again find a template file you should see a zip file named something like AECOM

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,230
0 7 2 template.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,740
That's it.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,790
So inside of here is an upgrade to his products listing page.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,530
Once again the only thing I've added in is a little bit of each e-mail and a couple of classes just

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,640
to apply some styling to what you see on the screen.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,180
So I'm going to double click that file to extract it and I get an indexed J.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,640
J ust file out.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,470
That's going to be a replacement for our products index not J.S. file inside of our views directory

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,310
it's going to take that new file once again I'm going to drag and drop it into my editor I'm going gonna

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:59,970
take everything inside that new file copy it go to my old one delete everything inside there and then

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,220
paste you'll notice that the code structure inside of here is still just about identical.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,920
We are still mapping our products array.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,130
We get out some rendered products we join that together into one big string and then throw that stuff

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,990
into this table element.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,160
So going to save this update what makeover refresh and we should see something a little bit closer to

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,950
this.

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,500
Now it might look like this kind of has all of our work done but once again there's still a couple of

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,530
things inside of here that we need to wire up.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,220
In particular you'll notice that if we click on this edit button right here nothing really happens.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,650
If we click on delete nothing happens and if we click on it new product.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:36,920
Okay.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,250
That one actually does work.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,280
But needless to say we still have to put together this link to edit and link to delete as well.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,240
So let's get started on this edit functionality in the next video.
