1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,460
Next up group two methods together that honestly don't really have much to do with each other except

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,570
that they are straightforward and there's not a lot to talk about.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,070
Join and reverse reverse is especially straightforward it does exactly what it sounds like.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,460
It reverses an array in place.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,430
That's the one key thing is that it does not make a copy.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,840
It actually impacts it mutates the original array so I can show it to you.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,130
It's very straightforward here I have an array called Letters.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:37,520
If I call letters dot reverse like that it does return the new version of the array.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,220
But if we look at letters as well it is changed so it used to be TCE P.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,620
Now it's RSP easy as you can see here.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,040
Okay.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,500
That's kind of it.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,600
It's going to reverse whatever the contents are.

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:01:01,620
If it's instead mixed its numbers and billions and other numbers and a string dot reverse it doesn't

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,760
matter.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,480
It reverses it.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,470
Okay.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,240
Next we have join which is a little bit different.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,980
Well you know it's.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,520
That's a lie.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,420
It's very different.

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,080
Has nothing to do with reverse.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,890
It's a little trickier but it's still very straightforward.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,280
What joining will do is it takes an array and it spits out a string where it joins.

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:27,300
All of the elements in that array into one single string so you can see right here.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,110
Fire air and water three different values in this array.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,440
When you join them together it gives you a single string so if we tried it with letters over here.

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,970
If I refresh we could do letters dot join.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,930
If I just do it like this the default separator between the values is a comma but we can change that.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,330
I could say letters dot join and I want you to join it on an ampersand.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,780
And there we go TNC and E and P and so on.

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:07,810
Now we could combine them and do letters dot reverse dot join and then join on maybe a period and look

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,360
at that ISB T.

34
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,370
Or we could join on a dash.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,890
Oh I re reversed it I can see that reverse does actually mutate the array so I need to do it one more

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,020
time to get our ISP with the dashes.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,160
Now one question I've seen before is what happens if you try and join things that are not strings like

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,590
these are strings in an array.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,950
We're joining them together.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:42,860
What if we have numbers twelve point three and then 60 and then maybe a boolean like false.

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,060
What happens if we join those it turns them into a string.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,130
So it's going to figure out what this twelve point three looks like as a string.

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,400
Well it's just twelve point three instead of quotes.

44
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,520
What's this false look like.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,760
It's just the string false and it joined them.

46
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,860
So it's going to turn them into a string put them into one string and then separate them by some character

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,390
the default is a comma.

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,260
But you can specify something else.

49
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:14,200
You could even specify more than one character we could do a space with I don't know hash sign and another

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,190
space and then an arrow and it inserts that between all of them and returns a new string and that's

51
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,070
it for reverse and join relatively simple ones.
