00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.670
Our edit functionality is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.830
So once again we're going to do a quick copy paste of some updated code just to apply some better styling

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.820
to our form.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.410
So as usual that changes that we're about to make.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
Coming from this file that we're going to download totally identical in function in nature.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.640
The only difference is some additional HCM L and some classes so attached to this video you're going

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.200
to find a file called something like AECOM 0 7 9 template that's it.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.410
Make sure you download that file unzip it and inside there you'll find a file called edit dot J.S. so

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.270
I'm going to take that file drag and drop it into my editor I'm going to select everything inside of

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.800
here.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.270
Copy it.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.520
I'm gonna go back to my edit dot j ust file for my project going to select everything inside of here.

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.550
Delete it and then paste when I paste I get a little broken formatting here some is going to fix it

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.150
up really quickly.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.640
There we go.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.610
I'll go ahead and save this.

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.100
I'm going to go back over to my browser.

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.670
I'll hit the edit button right here and that looks a lot better.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.200
So I see edit a product.

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.150
The title price an image and once again I can still say delete the title in the price attempt to submit

21
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.760
and I still see the validation messages appear okay.

22
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.980
So definitely a good improvement on the styling side of things so quick pause right here.

23
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.390
And once again continue in just a moment.
