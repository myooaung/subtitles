00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.760
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.110
It's time for a quick little three question quiz based off of the numbers and operators we just saw.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.090
First I'm going to give you three short problems.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.600
You don't have to type any code just mentally evaluate these.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.210
I recommend you don't try and type the code.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.200
Think them through.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.670
Figure out the answers.

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.420
Here's the first one.

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.210
I'll show it for a second or two.

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.390
You can pause.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.660
Here's the next one.

12
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070
What does this evaluate to.

13
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.890
If you were to run it in the console and here's a third one.

14
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.460
What does this evaluate to so pause if you need it.

15
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.520
And here are the answers.

16
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.210
The first one is relatively straightforward math one point five times two.

17
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.230
It's going to happen first because of the order of operations.

18
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.890
So that gives us three.

19
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.600
And we add that to one point five which gives us four point five next.

20
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
Slightly more complex some operations that aren't standard middle school.

21
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.490
So we've got modulo and exponent chief Asian exponent.

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.280
Not sure what the correct term is 10 mod 6 will happen first.

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.070
That is the remainder operator.

24
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.170
So how many times is six go into 10.

25
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.380
It goes in once.

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.480
So 10 minus six gives us a remainder of four.

27
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.690
So the remainder is four in those prints.

28
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.270
And then Star Star 2 is going to raise it to the second power a.k.a. square it four times four is 16.

29
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890
So that one gives us 16.

30
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.450
As you can see here there we go.

31
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.060
And this third one slightly different.

32
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.610
Just the simple addition with a division.

33
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.860
But the trick here or the key is that 0 divided by zero is going to give us not a number.

34
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.620
We just talked about that not a number plus another number is still not a number.

35
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.900
So the overall answer is n i n or not a number.

36
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.380
Two hundred plus zero divided by zero not a number.

37
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.990
That's it.
