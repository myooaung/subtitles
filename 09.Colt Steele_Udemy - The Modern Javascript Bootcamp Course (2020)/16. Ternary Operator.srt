00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,170
Next up there is a shortcut syntax that you can use in JavaScript for certain conditionals.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,070
It's called the ternary operator.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:14,320
It's a way of basically taking an F and an S and turning them into a single line of code.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,610
It's called the ternary operator because there are three pieces instead of binary ternary is the term

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,470
for three.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,310
As you can see there are three pieces here.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,200
This is kind of the template for how you would read it.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,050
There is a condition and a question mark.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,240
So if this condition is true this code runs.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,480
Otherwise if it was false this code runs.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,810
So let's take a simple example.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,180
Remember this only works if you're doing a simple yes or no.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,790
And if and then else.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,820
So no else ifs involved.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,500
Let's say we have a number but num equal 7 and if num is equal to 7 will control that log.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:55,980
Lucky

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,790
and then else we can control that log bad.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,390
OK so here we have a simple if and then else we could rewrite this entire thing on one line.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,570
If you wanted to using this syntax we have condition question mark so the condition is num equals seven

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,920
question mark.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,650
Then the code we want to run if true.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,660
We'll go there and then the code we want to run if false is separated by a colon.

23
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,530
So a question mark and then a colon colon control dot log that just like that.

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,550
I'll comment out the original code refresh the page and it still works.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,620
We get lucky.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,810
Let's change it to two.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,340
We don't get lucky.

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,180
OK back to seven so we've taken this logic and just written written it as a single line that doesn't

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,370
mean that you should always do this even this is getting pretty long for a ternary mainly because of

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,640
these constant logs that I'll show you another example slightly different where we could actually use

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,340
the ternary operator to assign a value to a variable let's say we're making a chat app where you can

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,570
set yourself you can set a status to be online or offline.

33
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:25,800
So we'll have a status variable instead let's go with offline to start and then we want to have a color

34
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,860
that we use to show like a little bubble next to your name if this is a chat app a bubble that is either

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,220
red or green.

36
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,020
So it's red.

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,220
If you're offline and green if you're online we would have a variable like color and if we did it without

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:52,110
a ternary operator we would do if status equals off line then we would make color equal to red and then

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:03:00,990
else color is equal to green so we could write it this way or we could do it all in one line.

40
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,310
So I'll keep that there but I'm going to comment it out.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,260
We could rewrite it as light color equals and then our ternary operator.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,360
So the piece of logic is status equals off line question mark then one value would be red.

43
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,140
That's the true part remember condition expression if true expression is false.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,370
So if true we want red.

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,620
Otherwise we want green.

46
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,770
And now we've rewritten this entire thing in one line.

47
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,800
So this is a pretty common use case.

48
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,670
If I run in we get red for color.

49
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,270
If I change this to be online or really anything else we're only checking for offline at this point.

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,190
We'll see that color is now green.

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,550
So it's a nice shortcut.

52
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,220
It can be kind of odd if you're not familiar with it which is why I wanted to show it to you now while

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,640
we're talking about conditionals it doesn't do anything new.

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,850
It just can shorten your code up.

55
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,360
So here is the original.

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,130
Here is the second version with ternary operator.

57
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,140
We have a condition question mark.

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,250
Something that happened if the condition is true and something that happened if the condition is false.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,030
So the if and the else that's it.

60
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,870
There's no room for.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,110
Else if it's just a yes or no do this or do this.
