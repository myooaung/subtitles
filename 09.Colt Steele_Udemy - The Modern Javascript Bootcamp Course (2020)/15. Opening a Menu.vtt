1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.780
We can national list of movie posters and the title of each respective movie.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.270
It's now all we really have to do.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.370
Believe it or not is kind of work on the styling a little bit.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.580
In particular we need to make sure that all these images are small.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.030
They show up next to their titles and that they all appear in a kind of menu directly underneath that

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.360
little input right there.

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.080
But to do so we're going to use some SS that is included inside of this project.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.180
Remember at the very start of the section that we downloaded a boilerplate project wired up inside this

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.350
project is a CSX framework called Belmont CSX almost the SS has a collection of different CSX rules

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.650
that allow you to very quickly style an application.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.570
We're going to take a look at a component where essentially a set of CSX rules that are going to allow

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.580
us to a very quickly turn the content that we have right here into what we're really looking for it's

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.530
going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to this documentation OK.

14
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.710
So if we go down on the left hand side just a little bit we'll see a demo of what they call a dropdown.

15
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.600
Now you might look at this and say Steven we're not making a dropdown we're making kind of an autocomplete

16
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.410
thing.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.620
Yes that's correct.

18
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.680
But we can kind of use some the CSX that's been implemented to make this dropdown to kind of leverage

19
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.860
it for what we are trying to create.

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.790
So the only effective difference between what you see right here and what we are trying to make is the

21
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.200
fact that we want to show a text input right there instead of a button.

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.230
They have a button.

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.780
We just want to have a text input so we can very easily swap that out to get something like what you

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.540
see right here.

25
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.850
All we really have to do is replicate that each symbol structure that they have over here on the right

26
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.210
hand side.

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.860
Now I'm not going to ask you to like read over all that CSX and memorize it.

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.260
Instead let's go back over to our project.

29
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.450
We're going to write in some of the CSX you see right here directly to our e-mail file and I'll show

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.040
you how quickly and easily we can replicate something that looks like that okay.

31
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.470
So back over I'm gonna find my index not a single file.

32
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.920
I'm going to go down to the very bottom and I'm gonna find my input element right above that input element.

33
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.290
I'm going to add in a new div

34
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.860
with a class of dropdown and is Dash active I'M GONNA PUT THE CLOSING div on the other side of the input

35
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.520
so this div right here is going to wrap our input element then immediately after that I'm gonna create

36
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.630
another div with a class of dropdown dash menu I'll close it off inside of there I'm going to create

37
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.540
another div with the class of dropdown dash content flows that went off.

38
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.680
Then finally I'm going to make a couple of anchor tags so in a. tag like so with a class of dropdown

39
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.730
item I'll then close off the anchor tag and inside the anchor tag I'll put in movie number one and then

40
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.140
I'm going to copy paste that anchor tag twice like so and just update the text so all I'm doing here

41
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.140
is using the same each symbol that we just saw inside the Bowman documentation by using the same each

42
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.800
CML at the same class names all the bonus the SS rules that are include inside this project are going

43
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.480
to kick in effect and try to style this block of H all right here.

44
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.520
So even though we're not trying to create a dropdown per say we can still leverage that set of CSX rules

45
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.970
for styling our application yes I'm gonna save this know flip back over refresh and now I see at least

46
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.520
what kind of looks like a menu right here of sorts.

47
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.730
I know it's like pushed up against the left hand side but it kind of looks like what we're going for.

48
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.650
I've got a list of items I can kind of hover over them when I hover over them I get that nice little

49
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.090
pointer cursor thing like with the hand with the little finger and so it's very evident to a user that

50
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.650
I can click on this.

51
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.140
So all you and I really have to do now is instead of showing these anchor tags that say movie number

52
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.040
one two and three we need to just take our movie images.

53
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.500
So like the poster and movie title and stick it into this anchor tag and then everything should essentially

54
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.490
show up correctly and nicely styled in our application.

55
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.320
So now we understand what our goal is in the short term.

56
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.300
Let's take a quick pause because there is something to kind of think about on how we approach this problem.

57
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.170
It's a quick pause and we'll discuss a little interesting side topic in the next video.
