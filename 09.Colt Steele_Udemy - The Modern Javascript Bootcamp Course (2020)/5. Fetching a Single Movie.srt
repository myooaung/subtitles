1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,590
I'm taking a look at the search results that we've just got back from the OMD API inside of here.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm looking at the very first results and I'm noticing that we've got just a couple of different properties

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,490
that represent this first search result one thing that's kind of interesting is that I don't see any

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:22,250
information related to a lot of the stuff that we need to actually make this application work correctly.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,100
So for example we want to make sure that we eventually show a short summary of the movie and be box

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,040
office take the critic rating and so on.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,350
But none of that information is visible inside of this search result right here.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,440
This goes back to a discussion we had just two videos ago.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,560
Usually whenever we make use of an API like this one we got a one in point for doing a searching or

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,360
index operation and we are adjusting a very limited set of information about every search result that

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,010
we just got.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,310
So if we now want to get more information about a very particular movie and get like the revenue or

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,360
the rating or whatever else we have to do a follow up request.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,340
So this would be referred to as a show action or a show request or something similar.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,280
When we do this show request we should hopefully be able to get a lot more information about one particular

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,990
movie at a time.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,840
Let's take another look at the own DP API documentation and figure out how we can do a request like

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,700
the one over here on the right hand side and get all that extra information that we know that our app

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,530
is going to need I'm going to once again go back to the documentation we were looking at by search previously.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:41,300
This time I'm going to go up to buy I.D. or title so if we do a lookup or a single movie at a time which

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,460
is essentially this section right here we're going to get a bunch of information about just one particular

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,360
movie to do this request.

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,830
We're going to add in a new parameter called simply I lowercase i that is going to be the idea of a

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,990
movie that we've already found through our search request so to do this request right here.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,580
We're gonna go back over to our code I'm no longer going to pass in that s String anymore.

26
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:13,330
That was if we wanted to do a search operation and now instead want to do a lookup operation it's going

27
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,210
to put in I like so and then I have to put in the idea of the movie that I want to look up to get the

28
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,070
idea of a movie.

29
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,990
I'm gonna go back to the search results that I was just looking at inside of my browser.

30
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,710
It looks like the idea of the movie The Avengers is t t 0 8 blah blah blah right there it's going to

31
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:38,180
copy that string and then paste it in as I like so so we no longer have an S.

32
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,070
Instead we just have an eye that indicates the exact movie that we want to get information about.

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,330
So now save this I'm gonna go back over to my browser once again refresh and now I get information about

34
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:57,140
just this single movie inside of here is way more information than what we got before and inside of

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,040
here is definitely all the information that we really need to make our application work.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,760
So remember we need to eventually get the and a search straight or see excuse me synopsis right here.

37
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,860
We need to get the box office value and a critic ratings and so on and so inside of this result we can

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,750
see plot right here.

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,570
That is the kind of plot summary of the movie we can see the box office take right there so that's the

40
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,840
amount of money the movie made.

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,970
And I can also see a rating right there.

42
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,760
So that's essentially the critic rating.

43
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,930
There's also a medic a score right here which is another critic rating as well.

44
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,500
So again this is the request that we're going to have to do once the user selects on an individual movie

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,810
or clicks an individual movie and we want to show a lot of information about that single movie on the

46
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,780
screen okay.

47
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,820
So now that we understand the two different types of requests we have to make.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,070
Let's take another pause right here.

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,440
We're going to start working on our UI in the next video.
