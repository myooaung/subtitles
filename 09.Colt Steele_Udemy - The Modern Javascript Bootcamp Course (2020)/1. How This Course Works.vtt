Hey everyone welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.150
My name is Colt.

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.800
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.990
So I'm really excited about this cause honestly more excited than I've been about pretty much any Udemy

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.910
course I've put out so far.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.070
I'm excited for a couple of reasons I'll go into.

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.080
First of all I just like Javascript.

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.790
It's a very fun topic to teach.

9
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.800
We can do a lot of really cool things with it.

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
And this course covers everything javascript.

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.770
It's a ton of javascript that we talk about from the very basics up to some pretty complex projects.

12
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.100
So what I want to start with here is a rough overview of how the course works.

13
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.960
The course is pretty unique in how it's structured.

14
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.980
There are two distinct parts.

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.700
The first part is a start to finish introduction to JavaScript for beginners.

16
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.350
Starting from the very very basics of getting setup variables up to more complex topics like Dom manipulation

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.590
and events all the latest features and JavaScript things like aero functions promises and then part

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.240
two of the course is focused exclusively on projects.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.600
So those projects include lots of new topics things like node or express or creating your own database.

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.690
Lots of really fun things coming up but there is a distinction.

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.770
Here's another visual for same idea.

22
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.460
We've got the building blocks first starting from the very basics and then part two is all projects

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.450
so to take this course you have a couple different options.

24
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.260
If you are a complete beginner you don't really know javascript.

25
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.820
Then start at the beginning.

26
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.000
Start with the basics make your way through the first 20 ish sections and then move on to all the projects.

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
If you're someone who has some javascript experience maybe you've taken one of my courses already or

28
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.880
a similar course.

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.110
You may not need to start at the very beginning.

30
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.360
So what you could do is jump right into the projects and just start building something.

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.390
There's almost 20 hours of projects in this course.

32
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.530
And if you do happen to hit a wall you run into trouble.

33
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.370
You can go back to the first part of the course and just review the parts that you need to if you need

34
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.040
to review aero functions or async functions or the spread operator or some newer features in javascript

35
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.780
that that maybe weren't covered in the last course you saw on javascript.

36
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.040
That's a great option for you.

37
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.250
Start with the projects and then reference the first part of the course whenever necessary.

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920
So that's how the course is structured.

39
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.460
We've got two main parts.

40
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.600
I think there's something here for I want to say everyone.

41
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.110
There's probably not anything here for someone who doesn't care about JavaScript but for anyone who

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.940
is interested in JavaScript whether you have no experience whether you've taken one of my courses or

43
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.410
Stephen's courses and you're just looking to build projects there's something here for you.
