00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,170
Next up.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,400
String escapes.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,990
Also known as escape characters escape notation escape sequences.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,390
I think I've heard before.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,800
It doesn't really matter what they are are combinations of characters that have a different meaning

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,280
within a string than the normal character would have.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,790
For example a quote a single quote or a double quote.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,590
Those are particular special characters in JavaScript strings.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,470
If we have single quotes around something he said and I wanted to quote la la la.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,200
We've already seen that this is problematic.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,210
The easy solution would just be to use double quotes on the upside or double quotes on the inside and

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,190
single on the outside like this.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:54,060
But if I wanted all single quotes like he said I ain't happy and I want ain't to have a quote or a single

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,120
quote apostrophe there that's not going to work.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,490
But if I use this special sequence where we have a backslash notice all of them I'm showing you start

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,760
with a backslash.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,590
Put that before the quote and our resulting string now has a single quote there.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,360
And this also works with double quotes.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,790
So technically this string here he said I ain't happy should have quotes around I ain't happy because

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,660
he said it and then ain't should have that quote there.

21
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:29,040
So if we wanted to if we did this with double quotes he said and I want double quotes again I ain't

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:39,310
happy I could escape those double quotes like that and now we end up with double quotes around it and

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,520
I could also go and add in that apostrophe either with just a single quote or backslash single quote

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,410
in this case single quote We'll do it for me.

25
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,410
Not that commonly used honestly but it is worth knowing about.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,710
Sometimes you'll see them.

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,030
So those are the two characters you need to get a double quote or a single quote.

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,260
You just put a backslash before it and it changes the meaning it tells javascript.

29
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,310
OK this is not actually a quote to close the string or open a new string.

30
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,180
This is a quote character I want in the string.

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,820
We also have backslash and this one will give you a new line.

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,080
So if I clear here and I do Hello.

33
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,800
And then backslash n goodbye and I hit enter.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,830
You'll see that my string is now on two lines.

35
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:33,130
So that's how you can add a new line on the docks on MDA and there's a table talking about different

36
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,710
escape characters escape notation is what they call it.

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,560
Most of these I've never used.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,220
We have things like backslash t to make a tab so we could do this.

39
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,550
Hit enter.

40
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,940
I don't know what that string actually means but ha with a tab in front of it.

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,460
Not that common.

42
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,860
And then one that definitely does come up is if you ever need a backslash in a string.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,440
All of these start with a backslash and that means that the backslash itself has a special meaning.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,220
It's a way of telling javascript.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,820
This is about to be an escape.

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,520
This is about to be a special character coming after me.

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,880
But if you just want a regular backslash then we need to put two back slashes so that would look like

48
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
this one backslash on its own.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,060
Is invalid javascript thinks there's something that was supposed to come after it.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,410
Is it backslash t backslash and backslash quote.

51
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,220
But if we instead do double backslash it turns into a single backslash.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,130
So that's the basics for escape notation.

53
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,190
Not really a huge topic and nothing you need to freak out about but it occasionally will come up.

54
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,970
It's good to know about it's a topic that is pretty consistent across programming languages.

55
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,710
The actual character might change but the idea of having an escape character or escape sequences is

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,180
pretty common.

57
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,510
All right.
