1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,490
All right.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,800
So next up let's discuss the tools you need for the course.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,000
It's pretty simple at least for the first part of the course until we get to node.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,210
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,050
The two main tools that I highly recommend you install are Chrome as a web browser.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,790
You definitely can use any web browser of your choice.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,120
If you are particularly tied to Firefox for example there's nothing wrong with using that but I'll be

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,430
using Chrome as well Stephen which makes it a lot easier for you to follow along especially as we talk

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,500
about the specifics of the developer tools.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,000
I would say in general I would not recommend using Internet Explorer safari.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,470
It definitely will work.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,910
But if you have chrome or firefox use one of those preferably Chrome.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,460
It's as simple as going to Google dot com slash chrome and clicking download it will just make for a

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,640
better experience if we're on the same page and as far as the editor that I'm using I highly recommend

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,070
VW code not just because I'm going to be using it in the course and it will be easier for you to follow

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,320
along but also it is just my personal editor of choice these days it's free.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,620
It's a great editor great community around it lots of amazing extensions and colors themes and lots

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,650
of fun things you can do.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,580
And if you don't have it downloaded already I would recommend you do that.

20
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,580
Now if you are somebody who already has a different editor that you are super tied to that you know

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,680
like the back of your hand which at expression never made sense to me but if you happen to know it like

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,420
the back of your hand then use that editor.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm not going to be doing anything all that specific to V.S. code but if you're new and you're looking

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,960
for an editor this is the one I would go with V.S. code stands for Visual Studio code.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,730
It's free.

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,930
It's developed by Microsoft.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,170
I can't say enough good things about it.

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,010
I really can't.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,640
So download it and just to show you what my version looks like.

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,500
I have changed a couple settings I've changed the colors theme I've changed the UI theme and some of

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,340
the icons you can see over here.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,560
But otherwise I haven't done a whole lot.

33
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,850
And if you do want to make your editor look exactly like mine I won't waste time in the course itself

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,090
talking about setup.

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,840
It's not very javascript specific and I'd like to get right to javascript but if you want to learn more

36
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,140
I'll include a link right after this video as a text lecture where you can watch my YouTube video where

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,530
I talk about setting up my editor and all the extensions I use.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,520
So V.S. code and chrome the two tools I really recommend you install for the first part of this course.

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,870
And then later on we'll talk about node and installation for some of the other tools.
