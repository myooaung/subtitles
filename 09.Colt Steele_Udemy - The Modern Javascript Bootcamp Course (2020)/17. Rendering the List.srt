1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,740
We've now got our request handler put together.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,780
That's going to eventually show a user a list of all the items they've added to their cart.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,450
Now at the end of the video we put together this cart show template right here and we passed in the

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,610
list of items.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,300
I made a small mistake here.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,120
There is no items variable inside this function.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,300
We want to say that items is going to be cart items.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,250
My mistake.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,110
So items is cart items let's now start to create the cart show template to do so we're going to create

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,590
a new folder inside of our views directory.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,770
So I'll make a new folder called carts and then inside there I'll make a new file called show dot J.S.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,140
so inside of here we're going to put together a function that's going to take the list of items iterate

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,360
over them and generate a line item or essentially just a little snippet of each team L for every item

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,090
that was added to the cart to get started at the top of the file.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:01,230
I'm going to require in my layout that j ust file so I'll say layout is required up one directory layout

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,530
well then do a module dot exports we're going to receive that object that's going to be passed in with

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:17,020
our list of items then inside of here we'll say something like rendered items we're going to do a map

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:25,300
statement over our list of items I'm going to receive each item and then inside I will return a little

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,700
snippet of each email we'll start off very simple.

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:37,880
Right now I'm going to show a div that has the items title I want to show the quantity and the price.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,150
Now I want you to recall what this item object right here really is back inside of our request handler

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,190
we found the associated product and embedded it inside this item object.

23
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,530
So the item variable that we're working with right now is essentially this big thing right here.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,410
So we've got the quantity we definitely care about that.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
And then nested it inside the product property is the title and the price.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,650
So those are the three different properties we're going to try to print out quantity product title and

27
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:12,490
product price so inside this div I'll do a string interpolation.

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,330
So dollar sign and curly braces.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:23,430
So we'll do item dot product that title and then how about a little dash then item dot product stock

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:31,220
price then a dash again and we'll print out the quantity so item dot quantity.

31
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,110
Because remember the product doesn't know anything about the quantity it's the item that has been ordered

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,630
added to the shopping cart the records the quantity

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,550
OK that looks good.

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,420
Now remember when we map over a list of elements that's going to give us back an array of strings because

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,730
we are returning a string inside of here so we don't want to render out or send an array of strings

36
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,660
to the user's browser.

37
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,290
So we're going to chain on a dot joint statement at the very end.

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,300
We're going to join on empty string to take the list of strings and condense it all down to one single

39
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:11,200
string then right after rendered items we can return our layouts and remember when we create a layout

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,440
we're going to pass on a object with a content property inside of here.

41
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:26,780
Also in each one it says heart items or something like that that works just fine and we'll just print

42
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,300
out our big list of rendered items okay.

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,770
That should pretty much be it.

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,300
So I going to say this I'm going to go back over to my browser and do a quick test to back over here

45
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,760
I can see carte items.

46
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,350
I've got winter gloves a price of nineteen dollars and I've got two pairs of gloves I got my winter

47
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,300
hats a price and I've got one D1 for that well I'd say this definitely looks pretty good.

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,740
Looks like everything is working as expected.

49
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,580
So now we should yield to go back over to our products listing.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,240
We should build to add in a new item to our cart like let's say khaki pants for thirty nine dollars

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,240
if I click on Add To Cart I'll see product added to cart I'll go back I'll go up to the header I'll

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:16,310
find the cart button and I can see I've added in khaki pants thirty nine dollars one D1.

53
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,590
So I'd say this definitely looks like it's working out.

54
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,870
The only downside is that the styling right now is not very good.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,110
So we're gonna take a pause right now.

56
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,120
We'll come back the next video.

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,140
I'm going to once again give you a template file that just has a lot of additional each T.M. that's

58
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,710
going to be placed inside of our DOT j ust file.

59
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,520
So let's take care of that in just a moment.
