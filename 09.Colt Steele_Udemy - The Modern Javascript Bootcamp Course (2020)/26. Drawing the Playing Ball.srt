1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,830
Now that we have our goal let's make sure that we show a ball as well that the user can manipulate by

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,540
pressing their keyboard keys.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,250
I'm going to find where we just added in the golden moment to go.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,230
I'm gonna add a comment right above it that says goal.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,390
Just remind myself that that is what that code is for the variable name.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,120
Kind of explains that but it's still a good practice to have a comment anyways.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,530
So then underneath that section I'll add in ball.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,810
So this is where we're going to draw our ball out going to first create a variable called ball we'll

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,580
do a bodies dot circle.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,560
Because in this case we want to create a circle not a rectangle and inside of here we could definitely

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,140
have a fixed ball size.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,860
But once again if we have a fixed ball size it might make a lot of sense on how large the ball is.

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,360
When we have only three cells but as we start to have a tighter and tighter maze if the ball is too

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,950
large it's not going to actually be able to make it through the maze at all.

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,040
So we probably just need to make sure that we kind of scale the size of the ball along with the unit

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,180
length.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,490
The other thing we need to be aware of is that the first two arguments to circle is the x y Cornet of

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,490
the very center of the circle.

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,270
So we probably need to make sure that we also adjust that starting location to always be at the very

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,810
center of that first cell right there so let's get to it for the starting x y coordinates.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,930
We're going to show the ball at unit length divided by two.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,180
That essentially means take the with this first cell divided by two and put it right there in the very

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,090
center.

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,880
We're going to do that but for the x coordinate and Y cornet as well and for the diameter of the ball

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,260
we'll do a unit length so that's the width of one cell.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,110
And we'll make the ball half the size of a cell so we can do a Times point five or divide by two as

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,070
well and I can go ahead and add that ball into the world.

28
00:01:51,210 --> 00:02:02,300
So World dot ad worlds and ball X I'll save this I'll fly back over refresh and there we go.

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,430
Now the ball is looking just a little bit too large.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,390
Well I think I just made a mistake here.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,810
The third argument I do this on my own when I was actually writing this application as well.

32
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,870
The third argument I just assumed was the actual overall diameter.

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,840
It's actually the radius of the ball.

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,440
So right now a unit length divided by two means that the ball is going to be essentially exactly equal

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,970
to the width of a cell.

36
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,720
My mistake.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,920
So the last argument here to be the radius correctly should actually be unit length divided by four

38
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,450
we'll try that again refresh and that's better.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,980
Now the ball is half the width of a cell.

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,390
Now the last thing we really have to do is make sure that a ball can collide with the goal.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,340
We need to make sure that we press on our keyboard keys up W.A. as indeed we apply some velocity or

42
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,870
movement to the ball as well.

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,570
Well first make sure that we can move the ball around.

44
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,010
Let's take care of that in the next video.
