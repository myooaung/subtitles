1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,390
Next we refactor we're going to do is four on option select.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,120
So in other words we're going to pull out all the logic that decides what function to run whenever user

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,820
clicks on an option.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,950
So to do so I'm going to go back over to auto complete J.S. and we're going to find inside of here the

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,550
code responsible for doing something whenever a user clicks on an option.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,500
So I to scroll down a little bit inside of an input inside of there is our form of loop.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,620
Once again and then inside of there after we create our option we attach that event listener to this

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,040
right here.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,480
This function is what's going to run after user clicks on the individual option.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,210
Now it's something to be aware of inside of here.

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,780
The first line like removing that is active class.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,890
That's something that we want to have happen regardless of what goes on in other words no matter what.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,820
Whenever user clicks on an option we always want to call it closed the dropdown.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,290
So we don't want to just kind of extract that function right there somewhere else.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,500
Instead we only want to extract some parts of it.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,270
I think one part that we very definitely like probably very clearly want to extract to be on movie select

17
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,550
right here is that is what actually decides what really happens or what goes on whenever a user clicks

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,240
on the button but the line that is kind of questionable about whether we need to extract or not is where

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,700
we set the inputs value with the movie title half of this line.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,150
In other words like that half right there is very much appropriate for keeping inside of this autocomplete

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,530
file because it is related to how the autocomplete works and we probably want it to work the same way

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,080
regardless of whether we're showing movies or recipes or blog post or whatever else but the source of

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,470
it.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,680
In other words movie title that part of that it line or that expression is very much customized for

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,600
the type of resource we're working with.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,940
If we weren't working with movies then instead this line should probably be something like log name

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,870
or something like that or recipe name but in every scenario we definitely get to take whatever that

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,080
value is and throw it back into the input value.

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,560
So this is kind of a more challenging refactor and we're going to have to think about exactly how to

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,790
handle that right now.

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,640
It's probably pretty obvious that we definitely want to extract the callback right there so at a very

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,490
minimum let's make sure that we create and pass in some function called like on option select on our

33
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,130
config object and inside there we'll make sure that we call on movie select to back inside of index

34
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,750
dot us years create autocomplete going to pass in a another function called on option select I'm going

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,490
to expect that this is going to be called with whatever object that the user just clicked on and I'm

36
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,600
gonna call it movie then inside of here we can do the same exact thing that we did before where we call

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,760
on movie select so call on movie select and pass through the movie

38
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,740
then we can go back over to our complete J.S. at the very top once again we can d structure off that

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:09,530
new function which we called on option select and then back down at the event listener that we're just

40
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,770
looking at instead of calling on maybe select right there directly instead it will be on option select

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
and this might seem like a very insignificant change right here.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,310
Right.

43
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,730
Like what we just change the name of the dropdown or the callback function.

44
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,960
Who cares.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,970
Again the entire point here is that if we had some scenario where we wanted to call a different function

46
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,380
right there if we were using our autocomplete on another application we would have had to open up the

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,830
source code for our autocomplete and change that line of code which hundred percent not good.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,690
We don't want to have to edit the source code of autocomplete J.S..

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,830
So in doing this change we've extracted deciding what to do when a user clicks on something into this

50
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,440
configuration option over in index dot J.S. which is going to contain all of our application specific

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,400
code.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,540
So I know this seems like a smaller change but it still is pretty meaningful.

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,860
Okay.

54
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,670
So now the other thing we need to be aware of that we discussed this line right here.

55
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,310
So again the left hand side it needs to happen for every instance in which we use not complete but the

56
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,560
source of information is really well that's kind of application specific.

57
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,300
So I think that we need to pass in a another helper function to our config object.

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,330
And I think that we need to use that to decide exactly what value to assign when a user clicks on something

59
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,580
so back inside of index dot J.S. I'm gonna add in another helper function.

60
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:41,020
I'm going to call it input value the goal of input value is going to be to take a movie and after a

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,710
user clicks on the option we're going to call input value with the movie and we're going to return whatever

62
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,030
value it should show up inside of the input.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,830
So I'm going to return movie that title.

64
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,080
So this is how we're going to extract the logic out of autocomplete J.S. it's not to use that will go

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,750
back over to autocomplete J S again rather than directly referencing movie title I will instead call

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,290
input value with the movie up inside of our config object up here at the very top of the file.

67
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:24,310
I'll make sure that I also extract input value from the config.

68
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,190
All right now we'll not see on repeat really quickly here.

69
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,840
We still have many references to movie inside this file and so it might seem like we're making no progress

70
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,170
in actually making this thing reusable again.

71
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,380
We are going to eventually come back through and replace the term movie with something else that will

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,700
be a little bit more consistent.

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,980
So we got one more step forward let's do another test or refresh a search for Avengers a click and it

74
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,630
looks like the input value still gets updated correctly.

75
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,820
That's very good.

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,440
Let's not take one more pause and try to finish up this refactor in the next video.
