00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.770
OK so if you're still with me.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.150
We made our deck of cards object called my deck.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.500
It's a single object.

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.480
And right now I don't have a way of making another one.

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.520
So I'm just going to show you a quick and dirty approach to creating multiple decks.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240
This approach I'm going to show you is not the end all be all.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.880
This is not the best way of doing it but we haven't covered things that we would need in order to structure

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.020
this in a nicer way.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.980
We haven't covered constructors we haven't talked about the new keyword we haven't talked about classes.

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.770
There's a lot of stuff we have to get to where we could refactor this nicer nicer.

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.510
We could refactor this in a better way.

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.460
But what I'm going to show you here is a very basic approach where we could just make a function that

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.830
makes one of these decks for us.

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.730
It's long but I could just copy this.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.480
Define a function down here.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080
I'll do an arrow function for the sake of variety.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.250
Let's go with make deck

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.860
and make deck is going to return this whole object.

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.800
So our entire deck this thing I copied except for the variable name and the equal sign I copied from

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.180
curly brace to curly brace.

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.510
So now we have this function called Make deck and I could just delete this entirely.

22
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.590
We're returning this whole object and we could even do this implicitly if you wanted to just put piranhas

23
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.190
get rid of the return keyword so to use it instead of calling my decked out initialized deck I now need

24
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.190
to say const my deck equals make deck and this returns to me a new deck.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.690
Let's make sure it works my deck.

26
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.220
There we go.

27
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.220
So we have this deck I drew.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.630
How many cards from this nine cards if we want a second deck we'll go with const deck two equals make

29
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.060
deck.

30
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.520
Do it again.

31
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.560
Let's look at deck two and then let's also initialize it.

32
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.940
So deck two dot initialized deck and deck to date.

33
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.530
Let's not shuffle this one just so we can see the difference.

34
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.210
So we have deck.

35
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.830
Now it has 52 cards no drawing cards.

36
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.280
It's all looking good.

37
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.890
And then if we look at my deck it has 43 cards and they are all shuffled as you can see here.

38
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.880
And we have nine cards that we've drawn.

39
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.360
So we have totally separate decks.

40
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.350
They are separate objects because we made a function to return an object.

41
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.000
So we're returning a new deck each time a new object with these methods.

42
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.240
Draw card draw multiple shuffle initialized deck a separate deck array a separate drawn cards array

43
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.360
and we return that every time we call make deck.

44
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.050
So now we have a way of creating multiple but just to reiterate this is not the best way of doing it.

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.420
It's the best way of doing it with what we know right now.

46
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.770
And it's certainly better than doing it with all those functions and all the stuff we saw in the last

47
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.100
video.

48
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.550
This is still pretty clean.

49
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.890
It's not too bad.

50
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.950
And I'm going to stop here.

51
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.450
So we're going to move on to Dom manipulation for a bit.

52
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.590
Take a break from all this object stuff and working with this.

53
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.180
We'll see how to work with each team and see assess through javascript how we can add events to our

54
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.530
page.

55
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.710
Lots of fun stuff.

56
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.880
And then we'll come back to objects because it's a big topic.

57
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.700
We'll talk about classes and constructors and we'll see different ways of structuring this code already.
