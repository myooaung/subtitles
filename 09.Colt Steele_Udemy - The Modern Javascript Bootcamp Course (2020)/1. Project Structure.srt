1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,890
Well our project is looking pretty good with the exception of our project structure right now.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,860
So at present we have got an incredible amount of code stacking up inside of our index not J.S. file.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,590
We've got a couple of different root handlers and you can pretty easily imagine that if we continue

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,480
to build out our application in this fashion of really just stuffing everything into index dot J.S.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,340
pretty soon this file is going to be really large and hard to read.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,280
So in this video we're going to start to refactor out some of the code inside of here into separate

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,180
files inside of our project and then link it all back up inside the index dot J.S. file me first show

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,430
you a diagram to help you understand exactly how we're going to structure this project.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,700
OK.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,170
So here's the idea we're going to have three primary directories inside of our project.

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,030
We're gonna have a directory called Roots one called repositories which we technically already have

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,420
and one called views.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,300
I bet you could guess what the repositories directory is all about.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,450
That's where we're going to place the different repositories.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,760
We have to work with data.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,570
We've already got that for users.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,800
We're going to create another one called products pretty soon because remember although we haven't really

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,990
discussed it in a while.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:11,400
The goal of our project here is to build this kind of e-commerce application the next big directory

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,950
is going to be the roots directory inside there.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,580
We're going to have a sub folder called admin so two files are going to be inside there.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,140
One will be admin slash off which is going to handle all of our authentication related stuff.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,110
Essentially all it could we've written so far and then another will be called products which has a couple

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,310
of different root handlers around allowing administrators to create edit and delete different products.

25
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,850
We'll also have a file for handling all the different routes around a user using products.

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,140
It's like essentially this screen right here and another file for showing our cart.

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,850
So essentially that screen right there that's what's going on inside of routes.

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,830
Last one is going to be views.

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,180
At present we've stuck a lot of each team l directly into our root handlers.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,770
So in other words back inside of our index dot J as file we look at our sign up root handler right here.

31
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,020
We've got some H T mail right there.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,210
Same thing inside of our sign and root handler.

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,300
We've got some H channel all right there as well.

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,920
As you can imagine our final design or like the final application we're going for all this stuff is

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,490
going to require a lot of H to out.

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,210
So if we try to stick all its h t mail directly inside of our root handlers things are going to get

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,070
insanely messy really quickly even if we split stuff out into these separate files so instead we're

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,150
going to eventually create a views directory and inside there we're going to have a couple of different

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,050
files that are responsible for the creation of all the different each time all that we need.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,960
So we're going to call that stuff views because they're essentially the different viewable things inside

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,360
of our app.

42
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,550
So this is the end goal.

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,980
I just want to give you a preview of what we're going to head for right now.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,490
Let's focus on creating some this root stuff specifically around handling the administrator outs for

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,330
authentication and reconciling moving some code inside their back with the index dot J.S. file.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,010
So quick pause and we'll start that refactor in just a moment.
