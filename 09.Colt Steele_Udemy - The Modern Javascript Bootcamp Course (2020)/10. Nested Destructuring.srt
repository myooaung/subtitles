1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,490
Next up sticking with D structuring.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,620
I'd like to show you how we can work with nested objects and arrays and combine what we've seen so far

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,780
to extract individual values into variables to unpack them.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,660
So I have an array of objects still going with the marathon theme.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,930
So each object is a marathon runner and they are ordered still by finishing position.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,540
So we have gold silver and bronze from the 2016 Olympic marathon.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,990
The men's marathon.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,640
If I wanted to extract let's say the country of second place right here.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,540
Ethiopia using D structuring I'm inside of an array so I'm going to start with the array braces to set

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,680
the whole thing equal to results.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,130
And in this array I want the second element.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,050
So I'm going to skip the first one and then I'm now in the second element or I'm in that position and

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,850
we have an object.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,580
So instead of that object I want country

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,060
it's kind of annoying that my editor is putting it on multiple lines so I'll leave it like this so you

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,810
can see it here.

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,770
If I run it right now let's see what we get in country.

18
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,960
We get Ethiopia.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,850
So this comma is crucial.

20
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,630
We're skipping that first element.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,160
If I wanted to extract something from that first object let's say I wanted to get a first name which

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,880
is Elliott.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,970
So I'll write first and if I want to give it a different name or different variable name let's go with

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,730
gold winner

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,540
I'll refresh and I'll look at gold winner.

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,110
It said to Elliott and our country variable is still set to Ethiopia.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,800
So the point here is just to show you that we can combine the syntax.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,750
It can get a little crazy and I don't recommend nesting and doing a whole bunch of dy structuring with

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,180
nested structures instead.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,740
If you have like super nested stuff I think it's a lot easier to understand what's going on.

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,610
If so rather than getting country this way maybe it would be easier to understand if we did const skip

32
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:13,450
the first element and then go with silver medal equals results.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,210
And then from inside of silver medal we could extract country

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,980
so it's an extra line but some might say it's easier to read.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,050
This isn't bad but if you had more nesting that you were trying to work with and continue to D structure

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,530
from let's say instead of country we had an array maybe someone is from multiple countries or they've

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,750
competed for multiple countries before and we wanted to extract something or unpack a value from there

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,300
then we would have another array and it just gets complicated to do structure from.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,580
So just keep that in mind.

40
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,700
You can nested.

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,470
That's it I'm done.
