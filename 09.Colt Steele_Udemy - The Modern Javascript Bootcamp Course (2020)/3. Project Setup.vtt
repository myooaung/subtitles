00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.380
All right.

2
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.020
Now that we know what we are building let's flip over to our terminal.

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.770
We're going to create a new project directory and start doing a little bit of setup so I can go over

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.670
to my terminal.

5
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.910
I'm inside of a workspace directory of sorts inside of here.

6
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.360
I'm going to make a new project folder that I will call simply timer.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.930
I'll then change into that directory and start at my code editor inside there once my editor is open.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.920
I'm going to create an index not HDL file and in index start J.S. file as well.

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.930
We're going to put together a little bit of boilerplate inside this 80 mile document.

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.500
So let's get to it right away at the very top.

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:50.790
I'll put in my doc type of HDL I'll put in my HCM all element I'll put in a head a body and finally

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.710
a script tag with the source of index dot J.S.

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.080
Okay.

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.510
Simple enough then inside of index dot J us I'll do a quick council log that says Hi there just so we

15
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.760
can make sure that we correctly hooked up our index not j ust file to the H T mail file once I've got

16
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.050
all this stuff put together I'm going to make sure that I save both files I'll then go back over to

17
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.960
my terminal and open up that index not h small file once it is open I should see a console log inside

18
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.910
of my developer console of simply Hi there so as long as we see that that means we are good to go.

19
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.660
All right some pretty straightforward setup.

20
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.020
So now we've got this all put together.

21
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.470
Let's continue it in the next video and we're going to start to discuss how we're going to approach

22
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.870
this project and generally architect it out.
