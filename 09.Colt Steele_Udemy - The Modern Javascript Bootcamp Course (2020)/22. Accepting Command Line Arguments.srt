00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,610
There's one last thing I want to do inside of our program right now.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,350
Our analyst program only will print out the current working directory or the files and folders inside

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,350
the current folder but the original L S command can print out any arbitrary directory if we pass in

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,140
some path as an argument to the command.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,440
So for example I could say get the files up one directory or get the files from my root directory or

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,720
the files from my home directory as well.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,620
So I want to update our MLS command and make sure that it can receive some additional arguments that

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,220
we pass in some additional argument.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,870
I want to print out the files and folders at that folder instead of our current one.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,920
The first two we have to do is figure out how to receive some arguments into our program when he gets

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,860
removed from the command line to do so.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,320
I gonna go back over to my next dot James folder right above.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,040
DIR.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:59,060
I'm going to add in a console log of process not a R G V like so I'll then save this we'll go back over

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,240
and I'm going to run MLS by itself and I do so I'm gonna see a array of strings PRINTED OUT LIKE SO

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,980
START RUNNING THAT AGAIN.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,590
BUT NOW I'M GONNA ADD in some I don't know just random string of characters after an L S and now when

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,000
I do so I'm going to see that that additional string that I passed in is added as an element inside

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,040
this array.

20
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,680
So the process start a r GV array essentially has some information about how our program was executed

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,440
and in reality it is command line arguments that are being passed into our program so if we want to

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,510
somehow receive a directory that we should be printing out we can take a look at that A.R. GV array

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:45,830
and get the element at index 0 1 to if we have some element at index 2 inside that array.

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,450
That means we should take a look at that folder and try to print up some information from it instead

25
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,600
of whatever current directory we are working in okay.

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:02,440
So I'm gonna go back over I'm going to remove that console log and then I'm going to replace it with

27
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,430
a different variable instead I'm going to call it target directory.

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,030
Or how about just target dirt to keep it short so then we're going to have this come from process dot

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,380
a GV at 2 and then if nothing is provided there.

30
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,860
So if that is an undefined result we get back then instead I'm going to default to process dot current

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,980
working directory so if we provide an argument great let's use that.

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,520
Otherwise just use the current working directory.

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,030
So now we can take that target dir and pass it in as the first argument to reader.

34
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,630
Like so now the code that we have right here is not going to work right correctly.

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,390
Nonetheless I want to save this.

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,120
I want to run it and just see what happens.

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,070
So I'm going to go back over to my terminal.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,730
I'll run any less.

39
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay.

40
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,610
Everything still looks good.

41
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,380
Now going to try to print out the files from one directory above my current one if I want to do that

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,740
with L S I would say l s dot dot and that's gonna give me everything from up on directory but if I try

43
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,850
to do it with MLS whoa I start to get a really nasty error.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,960
So in this case the error that I see here is no such file or directory l stat d s store.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,780
Well that's a little bit mysterious.

46
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,540
Let's take a pause right here we'll come back in just a moment and figure out exactly why we're seeing

47
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,470
this error message.
