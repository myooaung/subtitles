00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
In this video we're going to make sure that a user can click on that edit button and navigate to a forum

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.830
where they can edit some attributes of this particular product.

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.270
Now putting together an edit forum is going to be just a little bit different than some of the new forms

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.920
we put together already.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.650
When I say new form I mean like whenever we click on new product right here we see a form with some

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.790
empty inputs.

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.550
There's no values inside of here whatsoever.

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.400
But when we start to think about editing an existing product well we essentially need to kind of pre

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.990
populate those input elements.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.980
So here's the new form.

11
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.200
Back in our mockups.

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.020
So when we show the new form we just say oh yeah this is where the product name goes and price goes

13
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.690
and we allow the user to fill out those inputs from scratch but now that we're handling the edit functionality

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.720
whenever a user first comes to this form we need to somehow pre populate those inputs with the attributes

15
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.150
of the record that they are trying to edit.

16
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.450
So again this time around showing a form is gonna be just slightly different.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.090
The first thing we need to think about is how we can somehow decide what product to show inside this

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.940
form at all.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.160
So of course we know that a user is going to click on like that edit button right there and that's going

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.170
to correspond to editing this record.

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.180
But we need to somehow communicate the fact that we want to edit that product right there to our root

22
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.220
handler that is going to create the form and send it back to the browser.

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.380
So to do so what we normally do is we take the idea of the record that we are trying to display inside

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.650
of our edit form and we throw it into the URL to take a look at this your structure right here inside

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.390
the CRL.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.890
We have admin products and then the 20 right there is not the price that was actually kind of a bad

27
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.680
match up will change us to something like that.

28
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.820
So this would mean I want to show an edit form for the product with I.D. 2 9 3 4 8 6 0 so before we

29
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.080
even start to think about showing the form to the user the first thing we have to do is to make sure

30
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.420
that we encode the idea of the product that we want to edit into that button right there.

31
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.880
So this button right here needs to have an appropriate link or an H ref or an anchor tag to it that

32
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.060
says if you click on this button I'm going to show you an edit form for product with I.D. 2 8 6 9 4

33
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.090
3 whatever whatever whatever so let's go back to our index form or submit our index template that's

34
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.710
showing this page right now we're going to update that edit button and make sure that we encode the

35
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.840
I.D. of each product inside of their okay.

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.500
So get active use admin products index it is right here I'm going to find our map statement inside there

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.380
I already have an anchor element around our edit button and so inside there I'm going to put in admin

38
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.650
slash products slash and now we want to do a little bit of string interpolation and throw in the very

39
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.680
particular idea the product that we're currently iterating over so I'll do a dollar sign curly brace

40
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.140
product dot I.D. slash edit it's now we're going to have a collection of very different anchor tags

41
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.300
being displayed for every product we're going to have a different anchor tag with a different HCF property

42
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.970
so now we can save this I'm going to refresh and now if I open up my element inspector and inspect any

43
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.190
of these edit buttons I should see something like that admin products and then the idea of that particular

44
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.390
product for a special coat.

45
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.080
Now of course you're going to see a different I.D. right there because we are generating our ideas at

46
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.270
random.

47
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.140
Now if I click on that you are always going to say products that I.D. slash edit.

48
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.590
Now we need to put together a root handler to receive this request right here a request to admin products

49
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.790
I.D. slash EDIT Let's take another quick pause and figure that part out and then just a moment.
