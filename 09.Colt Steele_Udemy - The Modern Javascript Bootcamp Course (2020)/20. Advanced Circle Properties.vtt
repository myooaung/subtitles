00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.020
We now have a bit better idea of how an SPG element works along with circle elements.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.060
Now in this video I want to tell you a little bit more about circles and some special properties around

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.550
them.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.980
And this is going to start to help us understand how we're going to finally implement that animation.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.920
OK so couple of things I want you to understand about circles where we draw out a circle using an SPG

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.700
element.

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.580
There are really two parts that circle the inside of the circle or kind of like the content inside.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.720
We refer to as the fill be border going around the outside the circle rather than calling it simply

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.160
a border.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.750
We instead call it a stroke we can change the color of the fill and the stroke by adding in some additional

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.050
HDL properties to our circle element.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
We can also change the width of the stroke or the border as well.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810
At the same time.

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.750
So let's go back over to our H small file.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.430
We're gonna start to play around with these different properties little bit and see what effect it actually

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.500
has on our circle okay.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.600
So I'm gonna go back to my HDL file.

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.290
I'm going to first change the dimensions of the circle just slightly so we can see these changes to

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.910
the Phil and stroke a little bit more easily.

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.060
So I can increase the radius to 90 I'm going to take my six to one hundred and see wide to 100 as well.

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.650
Let's save this and refresh our app just to see the effect it has okay.

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.510
So that's what it looks like now.

23
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.480
Now a quick reminder just really quickly.

24
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.930
Remember I wrote my browser very far zoomed in so you probably see something a little bit closer to

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.800
that right there.

26
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.160
OK.

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.320
So let's try changing the fill and the stroke.

28
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm going to first give myself a little bit of space to work with is we're going to eventually add in

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.360
several different properties here

30
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.420
it's going to put in a fill of red and a stroke of blue.

31
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.380
I'm also going to set these stroke width property as well so stroke dash width and I'll pass in ten

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.630
for that.

33
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.020
So this means make the center of the circle blue or something to make the center the circle red.

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.300
Make the border blue and the border should be about 10 pixels wide or ten pixels thick.

35
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.460
Let's save this.

36
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.630
Go back over and see what happens.

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.520
Well yep that's pretty much it.

38
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.480
So now we've got the red interior the blue exterior.

39
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.950
If we start to increase the stroke with here to say like 50 the border is going to get that much larger

40
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.300
going to stick with 10 for now cause it's a little bit easier on the eyes but there's another very interesting

41
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.370
value for Phil that we can use for our application is really relevant to what we are trying to do for

42
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.940
the fill.

43
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.750
We could specify a color of transparent which means make the center of the circle see through.

44
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
So if we use a fill up transparent that means we could very easily start to see some timer elements

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.660
behind this thing or something like that.

46
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400
It's all set filtered transparent.

47
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.130
And now the center polygon and I can see directly through it guess that some basic additional properties

48
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.060
around a circle and there's a couple of more that we're going to help us modify or play around with

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.520
that stroke.

50
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.340
Let's take a look at a couple more diagrams and understand what these other properties are that are

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.590
going to allow us to modify the border around the exterior so the first additional property I want you

52
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.060
to understand is stroke dash dash Ray.

53
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.010
We're going to give this a number of value and it's going to specify the length of a dash around the

54
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.210
perimeter or essentially for the border of the circle.

55
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.890
Let's try adding in this property and playing around with it just a little bit so go back over to my

56
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:41.280
ECMO file and I'm going to add in a stroke dash dash right and I'll start out with 10 flat means give

57
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.540
me a dash border and I want each segment of the dash to be 10 pixels long and then a 10 pixel gap before

58
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.560
the next dash segment.

59
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.070
So I'll say this go back over and refresh so this means or I can see very easily now I've got about

60
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.300
10 pixels of dash and then a 10 pixel gap and 10 pixels dash 10 pixel gap and so on around the exterior

61
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.300
this dash Ray property technically accepts two different values.

62
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.640
If we only pass in one then 10 will be used for two for both the different values the first value we

63
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.370
pass in is going to be the length of the dash and if we pass in a second it is totally optional it will

64
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.840
be used as the spacing in between each dash segment.

65
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.640
So for example if I put in a ten and then a five that means give me dash lengths of 10 and then spacing

66
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.620
in between each those dashes of five so we can save this go back over and we'll see we've got about

67
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.960
10 units of dash and five units of spacing in between but again if we just put in the one number that

68
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.430
means give us give us identical dash lengths and gaps as well.

69
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.040
It's going to leave it at 10 for right now OK so this looks good.

70
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.720
I want to remind you of something about properties of circles in general.

71
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.020
So if we take a circle and we measure its radius.

72
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.800
So that's going to be from the very center point to the outside edge.

73
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.670
We can calculate the entire perimeter of the circle so the total length of the outside edge by using

74
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.660
the formula two times pi times the radius.

75
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.750
Now the radius that we just changed our circle to is 90.

76
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.340
So if we do two times pi times 90 we end up with five hundred sixty five.

77
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.260
So that means that the total length of the outside edge of the circle is about five hundred sixty five

78
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.120
pixels so that calculation in mind we can start to draw like a quarter or like a half segment of border

79
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.240
around the circle.

80
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:46.410
Let me show you in my terminal I'm going to calculate two times math dot pi times 90 and then divide

81
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.270
that by two.

82
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.080
So that gives me about two hundred eighty two.

83
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.010
So if we enter in a dash array of two hundred eighty two.

84
00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.000
That means that we want to have about half circle have a dash and then have this half the circle not

85
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.210
have a dash.

86
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:09.530
I got to go back over and try updating the dash rate to about 280 to the if I now save that and then

87
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.670
refresh.

88
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.060
There we go.

89
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.480
So I've now got half the circle with a dash half about it we can do something very similar so to Tony's

90
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.540
math dot pi times 90 and then this time I will.

91
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.150
How about multiply by one quarter so point two five.

92
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:33.360
So now I would have just a quarter segment if I use that 141 it's now I get a quarter half a quarter

93
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.330
of know dash half a quarter dash half a quarter of no dash.

94
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.670
I mean of course.

95
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.770
Last thing I want to show you around this perimeter is if we do the full five sixty five or just slightly

96
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.900
less than it that should give us just about the entire length of the thing and then leave us just a

97
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.810
little bit of a gap so I'll do red around 560 and just leave a little bit of a gap.

98
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.040
So now I can see I get a whole bunch of water and I'm just a tiny little gap at the very edge so the

99
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.160
next I want to tell you about this circle is that the border is always started started drawn from the

100
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.190
right hand side and it draws around clockwise and we can see that very easily with the border dash array

101
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.900
or these stroke dash right that we just added on.

102
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.440
So it's very clear that the border starts right there and then travels around clockwise until it decides

103
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.830
to hit a empty spot we can start to play around with that value of dash array.

104
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.440
So I going to change it really quickly here several times.

105
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:37.240
It's going to start to decrease it to say 550 and I can see that the gap is a little bit larger.

106
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.950
I can go to 520 a little larger.

107
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.040
I go to four eighty little larger yet OK.

108
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.210
So that's how we can get like adjust about full border but have a gap at the very end.

109
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.940
So now there's just one last thing I want to show you.

110
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.740
I'm going to change the dash Ray back to the full about five 60 or so the last property I want to show

111
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:06.300
you is called the dash offset the dash offset is a really tricky property to understand.

112
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:12.540
Suffice it to say if we have a border that goes just about around the entire outside edge dash offsets

113
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.760
will introduce an extra little spacing right there let's play around with dash off set just to get a

114
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.910
sense of what's going on with it so back on my circle element I'm going to add on stroke dash dash offset

115
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.820
and I'll start it off at 10.

116
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.940
So this means in addition to that little space we have right there.

117
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.740
Give us another extra 10 units of spacing as well.

118
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.400
So that's gonna give us a little 10 extra units of the white space right there.

119
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.800
So save this refresh and I can clearly see it 10 extra units or about 10 extra units I don't actually

120
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.890
know what 10 units looks like but hey there's 10 right there.

121
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.100
Now if I start to increase that value to say 20 some more if go to say 40 I get more yet if I go to

122
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.540
one hundred.

123
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:10.490
OK one forty that should be about a quarter and then if I go to about two or is it 80 or so to two that's

124
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:16.030
going to be about half and I can eventually essentially unravel the entire thing by specifying about

125
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.320
560.

126
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.360
So that's going to give me extra whitespace all the way around that outside edge back to AROUND RIGHT

127
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.230
THERE.

128
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.690
OK.

129
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.190
So the dash array and a dash offset properties are how we're going to actually pull off this animation.

130
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.470
So let's take a pause right here in the next video.

131
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.290
We're going to take another look at these properties and I'll explain exactly how we're going to use

132
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.960
them to actually show the animation on the screen.
