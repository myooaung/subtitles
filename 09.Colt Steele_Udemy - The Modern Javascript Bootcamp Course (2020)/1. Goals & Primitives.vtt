00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome everyone to the first coding section of the course.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.520
We're starting out with the most essential fundamental parts of pretty much any language but especially

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.220
with JavaScript values and variables the building blocks of the language the stuff we learn in this

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.380
section will come up again and again in pretty much every line of code we write through the end of the

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.000
course.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.210
Very very important stuff.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.340
But a couple of goals.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.900
First off by the end of the section we want to understand what primitive types are.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.570
What are the different primitive types.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.850
And we want to be able to work with them.

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
We'll talk about creating variables two different ways with let in concept to keywords.

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.360
We'll compare and contrast the two.

13
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.970
We'll also talk about something called var which some of you may be familiar with.

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.710
We'll create a string template laterals and we'll work with common mathematical operations different

15
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.120
string methods and other useful bits of functionality.

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.400
But we're going to start by talking about primitive types.

17
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.810
So every language out there at least every language I've worked with has a group of types.

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.520
Different categories for data.

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.540
Fundamental pieces sort of like DNA of the language we need to work with information store information

20
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.040
whatever it is we need to represent data in our code whether it's a large app or a small app.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.130
So imagine we had this form.

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.300
This is H2 MLC SS No javascript involved.

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.200
When this form is submitted.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.890
Suppose that we're working with it in JavaScript we want to analyze it.

25
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.280
We want to add it to a database.

26
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.890
We'll do something with it.

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.350
We would need to be able to represent the different information the different values a user had entered

28
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.900
using javascript.

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.530
So there's different types.

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.880
It's just a simple form like this.

31
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.400
There's at least three different types of information.

32
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.120
We have words.

33
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.170
Somebody is going to type words here and here and here.

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.990
So that would be textual information which in Javascript is called a string.

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.050
We have numeric data.

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.950
This rating here while the user is not actually typing a number in JavaScript we would represent the

37
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.930
value using a number one to five maybe will allow them to do zero set of zero to five.

38
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.960
But it's a numeric value.

39
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.640
And then we've got this down here.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.560
The checkbox I agreed to the terms.

41
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.900
Blah blah blah blah blah.

42
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.850
True or false.

43
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.430
Yes or no.

44
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.390
We could use a number to represent that 0 or 1 or we could do something arbitrary 50 or 51 as long as

45
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.460
we are consistent.

46
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.880
We could use text the string or the piece of text a yes or no.

47
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.420
But instead the simplest solution is to use a third type called boolean which is a simple true or false

48
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.560
yes or no value.

49
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.490
So back to this slide primitive types in JavaScript we have a group of these super super basic primitive

50
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.820
types.

51
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.360
The different categories for values the different ways we can store information at the lowest level.

52
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.330
So some of them are self-explanatory like no it makes sense.

53
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.760
It's a numeric value.

54
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.590
Another category is string which we already talked about briefly.

55
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.680
It is text words.

56
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.770
It could be a number but they're inside quotation marks.

57
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.550
So it's treated as text.

58
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.280
We have boolean which are true or false values and then we have these things null and undefined.

59
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.310
We'll spend time on each one of these types in this section and we also have two more that we're not

60
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.630
going to talk about just yet.

61
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.280
Symbol and big end nowhere near as common as these five.

62
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.880
But they do exist.

63
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.050
So that's where we're going.

64
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.310
We're going to start by just surveying each one of these types understanding what they are how they

65
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.670
work how we create variables with them a whole bunch of stuff.

66
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.610
So let's get started.
