00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,920
Next up it's time for another quick quiz on the stuff we've just talked about.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,960
Variables let const var how they work.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,350
Just the basic syntax.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,010
So I'm going to show you three examples and I'd like you to mentally evaluate them enter the question

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,990
and then I'll come back to the answers.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,950
So here's the first one.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,170
What is the value of egg count.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,750
Once this code runs positive you need to.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,840
Here's the next one.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,350
What is the value of rating after this code runs.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,590
And the final one.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,970
What is the value of wind speed here.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,940
And then there's a second note.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,950
What is the minor issue with this code.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,540
So two questions.

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,940
What's the value of wind speed at the end.

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,080
And what's the minor issue with the code.

18
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,790
Okay so let's start with first one.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,630
What is the value of egg count.

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,020
Well it's initialized to 42 and then on the second line we are referencing egg counts and adding two

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,160
to the value.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,900
But that doesn't change egg count.

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,770
We're not resetting or updating egg count in any way.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,730
We're just asking for 42 and adding two to it and then that's it.

25
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,840
We're not saving it anywhere to egg count.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,610
So egg count is still 42 at the end of this the next one.

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,910
What is the value of rating after this code runs.

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,830
This one's a little trickier because we're using const so rating is set to seven point five.

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,970
And remember that means that rating will not and cannot change.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,770
So if we tested it out let's do const rating equals seven point five seven point six.

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,690
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,160
And then rating equals eight.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,470
Now we get an error assignment to constant variable.

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,790
So we do get an error.

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,720
But the question was What is the value of rating it still seven point six.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,510
We can't change it.

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,210
So that's the answer to that one.

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,250
And now the final one.

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,590
What's the value of wind speed after these three lines run.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,440
So the first one initialize is wind speed with a value of 76.

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,580
Then we use plus equals to add five to the value.

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,600
So that takes us up to 81 and then we use the unitary operator minus minus which subtracts 1 from wind

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,940
speed and saves it to wind speed.

44
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,870
So we go from 81 down to 80.

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,240
So wind speed is 80 and then the last part.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,800
What's the minor issue with this code.

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,500
The issue here is really a stylistic issue.

48
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,830
It doesn't follow javascript programming conventions as far as the style variable names are supposed

49
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,810
to be camel cased not snake case to it which is what we have here with the underscores.

50
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,860
So ideally this would be named wind speed like this wind speed camel cased first letter lower cased

51
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,920
it doesn't break anything to do it this way with the underscores.

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,090
Well it breaks the heart of JavaScript developers around the globe but it is valid code and that's it.

53
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,080
Nice little short quiz.
