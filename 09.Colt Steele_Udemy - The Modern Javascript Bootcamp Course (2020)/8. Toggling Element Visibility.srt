1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's make sure that whenever a user enters some secret message we hide that existing form and instead

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,990
showed this stuff over here.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,700
Also inside of a kind of card element.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,100
So let's get to it.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm gonna flip back over to my editor.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,440
I'm going to open up my index dot each team I'll file it inside of here.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,650
We're going to add add on a couple of different ideas in some choose locations and then use those ideas

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,840
to toggle some visibility on some different elements to get started.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,530
I'm going to first make sure that my dear down here that says sure this link with a friend also gets

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,280
wrapped with a div with a class of card dash panel that's going to make sure that shows up at that nice

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,950
kind of card looking wrapper around it's also going to add on a class to this thing of hide you hide.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,240
Class is included with the materialized the SS library that we wired up a little bit ago.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,670
If we are on a course of hide to some element then it's not going to show up on the screen at all.

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,450
So we can now save this go back over and do a quick test and we'll see that we only see that form by

15
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,160
default now once the user hits that enter key.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,730
We're going to want to take the high class off of this element and add it onto that one up there.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,160
So that's going to hide the first card and show the second.

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,530
We should probably add on some ideas just to make selecting these different elements a little bit easier.

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:34,900
So on the first card panel I'll add on an I.D. of how about message dash form and then on the second

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:43,830
div with a card panel class I'll add an I.D. of about link dash form it's now we can select both these

21
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,600
elements really easily we'll go back over to my index dot J.S. file at the very top.

22
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,600
Right away I'm going to try to select

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,970
the first one which was message dashboard so I'll do a pound message dash form a look at the class list

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,290
and I'll add the high class and I'll do the same thing.

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,340
And I'll get the link dash form I'll look at the class list but this time I'm going to remove the hide

26
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,820
class.

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,540
So again just going to toggle visibility s let's save and do yet another test here refresh a secret

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,600
message hit enter and it all swaps out.

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,220
And I have that link automatically selected.

30
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,130
OK so this is definitely the correct behavior.

31
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,880
It's exactly what we want.

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,670
Lastly we should probably do from a styling perspective is just make sure that the kind of card that

33
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,550
we're showing here gets drawn a little bit down the screen.

34
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,910
Right now it's at the very top.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,710
It would be nice to have this thing just like maybe a third of the way down or even centered on the

36
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,740
screen just so it's a little bit more prominent to someone who's taking a look at our application so

37
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,750
that we can add in a little bit of custom styling directly to our e-mail file.

38
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,680
So I got to go back to index dot H team email at the very top.

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,760
I'll find my head tag and right after the link I'm going to add in a style element I'm going to select

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,120
this row right here.

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,860
So going to just say select the row and we're going to add some margin on the top of it just to push

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,180
everything down by some amount they'll do it.

43
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,460
Dot row I'll give it a margin top of twenty five.

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,450
The H.

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,160
Which essentially means 25 percent of the total height of the screen.

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,400
All right.

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,650
So going to save that go back over refresh and that's better.

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,770
So now I can do my message and enter and I get the link Well I'd say this looks pretty good.

49
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,420
It's not the last thing we do is make sure that if someone comes to our application and there is some

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,950
kind of encoded string in the URL we don't want to show this form at all like we do want to show that

51
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,350
form.

52
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,930
We do want to show the link we want to show the actual unencrypted message.

53
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,820
So if a user comes to our application with that hash in the URL This is what we want to show to the

54
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,730
user instead.

55
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,620
All right so let's tackle that in just a moment.
