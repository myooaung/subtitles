00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.860
Next up we'll see a few other methods we can use to add new elements to the dome.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.020
We've seen a Penn child.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.150
So far we'll see other options.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
And we'll also talk about removing elements how do we delete something from the dome as we saw in the

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.200
very last video.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.100
A Penn child takes a new element but it's a method that we call on a parent.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.680
So to add a new ally to this list I need to select the list so I could do document the query selector.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.790
Take the first.

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:37.560
I think it's a UL query selector of well I'll call this parent UL so I have that parent.

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:47.580
Well I'll make a new ally const new ally equals document that creates elements of ally.

11
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.320
And then I will set it in our text just to be something like I am a new ally okay.

12
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.830
So we have that.

13
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.060
Now I need to make sure my quotes match when I do a Penn child.

14
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.830
It becomes the last element the last child of the parent.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.190
So parent you dot append child of new ally.

16
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.360
That's what we get.

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.690
And that is useful.

18
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.580
Sometimes you do want to append at the end the last child of an element.

19
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.040
But what if we wanted to put it at the beginning make a new top to do.

20
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.640
Maybe these are ordered by priority or you know due date or something like that.

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.810
And I want my new to do to go up here.

22
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.190
Or what if I want it to go in the middle.

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.810
We have a different method called insert before.

24
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.560
Now insert before sounds like the way that it would work is that we select a node and call insert before

25
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.290
on it.

26
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.630
So if I wanted to insert before this ally you might think I select that ally and then I call you know

27
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.780
first ally dot insert before new ally.

28
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.600
But that's not how it works.

29
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.120
We actually still have to select the parent and we have to select the element we want to insert before

30
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.370
it's kind of annoying not not knowing enough that you shouldn't use it.

31
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.970
But it's just kind of cumbersome.

32
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.580
So if I want to make this ally that I have down here I want it to go up top above mow the lawn I need

33
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.200
to first select mow the lawn so I'll make a variable called first ally equals document.

34
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.890
And what's the best way to select it.

35
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.430
I think it's the very first ally on the entire page.

36
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.410
Let me just double check over here.

37
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.670
We've got.

38
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.900
Yeah.

39
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640
Or it's the first to do on the page.

40
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.000
We could do it that way if you want to get more specific.

41
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.810
The first ally with the class of to do.

42
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.630
And if we look at it there it is.

43
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.930
OK.

44
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.190
So I have all the pieces I need I have my new ally that I've made.

45
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.330
Right now it's down here but I still have a reference to that.

46
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.370
So if I move it it will move from down here.

47
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.040
Then we also have the first ally I want to insert before and I have the parent you well.

48
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.610
So here is how I would insert my ally at the top of the well I call parent you will dot and then insert

49
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.970
before and then the annoying part is we have to say the new thing we want to insert new ally.

50
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.700
And where I want to insert it where I want to insert it before I want to insert it before the first

51
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.690
Ally.

52
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.540
Okay.

53
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.780
So the way it's structured again we have to have the parents of what we're trying to insert into.

54
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.710
And then we also have to select what we want to insert before and then what we are actually inserting.

55
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.190
And there we go.

56
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.650
It's now inserted as a child of parent you well but it's also before first ally.

57
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.140
And if I wanted to move it right above feed the alpacas I need to select that one.

58
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.340
So I'll call that last.

59
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.990
Well Concerta last.

60
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.670
Well equals document that query selector.

61
00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.080
I'm going to do a selector all of ally with the class of to do and then take the index of two which

62
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.790
is the third one zero one.

63
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.100
Nope it's the third one.

64
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.080
It's the fourth one index of three because we inserted this so that should give me no that did not give

65
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.150
it to me.

66
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.990
Let's see last.

67
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.690
Well actually I was wrong here.

68
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.770
Index of three is only going to work if I actually had four elements with the class of to do.

69
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.910
I forgot that this one up top does not have to do so we'll get rid of that and change it to index of

70
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:34.380
two but I've already declared this variable so I'm going to call this last to do so now I can insert

71
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:44.850
I'll do parent you l dot insert before and then I want to insert the new ally before the last to do

72
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.050
and then we go.

73
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.380
It now is right before the last two do feed the alpacas we also have a completely different method that

74
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.350
we could use called insert adjacent element and this one's a bit more complicated we pass in an element

75
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.770
we have to have a target element but then we also pass in a position and this is a string which might

76
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.040
seem odd but we have four choices before begin after begin before end and after end.

77
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.390
So if you imagine that this is our target we have a paragraph if we want to insert something before

78
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.660
this paragraph we would pass in before begin if we want to insert it after we use after end and then

79
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.510
if we want to insert it as the first child of the paragraph after begin and before end we'll be the

80
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.390
last child.

81
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.190
So let's try this just one or two times we can use the same Ally I guess or actually let's make a new

82
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:49.510
element it will just be a bold tag or how about an I tag document that creates element of I and we'll

83
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.920
call this tag or I whatever.

84
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.090
Not a great name but that's fine.

85
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.420
And then we'll do I dot enter text equals I am I italics.

86
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.630
Okay so we have our eye tag now let's select one of these elements how about the very first paragraph

87
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.650
on our page.

88
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:17.950
So that will be document that query selector P. save that to contact first P..

89
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.410
Now I can call first P. that insert adjacent element and then I have to specify where.

90
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:33.110
So if I do before begin and this method I think is kind of unpopular mainly because you have to remember

91
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.820
these strings and a lot of the time you just want to insert something as the last child anyway so you

92
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.470
can use a pen child and shortly I'll show you two other methods append and pre pen.

93
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.870
But here we can pass in before begin and then our new ie element and if we take a look it was inserted

94
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.570
before the paragraph began.

95
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.990
So that's a way of inserting something before the paragraph.

96
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.000
And I personally think this is nicer even if you have to remember before begin it's better than what

97
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.110
we did earlier when we had to select the parent insert before the target and then the new element.

98
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.600
Let's try the same line but we'll do after.

99
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.210
And now it goes after the paragraph after the paragraph ends.

100
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:29.190
And if we do after begin it goes into the paragraph element itself after the opening tag the beginning

101
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.280
tag it goes right there and then we have the final option before end which will put it right here before

102
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.320
the end of the paragraph.

103
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.000
One more time before and for end.

104
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.800
And there it is.

105
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:50.340
So another option for inserting I did mention there are two other methods we can talk about called append

106
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.580
and prepared.

107
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.620
These are newer.

108
00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.340
They do not work in Internet Explorer of course and they're just a little bit simpler than a pen child.

109
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.360
And also there is no prepared child.

110
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.400
So append is different from a pen child.

111
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.600
In that we can actually insert in multiple elements at once.

112
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.480
So if I have this paragraph tag let's see I have my eyes still and I have my new ally right now.

113
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.290
What do I new ally.

114
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:17.720
OK.

115
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.910
All Caps her l capital I capital.

116
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.010
So we have two elements.

117
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.510
If I want to insert both of them into this paragraph which we shouldn't really just put an ally in a

118
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.050
paragraph but if I wanted to I could use append.

119
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:37.530
So it looks like this the first paragraph that we already selected got append and then we can pass in

120
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:45.900
I and new ally and now both of them have been appended inside that paragraph the italics tag was already

121
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.870
there.

122
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.060
So it kind of looks like nothing happened but it did happen I promise.

123
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:58.340
And we also have prepared which is the same idea except it will make things a first child.

124
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:04.290
So it still will be a child of the paragraph but it will go to the beginning of the paragraph and there

125
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.440
we go if we look we've got I am italics I am a new ally.

126
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.470
They're still inside the paragraph but they are at the very beginning.

127
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.620
So appended prepared are nice they're short you don't have to do a pen child.

128
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.350
I mean you just save a couple letters but with a pen child you cannot insert multiple if I did a pen

129
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:30.240
child here it's not going to be happy with me we get the one element inserted I am italics but the ally

130
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.230
was never added it just stayed where it was.

131
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.130
So append is cool because you can do that but it does not work in i.e. neither does prepared well.

132
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.930
So many different ways of adding elements stick with a couple you don't have to master all of them append

133
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.240
child is usually good enough if you have multiple you can do append maybe you could do insert adjacent

134
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.700
element you just have to remember the syntax you've got preplanned.

135
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.090
Next I'll show you some ways of removing elements.
