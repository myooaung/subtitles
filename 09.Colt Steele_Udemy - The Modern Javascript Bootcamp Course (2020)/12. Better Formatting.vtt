00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:00.970
All right.

2
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.680
Last little bit of nit picking from me.

3
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.460
We're going to add in just a little bit more indentation to each of these individual tests once we start

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.980
to add an additional test files.

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.470
It's going to be a lot easier to read everything that's going on.

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.310
Once everything is indented just a little bit more so to do so we'll find all the console logs that

7
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.580
print out success or fail.

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
We're going to put in a tab character right before each one it's a back over here.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.110
I'll find inside the IT function.

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.110
Here's the console logs we have right before the okay.

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.430
I'll put backslash T right before the Excel put backslash T.

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
And then finally we need to essentially take the error message we get and make sure that everything

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
after that first line gets indented as well.

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.960
So to do so we're going to do a little bit of pre processing and the catch statement.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.640
I'll say constant message is going to be e r dot message.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.200
We're going to replace.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.120
We're going to use a regular expression here.

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:02.170
So I going to say globally or everywhere inside the string find every new line character and replace

19
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.960
it with a new line followed by two tab characters like so and then inside of chalked red read We will

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.560
change your message to instead reference the message variable that we just put together.

21
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.290
So again this is saying Every new line inside that error message replace that New Line character with

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.790
a new line and then two tabs to just move it all in.

23
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.380
Let's now save this flip back over run again.

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.000
And that's definitely better OK.

25
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.540
So that's it for reporting.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.610
I won't make you go through anymore.

27
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.520
So let's take one last pause right here.

28
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.660
We're going to continue brushing up our implementation and adding in a couple more features to our test

29
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.340
runner in just a moment.
