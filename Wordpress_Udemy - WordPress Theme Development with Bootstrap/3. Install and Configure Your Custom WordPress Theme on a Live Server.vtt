00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.130
Hey welcome back to Booster
incoming Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.970
Now that you've installed WordPress live,
you need to get that theme in there.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.090
So let me show you how to do that.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.831
Come on in.

5
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:16.190
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.810
So how do we add our own custom
theme to our live WordPress site?

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.550
Well, normally you'd be in appearance and
themes, and then you'd find a theme or

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.380
you'd buy a premium theme, and
then you'd install it here.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.900
But what you could do is you can go to the
directory of your theme that you coded so

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.270
here in my finder I have.

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.610
B2W WordPress content themes.

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.910
Bootstrap to WordPress.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.240
And then compress that file,
or that folder.

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.250
So this is the package for
your theme right here in the zip file.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.690
And then you're going to want to here
in your dashboard add a new theme.

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.690
Choose file or drag and
drop that zip file right here.

17
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.490
And then hit Install Now and
that will install your theme

18
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.390
into the directory that
you can choose from.

19
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.130
And then go ahead and hit Activate.

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.410
Now we're not quite done here
because we're gonna be missing a lot

21
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.920
as you will see.

22
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.890
So here I've activated our
bootstrap to WordPress theme, but

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.780
if I were to go check this out live,
let's just see.

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040
There's a lot of wonky looking stuff here,
and

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.290
this can be discouraging if you don't
know how to solve this problem.

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.940
So it takes a little bit of configuration,
and that's why this lecture is called

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.810
Install and Configure your WordPress
Theme, cuz we're not quite done yet.

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.360
What we're gonna do now is go to
php.myadmin on our local machine.

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.840
So here, local host 8888, MAMP.

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.850
And I need to go to tools, php.myadmin,

31
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.940
and then find my Bootstrap
to WordPress database.

32
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.940
Right here, and up here,
you'll see a tab called export.

33
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.710
I need to export this entire database,
so click custom.

34
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.322
Make sure all of these
tables are selected.

35
00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.250
Save output to a file.

36
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.600
Format as sql.

37
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.590
All these are fine, and
then go ahead, hit go.

38
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.290
That will download an SQL file.

39
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.500
Now go back to your control panel.

40
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.260
And then go into PHP my admin.

41
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.080
Make sure in here that you open up
the Database that was created for

42
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.690
your WordPress site and if you use the
auto installer then it's going to create

43
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.100
a generic or tail name like Word 7 or
Word 6, or Word 425, things like that.

44
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.090
You need to make sure to
find the correct table.

45
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.490
The easiest way to find
the proper database

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.010
is to go to your WordPress
config file in your live site.

47
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.230
So login by FDP.

48
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.790
It's easy if you're using Coda and
open up your WordPress config.

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.780
You can see the database name right here.

50
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.374
So for me 1683.

51
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.300
Here we go, 1683.

52
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.510
And we're given a bunch
of default tables when

53
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.660
the WordPress, install wizard installed
everything, but we don't want

54
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.370
any of this because it's not the correct
tables that we're using for our site.

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.490
So check all and drop the entire thing.

56
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.190
Hit Yes.

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.360
And now you should have an empty site.

58
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.050
Great.

59
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.160
Really all we used the install wizard for
was to quickly install the Wordpress

60
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.530
core files, and then we can go through
the install process ourself manually,

61
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.100
because the core files is what takes the
longest to install when uploading via ftp.

62
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.130
So go back to your code editor in
Wordpressconfig.php, the live site, and

63
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.910
scroll down in the Stable_prefix,

64
00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.890
change it to the Stable_ prefix that
you used in your local version.

65
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.534
So, for me it was dbbs_.

66
00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:07.800
And go ahead and save that.

67
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.560
And now, hit import.

68
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.320
And import the SQL file that you
downloaded from your local site.

69
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.970
And then hit go.

70
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.070
And now we should have all of
the correct database tables.

71
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.620
However, there's still a few
settings we need to change.

72
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.990
Go back to the live site here.

73
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.980
And try logging in, see what happens.

74
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.880
You're redirected to your
local host port 8888.

75
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.890
Wonder why that is.

76
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.370
Well that's because in your database
it saved the information about where

77
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.910
the WordPress install was hosted,
and that was your local host 8888.

78
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.580
So go back to your database.

79
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.000
So what you need to do now is change
the information in the database that

80
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.160
anything that says 'local host 8888,'
you need to change to your new URL.

81
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.650
And that sounds daunting, and it can
be depending on the size of your site,

82
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.550
because you have multiple instances
of that address in your tables,

83
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.420
and so you can do something and

84
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.530
you could search for, for
example, localhost port 8888.

85
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.690
Inside all the tables and then hit go.

86
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.690
It'll let you know how
many instances there are.

87
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.320
And so here there's 96, and this one five,
and then two, and that's it.

88
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.810
So basically, you got A little over
a 100 incidences in these three tables.

89
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.020
Now you can do a pretty quick search and
replace if you have MySQL knowledge.

90
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.980
Or you can go to a tool called
search replace db on GitHub.

91
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.660
So github.com
interconnectit/search-replace-DB.

92
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.170
And it's a php search replace tool quickly
modifying string throughout a database.

93
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.570
Used for changing the base URL and

94
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.580
migrating the WordPress site
from development to production.

95
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.900
Exactly what we're doing.

96
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.370
So why don't you go ahead and download
this, and so what you need to do here is

97
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.400
upload the script to your web root as so
the same as the WP can fig,

98
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.350
and then browse to it in
the in your browser and

99
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.590
then fill in the fields and
hit go so lets try it out together.

100
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.850
So I'm gonna download this.

101
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.490
So here we go.

102
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.320
We have the search replace DV master.

103
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.750
I'm gonna upload that to my
root on my WordPress site here.

104
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.505
And now that's installed I'm gonna go to
my browser and navigate to Bootstrap to

105
00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:39.690
Wordpress.com/searchreplaceDVmaster
Localhost port 8888 and

106
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:47.484
replace with
http://bootstraptowordpress.com.

107
00:06:47.484 --> 00:06:52.360
And we're gonna check all tables and

108
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.299
you could choose dry run just to
double check to see if it works.

109
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.980
So you could see here how
many cells will be changed.

110
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.270
And what you could do
now is do a live run.

111
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.470
And now that we're all done,
we don't need this script anymore so

112
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.820
make sure to remove it.

113
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.080
Or you could delete it right here.

114
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.440
Now we're gonna go back to our log in
screen and see if we're redirected.

115
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.500
And we're not, so that's a good sign.

116
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500
I'm going to log in here.

117
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.660
And here we go, I'm logged in.

118
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.560
But we're still not done yet.

119
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.300
Because we don't have all the plug ins,
and

120
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.990
information that we had in our local site.

121
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.080
So let's just double check
that everything is here.

122
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.540
At least the default pages are here.

123
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.569
So we got the pages.

124
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.900
And I think we should have some posts.

125
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900
Yup.

126
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.270
Okay so we're on the right track but

127
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.100
our site still looks like
this with no information, so

128
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.470
the first thing you need to do is make
sure you have all the correct plugins

129
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.150
because we've used advanced custom fields,
contact form seven, custom post type UI.

130
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.360
Those are very important so we need to get
these plugins and make sure they are live.

131
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.040
What you can just do,
is go straight to your FTP.

132
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.130
From your local site, grab the plugins.

133
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.300
So advance custom fields.

134
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.750
Custom conduct form seven.

135
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.670
Custom post tag UI.

136
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.870
Then make sure to upload them
in the WordPress content.

137
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.410
Plugins, there we go.

138
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.170
You can go ahead and
just upload those folders.

139
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.780
Let those upload.

140
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.960
They might take a few minutes
depending on the size.

141
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.660
It might take a little while.

142
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.170
And now once those plugins have been
installed and activated you should have

143
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.420
access to everything that
you did in your local site.

144
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.170
Theoretically everything should be there.

145
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.670
However, from experience, I already know,

146
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.080
right from the get-go,
that your media library will not be there.

147
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.300
And that's pretty important.

148
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.930
As you can see right here,
these are all broken references.

149
00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.010
All you gotta do is make sure in your
local site in the WordPress content

150
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.520
folder uploads,

151
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.400
make sure to upload the content of
uploads to your live site right in here.

152
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.950
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
upload uploads to my live site.

153
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.620
That should take a few minutes and
once that's done,

154
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.130
we're gonna double check our media library
to make sure we have everything in there.

155
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.610
And here we go in the media library,
everything's been uploaded.

156
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.720
I refreshed, looks good, and

157
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.610
if I go to the live site just to
double check everything's working.

158
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.480
Here we got our hom page.

159
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.690
Everything looks like it's good to go.

160
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.560
Check out the Resources page,
Resources, they're good to go.

161
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.110
Blog, we should have our blog posts,
excellent.

162
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.430
And then the contact page, awesome.

163
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.530
Let's just check the 404,
boom there it is.

164
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.560
And modal windows should pop up for
us, great.

165
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.780
All right, so that's it.

166
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.350
You did it, you uploaded your

167
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.410
Custom WordPress theme live to your
own domain and that's amazing.

168
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.940
That's a huge deal.

169
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.680
It's a big task and it's a lot of work and
it's a little stressful at first but

170
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680
the more you do it
the better you'll get at it.

171
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.250
And my challenge to you is actually to go
back a couple lectures, remove everything

172
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.900
you've just done, delete it from your live
server, remove the WordPress installation,

173
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.900
and start over from scratch and get your
local version onto your live server.

174
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.680
Try that a couple times because the more
you do it, the better you'll get at it.

175
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.750
For me, it's like a piece of cake because
I've done this upwards of 100, 200 times.

176
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.620
So no problem, and you can do the same.

177
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.470
So the more you do it, more practice,
the easier this will be.

178
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.130
And that's also a good thing when
it transfers over to Client work.

179
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.670
When you're doing a website launch,

180
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.250
you don't wanna get yourself caught
with your pants down around your ankles.

181
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.190
You gotta do this right.

182
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.520
And you gotta do it efficiently.

183
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.970
And you gotta deliver on time so

184
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.050
that your client isn't being stressed
that their website isn't gonna be alive

185
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.860
in time for their launch party or
whatever it is they're doing.

186
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.250
So one good way of keeping your client
happy is to make sure that you launch that

187
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.540
website efficiently on time and
without any hesitations or problems.

188
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.720
So I'm going to jump into another module
here with just a few more lectures.

189
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.510
And it's just fun.

190
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.420
Nothing hardcore.

191
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.886
Just to give you a few more details and
information to help extend your

192
00:11:13.886 --> 00:11:16.777
WordPress site and
just give you a bit more information.

193
00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:17.929
So I'll see you there.

194
00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:23.079
[MUSIC].
