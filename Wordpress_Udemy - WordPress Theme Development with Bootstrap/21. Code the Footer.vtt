00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:07.454
Oh, hey guys, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap WordPress.

2
00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:09.968
This chapter is called Coding the Footer.

3
00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:19.266
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.092
All right,
this part should be pretty easy.

5
00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:26.230
We're gonna be coding the footer down
here at the bottom of the website.

6
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.210
Let's jump into our code editor.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.570
Make sure in your HTML,
go down to the footer section.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.500
Put the footer HTML5 tag.

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.540
We don't need to add any ID to that
because it's pretty straight forward.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.505
We're gonna add a container
class div here,

11
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:47.300
cuz we want the footer to be the full
width with that kind of gray-blue color.

12
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.920
But we want the container
to be within that footer so

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
that we can have centered content.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.830
Call small three, and in call small three,
we're going to have the footer logo.

15
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.300
So we'll have a paragraph tag, and a href,
we're gonna link that to the root.

16
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090
And within there we'll have an image,

17
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.460
the source will be assets/img/logo.png,
so just the logo.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
And the alt text will be
Bootstrap to WordPress.

19
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
All right, that should be good.

20
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.110
Now if you save that,
move onto the next one.

21
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.050
So now we want another column, col-sm-6
and in there we're gonna have a nav.

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.790
So the HTML5 nav tag to be semantic.

23
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.100
Now I want to show you
something cool with emmet,

24
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.680
since I've been using it a couple times.

25
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
I wanna show you even
more power that it has.

26
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.410
So, say I wanna add an unordered list
with the class, with a couple classes,

27
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.070
and I want there to be, let's say, five

28
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.970
list items that have eight
tags within each of them.

29
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.620
So that would be a lot of hand coding and
a lot of copy and pasting.

30
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.720
But with Emit I can do
something like this.

31
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.570
So I want an unordered list
with the class of list

32
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.830
unstyled because that's a bootstrap class.

33
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.810
I want the the unordered
lists to have no styles.

34
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.180
No bullets, no margins, nothing like
that and also list dash inline.

35
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.930
So this is a Bootstrap class as well.

36
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.970
This will just make the LI items float
up next to each other and pretty sure

37
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.240
it just makes them all inline elements so
it just, they're all beside each other.

38
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.108
I don't want it to be a vertical list,
I want it to be horizontal.

39
00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:51.900
Okay so, ul.list-unstyled.list-inline.

40
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.560
Now I want some children
within this unordered list.

41
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.270
So I would add the > symbol,
and then I'll say LI and

42
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.940
then if I want five of those,
I'll say times 5.

43
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.600
And I want those five list items
to have children as well, and

44
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.480
have those list items have
children of an A tag, and

45
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.470
now if I expand that,
we'll see what happens.

46
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.820
Boom, check it out.

47
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.920
Amazing, hey?

48
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.110
So, UL, class list and style list in line.

49
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.280
We have li items, and each of those
li items have A tags, pretty cool.

50
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.768
Now I can just put in the text.

51
00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:43.630
Home, Blog, Resources,

52
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.090
Contact and
then the last one will be Sign up now.

53
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.410
And then this I'm gonna give
a class of sign up link.

54
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.210
Because I'm gonna style
it a little differently,

55
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.670
give it a little bit of
red text to stand out.

56
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.590
And then after this last column here, the
sixth column I'm gonna do another call and

57
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.430
that will be small three
to equal twelve and

58
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.150
add a paragraph with
a class of pull right.

59
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.020
And that is a Bootstrap helper class that
will pull this paragraph to the right,

60
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.850
meaning it will float it right and
will have the copyright HTML entity,

61
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.060
copy, there it is, 2014 Brad Hussey.

62
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.869
Save that, check it out.

63
00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.030
Okay.

64
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.450
So there is your footer.

65
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.890
Basically the layout is nearly perfect.

66
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.490
It's just we don't have
the right styles within it.

67
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.640
So then just head to your styles,
your CSS and scroll down.

68
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.190
Past the sign up ID's where you style

69
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.570
just sign up section because that would be
under there in the layout, there they are.

70
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.570
So under your sign up button,
select a footer.

71
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.219
The background you want it to be that
blue-grey color, so that it's 3e4249.

72
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.600
And then the color of all the text will
be white, padding will be 20 pixels top,

73
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.490
zero on the left and right,
and ten pixels on the bottom.

74
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.510
Bot size 12 pixels, okay.

75
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.750
And now we want the paragraph tags
cause there's a few in there,

76
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.050
paragraph tags in bootstrap
have some margin by default.

77
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.580
And, we don't want any
margin in the footer.

78
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.740
That will mess up the layout footer.

79
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.090
Now, we're gonna select the a:link,
and the footer a:visited.

80
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.510
Cuz, when you click on a link and

81
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.130
it has been visited it will by default
turn to a purple color or a blue color.

82
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.260
We just want to style those and make sure
that all the links are just flat white.

83
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.520
However, when you style it like that, that
means the hover will also be affected.

84
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.410
So we want to select the a in the footer,
and

85
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.350
when it's hovered we want
the color to be dd5638.

86
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.610
And we're gonna select
the footer li sign up link.

87
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.120
Remember that list item
with the specific class and

88
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.610
when you hover over that one
actually I jumped the gun there.

89
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.540
We're just gonna style the A first.

90
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.690
The color of that one will also be dd5638.

91
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.960
So when you hover over the traditional
links they'll turn this salmon color,

92
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.830
but the sign up link will
be salmon color by default.

93
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.580
However, when you hover over
that I want it to turn bold.

94
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.390
So I'm gonna select that and just copy and
paste it, made a little change and

95
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.030
then I want the font weight to be bold.

96
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.342
So save that let's check it out.

97
00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:57.703
All right, here is our footer so
you can see down here.

98
00:07:02.064 --> 00:07:05.689
We've got our logo,
we got the background color,

99
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.737
expanding the full width
better small text, the links,

100
00:07:09.737 --> 00:07:14.820
the list item when you hover over each
of them, they turn the red color.

101
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.480
And then when you hover
that it turns bold.

102
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.810
And then we have the copy write over here.

103
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.760
There is one thing that I noticed we
might as well clean it up right now.

104
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.550
When you hover, you get an underline.

105
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.870
I don't want underlines.

106
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:32.800
So go back to your code and if you scroll
right back up to the global section.

107
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.420
And we're gonna do a little
typography styling here.

108
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:43.922
So let's say under the H4 we're
going to select the a:link,

109
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:47.980
a:visited.

110
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.380
Now, this is just a specific.

111
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.370
I'm just gonna make sure all the links
by default are that salmon color

112
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.720
instead of the default
Bootstrap blue 5638.

113
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.960
So any additional links that we add
when we add to our blog section or

114
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.550
our resources contact page, all that
sorta stuff, always will be salmon.

115
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:12.130
And then when you hover over those
links text decoration, none.

116
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.856
So that's the no text underline and
then the color will be

117
00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:21.534
c9302c.

118
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:28.190
So that is basically
the default link styles but

119
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.320
we're overriding them in the footer
with the white and the salmon colors.

120
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.290
Go ahead and say that and
let's check it out.

121
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.150
Down here in the footer you should see.

122
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.040
Now when you hover they just change color.

123
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.290
They don't give underlines.

124
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.410
It looks so much better.

125
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.240
Perfect, all right.

126
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.860
That's it.

127
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.500
In the next lecture we're just going to
do a few small things and style the media

128
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.570
queries a little bit, and a few extra
CSS elements that we may have missed.

129
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.589
Alright see you there.
