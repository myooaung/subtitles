00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.390
Hey everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.090
This lecture is called Code
the Hero Section using Custom Fields.

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:16.612
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:20.012
Okay everyone, so
now what we're gonna do is,

5
00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:23.330
start making our homepage
actually dynamic.

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.280
We're gonna be actually using
the dashboard, in WordPress, and

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.840
we're going to be pulling that
information, into our templates.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.210
So that we can display the information
here, on our screen, but

9
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.070
also make it easy to update the site,
via the dashboard.

10
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.840
And you're gonna start seeing the benefits
pretty much immediately so here we go.

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.770
We're gonna go in and
start coding this hero section and

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.490
by coding it I mean making it dynamic.

13
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.445
Right now it's static,
we want it to be dynamic.

14
00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:50.765
So let's do it.

15
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.645
Go to your dashboard, or

16
00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:56.465
alternatively you could have
clicked Edit Page on the toolbar.

17
00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.295
If I go back, click Edit Page,

18
00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.285
you can go straight to this page,
which is actually kind of a bit better.

19
00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.415
Okay, so here we have nothing.

20
00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:08.965
What we want to do is
utilize this section, but

21
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:10.655
first let's go to our code editor.

22
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.800
And what we're gonna do here is start
off right here in the hero section.

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.990
We're going to just make
dynamic what we can quickly.

24
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.970
So important parts would
be say right here.

25
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.910
Level one heading.

26
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.520
Right here it's static,
bootstrap to WordPress.

27
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.190
What if we want to change that?

28
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.300
What if we don't want it to be
called Bootstrap to WordPress?

29
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.580
What if we change the course name?

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.650
What if I test it out and
find out I have a better course name and

31
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.980
I want to change it and
I don't want to open up the source code?

32
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.390
What if I'm on vacation in Hawaii, and I
wanna change my website name really fast?

33
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690
I can log in on the Internet and
change it.

34
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.120
That's what I wanna be able to do.

35
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.287
I don't wanna be able to open the code.

36
00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:49.120
So, Watch this.

37
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.560
PHP We're gonna be using a WordPress
function called blog info.

38
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.350
You recognize that one.

39
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.080
And there are a lot of arguments
that we could put in here.

40
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.300
One of them is name.

41
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.750
That is the name of the website.

42
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.590
So I save that, and go back to
the homepage here, Bootstrap to WordPress.

43
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.270
That is now dynamic and
the reason why it is dynamic

44
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.930
is because it's pulling from
the name of the site itself.

45
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.260
So I can go to the dashboard here,
go to Settings and then General.

46
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.480
Site Title.

47
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000
This is it right here.

48
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.350
So this is where name comes from.

49
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.020
So if I change this Bootstrap to
WordPress, Heeyyyy, and then save that.

50
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.040
That will now reflect.

51
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.757
Well, up here and also right there.

52
00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:45.240
So, right away,

53
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.890
you can start seeing benefits of
how this is actually really cool.

54
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.040
So I'm gonna go back and

55
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.970
change that because that's not the title
of the site, although it is pretty cool.

56
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.658
I'm gonna save that.

57
00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.190
Now let's go back to our code.

58
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.440
If I go here, this section, Earn An Extra
$1k to $5k a Month, so on and so forth.

59
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.930
I want that to be dynamic too.

60
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.343
No problem.
I'm gonna copy this or

61
00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:09.470
cut it to my clipboard
because I'm gonna use it.

62
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.720
But I'm gonna do PHP again.

63
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.920
Same thing we're gonna do blog info.

64
00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:19.900
And inside here as an argument.

65
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.820
As a little parameter here in this
function, it's going to be description.

66
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.060
Description actually pulls
from here in the dashboard,

67
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.780
tagline, paste that with
what you want it to be.

68
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.600
Earn an extra 1k to 5k a month by learning
to code your very own responsive and

69
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.130
custom WordPress websites, Save that.

70
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.200
Now, if I refresh, there it is.

71
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.180
It is dynamic.

72
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.700
And also, up here,
in the title that is in the webpage title.

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.440
So for

74
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.610
SEO purposes that could be potentially
good, although it is a bit long.

75
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.710
All right, let's go back in.

76
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.616
Now where we're at, are these prices,
I wanna be able to change these prices.

77
00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:11.130
The price can change.

78
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.990
And depending on what you want here,
you wanna be able to easily edit this.

79
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.630
So very simple, but

80
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.312
instead of using
the dashboard's settings tab.

81
00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:27.810
We're gonna actually have to have this
associated with the specific page itself.

82
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.005
So what we're gonna do is use for
this section what is called Custom Fields.

83
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.380
Now go back to that page here.

84
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.240
We're gonna go to the home page.

85
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.854
And up here in the top right,
you'll see screen options.

86
00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:48.980
Make sure Custom Fields is checked.

87
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.590
Now that will allow you
a new section down here.

88
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.220
And this is where we're gonna
be using Custom Fields.

89
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.610
And it's basically the same,
it's basically an array, and

90
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.190
it's using the name and value, kind of key
value pair, that an array would be, and

91
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.610
if you've taken my PHP course,
then you'll know what I'm talking about.

92
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.420
Otherwise, I"m assuming you
know a little bit about PHP.

93
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.660
If you don't know about PHP,
you can still follow along.

94
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.870
You might be a little confused
with some of the terminology,

95
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.740
but you could totally still follow along.

96
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.139
But, I do recommend to checking
out my free PHP course.

97
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.080
Okay.

98
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.880
So what we're gonna do now is
actually create name and value pairs,

99
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.560
add them as variables
to our PHP script and

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.520
then pull in the content
into our sections.

101
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.230
Sounds pretty easy.

102
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.190
Right?

103
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.500
That's because it is.

104
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.759
So this is what we're gonna do.

105
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.300
We're going to create
some custom fields here.

106
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.430
So the first one I wanna
create is prelaunch_price.

107
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.770
Now we need to use code conventions
when we, in regarding the name.

108
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.870
We can't use capitals and
spaces and special characters.

109
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.750
Keep it lower case.

110
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.420
No spaces.

111
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.520
Use underscores in replacement of spaces.

112
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.430
So prelaunch_price.

113
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.970
The value?

114
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.740
Well 149.

115
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.340
So we'll say 149.

116
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.710
Now let's add the custom field.

117
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.630
So that will add that one and
give us a new field.

118
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.580
And the next one we wanna
do is launch price.

119
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.810
And then final price.

120
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.660
So let's add those two.

121
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.745
So launch price, and that was 299.

122
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.170
Add the custom field,
and then final price.

123
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.560
And that one was 399, add custom field.

124
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.150
Okay.

125
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.110
Now I'm gonna need to publish this, or

126
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.680
update this because this is
not currently in the database.

127
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.520
I'm gonna update this and

128
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.780
make sure these custom fields are saved,
committed to the database.

129
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.800
Great.

130
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.010
Now, we should be able to access these.

131
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.170
So the way that you can do this,

132
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.540
and I'm gonna use some variables
because it keeps our template clean.

133
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.690
And we can pull the variables in through
out our template, through out our page.

134
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.190
So we don't have to keep writing this same
function over and over and over again.

135
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.570
So it's at a thing here
called Custom Fields.

136
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.008
So this is where we're gonna
put our custom field variables.

137
00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:27.270
Let's say prelaunch_price, we're gonna
use the same naming convention here,

138
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.620
a couple tabs.

139
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.450
This is how you grab the custom fields.

140
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:39.230
Use a function that's build into
WordPress called get_post_meta.

141
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.675
You like my accent there?

142
00:07:40.675 --> 00:07:44.830
Get_post_meta and
there are a few arguments.

143
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.440
In fact there are three
that we're gonna use.

144
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.170
And one is the, it's not required, but the
page ID that we want to pull this from.

145
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:59.890
So we need to know the ID of the page
that we're pulling the custom field from.

146
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.920
And that would be the home page and
the easiest way to find out that

147
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.155
ID is by looking in your toolbar,
your address bar.

148
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:14.620
Post=7, so this page has the ID of seven.

149
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.850
So we know to put here,
get_post_meta 7 and

150
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.510
then comma, we need to pull the name or

151
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:30.180
the key from the custom field,
using the naming convention we used.

152
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.410
So that would be
prelaunch_price in strings.

153
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.400
And then there's another parameter
here yhat will let us know, or

154
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.390
let the function know if this is
going to be a single item or not.

155
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.860
And that sounds confusing, so right here
in the documentation, the WordPress Codex,

156
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.020
which you will be using a lot.

157
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.240
It's really good,

158
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.580
really descriptive and helps me out
every single time I do WordPress.

159
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.360
So here we go.
We have get_post_meta.

160
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.100
The first parameter is the post_id,
then the key from the actual custom field.

161
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.550
And then, if it is single, so right here.

162
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.400
If it is set to true,
which is the default, I believe.

163
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.440
It will return a single result,
like a string.

164
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.810
If false, or not set,

165
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.990
so actually sorry, the default is if
it is not set which would be false.

166
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.222
Then the function returns in
array of the custom fields.

167
00:09:23.222 --> 00:09:26.710
We wanna be able to
pull this single value.

168
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.850
So we would say this is true.

169
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.230
This is a Boolean Parameter,
so that means true or false.

170
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.506
And this is gonna be true,

171
00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:37.040
because we want just the string
from this one custom field.

172
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.621
Copy that and we're gonna paste it a
couple more times because we're gonna grab

173
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.324
the launch_price.

174
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:48.280
And then this will obviously
be the same launch_price true.

175
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.335
And then the last time was final_price.

176
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.336
And then change it here one more time.

177
00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:59.836
Great, so now if we save that, now we
should have access to these variables,

178
00:09:59.836 --> 00:10:03.190
cuz they now store the post_meta,
or the custom fields.

179
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.380
So let's go ahead and just use them.

180
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.100
Nice and easy.

181
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.060
If you know PHP,
it's very straightforward.

182
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:15.990
PHP, right here we're gonna have echo and
then prelaunch_price.

183
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.490
Cool.

184
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.116
I'm just gonna copy this and

185
00:10:21.116 --> 00:10:26.357
replace the launch price
with launch_price and

186
00:10:26.357 --> 00:10:30.010
final price with final_price.

187
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.020
Now save it.

188
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.310
Let's see if it worked.

189
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.790
Go back to your home page and refresh.

190
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.210
There they are.

191
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.630
These are actually dynamic.

192
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.029
Cuz it, now if I were to change,
just to prove it to you,

193
00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:49.662
this to say, 999 and update.

194
00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:54.420
And then go ahead and
check it out on the front end.

195
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.550
Final price will now change to 9.99.

196
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.950
Awesome, there we go.

197
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.600
So I'm gonna change that back to 399.

198
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.120
Now let's head back to our code.

199
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:15.180
Next thing I want to do here, is I want
to make, well the URL of the button.

200
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.290
And the button text to be easily
editable via custom fields.

201
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.640
So how do we do that?

202
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.280
Very easy.

203
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.612
We're gonna create a couple
more custom fields here.

204
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.955
We're gonna enter a new custom field.

205
00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:36.202
And this is gonna be, course_url.

206
00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:44.178
And then here's where you'll
put a URL to the course,so for

207
00:11:44.178 --> 00:11:49.309
now I'm just gonna say
http://udemy.com/u/bradhussey.

208
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:53.840
Obviously this would be
the real URL to the course.

209
00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:02.170
And then I'm gonna add another custom
field and it's gonna be button_text.

210
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:09.531
And then let's say, Enroll now and

211
00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:13.270
then I'm gonna put raquo.

212
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.920
Okay, our custom field, great.

213
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.780
Now update.

214
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.120
Now they should be
committed to the database.

215
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.690
We should now be able to grab
them with our variables.

216
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.844
So we're gonna say course_url,
it's gonna be

217
00:12:29.844 --> 00:12:36.050
get_post_meta and
then again this is page_id 7.

218
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:41.000
I'm pulling in the course_url and
again will be true.

219
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.272
The last one will be btn_text or
maybe just to be consistent

220
00:12:46.272 --> 00:12:51.790
button_text 7 and
then this one will be button_text, great.

221
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.360
Now we can just easily use them down here.

222
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.928
So here we have our href
we want that to be php echo

223
00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:04.252
course_url.

224
00:13:04.252 --> 00:13:07.796
And then down here,

225
00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:13.430
we want php echo button_text.

226
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.560
Save that,
let's see if it worked on the front end.

227
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.630
There we go.

228
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.030
There it is, these are dynamic,
so all this is dynamic.

229
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.980
So now what if wanted to say,
I wanted to go further,

230
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.980
like save this, I want this to
be editable via custom field.

231
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.320
So I wanted the text and
the button to be editable.

232
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.130
Well, again, really easy,
it's very easy to do.

233
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:37.770
So we're in the option section,
and it's quite simple.

234
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.050
I'm actually just gonna copy this.

235
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.880
So the strong tag with the text,
and then the other text.

236
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.720
I'm gonna copy that.

237
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.730
I'll actually cut it.

238
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.780
And then we're gonna go
back to our home page here.

239
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.780
Create a custom field.

240
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.950
Let's create a new one and
call it optin_text,

241
00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:01.410
and then we're gonna put that HTML there.

242
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.710
This accepts HTML.

243
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.560
Basic stuff here.

244
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:12.380
And add that Custom Field, and
then I'm gonna say, optin_button_text.

245
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.087
And that will be Subscribe.

246
00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:21.340
Click here to subscribe.

247
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.230
Add Custom Field.

248
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.350
Let's update that and
then why don't we go ahead and

249
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.140
add that to our list of variables.

250
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.370
No problem.
Right?

251
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.674
This will be optin_text.

252
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.230
Copy this, I'm gonna change
this to optin_text, great, and

253
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.405
then we have one last one, and
that would be the optin_button_text.

254
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.153
And then this is very simple,
optin_button_text,

255
00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:58.011
save that, scroll her down and
then here, in the button,

256
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:05.689
we'll have php echo, optin_text.

257
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:11.158
Actually, this is a button, so,
it will be optin_button_text.

258
00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:16.135
And then right here in the lead paragraph,

259
00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:20.300
I'm just gonna have optin_text.

260
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.130
Save it, now that again should be dynamic.

261
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.163
There it is and you can edit that so

262
00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:31.960
easy in the homepage using
custom fields right there.

263
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.920
Great.

264
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.520
So that's it for this lecture but
I'm really excited for

265
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.000
this next one because I am basically
gonna take what we just learned

266
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.570
about custom fields and
we're going to scrap it forever.

267
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:54.080
We're basically not going to use custom
fields as we just did ever again.

268
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.860
Now you can and I'm kind of trying to,
I'm just joking around a little bit.

269
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.740
You can obviously use
custom fields all you want.

270
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.640
Keep what you already did,

271
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.120
cause this is a good learning,
this is a good method of learning.

272
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.700
It's important to know how this works.

273
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.210
But it's not very user friendly, and I've
found in the past when I've had clients

274
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:17.570
update their content via custom fields
you can have a lot of custom fields.

275
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.870
You can see how this list
can keep going and going.

276
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.680
And the names aren't very readable.

277
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.700
They're not very pretty to look at,
optin_button_text.

278
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.550
For programmers that's perfectly
normal but for a veterinarian who;s

279
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.170
trying to update their button text,
it's confusing, it doesn't look very good.

280
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.220
Name, value, it's not user friendly.

281
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.090
There's a plugin that I'm
about to introduce to you that

282
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.760
changed my world when it came to
developing WordPress websites.

283
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.330
It's amazing,
I can't wait to show it to you.

284
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.192
So hang on tight and I will see you in
the next lecture, and rock and roll.

285
00:16:55.192 --> 00:16:58.709
