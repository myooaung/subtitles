00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.070
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.230
Bruce Derenko Bootstrap to Wordprocess.

3
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's see if I can say
that a little faster.

4
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.679
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to

5
00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:05.800
Bruce Derenko Bootstrap to Wordprocess.

6
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.740
This lecture is called Code the Instructor
Section with Advanced Custom Fields.

7
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.555
Ha, yes, did it.

8
00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:19.979
[MUSIC]

9
00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:23.155
Here we are in the instructor section,
almost on the home page, and

10
00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.840
this one's actually really easy.

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.620
The last couple were doozies, so this one
is going to be pretty straight forward.

12
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.660
Let's jump right in.

13
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.460
Go back to your dashboard and
we're gonna go straight to Custom fields.

14
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.360
There's no custom post types in this one.

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.670
We just want to be able to have
a section in our Home Edit page.

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.270
So add a new field group.

17
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.870
We're going to call this bad boy,
the Instructor Section.

18
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.600
Add a field, and that field label is
going to be instructor section title.

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.100
Whoops.

20
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.020
There we go.
And that's just going to be text,

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.750
acquired [FOREIGN].

22
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.470
No format, and close that field up.

23
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.550
Good to go.

24
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.640
Add another field.

25
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.920
This one will be instructor name,
and text, whoops not text area.

26
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.600
Required and No formatting.

27
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.380
Close that field.

28
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.260
We're gonna have another section
called the Bio excerpt, and

29
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.760
that's gonna be text as well.

30
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.830
Required Yes and No formatting.

31
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.890
Close that.

32
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.730
And then we have the full bio,
we'll call that Full Bio.

33
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.350
And this will be WYSIWYG Editor.

34
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.746
Nope, changed my mind, Text Area.

35
00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:48.691
Required, yes.

36
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:53.270
And formatting, break tags, good enough.

37
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.030
Close field.

38
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.270
I actually want to put a couple
hints in here, field instructions.

39
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.710
Enter a brief intro to
the instructor's bio.

40
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.090
There we go.

41
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.788
And then for a full bio, I wanna say,

42
00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:18.250
enter the remainder of
the instructor's bio.

43
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.480
There we go.

44
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.920
So we got full bio, and
we got those social icons.

45
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.830
We have Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus.

46
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.740
We need to be able to
access the username for

47
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.800
that specific instructor, for me.

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.636
So we need to add another field and

49
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:45.568
we're gonna say Twitter user name [SOUND],

50
00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:50.637
and that's going to be
just basic text enter

51
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:55.173
the instructor's Twitter user name.

52
00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:57.920
And then, I'm going to
actually put placeholder text.

53
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.230
This isn't required.

54
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.090
Placeholder text to show you
what I want you to type.

55
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.640
So, I want to say at Brad Hussey.

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.560
Actually, I'm just going to say Brad
Hussey because I'm going to prepend and

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.940
at symbol.

58
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.760
Because I don't want you to write the at
sign because we're going to grab what they

59
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.180
wrote then stick it in a URL so

60
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.250
the at sign will break the URL, whereas if
you put a prepend just before the input,

61
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.890
it'll look like it's already there and
they'll just put their username.

62
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.610
No formatting.

63
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.300
And close that field.

64
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.216
Let's duplicate that and
say, Facebook Username.

65
00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.450
And that's gonna be same deal.

66
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.489
Enter the instructor's Facebook username.

67
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.350
Same deal, but it won't be at.

68
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.175
Close that field.

69
00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:05.610
And we're gonna duplicate.

70
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.159
This one will be Google Plus Username,
google_plus_username.

71
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.414
Enter the instructor's G plus username,

72
00:04:19.414 --> 00:04:24.210
and then I'm gonna prepend a plus.

73
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.673
Or I think the plus sign is in the URL,

74
00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:30.423
so we're gonna make
the placeholder text look like so.

75
00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.500
So, they put the plus sign.

76
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.014
Great.

77
00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.770
And close that field.

78
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.380
Then, we have those three
little spots down here.

79
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.910
Big spots.

80
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.080
The numbers.

81
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.340
How many students are using courses.

82
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.160
So, we just need to be
able to add those numbers.

83
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.141
So, I'm gonna say, number of students.

84
00:04:56.508 --> 00:04:59.640
I'm just gonna change this to
num_students just so it's shorter.

85
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.200
Let's change this to number.

86
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.261
And not required, well, yeah,
let's make that required.

87
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.450
And we'll leave that as is, close.

88
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.120
Duplicate, this would
be Number of Reviews.

89
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.113
This will be num_reviews.

90
00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:31.184
Number required, good enough.

91
00:05:31.184 --> 00:05:38.560
And then, number of Courses.

92
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.900
And this will be num_courses.

93
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.430
And all the rest should be good.

94
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.140
Close that field.

95
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.170
All right.
So, now,

96
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.020
we need to make sure that this
displays on the homepage.

97
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.220
Good to go.

98
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.440
And the position is normal,
we want it to be standard.

99
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.919
WordPress metabox.

100
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.310
And that's fine.

101
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.260
Now, let's see if there's something
that we can organize better here.

102
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.610
So, maybe we can organize
the social icons and the numbers.

103
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.410
So let's add another field and
make it the tab.

104
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.330
And then title that tab, Social Icons.

105
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.390
And then we're gonna drag that up here.

106
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.140
Whoops.

107
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.610
Before the social icons.

108
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.250
And then I'm gonna add one more tab.

109
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.271
And that's gonna be titled, The Numbers.

110
00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:40.620
I'm gonna drag that above the numbers,
and there we go.

111
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.600
I'm gonna publish that.

112
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.680
And then, now, if I go to my homepage,

113
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.740
I should have access to
the Instructor Section.

114
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.240
Perfect.

115
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.710
Great.
I'm just gonna drag that below the project

116
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.160
features section.

117
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.040
Open that back up again.

118
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.830
And now let's just add some info.

119
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.510
Okay.

120
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.640
So, we have Your Instructor.

121
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.200
I'm gonna grab this stuff here.

122
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.770
Well this first, Your Instructor.

123
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.930
Instructor Section Title, Your Instructor.

124
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.850
And then, Brad Hussey is the name.

125
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.500
Bio excerpt was this stuff right here.

126
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.680
Gonna paste that in there.

127
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.550
And then the rest of
the bio was right here.

128
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.860
Paste that in,
social icons and the numbers.

129
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.920
Okay.
So, my Twitter username is bradhussey,

130
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.930
Facebook username is bradhussey and

131
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.230
my Google Plus username is bradhussey
with the plus sign beforehand.

132
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.620
The numbers,
number of students at this point,

133
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.535
I have how many students at this point?

134
00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:52.150
57,121.

135
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.970
I'm gonna go ahead and
paste that in there.

136
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.490
57,121 plus,
just because by the time I publish this,

137
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.920
I might have a couple more
students number of reviews.

138
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.851
I have 853 reviews.

139
00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:18.440
And the number of courses, eight courses.

140
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.360
There we go.

141
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.830
And now I'm going to go and update that.

142
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.410
And it wouldn't let me because I
think I have a plus sign in there, so

143
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.990
I'm just going to take that plus
sign away and update again.

144
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.730
Please enter a number, okay.

145
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:40.920
So, it's not happy that
I have a comma in there,

146
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.060
so this is probably best
to not have it be a number.

147
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.050
So I'm just gonna, for now,
just put a straight up number in there and

148
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.890
I'm gonna go back to my custom fields and

149
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.470
change the number of students
to just a plain text field.

150
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.270
Because I wanna be able to put
the comma and the plus symbol or sign.

151
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.510
So back to the instructor section here.

152
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.500
Change the number of students not
to a number but straight up text.

153
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.890
And formatting, no formatting.

154
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.400
Good.

155
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.710
Update.

156
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.720
Head back to your home edit page.

157
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.400
And in there, you should now
be able to add the comma and

158
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.100
the plus sign where they should be.

159
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.187
Perfect.
Now, I can go ahead and update.

160
00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:38.238
And now in my code editor,
we need to add some variables.

161
00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:41.547
Last section of variables here,
my friends.

162
00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:47.890
We're gonna have
the instructor_section_title.

163
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.340
And that's gonna be the whole
get_field function,

164
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.690
as we are used to now at this point.

165
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.350
This will be instructor_section_title,

166
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.014
and the next one is gonna
be the instructor_name.

167
00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:08.770
Change this to instructor_name.

168
00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:14.640
And then,
we got ourselves the bio excerpt.

169
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.460
Good to go.

170
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.590
This is gonna be the same field,
bio.excerpt, and then we got the full bio.

171
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.349
Put that full bio in there.

172
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.840
Then we got ourselves
the Twitter user name.

173
00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:44.761
And that will be the same deal in here.

174
00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:49.350
User name.

175
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.265
Great.

176
00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:56.440
And then the next one will be

177
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.842
the Facebook username, and

178
00:11:01.842 --> 00:11:08.379
then Google plus username [SOUND].

179
00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:15.632
And then the last few things
are the number of students num_students

180
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:26.374
then we have the number of reviews,
num_reviews.

181
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.020
And then last,
we have the number of courses.

182
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.480
And there are our variables.

183
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.740
Scroll down to the instructor section.

184
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.010
Here we are.

185
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.890
And then,
let's start changing some stuff up.

186
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.705
So the H2 right here,
we're gonna have php echo

187
00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:57.860
instructor_section_title, and
then, in the small tag,

188
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:04.612
we've got php echo instructor_name.

189
00:12:04.612 --> 00:12:05.840
Great.

190
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:13.760
And then here,
we're going to add our social lengths.

191
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.330
So I could have made them not required.

192
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.370
I don't remember if I made
them required or not.

193
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.360
So let me just double check.

194
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.230
Not required.

195
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.230
Okay.
That's important for

196
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.260
us to know because we need to check
to see if they've been set or not.

197
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.730
So, the way that we do that
is very straightforward.

198
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.450
For the Twitter one, looks like so, PHP.

199
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.939
If not empty, Twitter username,

200
00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:45.490
and then we're going to close
up that PHP tag right here.

201
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.110
And if.

202
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.770
So there is Twitter, but we need to
actually make the user name correct.

203
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.400
So right here instead of the static one,
we're gonna say,

204
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.970
PHP echo twitter username.

205
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.150
There we go.
And then,

206
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.599
we're gonna do the seam sort
of deal here for Facebook.

207
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:19.587
And this will be facebook_username,
instead of twitter_username And

208
00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:26.460
then, instead of bradhussey,
this will be PHP echo facebook_username.

209
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.410
Good.

210
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.320
Then, the last one right
here is Google plus.

211
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.060
This will be Google plus user name.

212
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.970
Close up that PHP tag, then we have our

213
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.421
Google plus username right here,

214
00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:50.197
PHP Echo google_plus_username.

215
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.430
There it is.

216
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.350
Scroll down.

217
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:58.300
We have our lead text here, which is gonna
be our bio excerpt, so that's easy enough.

218
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.512
Php echo bio_excerpt.

219
00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:01.670
Good to go.

220
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.000
And all of this, take out all
the paragraph tags all together.

221
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.216
That's just gonna be straight up.

222
00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:11.310
<!--?php echo $fullBio; ?--> There it is.

223
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.950
And then, we have the level four heading.

224
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.990
The Numbers, they Don't Lie.

225
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.030
And then you've got our numbers.

226
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.156
So, we're gonna take this number here.

227
00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:27.361
<!--?php echo $num_students; ?--> And

228
00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:32.341
then I'm gonna do the same deal for
the other ones.

229
00:14:34.678 --> 00:14:36.560
So, I got PHP echo num_reviews.

230
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.440
And if I wanted to add a plus sign to
this one, although it is just a number,

231
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.310
I could put it right here at the end.

232
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.310
Could have done the same deal here, but

233
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.910
I like the idea of having
the comma in that number.

234
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.634
We're in the text field, number of
reviews and then the number of courses.

235
00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:57.960
Change this to num courses.

236
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.160
Okay.
Save that and

237
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.630
let's see if it works on the front end.

238
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.670
If so, then we're good for this lecture.

239
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.420
Awesome.

240
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.100
Looks like it works.

241
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.940
And we got the title, instructor name,
we got the correct links to the profiles.

242
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.970
Bio excerpt, full bio.

243
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:20.190
We got the numbers, 57,121 plus students,
853 plus reviews, and 8 courses.

244
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:20.920
Awesome.

245
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.500
That's good.

246
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.650
And then, now, we have one more
section coming up for this up,

247
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.910
one more lecture for this whole module or
section and we're gonna be doing the,

248
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:36.570
What People Are Saying About Brad
section right here, the testimonials.

249
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.988
And I'll see you in the next lecture for
that.

250
00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:41.422
