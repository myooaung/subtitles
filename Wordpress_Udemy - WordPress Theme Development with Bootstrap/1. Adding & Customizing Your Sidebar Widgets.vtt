00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.050
Hey, welcome back to booster income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.210
New section/module.

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.260
I don't really know what
to call these anymore.

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.470
This one's gonna be finalizing
your WordPress theme.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.716
We're gonna add and
customize some sidebars and widgets.

6
00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:16.541
Know my widgets.

7
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:25.324
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.760
Hey, welcome back.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.020
We're gonna be playing around
with some widgets here.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.770
So this is the static site.

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.680
Just wanna show you over here,
we have a few of these widgets.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.320
And this is obviously, this is hardcoded
and I just wanted to show you.

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.030
What we're going to be trying to achieve
in this lecture is something like this.

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.230
Currently on our actual WordPress site
we have some generic widgets here.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.840
While they still look the same as the
final design, I want to show you how you

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.680
can manage these, because you can
really add as many as you want.

17
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.850
You can remove them,
you edit them, customize them.

18
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.800
And everything like that so head back to
your dashboard and go to appearance and

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.310
widgets.

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.940
In Widgets is where you can
manage your sidebar and

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.100
the widgets within that sidebar.

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670
So, over here these
are the available widgets and

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.870
you can see you have things like archive,
calendars, custom menus, pages,

24
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.820
recent posts, search text,
so on and so forth.

25
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.170
And right here is a metabox
called Sidebar, and

26
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.950
you can drag and
drop these widgets in here, and

27
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.590
these widgets are customizable based on
the settings they allow you to customize.

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.710
A lot of the time you can
just change the title and

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.280
choose if you want to display any extra
information or anything like that.

30
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.470
The other thing in the newest
version of WordPress,

31
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.380
the latest version of WordPress, you can
actually go to the customize section.

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.990
So I clicked on Manage Customizer.

33
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.760
And you could see the widgets here in
the customizer, and you can drag those

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.780
widgets around, and
they'll reflect in real time over here.

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.990
And you can see if you hover over
them then the corresponding widget

36
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.610
will highlight.

37
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.820
So you can see what you're working with.

38
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.390
So for
example I don't want recent comments here.

39
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.010
I'm just going to remove this.

40
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.775
So comments will go away.

41
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.020
Same with any of these other ones.

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.120
So let's see what we got here.

43
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.570
We got this is a text box with
some custom text and a button.

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.040
We just have a search bar some more
custom text, posts and categories.

45
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.070
So let's mimic this right here.

46
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.880
So let's go back here and
work on our customized section, why not.

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040
Search looks good,
we don't have to do anything.

48
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.390
But we need to add a new widget.

49
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.220
So let's add a text box.

50
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.600
And I want that up at the top because this
is gonna be where our opt in window is for

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.710
our mailing list.

52
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.860
And this is gonna say
join our mailing list.

53
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.000
And let's copy that text.

54
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.060
Paste that in here.

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.940
And then we will make a strong
tag around the rest of this here,

56
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.190
pretty sure this is how we did
it over here, close enough.

57
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.460
Then we have a button to opt in,
to trigger the modal window.

58
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.310
Well basically all I got to do
now is head into our static

59
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.930
site here and
open up file with the side bar in there.

60
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.070
And I'm just going to copy that HTML.

61
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.400
So right here, click here to subscribe and
you've got the button HTML.

62
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.350
And I'm just going to
paste that down here.

63
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.780
And maybe I'll just add a break
tag couple, break tags.

64
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.520
There we go clean this up a little
bit we don't need all this space

65
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.820
and now if I were to click this button,
technically a moto window should pop up.

66
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.230
And there it is.

67
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.320
And then you could subscribe to
the mailing list, theoretically.

68
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.270
We don't have this hooked up yet.

69
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.810
So, there we go.

70
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.510
We've got that.

71
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.500
You could see this widget worked out good.

72
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.350
Let's close that one up.

73
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.140
What do we got next?

74
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.870
We've got the search and
then we've got some more text here.

75
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.430
This is simple.

76
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.940
that's just another text widget.

77
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.810
Just gonna click that and I'm gonna
bring that right under the search.

78
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.830
There we go.

79
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.760
And that's just gonna say
about Bootstrap to WordPress.

80
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.690
And then, I'm just going to snag
some Lauren Lipson right here.

81
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.600
Paste that in there.

82
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.420
You get the idea.

83
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.180
And they got recent posts.

84
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.070
I'm going to remove archives,
and that categories.

85
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.360
And we don't need meta here because
this is just not really that useful.

86
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.400
Just gonna remove that as well.

87
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.790
There we go, and
we've cleaned up our sidebar, looks good.

88
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.330
Now what if we wanted to
have different sidebars?

89
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.980
So, I'm gonna save and publish that first.

90
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.660
So say,
If you had other pages with sidebars.

91
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.470
Right now we really only have the blog.

92
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.370
You can create new side
bars to add widgets to,

93
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.050
by going back to your code and
then head to your functions dot PHP.

94
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.154
Search for sidebar and
you'll see here there's around line 74.

95
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.550
We got register widget area.

96
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.680
So in this function,
Bootstrap to WordPress widgets in it.

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.040
We have one sidebar, register sidebar,
you can see it's called sidebar.

98
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.790
The ID is sidebar-1 and then there's just

99
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.920
some extra info here in the array that
helps set up the register of the sidebar.

100
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.560
And this sidebar is the one that shows
up in our appearance widgets menu.

101
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.130
Now we can create new sidebars by
registering as many as we want, and

102
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.150
then we could use those wherever
we want on our site, and

103
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.470
I'll show you how to do that,
just as an example.

104
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.672
So I'm going to copy this register
sidebar function and array.

105
00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:32.360
I'm gonna register another
another side bar and

106
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.760
I have to change the info, so
the name is going to be Extra Sidebar.

107
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.250
And then the id, sidebar-2, and
then this looks fine to me,

108
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.760
all the rest looks good,
keep the same markup.

109
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.630
I'm gonna save that.

110
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.230
Now if I were to go back to
my appearance in Widgets and

111
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.780
refresh this, I should have another
sidebar called Extra Sidebar.

112
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.200
And I'm free to drag more info in here,
and I could do that.

113
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.580
I could drag in Archives, I could drag
in Tag Cloud, so on and so forth.

114
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.290
And so we got our extra sidebar here.

115
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.790
Now it's not gonna show up anywhere,

116
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.270
this isn't just gonna automatically show
up by using the getSidebar function.

117
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.840
We actually have to use an additional
function to pull this into our template.

118
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.090
So let's just say I wanted to put
this index here, the blog index.

119
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.370
And so to pull that sidebar in,
all I need to do is use the function

120
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.680
called dynamic_sidebar.

121
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.850
And then dynamic sidebar,

122
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.350
I just pull in as a parameter here
the id of the sidebar I'm looking for.

123
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.914
So here, I'm looking for sidebar-2.

124
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.150
And here is the parameter say sidebar-2.

125
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:55.470
If I save that and go back and refresh
this, then you will see I should have it

126
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.410
at the bottom at least the archive because
there are no other custom menus right now.

127
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.270
So this is it, just to prove it works.

128
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.570
I am going to remove get sidebar,
save that, and

129
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.470
now we should just have the one sidebar.

130
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.850
And so this is just, I just put both
sidebars on the blog, but if you wanted to

131
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.700
use any other sidebars on different pats
of your site then you could do that.

132
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.060
Now, you don't have to limit this to
just sidebars literally like an aside.

133
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.470
On the left or right side of your page.

134
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.380
In this could be like
a footer widget area.

135
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.550
So, for example, if you had in the footer,

136
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.850
you wanted to have a bonus little footer
section, where you had custom menus,

137
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.550
an opt-in box or your categories,
things like that.

138
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.790
Then you can register that as a side bar,

139
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.620
add the widgets in the widgets section,
and then have it appear here.

140
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.970
You just have to style it so
it looked appropriate for a footer for

141
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.950
a horizontal layout rather than
a vertical sidebar layout right here.

142
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.140
And so basically that's how sidebars and
widgets work.

143
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.070
You really just need to play around in
here in appearance and widgets, and

144
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.030
you could play around
with the widgets here.

145
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.570
You can download and install plugins
that allow you to have extra widgets.

146
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.050
A lot of features in premium and
free plugins.

147
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:19.040
Give you the ability to add widgets
based on whatever you downloaded.

148
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.230
So if there was like a calendar,

149
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.910
an event calendar plug in,
it allows you to use a widget.

150
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:30.400
You can use short codes and everything
inside your sidebars and your widgets.

151
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.930
So there's a lot you could
do with the widgets section.

152
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.850
And if you wanted to extend that
functionality you can create your

153
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.390
own sidebars by registering
them in your functions.php.

154
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.820
And it's really easy, as you saw.

155
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.802
So in the next lecture I'm gonna show you
a little bit more about WordPress menus

156
00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.735
and creating a custom menu so you can use
that throughout the rest of your site.
