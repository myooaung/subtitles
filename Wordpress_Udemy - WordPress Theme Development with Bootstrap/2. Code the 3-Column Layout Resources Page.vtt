00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey everybody.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.070
Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.750
In this lecture,
we're gonna create a resources page and

4
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.240
code the three column layout.

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.868
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:19.315
All right, so lets jump right in and
code this resources page.

7
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:22.686
In your code editor,
create a new file called resources.html.

8
00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:27.213
And we're going to want to get that
skeleton set up, so just go ahead and

9
00:00:27.213 --> 00:00:28.995
grab any page, really.

10
00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.995
Maybe, lets grab the blog here.

11
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:37.133
And lets start off by copying

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.000
the head right here.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.770
Copy that.

14
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.147
Paste it in your resource.html.

15
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:54.078
And go ahead, get back there and
copy the bottom here so

16
00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:59.150
from HTML, the closing the HTML tag.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.540
All the way up to.

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.830
Well let's see what does it
look like here, the final page.

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.920
So we have the sign up section.

20
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.700
So go ahead and copy all of this including
the modal, we'll remove it from the code.

21
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.580
Because we don't necessarily need it for
this one or we could leave it.

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.640
It's fine.
We'll remove it in WordPress.

23
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.130
Grab the footer, the sign up section.

24
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.490
There we go.
Right up to the sign-up section,

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.847
from the closing HTML tag up to
the beginning of the sign-up section.

26
00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:30.450
Paste that.

27
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.180
All right.
So we should have our basic skeleton here.

28
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.900
And within here,
just gonna make sure we have everything.

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.600
Okay.

30
00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:56.043
Right after the head, that's where
we're going to add the body tag.

31
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.481
And now we already have a closing
body tag way down here, so

32
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:08.030
we don't need to add the closing one,
just the opening one.

33
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.190
Give it the class of full-width and
resources.

34
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.719
We're going to utilize those in our CSS.

35
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.240
And then down here header.

36
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.980
Well, actually let's
not code all that out.

37
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
Let's copy that header from the blog
again, because it's the navigation bar.

38
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.990
We're gonna need that.

39
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.400
So grab header, copy that,
paste that header in there.

40
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.370
There we go.

41
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.560
And here let's change this active class
to highlight their resources page.

42
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.810
Save that.

43
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.060
Now let's just make sure
we have everything.

44
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.250
Go to your page, click on resources.

45
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.530
Okay we're getting something here.

46
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.784
We're gonna also need this header.

47
00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:09.158
So that would be back in your blog, and

48
00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:13.180
under the header we have a section
with a class of feature image.

49
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.200
Now go back to your resources.

50
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.005
Paste that right in under the header.

51
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.900
Change this to resources.

52
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.630
And remove feature image default alt,
and make it just feature image default.

53
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.890
Save that.

54
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.750
And now we should have a skeleton for
our resources page.

55
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.360
There we go.

56
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.990
Now I'll start adding
the rest of the content.

57
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.010
Right here after your feature image, let's
just give that an HTML comment there.

58
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.250
Feature image.

59
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.320
Let's add another section.

60
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.350
This will be the main content and

61
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.810
we're gonna have a div with
the class of container.

62
00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:10.020
Within here we'll have a row
with the ID of primary.

63
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020
Let's not forget that like
we did in the last couple.

64
00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:20.640
And in there we're gonna have
div with the ID of content and

65
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.500
the class of call small 12.

66
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.100
So full width,
suppose you can change this to content.

67
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.970
And in content we're going to have

68
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.370
a section with the class
of the main dash content.

69
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.670
Within that main content
we're gonna have some text,

70
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.110
paragraph with the class of lead, and in
there we'll say welcome to the Bootstrap

71
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.490
to WordPress resources page.

72
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.570
And yadda yadda yadda you can go ahead and
copy that out or just put Larumepsum.

73
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.790
We're gonna add another paragraph here.

74
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.750
And that's gonna have an M tag within
it as our transparency disclosure

75
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.570
regarding our affiliate
links if we are using them.

76
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.485
Please keep in mind some of the following
Resources are my affiliate links.

77
00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:29.315
Should you decide to make a purchase I
will earn a small commission at no extra

78
00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:29.835
cost to you.

79
00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:32.385
I am recommending these resources
only because I have found them to

80
00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:33.795
be incredibly helpful.

81
00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:35.275
Don't spend your money on any products or

82
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.785
resources unless you think
they will benefit you.

83
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:45.205
All right after that,
let's add a horizontal rule.

84
00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:55.521
And then now we're gonna add a div with
a class of resource-row and clearfix.

85
00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.579
Resource-row, within resource-row.

86
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:11.200
We're going to add a div
of the class of resource.

87
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.180
There we go.
And in there, we're going to add an image,

88
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.160
and that source will be,
assets/img/justhost-logo.jpg.

89
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.240
This will be just host, the alt text.

90
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.670
And then, we'll have a level three
heading, with an A tag within it.

91
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.670
I'm going to put my specific
affiliate tag there, and just host.

92
00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:49.610
I think this is the proper way to
spell Justhost without the camel case.

93
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.190
Paragraph tag.

94
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.520
I'm just gonna put the text here.

95
00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.320
I believe I have included in
the copy deck, the resources text.

96
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.960
There you go.
So you could just copy and

97
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.630
paste right from the copy deck.

98
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.380
So you don't have to
waste time on this part.

99
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.640
Just copy and paste and
a couple of paragraph tags.

100
00:07:11.613 --> 00:07:15.647
And then I'm going to have an a tag,

101
00:07:15.647 --> 00:07:19.690
hf will be again my affiliate link.

102
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.720
And I will give that the class of btn and
btn-success, and

103
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.720
then Get started with Justhost.

104
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.297
Okay, then after that, I'm gonna copy
this resource that I just coded,

105
00:07:36.297 --> 00:07:41.089
paste it, and I'm just gonna
change all this stuff around for

106
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:47.371
the next resource, which will be
Coda2-logo, the alt text will be, Coda 2.

107
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:54.084
And then, I'm gonna add the Coda
2 text and the Coda 2 button.

108
00:07:54.084 --> 00:08:01.340
So, the button down here, remember to keep
it the same class, and just some new text.

109
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.470
We'll copy and paste this out again for
the next resource, and

110
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.998
that will be dropbox logo and

111
00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:18.560
then dropbox,
these links will be dropboxed.

112
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.280
I had to change my Coda 2 link here.

113
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.960
Almost forgot.

114
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.730
Okay, back to our Dropbox.

115
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.902
This changes to say Dropbox.

116
00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:37.850
And then I'm going to have my
Dropbox text and my Dropbox button.

117
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.280
Perfect.
Save that.

118
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.060
Check it out in your browser.

119
00:08:48.507 --> 00:08:49.370
Okay, there we go.

120
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.660
So, we have our text, perfect.

121
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.100
And then we have our lists of resources.

122
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.140
You can tell that they are not
in a three column layout.

123
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.520
And you may be wondering, why didn't I
use the Bootstrap three column layout?

124
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.750
Well, in this case, what I want to do
is use custom CSS because what I found,

125
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.640
if I'm using the Bootstrap
three column layout,

126
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.360
you need to have each row in a row class.

127
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:20.090
And you need to know exactly how many
elements are going to be in those rows.

128
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.710
However, when you put this in WordPress,
these are gonna be dynamic elements.

129
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.630
And if you have two elements,
two will show up.

130
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.490
If you have six elements, six will show
up, eight will show up, ten will show up,

131
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.680
however many you put.

132
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.970
So when you start adding all
these resources in WordPress, and

133
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:46.050
if you have a fourth resource,
it's going to jump down to the next line.

134
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.210
But it's gonna have a margin on the side,
on the left.

135
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.050
And it will be out of sorts.

136
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.580
The layout will be kinda broken.

137
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.110
And that's because it's not adding
a new row, because it's dynamic.

138
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.930
So this way,
I'm just going to bypass all that mess and

139
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.410
I'm just going to code it
myself using percentage widths.

140
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.330
So that it always looks good.

141
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.010
So why don't we just go in there and start
styling it and I'll show you what I mean.

142
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.740
Go to your CSS.

143
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.960
Now we're gonna scroll
down past our comments.

144
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.470
And right here,
we're gonna style our resources

145
00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.880
Very simple, not a lot of CSS here.

146
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.691
You'll be surprised at how quick it is.

147
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:34.021
I'm going to select the resource and

148
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.776
say width: 31.33333333.

149
00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:40.699
I believe that is the correct
amount of threes.

150
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.960
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight three's percent.

151
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.010
I copied this basically from
Bootstrap's native CSS.

152
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:56.840
And that's how wide
the three column grid is.

153
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.150
So I'm just trying to replicate that.

154
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.068
Float left.

155
00:11:00.068 --> 00:11:07.580
Margin, 0, 3% on the right, 40 pixels
on the bottom, and 0 on the left.

156
00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:12.625
Now, I want to select,
if I go back and check it out.

157
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.788
You can see,
the third one's not floating up here,

158
00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:21.470
that's because this one has
a margin of 3% on the right.

159
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.580
But every third element,
I don't want to it to have a margin.

160
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.050
So that once we have three, six,
nine, twelve, however many resources,

161
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.420
I wanna make sure that they float
perfectly in their respective layout.

162
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.420
So we gotta remove the margin
on every third element.

163
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.990
Luckily CSS3 lets us dynamically
choose the third element.

164
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.240
No matter how many elements there are.

165
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.150
So, resource: nth-child(3n).

166
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:54.325
That selects every third element
that has the class of resource.

167
00:11:54.325 --> 00:11:58.355
Margin-right: 0; Now look.

168
00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:00.290
There you go.

169
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.880
Floats right up there perfectly.

170
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.206
And, we're responsive.

171
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:13.280
Now if you look here,
this isn't quite gonna work for me here.

172
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.300
Once we are down to a mobile
size it's a little too squished.

173
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.990
So we're just gonna change
that in our media query.

174
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.210
So why don't we jump back,
scroll down to our media queries.

175
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.710
There they are.

176
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.300
And that's where we're just
going to do a few more styles.

177
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.510
So right here, max width 768.

178
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.709
Let's add a style here.

179
00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:43.519
48% for the width Margin-right 2%.

180
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.980
That should be good for 768 and lower.

181
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.731
And then down here in 568,
let's go resource,

182
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.710
width: 100%, margin-right: 0.

183
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.970
Now save it, check it out,
resize your browser.

184
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.450
You'll see the changes happen.

185
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.500
So, we've got full width here.

186
00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:08.640
There we go.

187
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.130
So it broke down to a couple of columns.

188
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.160
Maybe I'm gonna wanna add a little
bit more margin here on the bottom.

189
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.640
Because this kind of pops over.

190
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.380
It looks a little funny.

191
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.640
So, that is this one.

192
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.280
So right here we're just gonna give
these resources a minimum height.

193
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.030
So let's say minimum height 800 pixels.

194
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.040
So now if I save that and check it out
we shouldn't get any of those funny,

195
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.650
once it scrolls to this width

196
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.900
each of these resources will have
the minimum height of 800 pixels so that

197
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.700
will give us plenty of space to be able
to see them without the layout breaking.

198
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.760
But once it gets to here I don't
want that minimum height, so

199
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.984
let's just remove it right here.

200
00:13:47.984 --> 00:13:55.009
Resource, min-height: 0.

201
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:57.100
Here we go.

202
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.450
And, now we're good.

203
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.780
So, the layout looks good
on mobile devices, as well.

204
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.720
And one more thing,
I don't like the padding right here.

205
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.470
There's just a little bit too much
padding on the top and the bottom.

206
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.500
As you can see here in the final
static site, there's less padding.

207
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.300
You see that?

208
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.840
So all we need to do is just select the
section with the class of main content,

209
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.779
which is this whole thing.

210
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.310
Let's just scroll up to
our layout section, and

211
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.950
let's go right here after section.

212
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.010
Section with a class of main content.

213
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.320
Padding, 40 pixels 0.

214
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.780
Now that will change that.

215
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.310
Perfect.
There we go.

216
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.120
And that's it.

217
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.890
There is our Resources page.

218
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.710
Looks awesome.

219
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.900
Super quick.

220
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.360
Hang on tight,
see you in the next lecture.

221
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.807
We're going to code the Contact page, then
after that, we're jumping into WordPress.

222
00:14:52.807 --> 00:14:58.289
