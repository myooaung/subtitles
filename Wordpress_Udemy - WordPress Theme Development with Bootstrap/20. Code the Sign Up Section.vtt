Hey, everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.197
In this lecture we're going to be coding
the sign up section at the very bottom of

3
00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:07.762
the page.

4
00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:16.615
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.940
Okay guys, and now in this lecture,

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.410
we're gonna be coding this
sign up section down here.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.180
You can see that it has a little bit
of a parallax effect with all these

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.310
cool little hipster items.

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.540
And some leading text with the sign
up button where you can click and

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.280
it will take you somewhere.

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.960
And in this case it
doesn't go anywhere but

12
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960
that doesn't matter right now it's
just about what it looks like.

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.150
So slip into our code editor and then
in your HTML scroll down to the sign-up

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.760
section and as usual,
let's get coding, id, sign up.

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.290
And if you remember If you want
yourself a parallax background,

16
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.690
you'll need to add a couple extra
attributes to your sections.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.360
So that is the data type attribute and

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.970
that will equal background because
we're using our JavaScript,

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.700
our JQuery to select that and data speed,
I want this to be four, okay.

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.340
And now we're gonna be adding a container
class with a child container,

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.770
or a child element of a row.

22
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.270
There you go.

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.880
Little few things here, and,
we'll close that one up with a comment.

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.587
Perfect.
Inside here we're gonna put a col-sm-6,

25
00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:32.380
and we're gonna offset that one by 3.

26
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.550
Now you're probably wondering,
how does that all work,

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.860
how do you make sure something's
centered when you're having an offset?

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.670
Sorry, col-sm-offset-3.

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.720
There we go.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.120
So because I'm using a six,
I'm gonna have six columns, and

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.070
I want it to be in the center,

32
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.730
and if I want it to look like it's in
the center, I need to offset it by three.

33
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.180
That's because,
if you were to have another, so,

34
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
say you have three columns on the left,
six in the middle, and

35
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
then three on the right, you'd need
to have three, six, and then three.

36
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.670
But because I'm centering this and
I'm not having any content,

37
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.615
I don't need to have empty columns
on the left and the right.

38
00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:14.850
I just gonna need to offset the six
column by three on the left side.

39
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.020
So it kinda has the illusion
that we are in the center.

40
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.110
Technically we're in the center so

41
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.610
maybe it's not an illusion,
it's a total reality.

42
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.787
But if you want it to be centered, so
let's say if you wanted four to be

43
00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:32.198
centered, you need say col-sm-4,
and then col-sm-offset-4.

44
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:33.840
What if you wanted 8 to be centered?

45
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.567
Well, you need col-sm-8, col-sm-offset-2.

46
00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:40.492
Get the drift?

47
00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.976
Hopefully that makes sense.

48
00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:47.810
All right, in here, level two heading,
are you ready to take your

49
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.160
coding skills to
the strong tag next level?

50
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.930
And then we're gonna add a paragraph here,
and

51
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.840
in that paragraph we're gonna have a href.

52
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.710
Not gonna go anywhere right now.

53
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.890
Class BTN, BTN large or LG,

54
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.030
BTN block because they want to span
the full width of the parent element.

55
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.400
Make it a block level element.

56
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.340
BTN success to make it green and

57
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.270
then in side that A tag, yes, sign me up.

58
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.610
Alright, save it.

59
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.163
Let's check it out,

60
00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:26.273
see what it looks, and then we'll do some
styling because we're gonna need it.

61
00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:29.300
There you go.

62
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.820
You ready,
take your coding skills to the next level.

63
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.520
Looks pretty boring hey, compared to this.

64
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.780
So let's make it look like this.

65
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.710
This is way more exciting.

66
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.130
Jump into that code editor again.

67
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.920
Go to your CSS right
under your testimonials.

68
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.846
You're gonna add or select the sign up,
id, text align everything center.

69
00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:53.495
Background URL,

70
00:03:53.495 --> 00:04:00.130
image hipster-stuff.jpg,
that's the image that I called it.

71
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.552
Center, center, repeat fixed.

72
00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:07.634
All right, and
then we'll do background size, cover.

73
00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:12.100
We wanna cover it, so
that if we extend it to any size,

74
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.105
that background image will
stretch to fit it proportionally.

75
00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:20.240
Color white, the text, we want it to
be white cuz it's a darker background.

76
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.388
We need to be able to see that text.

77
00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:26.790
Padding: 140 pixels on the top and
the bottom is zero, just to space it out.

78
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.040
All right, there's a level two heading in
there so we're gonna select that as well.

79
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.950
Sign up H2, and we're gonna font
wait normal because currently

80
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.480
the default is bold and
we actually want it to be not bold.

81
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.970
And then now we also need to select that
strong tag with in the level two heading.

82
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.260
And we're gonna give it border,
bottom, and solid two pixels,

83
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.620
believe the salmon color is DD5638,
save that.

84
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.190
One more thing, sign up and a button.

85
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.170
We're gonna give it the font size of 24
pixels to make it a more acceptable size.

86
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.670
Let's check it out.

87
00:05:13.388 --> 00:05:16.760
All right, kind of there,
we kinda have a little issue here.

88
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.150
It looks like something happened where our
text went to Times New Roman or something.

89
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.540
It's probably because we have a bug and
I typed something wrong here.

90
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.460
Font family normal, that's right.

91
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.910
So that needs to be font weight,
that's what it was.

92
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.070
Type that out correctly.

93
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.200
All right, now it will be good.

94
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.000
There it is.

95
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.120
It looks good and
we should have our parallax background.

96
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.110
You can see if you scroll,

97
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.740
the background moves at a different
speed than the foreground and

98
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.320
it gives this really cool illusion that
there are multiple layers to our website.

99
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.130
That is super cool.

100
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.140
And there's a button, and
I believe there's one more thing.

101
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.740
The button, technically,
we have a different color.

102
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.640
The success button.

103
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.260
We need to change that green color to
the color that matches the brand of

104
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.670
this website.

105
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.890
So all we need to do,
head back to your CSS and scroll up to

106
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.386
your global section where you've been
styling your Buttons right here.

107
00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:19.337
So under button danger,

108
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:24.808
let's add a few more things here.

109
00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:29.490
So btn-success,
we wanna style that in the background and

110
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.860
we want it to be a separate green color
than the default Bootstrap color.

111
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.164
And border none.

112
00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:43.879
Under that, button success and

113
00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.750
pseudo-class hover, so
when we hover over that button

114
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.245
background we want that to be
a little bit different of a green, so

115
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:59.840
6a9b3d.

116
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.830
And the border color will be the same.

117
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.550
We just need to select border color.

118
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:14.940
There we go, save that and
let's check it out.

119
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.830
So now our Success button looks better,

120
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.090
and I even saw one up here,
our Subscribe button looks good.

121
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.980
Now there's one thing I see here.

122
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.330
Do you see when I click on this button,
this blue outline appears.

123
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.050
That's a Bootstrap default style,
and I don't actually want that.

124
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.630
It happens on, I believe,
this is an actual button.

125
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.510
So the button HTML.

126
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.450
I don't want that outline on those,
so let's go back to our CSS.

127
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.470
So to remedy that outline,
all you need to do,

128
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.590
let's just put it here under our button
class and go bbutton pseudoclass focus.

129
00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.370
And then if you say outline none,
that should resolve that issue.

130
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.040
Let's just see.

131
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.880
No it didn't.

132
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.720
It's probably because it
wasn't specific enough.

133
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.470
So, let's go button.btn:focus.

134
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.870
So let's try it.

135
00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:20.214
And no dice.

136
00:08:20.214 --> 00:08:24.660
So basically it's not specific enough to
override the default Bootstrap style so

137
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.650
there's a couple things you can do.

138
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.050
You can just make this even more
specific and say button and

139
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.800
then button success, that might do it.

140
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.430
Yeah it did it but then that kind of
leaves us with the issue that it might

141
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.720
when we add new buttons if
we added another button

142
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.240
it might not work because it
needs to be the success button.

143
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.375
So you can add extra classes here or
this is where you might want to use

144
00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:57.040
the important, right here.

145
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.820
And that will just override any style
that's trying to compete with it, and so

146
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.750
that should work as well.

147
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.010
There we go.

148
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.510
Perfect.

149
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.520
So, there we go.

150
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.030
We have our button there, and
I think everything else is sorted out.

151
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.680
We have our section at the bottom,
and our nice big button, looks good.

152
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.860
And hang in there, the next lecture
will be the last one for this section.

153
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.310
We're basically done the homepage,
we're just gonna do a couple things to fix

154
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.750
the responsive layout here
using some media queries.

155
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.760
Because as you can see there are a few
things that we could sort out.

156
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.000
Everything looks pretty good already.

157
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.880
But there are a few little
things as you can see.

158
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.360
You can't read the text.

159
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.590
These are kinda clumped together.

160
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.160
And there are a few things that we will
fix in our responsive media queries,

161
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.450
in the next lecture.

162
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.736
So I will see you there.

163
00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:51.019
