00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.960
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to boost your income with

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.980
bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.795
And in this lecture, we're gonna
Style the Blog Excerpt with CSS.

4
00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:15.265
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.600
Hey, hey, welcome back.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.280
Okay.
So, what we're gonna do here is style this

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.510
blog page that we coded
in the last lecture.

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.710
Let's make it look good.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.240
Make it look like this.

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.490
Let's do it.
Jump into your code editor, into your CSS,

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.770
that is custom dot CSS.

12
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.020
Right here under your styles,
your layout styles,

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.880
you should see your footer styles here.

14
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.930
We're going to add a comment here, and
this is going to be the blog styles.

15
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.710
And right under here,
this is where we're gonna style

16
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.020
our blog excerpts and
the rest of our blog once we get to it.

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.485
So, let's start off by saying,
post, I wanna style the post, and

18
00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.375
eventually we're gonna
add a couple things here.

19
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.425
We're gonna add a class and an ID for
our widgets and our comments.

20
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:06.489
But right now,
we're just gonna style the post.

21
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:12.235
Position relative, border solid one pixel,

22
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:17.630
triple D, and then the background
will be white for the posts.

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.790
Margin zero, zero 40, and then we're
going to add some border radius,

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.440
webkit, border radius.

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.620
We're going to say four pixels, and

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.850
then we're going to have to
add the moz border radius.

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.210
Four pixels as well,
and then border radius.

28
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.570
So we can make sure we're
covered on all fronts.

29
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.990
Give that a Save.

30
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.700
Let's give that a little look here,
see what that looks like.

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.480
Cool.

32
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.030
It's looking better.

33
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.270
Let's keep going.

34
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.830
Now we're gonna select
the header within post.

35
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.810
And also, we're going to select
a couple of other things.

36
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050
Oops, here we go.

37
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.480
Post and then post excerpt.

38
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.020
There we go, and we're going to
give that padding 20 pixels.

39
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.550
Again, here,
we're going to tack on a couple more

40
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.030
selectors once we get into
a couple future lectures.

41
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.429
But right now,
let's just stick with these.

42
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.020
Save it, check it out.

43
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.070
All right.
We're given some padding here, looks good.

44
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.650
After that, let's style the post header.

45
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.090
Level three, heading, margin,
we're going to give that zero, zero, 15.

46
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.200
That's 15 pixels on the bottom,
zero everywhere else.

47
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.300
Padding, same deal, zero, zero, 15.

48
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.264
Border bottom will be solid 1 pixel,
triple D.

49
00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:49.982
And while we're here, why don't we just
style the post, header level one heading,

50
00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:54.570
margin zero, zero, 15,
padding zero, zero, 15.

51
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.210
Pretty much the same.

52
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.300
Border, bottom, solid, one pixel,
triple D, and font size 24 pixels.

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.150
Now, some of you who may be a little
more advanced in CSS than some other

54
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.139
students might recognize that I did
something a little redundant here.

55
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.560
It's totally fine to leave this as is.

56
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.340
Nothing's gonna break.

57
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.560
However, there is a better way to
code these two sections right here.

58
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.500
Maybe some of you know what it is,
maybe some of you don't, but either way,

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.030
I'm gonna show you.

60
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.800
Do you notice that the margin padding and
border for the H3 and H1 are identical?

61
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.630
So I just coded this twice.

62
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.030
Basically, what I could have done here and
what I will do is just add the post

63
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.180
header, level one heading and
the post header H3.

64
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.910
Give it those styles.

65
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.170
And then,
I'm going to specifically style the H1.

66
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.280
I'm going to remove these and
say font size 24 pixels.

67
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.630
So I don't have to write this out twice.

68
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.060
These have the same styles.

69
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.990
H1 just has a little additional style.

70
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.600
I don't need to see,
code the same thing over and over again.

71
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.510
There we go.

72
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.488
Kudos to you if you notice that.

73
00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:07.670
All right.

74
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.800
Save that, and let's just have a look.

75
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.648
There we go, looking better,
looking better.

76
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.850
Now the level one heading
doesn't appear yet.

77
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.230
That's going to be in the future
lecture where we code

78
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.010
the full blog post, but it's there and
now I don't have to deal with it.

79
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.700
Post image,
we want that to be height auto.

80
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.030
Once we get in to WordPress,
we're going to be using

81
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.800
a skeleton WordPress theme, that we're
going to build our theme on top of.

82
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.170
And there are a couple of styles in
there that conflict with our styles.

83
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.170
So I'm just putting this here, so we don't
lose it or forget about it in the future.

84
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.250
Basically, we need to
set the height to auto.

85
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.040
Because sometimes WordPress,
the styles that this theme we're gonna use

86
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.540
to build our theme on top of, it will
set a height on those features images.

87
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.520
And it kinda makes our images look
weird when we resize our browser.

88
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.652
So long story short, add this and
you won't have a headache later.

89
00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:17.840
Post-details font-size 12,

90
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.764
we want that to be small,
and the width to be 90%.

91
00:05:21.764 --> 00:05:22.561
Why?

92
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:25.241
Check it out.

93
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.220
Here we go, we're getting there.

94
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.430
You can see the font size for
the post details here.

95
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.810
It's smaller.

96
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.490
The 168 is over here and that's gonna
turn into the comment bubble over here.

97
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.710
The reason why we made this 90% is because
we want space for the comment bubble.

98
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.910
Let's get back in there.

99
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.480
All right, at this point I just
wanna hold up for a second.

100
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.720
I just realized something.

101
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.690
I led you a little bit astray
back here in our blog at HTML.

102
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.930
I apologize if I confused you
because I realize that I used

103
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.780
span tags and the class glif icon and

104
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.800
glif icon user time folder,
whatever I used and

105
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.650
you might have been confused because
we haven't done this at all so far.

106
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.520
And the reason why it's habit,
because I use glyphicons all the time.

107
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.593
And they're the fonticons, but
they're called fontawesome now and

108
00:06:20.593 --> 00:06:21.780
the version is new.

109
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.930
And the version that
we're using in Bootstrap

110
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.620
to WordPress is the latest one at
the time of the recording of this video.

111
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.180
And so,
I'm using an even older version here.

112
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.040
So basically, what we need to do,
it's very simple,

113
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.718
change those spans to i tags and
then glyph icon to f a.

114
00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:49.640
So f a fa-user.

115
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.810
Go ahead and change all those instances,
and there should only be a few.

116
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.130
Go ahead and do that.

117
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.670
Shouldn't take you very long at all.

118
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.090
And don't worry, we haven't done it at all
throughout the home page, so you don't

119
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.340
need to go back and try and fix anything
there because we're good over there.

120
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.830
Okay.
So

121
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.286
looks like we already have one down here.

122
00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:21.820
Fa fa, itags, okay.

123
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.530
Save that.

124
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.400
Now, what you need to do is take that
first post, this post that you just edited

125
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.350
copy that and
remove these other ones because they have

126
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.700
the cliff icon markup and

127
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.500
just paste that two more times and
now you should be good.

128
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.020
Paste that, there you go.

129
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.980
So the icons are there we're using
the correct icons and we're good.

130
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.040
So, now let's go back to our CSS.

131
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.540
Continue from where we left
off here under post details.

132
00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:00.493
Now, we can select post details and
then i.fa.

133
00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:04.830
That selects the i with a class of fa.

134
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.860
Padding left ten pixels.

135
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.903
Okay, now we want to select post details,
I.fa,

136
00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:18.140
and first-child.

137
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.510
So, what this psuedo-selector will
do here is select the first i class,

138
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.910
i with a class of fa in the post details.

139
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.060
So, there are three or four or five, even.

140
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.610
It doesn't matter how many there are,

141
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.980
but this will select only the first one,
allowing us to style that one.

142
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.830
Giving it padding, zero, because we don't
want padding left on the first child.

143
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.470
Save it.
Check it out.

144
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.730
Cool.
We spaced these out a little bit.

145
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.170
I also just realized that
this time icon isn't working.

146
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.700
Let's go back and just double check.

147
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.590
See what's missing.

148
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.380
Scroll up to your first post.

149
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.320
So, I class fa fa time.

150
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.680
So, I'm assuming there is no time icon,
and it's something different.

151
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.490
I actually do know it off by heart,
it is fa clock dash zero.

152
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.820
Save it, check it out.

153
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.330
There we go.

154
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.020
So just make sure to
add it to other posts.

155
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.860
FA clock O instead of time.

156
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.090
This is the beauty of once we start
using WordPress because instead of

157
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.870
editing each of those posts that we added,
we'd only have to edit one, and

158
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.380
every single one through the entire
website will be updated.

159
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.970
That's the amazing part.

160
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.610
Save it.

161
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.615
Now, I think you're good.

162
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:35.450
Okay.

163
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.420
Let's get back to our CSS.

164
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.160
That's what this lecture
is all about after all.

165
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:47.850
Now, let's style that comment bubble.

166
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.590
Right here is where we are going
to reserve the section for

167
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.980
styling the comments
within our blog posts, but

168
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.380
we also can style our post-comments-badge.

169
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.624
We want that to be
a circle in the top right,

170
00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:11.476
so height 70px, width 70px,
position absolute,

171
00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:16.749
top 25px, right 20px, border none.

172
00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:23.517
And we want some webkit-border-radius
that will be 100%,

173
00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:27.456
moz-border-radius 100%, and

174
00:10:27.456 --> 00:10:32.509
border-radius 100% covering all fronts.

175
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.880
And we're going to make this background
green which will be the 79b044.

176
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.150
And text line center.

177
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.080
And then display table.

178
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.561
I'm hoping you know what comes next.

179
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:52.058
Post comments badge A.

180
00:10:52.058 --> 00:10:56.088
We're selecting the comment
within the post comments badge.

181
00:10:56.088 --> 00:11:00.643
Display table-cell now that means we
can vertically align it in the middle.

182
00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:05.503
Meaning, it will always be vertically
centered no matter how large the comments

183
00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:07.895
badge and no matter how large the text.

184
00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:11.255
Color white, font size 20 pixels,

185
00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:15.673
line height 20 pixels,
save it, check it out.

186
00:11:15.673 --> 00:11:18.430
There is our comments badge.

187
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:23.920
One thing I wanna do is make
this icon display block.

188
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.685
So we're gonna go here and
say post-comments-badge i.fa

189
00:11:30.685 --> 00:11:36.490
display block, font-size 15,
just a little bit larger,

190
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.820
adding 0, margin-bottom 4 pixels
just to space it out a little bit.

191
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.365
And then,
why don't we just add another style here,

192
00:11:46.365 --> 00:11:50.511
comments-badge:hover, background color.

193
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.166
And we're gonna make it a little
bit darker but green 8bc653.

194
00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:58.548
Save that.

195
00:11:58.548 --> 00:12:03.250
There it is, hover over that.

196
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.970
Looks good.
It's actually a lighter green,

197
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.470
I apologize.

198
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.520
I said a darker green, but
it's actually a lighter green.

199
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.690
So, there are the excerpts.

200
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.370
Now, there's a couple things we
forgot to style our header here,

201
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.080
why don't we go ahead and do that?

202
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:21.070
So scroll up to your layout section,
way, way, way up here.

203
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.010
Here it is.

204
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:29.095
And let's position these
styles just under section H3.

205
00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:31.423
Right there.

206
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.790
It could really be anywhere in
the section or anywhere in the CSS, but

207
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:41.250
I like organizing it based on
where it will be easiest to find.

208
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:47.964
So we're gonna select feature image and
display table width 100%.

209
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.070
And then feature image default,
so we're gonna have

210
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.821
a few feature image fallbacks,
background URL,

211
00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:04.607
dot dot slash image,
stuff dash feature.jpg, no repeat.

212
00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:12.245
Background size cover and
we also have another feature image.

213
00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:18.190
.feature-image-default-alt is the one
we're using on this page specifically.

214
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.701
This one is called hipster-stuff.jpg,
background-size: cover;.

215
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:33.060
Okay, now in here, right after this
feature image H1, display table cell.

216
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.390
You see how we're using
this trick now a lot?

217
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.500
Middle.
So, now, we vertically aligned that text,

218
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.230
so that H1 could be any size
based on the page you add.

219
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.580
And we want it to always be in
the center now matter what.

220
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.560
And this is how you do it.

221
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.950
Text line, center, and then color white.

222
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:49.850
Okay, check it out.

223
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.330
Boom.
That's beautiful and

224
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.250
I think that if we scroll we
should have a paralux background.

225
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.190
There we go.

226
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.900
And it scrolls at a fast speed
because we made data speed 2.

227
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.840
See how it scrolls quite fast.

228
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.710
There it is.

229
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.570
This little thing here I noticed,

230
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.970
we need some margin here
at the top of our excerpt.

231
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.780
I know what that is if we
head back to our HTML,

232
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.180
we need to, up here,
I think we already added it.

233
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.240
We have div with the class of rho,
here it is, and ID primary.

234
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.430
We need to style
the primary ID in our CSS.

235
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.520
So head back to CSS, and we're in the
right section, so let's go under our H3.

236
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.260
Section H3 again and style primary.

237
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.384
That's going to have padding-top: 40px and

238
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.650
padding-bottom: 40px.

239
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.270
Now check it out.

240
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.570
There we go.

241
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.860
Padding top 40 and padding bottom 40,
plus a little bit because of this element.

242
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.290
Thought I was going to
let you off that easy?

243
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.380
Yeah, right.

244
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.145
One more thing that I
messed up in this lecture.

245
00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:02.951
Right here.

246
00:15:02.951 --> 00:15:06.160
I-Class FA folder.

247
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.070
What it used to be was folder open alt.

248
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.040
That is wrong.

249
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.670
Change that to FA folder.

250
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.370
Make sure to change all those instances.

251
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.410
Now, your font awesome icons will be
perfect and won't be missing any.

252
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.610
And that is styling our articles,

253
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.340
our excerpts right here, and
we're gonna move on to the next lecture.

254
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.330
We're gonna add some widgets and
style those up, and

255
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.890
then we're on to the next section.

256
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.719
See you there.
