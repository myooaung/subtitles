00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.960
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.670
This lecture is called the final, and

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.830
might I add, very beautiful, WordPress
website you're gonna be building.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.315
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:22.140
So this is the final WordPress website.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.020
This is fully coded, fully designed,
everything is implemented.

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.520
Exactly what you see on the screen
is what you're gonna be

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.830
building throughout the entire course.

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.060
So you're actually gonna
be able to build this.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.112
So this is the homepage.

12
00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:37.612
Right here, we have a nice big
header graphic here with some

13
00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:41.392
cool design elements,
the title of the website,

14
00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:46.820
a few price tags, I guess you
can call them, a couple buttons.

15
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.270
This Subscribe button is gonna pop
down a modal window where you can

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.400
subscribe to the mailing list,
and get a discount,

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.560
or whatever it is that you'd
want to send your subscribers.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.610
And then we have just a few sections here.

19
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.514
All of these,
this looks just like normal text, but

20
00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:08.820
this is all fully implemented
in the WordPress back-end.

21
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.560
And I'll show you that momentarily.

22
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.499
So this is all easily editable by
the WordPress content management system,

23
00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.666
all of this text here,
plus the graphics, some more fun stuff,

24
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.773
cool parallax effect in
the background there.

25
00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.582
As you could see,
we're gonna be building that as well.

26
00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:34.403
Just a big picture of me looking funny,
and

27
00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:40.300
some testimonials right
here that are also dynamic.

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380
And you can add them
individually using WordPress.

29
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.100
So you can have as many
testimonials as you want.

30
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.461
And at the bottom, we have a big,
nice, sexy call to action with, again,

31
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:52.987
a parallax background and

32
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:57.260
a button that will take you to
wherever you want that to go.

33
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.910
We have a Blog section, which is

34
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.580
the strength of WordPress,
the blogging platform.

35
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.708
So here, we have our custom designed and
developed blog with our excerpts.

36
00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:12.310
As you could see here,
I only have a couple.

37
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.330
Again, these are actual blog
posts with random texts,

38
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.400
but it's actually added using WordPress.

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.320
If you click on the Posts,

40
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.050
you'll go into the full post, and
then there's comments at the bottom.

41
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.320
These are actual WordPress comments.

42
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.550
You can click on these, reply,
you can leave a reply down at the bottom.

43
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:38.609
You can also click on the individual
categories or tags, and that will take you

44
00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.310
to the category or tag template, again,
which you're going to be coding.

45
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.340
So this is the coding category.

46
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580
It shows you the posts under coding.

47
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.850
If I were to click on a tag,
like WordPress tutorial,

48
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.910
it will take me to the WordPress
tutorial template.

49
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.730
Showing me the individual blog posts
tagged with WordPress tutorial.

50
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.742
Resources, this is just a page,
an inside page for this website.

51
00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:13.232
And we're just displaying the resources
that you could find useful.

52
00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:17.010
Obviously, I'm putting the ones that
I find useful and they're also just

53
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.910
kind of examples, but they are incredibly
useful, JustHost, Coda, and Dropbox.

54
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.090
But that's beside the point,
these are dynamic, and

55
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.660
are editable, and addable,
if that's even a word, via WordPress.

56
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.890
Again, I'll show you in a little bit.

57
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.940
And then we have a Contact
page with a contact form,

58
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.260
very simple, but very useful.

59
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.840
And you can add your information here,
click Get in touch, and

60
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.600
you'll send an email.

61
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.230
So let's take a little look at
the back-end of the website.

62
00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.211
Here is our WordPress dashboard, comes
with the WordPress software for free.

63
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:04.610
And here is our sidebar with
all the information and

64
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.270
stuff that we can add and
edit to the website.

65
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.160
So we have our Posts,
that's if we wanna add blog posts.

66
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.750
Media, that's if you're adding pictures
and images in your blog posts and such.

67
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.175
Pages, this would be like the Resources or
Contact page.

68
00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:25.225
Or for example, the home and

69
00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:28.935
blog page as well, which we'll dive
into when we get into the course.

70
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.395
Comments, you can manage your comments.

71
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:34.825
Testimonials, this is a custom
post that we are going to

72
00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:36.395
add to our WordPress dashboard.

73
00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:38.405
So this doesn't come
natively with WordPress.

74
00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:39.929
We added this ourselves.

75
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.900
So we can add a testimonial, and you could
see here, these are the testimonials.

76
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.560
If I click in here,
I could see the testimonial title,

77
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.290
the information,
like the actual quote itself, and

78
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.060
the featured image with the graphic
of the person, or the headshot.

79
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.990
So that's Testimonials.

80
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.770
Resources, same thing,
we can add individual resources and

81
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.590
they will all pull in dynamically
on our Resources page.

82
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.360
Here we have Dropbox, Coda address host.

83
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.396
This is what it looks like when you go in.

84
00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:12.830
We have the title of the resource,
we have the little blurb, and down here,

85
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.460
we have the button text and the link
that we want the resource to link to.

86
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.540
And that all dynamically generates,
same with our feature image over here.

87
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.170
Course Features, this is on the homepage
where we have the little course

88
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.570
features that tells you about what's so
great about this specific course.

89
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.020
Obviously, this is an example website and

90
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.910
I'm basically building the course website
and you're gonna be building it as well.

91
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:48.140
But you can use these tricks and
these tips to build your own website,

92
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.490
so that you can add your own custom
sidebars, and everything like that.

93
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.140
So these are just examples.

94
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.020
Accessible content on your mobile devices,
so

95
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.940
you could see here,
it just has room for a text field.

96
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.820
So one of the features, and course feature
icons, choose the icon you'd like to

97
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.830
display, so device, instructor, calendar,
watch, computer, and so on and so forth.

98
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.010
This is all custom
developed in the WordPress.

99
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.420
And this chooses the icon that
will display above the feature,

100
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.910
really super cool.

101
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.000
Contact, this is our contact form.

102
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.350
We're using the Contact Form 7 plugin,

103
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.860
which we will get into a little
further in the course.

104
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.638
Appearance, Here is our custom theme,

105
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.590
the Bootstrap to WordPress
theme that we will build.

106
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.250
And you can utilize
the WordPress customize feature.

107
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.125
And you could basically edit
your site title and tagline,

108
00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.830
which will show up right here.

109
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.830
The logo, so this logo up here,
you can change that logo.

110
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.450
And these other things don't necessarily
work because we have pretty dynamic

111
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.320
backgrounds.

112
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.688
We have different textures and stuff, so
these don't really matter for this course.

113
00:06:58.688 --> 00:07:04.470
Navigation, we could choose the menus for
our primary menu, which is up here.

114
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.860
And at the very bottom,
we have a footer menu down here.

115
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.160
And so we'll get into how to use the menus
and stuff in the course as well.

116
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.480
Widgets and all that sort of stuff,
we'll also get into later.

117
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.417
So that is our full WordPress website,
and we're utilizing really,

118
00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:27.354
really cool features like custom fields,
custom post types.

119
00:07:27.354 --> 00:07:32.880
We're dynamically generating testimonials
and resources, our blog posts.

120
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.900
It's really, really cool, and

121
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.140
you can pretty much build anything
that you want knowing these skills.

122
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.800
Any website with certain
specific functionalities,

123
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.090
you could build that with WordPress.

124
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.180
That's how powerful it is, and
that's why I wanna teach you this course.

125
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.100
Also, I'm very excited about it.

126
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.130
So why don't we jump into
the next lecture, and

127
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.919
see where we can go from there?

128
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.030
