00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.230
Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.726
My name is Brad Hussey and

3
00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:08.445
we're about to code a section
that includes my face as Elvis.

4
00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:16.583
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.620
All right, and now we're gonna code
the big, sexy instructor section.

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.988
And by big, sexy instructor, I mean huh?

7
00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:25.837
No?

8
00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:27.530
Okay.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.750
This section, it's quite nice.

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.940
And there's a few things
here that are cool.

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.650
Just some typographic elements,
like a header

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.090
with some small text,
kind of within that header, we

13
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.500
have some leading text just some general
content here, a big background image.

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.680
This isn't just an image it's
actually a background image.

15
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.370
You have some numbers here and
these are CSS3 circles.

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.450
We'll be jumping into that
in the following lecture but

17
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.250
first let's get ourselves
going with this HTML.

18
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.750
Jump into your code editor and in your
index file, scroll down to the instructor

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.290
section and that's where we're
gonna be adding some major markup.

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.314
Here we go, id instructor, whoops.

21
00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:21.280
All right, and then we're gonna
add a container class div here.

22
00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:27.583
And between there we'll add a row.

23
00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:39.564
And then in between there we'll
add a column small eight.

24
00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:47.694
And we're actually gonna add
some additional classes here so

25
00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:51.660
I can show you a little bit more of
the power of Bootstrap's grid system.

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.980
But right now,
let's just start with small eight, and

27
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.820
then I'll show you why we're going to need
to add some additional classes there.

28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.800
So it gets a little bit trickier.

29
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.310
And you can see that there's more
useful ways you can use that.

30
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.990
But let's continue first,
and then we'll get there.

31
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.110
And this is a row.

32
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.810
And then in between row we're
going to add another column.

33
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.090
And that's going to be call large eight,

34
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.390
and I'll show you why in a moment,
h2, Your Instructor.

35
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.350
And then a small tag.

36
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.793
Brad Hussey.

37
00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:28.750
All right.

38
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.960
And then after the eight,
we want a col-lg-4,

39
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.580
because we obviously want
this to equate or equal 12.

40
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:46.050
So this will be four, and our large
four column will have a tag href.

41
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.105
And that's gonna be my Twitter,

42
00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:56.250
https://twitter.com/bradhussey.

43
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.610
And we're gonna open that in a new window.

44
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.910
And then we're gonna add some classes
here, badge, social, and twitter.

45
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.080
And we'll get to those
classes in the next lecture.

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.880
And in between this a tag, we're gonna
have an i tag with a class of fa for

47
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.714
font awesome and fa-twitter.

48
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.470
And that should give us
the Twitter logo in a font.

49
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.260
So, copy that.

50
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.188
And we're just gonna paste
that again two more times, and

51
00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:28.814
just change a few of these attributes and
the values.

52
00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:32.862
This will be facebook.com/bradhussey.

53
00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:37.710
And you could use your own links here.

54
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.160
But because this is what we're building,
we're just gonna use what I already have.

55
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.500
This will be Facebook.

56
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.090
And this will be Facebook.

57
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.550
All right?
And then the last one will be Google Plus.

58
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.040
So it's plus.tway.

59
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.668
Oh, sorry, google.com/+BradHussey and

60
00:03:56.668 --> 00:04:02.242
that would be badge social
gplus is what the class we're

61
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:07.480
going to give it and
this will be fa-google-plus.

62
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.150
All right save that and
let's just give that a little look see.

63
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.890
What've we got here?

64
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.390
So very simple.

65
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.170
Not very much here.

66
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.020
So your instructor.

67
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.670
We got some icons here.

68
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.780
Clearly they're not the way that
they're so supposed to be styled but

69
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.050
we'll get there.

70
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.300
And we have our columns.

71
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.580
So let me just explain
a little something here.

72
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.010
Why do we have a row and then another
column, and then inside that column,

73
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.520
we have a row, and then more columns.

74
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.997
So we actually are gonna have initially,
we're gonna have a col-sm-8,

75
00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:40.780
so we want it to have space on
the right side for the instructors.

76
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.460
So over here, this is our col-sm-8, and
we want to have this much space over here.

77
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.610
So we can see our instructor.

78
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.120
Actually I think the column small
eight is a little bit bigger here.

79
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.940
And let me just inspect element.

80
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.266
Here's our instructor,
section, container, right?

81
00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.354
Row, and
then inside of row we have our col-sm-8.

82
00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:08.282
You'll see that there's also
something here called col-md-6,

83
00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:09.710
which is col medium six.

84
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.130
And that's because,

85
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.530
when you shrink your window size,
when you're on smaller screens, so here.

86
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.955
It'll go to a col-sm-8.

87
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.940
And then, it will eventually go full
width here, like it's usually does.

88
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.215
But, when you add an extra class,

89
00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:37.520
col-sm-8, and then add here col-md-6.

90
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.600
That basically says when you're on
small screens give it an eight column,

91
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.610
when you're on medium
screens give it a six column.

92
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.590
You can also add a col large something.

93
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.170
And if you want large screens you
have a specific grid width and

94
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.486
then medium and then small.

95
00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.220
So the reason why I do that is because
we want to be able to have that text

96
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.570
not be so shrinked.

97
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.660
So if I kept this as col-sm-8 and
then I shrunk it,

98
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.330
it wouldn't have the same layout.

99
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.290
I want it to be able to grow
a little bit as I shrink.

100
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.690
So, you could see here.

101
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.820
It maintains that size.

102
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.920
If I were to do something here,
let me just show you as an example.

103
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.730
So it's not too confusing.

104
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm just gonna, in the final
site I'm gonna get rid of that.

105
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.410
So here this is actually
an eight column grid.

106
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.795
You could see that it's wider than.

107
00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:32.390
Let's go to the WordPress version and
you can see it's wider and

108
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.460
we don't necessarily want that
because it's just too wide.

109
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.300
I wanted it smaller.

110
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.050
It looked nicer.

111
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.600
And then here,
it starts getting in the way,

112
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.200
crossing over with the background
image and it doesn't look as good.

113
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.090
Here is fine.

114
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.500
So when you add col-md-6, let me
just go back to the full width here,

115
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.020
medium screen sizes and
larger will have a six column, so

116
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.130
this is actually half six, and
then this is six over here,

117
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.601
and then when you get smaller,
it jumps into an eight column grid.

118
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.370
So that you can actually, there you go.

119
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.910
There's your eight column grid, rather
than six, which would be this wide, so

120
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.560
it would be too small, and the text would
be all bunched up in this little box.

121
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.400
So, that's why we're doing that.

122
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.550
So, then, add your column medium six.

123
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.464
Okay, and now in this big mess of
HTML code here, after your row,

124
00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:38.730
within your col-sm-8,
we wanna add some content.

125
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.500
And the bio should be in the copy deck.

126
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.130
And we're gonna start off with
a paragraph with a class of lead.

127
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.110
And then we will just
start adding our text.

128
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.206
You don't have to obviously, I am not
going to just type it all out because

129
00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:57.038
that'll take too long and it's pointless.

130
00:07:57.038 --> 00:08:01.520
I am just going to paste all the rest of
the content and in the copy deck you could

131
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.280
be able to do that, add your paragraph
tags and then the content here.

132
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.400
You kind of have free reign there.

133
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.612
After the last paragraph tag,
add a horizontal rule.

134
00:08:11.612 --> 00:08:17.966
And then, an h3,
the numbers in a small tag.

135
00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:21.760
They don't lie.

136
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.870
All right, I'm gonna tab this in here.

137
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.140
Because it's not fully tabbed in.

138
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.640
There we go.

139
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.830
I believe I got this correct.

140
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.580
Now down here,
there should be another after the h3.

141
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.200
We want to add another row.

142
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.530
You can nest columns within columns
as long as you open it up with a row.

143
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.310
That's important because columns,
the class of column, small whatever or

144
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.790
a large whatever, they have left margin,
and the row has negative left margin so

145
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.530
it'll jut it over that 15 or
30 pixels, whatever it is.

146
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:11.320
And then here we're gonna add a col-xs for
extra small.

147
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.247
4, so this means that extra small screens
maintain the column, the grid base layout,

148
00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:20.920
other than just having it be full width,
and that's what's also cool about this.

149
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.823
We're gonna add a div
with the class of num.

150
00:09:29.162 --> 00:09:34.110
Inside there, we're gonna add a div

151
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.588
with the class of num-content.

152
00:09:43.429 --> 00:09:45.356
Then within there,
let's just add some numbers.

153
00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:49.656
41,000+, I believe at this point,

154
00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:54.430
I'm actually at about 48,000 students.

155
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.310
Now copy that column altogether.

156
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.630
Make some space there,
paste it again couple more times.

157
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.315
Just gonna change some stuff up here.

158
00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:12.642
So this will be 568 reviews, and

159
00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:19.496
this last one will be 8 courses.

160
00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:24.900
Okay, now, save that and you should
have all the content for this section.

161
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:31.460
All right, it's getting there,
you can see, it's got the right idea.

162
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.250
Here's the final one, here's your version.

163
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.030
You got the text here.

164
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.720
You got the numbers.

165
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.270
You got the hr.

166
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.710
Very kind of light there.

167
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.090
Can't really see it.

168
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.310
And you got our text.

169
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.280
Now we're gonna jump in and
just do, let's see.

170
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.473
Let's add our background white and
me, Elvis.

171
00:10:50.473 --> 00:10:52.281
Because I'm Elvis.

172
00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:53.745
Go to your CSS.

173
00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:59.210
Under your featurette section,
select the instructor ID.

174
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:08.078
And give it the background of white and
URL of ../img/brad-elvis.

175
00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:11.220
That picture is in there.

176
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.180
.png.

177
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.921
And we're going 90%.

178
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:24.190
And negative 10 pixels will be
the position of this background.

179
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.920
And I'll show you why.

180
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.690
Save it.

181
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.190
Check it out.

182
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.330
Here I am.

183
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.040
All in there, it looks good.

184
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.540
Perfect.

185
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.630
But, what's with the 90% and the 10?

186
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.140
Well let's just go 0 and 0 for top left.

187
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.780
What happens?

188
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.450
Well that's not right.

189
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.530
I want to be over here.

190
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.370
So what if I said 100% for fully right.

191
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.830
Okay, well that's okay.

192
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.620
But what if I wanted myself a little bit
closer in, I'm a little bit separated from

193
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.800
the content here, so 90%, that brings
me in a little bit towards the left.

194
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.762
There I am, looks good.

195
00:11:59.762 --> 00:12:03.406
And now 0,

196
00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:08.080
it just means top, but
I want to be just a little further up.

197
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.840
Trim off some of the top here.

198
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.420
There we go, just ten pixels up.

199
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.860
And there it is.

200
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.770
There's our content and
all that sort of stuff.

201
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.880
Now what we'll probably do is leave
the lecture at this because that was quite

202
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.930
a bit and
we're gonna jump into the next lecture.

203
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.680
We're gonna do some CSS, we're gonna
style up these icons and these circles.

204
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.740
And a few other things.

205
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.389
See you there.

206
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:37.759
