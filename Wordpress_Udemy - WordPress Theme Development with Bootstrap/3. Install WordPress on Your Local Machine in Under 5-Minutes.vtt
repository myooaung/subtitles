00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.637
Hey, welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.912
And in this lecture we're gonna
install WordPress in five minutes.

3
00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:14.290
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.420
All right, and we're back.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.600
Here we are on my desktop.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.490
And in the previous lecture,
we downloaded WordPress.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.277
I was referring to WordPress 4.0.

8
00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:24.726
But WordPress 4.0.1 is out and

9
00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:30.281
if you haven't already downloaded
4.0.1 then go ahead and download that.

10
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:34.327
Make sure you have the same version as
me cuz we're gonna be using 4.0.1 now.

11
00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:38.333
All right, then you'll have
this zip folder here, 4.0.1.

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.060
If you unzip it, you'll get a generic
WordPress folder that looks like this.

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.370
Just WordPress.

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.790
In there you'll have all the WordPress
files, everything in here, the files and

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.880
the folders.

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.850
Looks intimidating at first, but
that's why you're taking this course,

17
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
to let me ease the pain and show you
that this isn't that big of a deal, and

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.490
you will welcome this
chaos into your life.

19
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.650
Just kidding.

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.885
Or I'm not.

21
00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:04.887
All right, so let's go ahead and

22
00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:09.189
change the name of that folder to
something easy to remember like b2w.

23
00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.750
And what we're gonna be
using is a local server.

24
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.010
We need to have something to
manage the website locally.

25
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.490
Because it's PHP,
we need to have a local server.

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.440
And for those of you that don't
already have something installed,

27
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.870
I recommend installing MAMP for both you
PC and MAC users, you can install MAMP.

28
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.910
Just go to mamp.com I believe it is,
or just google MAMP.

29
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.590
For those of you who are using a different
server, if you're comfortable with it and

30
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.720
you know how to manage databases and
everything like that, great.

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.100
Otherwise, I would say ditch what
you're used to using and use MAMP.

32
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.920
Just because I'm going to be instructing
with it and I want to make sure we're all

33
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.910
on the same page here to
eliminate any margin of error.

34
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.220
Hopefully that makes sense.

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.220
Download MAMP.

36
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.130
Here we are.

37
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.478
We need to change the document
root right here to b2w or

38
00:01:56.478 --> 00:02:01.040
whatever you've called
your WordPress folder.

39
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.650
And you hit OK.

40
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.940
Those servers should get hot and
ready here.

41
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.080
Great.
They're all good to go.

42
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.309
Now, I should be able to go
to my localhost port 8888.

43
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.530
Okay, so it's gonna ask me for
my language but

44
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.990
then it's gonna say hey,
we need some database info.

45
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.440
Great.
This is where we're gonna start doing our

46
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.860
timer to see if it's
possible to do the famous

47
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.140
WordPress five minute install
in five minutes or less.

48
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.790
Keep in mind because I'm talking,

49
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.510
it might take a little bit
longer than five minutes.

50
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.840
I can do this by myself in
maybe a minute to two minutes.

51
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.870
But because I wanna instruct you and
kinda give you some value here, something

52
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.140
that you can digest and remember, it
might take a bit more than five minutes.

53
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.880
But let's see what we can do.

54
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.340
I'm gonna set up this timer here for
five minutes.

55
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.770
Once we hit Go, here we go.

56
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.862
Five minutes, here we go.

57
00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:56.990
All right, so we need to go to local
hosts port 8888/mamp because we

58
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.710
need to access our PHPMyAdmin,
which is right here under tools.

59
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.940
This will allow us to create and
edit our database information.

60
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.330
Here we are in PHPMyAdmin, click on New.

61
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.500
That will allow us to create a database.

62
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.120
Give it a name.

63
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.270
We're gonna call it
Bootstrap to WordPress.

64
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.830
Hit Create and then there is
your database shell right here.

65
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.940
Click on that.

66
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.730
And now we need to add a user.

67
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.085
It needs to have a user that's associated
with the database so that user can

68
00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:33.690
perform actions within that database,
like add new posts and blah, blah, blah.

69
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.940
Keep in mind this isn't
the same as the WordPress user.

70
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.160
This is just the database only.

71
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.740
Under Privileges,
you want to add a new user right here

72
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.210
and then right there, you're going to
add a user name, let's say bootman.

73
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.470
And this would be localhost.

74
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.510
User name could be anything.

75
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.880
And it could be more secure
if you'd like it to be.

76
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.180
Password.
Generate that.

77
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.144
Copy what they have here because
you're going to need it.

78
00:04:01.144 --> 00:04:03.980
And grant all privileges on
database Boot Strap to WordPress.

79
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.100
Great.
Don't do the global privileges or

80
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.660
these other two.

81
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.630
You should be good to go.

82
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.380
Hit Go down in the bottom right.

83
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.600
Boom.

84
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.130
So there we go.

85
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.280
We got our database and our database user.

86
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.270
Now, in our code editor,
open up your b2w folder in your

87
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.030
code editor, and WordPress config sample.

88
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.008
Open that up.

89
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:32.767
Database name needs to be your database
name, which is bootstrap2wordpress, great.

90
00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:36.150
Username, replace this with user name,
which is bootman.

91
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.080
Password, paste.

92
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.610
It's probably in your clipboard still.

93
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.050
That's the password that
the database generated for you.

94
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.830
And now we need to do the authentication
unique keys and salts.

95
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.980
Sounds crazy, really isn't.

96
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.460
Copy this URL that they
provide you right here.

97
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.270
Paste that in your browser and

98
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.880
it's gonna give you a uniquely generated,
randomly generated unique salts.

99
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.800
So go ahead and copy that.

100
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.283
Paste it in replacement of all of
these defaults, boom, there it is.

101
00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:09.999
Scroll down the last thing you may or
may not want to do is the table prefix,

102
00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.610
you can leave it as wp_.

103
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.599
But for security purposes, it's sometimes
better to change that to something a bit

104
00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.890
more secure because
WordPress defaults to wp.

105
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.230
Hackers know that your prefixes are wp so
therefore they have one little bit of

106
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.080
information about your database that
maybe you don't want them to know.

107
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.710
Change that if you'd like to
something random or whatever.

108
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.750
So I'm just gonna say db bs bs,
dbbs for database bootstrap.

109
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.250
Why not?

110
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.755
Okay.
I'm gonna save that and

111
00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:46.680
change the name from
wp-config-sample to wp-config.

112
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.500
There it is.

113
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.720
Go back to your local host.

114
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.570
Right, whoopsies.

115
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.010
Local host, port 8888.

116
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.040
All right.

117
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.450
Language is English.

118
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.160
Here we go.

119
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.590
So site title, Bootstrap to WordPress
with a capital P, remember that folks.

120
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.860
Username, create a username for
your WordPress.

121
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.440
So it could be admin, it could be
your name, something more secure.

122
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.980
Go ahead and do that.

123
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.800
I'm gonna say bootstrap_admin.

124
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.490
Add your password,

125
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.640
obviously I'm not gonna tell you mine,
you just need to know yours.

126
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.270
Good enough, obviously it's very weak.

127
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.920
And your email, go ahead and
put that in there and then for

128
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.840
now, don't allow the search engines to
index this site cuz they don't need to,

129
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.280
once it's live you can change that.

130
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.181
Install WordPress And let's log in.

131
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.304
So with your password or
username and password.

132
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:47.740
And here we are in
the WordPress dashboard.

133
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.470
The front end looks like just
the generic WordPress theme.

134
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.020
Blah, nothing like what
we're gonna create.

135
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.990
But, basically that's it.

136
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.100
We've installed WordPress.

137
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.070
And we did it in five minutes or less.

138
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.130
Here it is.

139
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.280
So we have 30 seconds to spare.

140
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.950
Maybe we could just do a song and dance.

141
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.330
Talk to each other about our feelings.

142
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.470
Or we can cut it short.

143
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.110
Move to the next lecture where we're
going to do even more awesome stuff.

144
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.740
Good job installing
WordPress in five minutes.

145
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.619
You're awesome.
See you there.

146
00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:16.371
