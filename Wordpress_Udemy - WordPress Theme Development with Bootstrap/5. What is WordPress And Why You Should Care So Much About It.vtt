Hey everybody.
Welcome back

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.480
to Bootstring come with
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.610
We're entering a brand new section now
called what you need to know about

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.130
WordPress.

5
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.115
And the following few lectures
are gonna be just about WordPress and

6
00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:11.483
what you need to know about it.

7
00:00:11.483 --> 00:00:15.389
This specific lecture is called What
is WordPress and Why You Should Care So

8
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.196
Much About It.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:24.373

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:25.300
All right.
WordPress.

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.980
What's the big deal with WordPress?

12
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.910
Well it is a free web software that you
can use to create websites or blogs,

13
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.550
essentially.

14
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.310
The core software is built and

15
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.050
maintained by hundreds of community
volunteer web developers.

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.690
And it is probably the most popular
content management system software ever.

17
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.580
And because of that,
it's widely documented.

18
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.000
So if you're ever building a WordPress
website and you run into a roadblock or

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.030
an issue, or you have a question,
you can't figure something out.

20
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.070
Just Google it.

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.890
Chances are, it's already been
answered hundreds of times.

22
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.350
That's what's really great about
developing WordPress websites.

23
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.820
If you ever run into an issue,
somebody's out there to help you.

24
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.755
Because everybody uses WordPress.

25
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:14.820
WordPress.org even claims
that over 60 million

26
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.250
people have used WordPress
to power their websites.

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.720
A few popular ones include The New Yorker,
Beyonce.com.

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.990
Smart Passive Income blog with Pat Flynn,
one of my favorites.

29
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.500
John Mayer.

30
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.610
Even I use WordPress to power my blog.

31
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.690
Also I exclusively use WordPress

32
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.690
when building custom CMS driven
websites for my clients.

33
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.920
So then to answer my question that
I asked, why should you care so

34
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.740
much about WordPress?

35
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.928
Well basically there are a few reasons.

36
00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:52.030
One, you're gonna need to learn
how to use it to take this course.

37
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.940
But two, it's easy.

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.040
It's actually easy to learn.

39
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.780
But the problem is there's a lot of steps,
and there are a lot of details, and

40
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.090
there are some prerequisites in
terms of your knowledge and skill.

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.710
You need to know some HTML, CSS and PHP.

42
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.150
Thankfully, you can learn
those things as well.

43
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.700
I'm assuming you already
know those things.

44
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.850
At least have a rudimentary
knowledge of them.

45
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.360
If you have any problems
with any of those languages

46
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.780
I do have courses on all of those.

47
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.290
PHP is one that will greatly help you.

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.430
And I do have a free course on that.

49
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.920
But like I said it's easy.

50
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.490
You just need somebody to
show you how to do it.

51
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.863
And once you know how to code a WordPress
website, your eyes will be open, and

52
00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.385
you can take it and run,
cuz then from there you can do so much.

53
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:45.660
You could create your own WordPress
websites, whether that's for

54
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.060
personal use or for commercial use, like,
say you have a graphic design business and

55
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.860
you've always outsourced to your websites,
to a web developer because you

56
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.515
don't know how to code or you don't
know how to make a WordPress website.

57
00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:04.803
Well once you know how to do that, once
you know how to code your own WordPress

58
00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:09.426
website, you could do that yourself and
therefore make yourself the thousands of

59
00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:13.040
dollars that you would have
had to pay a developer.

60
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.160
And that goes right back into your pocket.

61
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.450
So there's so many reasons why learning
to code WordPress websites is amazing.

62
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.190
It literally changed my career.

63
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.930
As soon as I learned how to use and
develop WordPress websites.

64
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.170
I was able to take on more clients.

65
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.400
I took on bigger budget projects.

66
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.230
My current clients took me more seriously
cause I was able to deliver something way

67
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.050
more robust and way more amazing rather
than just static HTML and CSS pages.

68
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.440
And they were so happy because they were
able to update the websites themselves

69
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.440
and that has also helped me because
I don't have to keep going back and

70
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.470
making little updates for
measly amounts of money.

71
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.005
So those are just a few reasons why you
should really care about WordPress, so

72
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:05.495
why don't we jump into the next lecture.

73
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.091
I wanna show you a couple ways that you
can actually make some money by knowing

74
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.674
how to code WordPress websites.

75
00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:14.559
See you there.
