Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.130
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.185
This lecture is called
Recommended Tools for Sketching and

4
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.138
Wireframing Your Website.

5
00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:18.298

6
00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:22.996
So there are a few tools out there that
can help you in terms of sketching or

7
00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.030
wireframing.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.320
You could go the pen and paper route,
and you can go the digital route.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.675
All you really need is just a piece of
paper and a pen or a pencil, but that's

10
00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:40.298
not necessarily the most professional or
inspirational way of wireframing.

11
00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:45.517
If you just handed a piece of loose
leaf paper, or napkin to your client

12
00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:51.555
with crayon, or just a Sharpie on it,
it might not be so professional.

13
00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:54.540
And you might not be able to
convey your ideas very well.

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.891
But if you presented a really nice
notebook with some really beautiful

15
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.777
sketches, that's much more professional.

16
00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:05.330
And it's more inspiring to work with,
it's more creative.

17
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.730
Even further,
if you wanted to have a digital

18
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.295
software where you can
create wireframes quickly,

19
00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:15.700
and its a software specifically
designed for wireframing, you could

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.640
create really nice looking wire-frames
that are actually fun to create.

21
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.050
So let me show you
a couple of the options.

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.040
If you like the idea of creating a
wireframe with just a pen and a notebook,

23
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.040
then I suggest checking out Gridbooks,
which is bradhussey.ca/gridbooks.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.840
Keep in mind, that's my affiliate link,
and if you do decide to purchase

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.650
a Gridbook with that link,
I'll get a small commission.

26
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.790
If you don't want to go that route,
totally fine,

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.100
you could just go to the gridbooks.com
website and bypass that altogether.

28
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.260
Gridbooks is basically the best way to
visualize and sketch digital ideas.

29
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.670
And they're beautiful, handmade
notebooks designed and crafted here

30
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.280
in Calgary, Alberta,
Canada where I'm currently residing.

31
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.328
I actually worked with these guys,

32
00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:13.940
Sajack & Farki,
the digital agency who creates Gridbooks.

33
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.040
I was their front-end
developer at one point, and

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
I got to work with them on
the Gridbooks website and everything.

35
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.050
We use Gridbooks everyday, and

36
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.380
I still use Gridbooks all the time
when I'm framing my websites.

37
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.550
I even use them just for note-taking.

38
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.840
They have a series of
different types of books.

39
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.800
They have the web books,
mobile books, banner books.

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.000
You can buy bundles, and
they're truly beautiful.

41
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.930
So for example, if you're just looking for
like a web grid and you want to wireframe

42
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.414
websites, the web books or
web pads are good options for you.

43
00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:49.280
You can go to the website,

44
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.880
you can go to the products, you could
check them out, they're gorgeous.

45
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.490
They're fun to draw with,
and take notes, and sketch.

46
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.490
They're specifically designed for
wireframing.

47
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.810
They use a 960 grid, so
you can actually sketch grids

48
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.520
with the dot grid that is
printed on the paper itself.

49
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.580
It's not just a piece of paper just for
taking notes,

50
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.480
it's specifically for
web designers working with grids.

51
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.130
That's what's so great about Gridbooks.

52
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.830
That's what sets them apart from, say, a
Moleskine, or just a traditional grid pad.

53
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.120
This is specifically meant for
websites, mobile websites.

54
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.985
You could see here, they have mobile
grids, specifically designed for

55
00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:37.220
wireframing and sketching for

56
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.729
iPhones, and
digital kind of handheld devices.

57
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.476
They even have banner grids if you're
doing banner ads and things like that.

58
00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.620
So I recommend Gridbooks.

59
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.670
I have a handful of Gridbooks
with me that I use all the time.

60
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.870
The other option is if you
wanted to go the digital route.

61
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.500
And I love this route as well.

62
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.610
In fact, I use both the pen and
paper route, and the digital route.

63
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.620
I like to start with paper, and
then bring it to the computer.

64
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.300
I suggest checking out OmniGraffle.

65
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.480
If you go to bradhussey.ca/omnigraffle,

66
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.600
that'll take you to
the OmniGraffle app in iTunes.

67
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.830
Keep in mind, this is for a Mac.

68
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.190
OmniGraffle is basically a whole
software that is designed for

69
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.858
page layouts, process charts,
wireframings, graphic design, diagrams.

70
00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:39.150
You could do a whole bunch
of stuff with it, but

71
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.930
I specifically use it for wireframing.

72
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.790
So here, I have OmniGraffle and

73
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.150
I've already created just a little
wireframe just to show you.

74
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.905
So here's OmniGraffle,
I have a title page here.

75
00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:57.850
I got a little site map, you can see
our website is gonna have a Home, Blog,

76
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.420
Resources, and Contact page.

77
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.580
You could see subpages within each page.

78
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.748
Here's a homepage
wireframe that I created.

79
00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:10.700
So you could see here I've got the page,
got some details over here with some notes

80
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.832
that would be good to show to the client,
or something like that.

81
00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:18.030
You could see our navigation bar, big hero
graphic with some pricing details and

82
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.528
a big button.

83
00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:23.810
An opt-in box, and
then just some sections so

84
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.090
you can see where,
how the page is gonna be laid out.

85
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.590
Continues on here, you could see
just some simple boxes and lines,

86
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.240
just kind of detailing what
the homepage will include.

87
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.950
And it takes us all the way
down here to the footer.

88
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:47.120
And so basically, that's just
a simple wireframe using OmniGraffle.

89
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.092
So I like both, I like using both
Gridbooks and OmniGraffle in tandem,

90
00:05:53.092 --> 00:05:56.600
so if you're looking to take it
a little bit more seriously,

91
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.060
I totally suggest checking out Gridbooks,
they ship worldwide.

92
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.240
And OmniGraffle, if you're using a Mac,
which is also awesome.

93
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.240
You can also just use piece of paper,
or you can use Photoshop,

94
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.150
if you have Photoshop as well.

95
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.160
So those are two super useful tools
when it comes to wireframing.

96
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.320
So in the next lecture, we're going
to actually jump into the project.

97
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.660
We're going to get started, and
kind of get our hands dirty.

98
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.750
We're gonna download
the Bootstrap framework, and

99
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.820
we're going to get our
project environment set up.

100
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.581
So see you there.

101
00:06:29.581 --> 00:06:31.360
