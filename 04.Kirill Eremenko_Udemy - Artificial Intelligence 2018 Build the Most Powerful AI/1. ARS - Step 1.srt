00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,770
Hello and welcome to the very first practical tutorial for this course and this is from this point that

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,670
we're going to build this very powerful but very simple model an artificial intelligence which I'm still

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,100
blown away to see the insane results it is able to perform.

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,410
I remind that this mall was made just recently.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,970
You know the research paper appeared in March in late March 2018 and it surpasses any other AI algorithm

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,910
that we've worked on in the year 2017.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,540
So it is a big deal.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,570
What we're about to implement and the double good news is that we don't need any library.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,130
You know it manages to beat the AI models we built on tend of flow or by torch.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,850
It's crazy it's just pure logic and that's why we will be able to implement it with only the non-pay

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,730
library.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,950
We will not need any sense of flow or pie torch or any sort of advanced AI framework we will just need

13
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,780
them by.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,620
You will see the results will be insane.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,260
All right.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,720
But let's start by installing an icon that's why right now I'm on Google.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,540
Let's dive here.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,010
Anaconda you can just type panic on that.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,800
Will get you the first link instead of the steak.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Here we go.

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,990
And on the cloud.

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,460
And now you just need to go here to download Anaconda.

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,240
And here we go now choose Anaconda for the system you're having.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,210
Windows Mac OS or Linux.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm a Mac OS so I'm going to write and make sure to download five 3.6 instead of pipe and 2.7.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,440
Right.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,600
So if you're ready let's click on download then we'll get the file and we will just install an icon

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,260
that will just take one or two minutes and then we'll be ready to start the implementation.

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,490
All right so two seconds left.

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,340
Here we go.

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,760
Perfect We have an account.

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,500
So now I'm going to jump to my downloads folder here it is.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,100
And here is the file I've just downloaded.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,650
Let's double click on it.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,780
Here you just need to click on continue continue continue continue.

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,220
You can read if you want and agree and install.

37
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,210
And there we go.

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,780
The installation is on its way.

39
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,410
We'll just take a few seconds or maybe one or two minutes but not more.

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,190
So while it's installing I can tell you a few words about Anaconda and I can do is basically a platform

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,820
that contains several IDs integrated development environments on which you can code and program anything

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,390
you want doesn't have to be any IDE can be you know some basic tools and deterministic tools but of

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,270
course on one of those frameworks and one of those ideas will build an AI.

44
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,330
And this idea will be spider as in every of our courses.

45
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,980
Spider is the best for me at least when you're beginning or when you need a nice interface because indeed

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,860
it's really like you're in a studio and you can visualize the data easily.

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,330
You can open some files from the file explorer you can debug easily.

48
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,340
Anyway it's a great tool to implement anything you want.

49
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,500
So we'll go for spider.

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,420
I'll show you Spider very soon.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,810
Here we go.

52
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,430
The installation is over.

53
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,920
You don't have to install Microsoft.

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,530
Yes code you can just click Continue close and you can choose to keep the file the downloading felt

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,450
or not perfect.

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:32,500
So now for those of you who are on Windows go at the bottom left of your monitor to go into the list

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,950
of program and find Anaconda.

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,100
For those of you who are on Linux you will find an icon then same in the list of programs.

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,540
And for those of you who are on Mac like me you just need to get applications and double click on this

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,820
anaconda Navigator.

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,840
It will open this whole Anaconda framework that contains several ideas.

62
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,170
I will show you the ideas.

63
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,230
Here they are.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,740
So Jupiter notebook is one ID.

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,670
One great idea actually if you want to combine you know programming and mathematics written in lasic

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,980
for example if you're writing a research paper that combines some code in math and you have spider as

67
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,230
I told you about you also have our studio if you want to code in are you can code in our any.

68
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,460
That's totally possible or some deep variables but I mostly use are for statistics.

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,270
And now as far as we are concerned we are going to work on spiders.

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,240
You just need to click on launch and there we go.

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,750
Spider is opening sending up main window and here you go.

72
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,730
Welcome to Spider.

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,600
This is the spider ID interface.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,200
So the first thing you need to understand when you open Spier is that you'll get this temporary tender

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,990
wife out and we will not be using that file at all.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,700
It's just a temporary felt like there has to be a fall in here.

77
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,550
That's the editor that a window which can combine File Explorer will you have all your files.

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,890
Variable Explorer which will contain all the variables you create and help which can give you some information

79
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,850
on the different objects and classes that you're using while building any I remind that for our age

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,190
I will not be using any library so we will probably not use the help but it's very helpful.

81
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,930
All right.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,650
And then this is the Council meaning that when we execute our code our code will be running inside this

83
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,140
console and will execute the training of the AI for what we're going to do.

84
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,620
Perfect.

85
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,520
So that spider and now the first thing we're going to do is go to falx poor and I'm going to go to my

86
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:49,780
desktop because in my desktop I created this 8:28 in folder that will contain all the code will be implementing

87
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,870
in this course.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Right now this folder is empty but it is this folder that will contain the file that we're about to

89
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,030
create and which will contain the whole artificial intelligence.

90
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,820
We will build in this course we will actually build several ones but we will start with the main one

91
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,780
that will contain the heart of the artificial intelligence following exactly this new research paper

92
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:20,160
that just came out in 2018 in March 2018 and then we'll connect the AI to the environment to train it

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,470
to accomplish what we want to do.

94
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll get to there soon.

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,320
But we will build the AI here and our file will be saved in this folder.

96
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,250
I.

97
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,120
So feel free to do the same.

98
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,020
And if that's the case you're ready to click on file at the top.

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,580
Click on new file.

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,050
This will be the pipe and file this will contain the AI implementations.

101
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,680
Now you can close that.

102
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,790
And now you can select all this delete then added Tyrel we're going to get to this implementation the

103
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,000
following title.

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,770
So you have to put a hash tag first because the title has to be in a comment hash tag.

105
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,040
And then let's just call it a 20:18.

106
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,490
All right.

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,680
We're going to build the AI 20:18 the most powerful AI 2018.

108
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,360
And actually I think it is the most powerful AI AI mole ever built because you're going to see how it

109
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,270
surpasses any score at least on the environment that we're going to try.

110
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,220
All right.

111
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,550
So that's the title.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
Let's just start with this and then we're going to save.

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:28,200
And we can just call it a r s because indeed the ideas we're going to build is called commented random

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,420
search.

115
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,820
So let's save that.

116
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,660
And here we go.

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,510
We are ready to start the Egmond and random search.

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,650
So we'll stop here for this to toile then in the next one hour introduce you to the environment.

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,540
I'll introduce you to the research paper Kiril explain the whole intuition behind it.

120
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,250
But since you know we're going to go back and forth jumping from the research paper into the code because

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,200
I want to show you exactly what we're coding with respect to the research paper.

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,410
I prefer to already introduce it to you so that we can already get familiar with it.

123
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,060
Perfect.

124
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,040
So I'll see you in the next tutorial.

125
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,830
And until then enjoy AI.
