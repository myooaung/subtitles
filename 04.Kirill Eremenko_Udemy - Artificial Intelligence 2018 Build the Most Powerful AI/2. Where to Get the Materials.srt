Hello and welcome back to the course on augmented random search in today's tutorial We quickly go and

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,500
have a look at where you can find the supplementary materials for this course.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,800
So if you open up your browser and go to Supertech science dot com slash a r s That's a superset of

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,150
science is one word dot com slash Erris you will find the page that is dedicated to specifically this

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,830
course.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:32,460
And here is where we have shared all of the supplementary materials for this training and that includes

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,950
all of the additional reading that we have listed for instance blog posts or articles or research papers

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,770
that are highly relevant to what we discuss and search intervals or that we found interesting and insightful.

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,250
And you can find all the links here.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,550
And also you will be able to find the code that we will be creating the practical side of the tutorials

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,240
so you will be coding along with that line and you'll be able to create that code yourself.

12
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:10,020
But if you'd like to download it and follow along that way or compared to your code maybe just make

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,080
adjustments to it.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,060
