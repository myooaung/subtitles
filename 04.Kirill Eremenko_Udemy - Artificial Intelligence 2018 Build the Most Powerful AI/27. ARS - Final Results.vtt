00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.880
Hello and welcome to the final tutorial of this course the ultimate tutorial where we're going to see

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.120
our results to help you to hopefully running across this field now that we're done with our various

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.350
implementation.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.550
So I'm super excited to have reached this point.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.220
And congratulations for those of you who reached this tutorial.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.480
This is now that we will enjoy watching the result.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.250
All right so first of all as you can notice I added a new found in our working directory for that which

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.740
is documentation that PTF and that contains Of course all the documentation you need to make this work.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.510
But you will see this is actually quite simple.

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.820
We won't have to install any frameworks such of flow or by torch we will only need to install of course

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.080
Jim and Pipelet because indeed we have to import the environments we'll be working on.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.650
There is the how to use environment and this environment belongs to the public library and we will wrap

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.090
this environment into gyms so that we can display the videos on our monitor.

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.160
All right.

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.840
So before we have a look at the condition I have to tell you that I reinstalled everything from scratch.

16
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.200
That is Anaconda.

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.740
Just to show you that there won't be any issue and that installation will be quick and easy.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530
All right let's do this.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.640
I will give you the documentation in the next to tell you all in some kind of article where you will

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.930
be able to download it.

21
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.010
But in the meantime let's have a look at this documentation.

22
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.190
Here we go 20:18 documentation.

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.290
So it's documentation in two parts.

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.470
Part one to be installed inside the terminal and I can the prompt where I explain what you need to enter

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.060
in a terminal to install Djimon by bullet.

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.830
And also this which is to actually have the videos you need to install if and MPEG.

27
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.600
And the second part the how she the environment where I explain exactly what you do and how to import

28
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.970
this environment from our code.

29
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.850
All right so let's tackle the first part first.

30
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.840
To be installed inside a terminal and on that prompt so I know that the oceans here is composed of Linux

31
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.660
users Mac users and Windows users so I separated the three cases for Mac and Linux users.

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.040
Please open a terminal.

33
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.130
So for Linux users you can find it very easily in the list of programs and for Mac users.

34
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.120
Well I'm going to show you very quickly how to do that.

35
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.210
And for Windows users the terminal is not that direct to find.

36
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.160
And besides if you want to run some command for Anaconda the windows prompt is not enough.

37
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.950
So instead of opening the windows prompt what you need to do is you click the windows button at the

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.800
bottom left of your screen right here.

39
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.790
Then you have two options.

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.590
Either you find an icon that in the list of programs and then you will find an X on a prompt you just

41
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.950
need to click on it and the other way to find it.

42
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.190
I gave you a link here.

43
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.990
It's just still in the bone left after you click on this window's button.

44
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.850
You search on the prompt and you will find it and you click on it and then you will have this black

45
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.530
window opened and this is exactly like opening a terminal on Mac in Linux so once you reach that point

46
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.400
you're all on the same page and you're ready to install the three modules.

47
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.300
So let's do this now.

48
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.920
I'm on Mac so I'm going to show you right away how to open a terminal.

49
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.060
My short cut to do this is to press them into space and then type terminal.

50
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.250
Here we go.

51
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.770
And here is my terminal and now what we're going to do.

52
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.550
We simply going to copy paste these three command lines and then press enter but you have to do it one

53
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.760
by one for each of them.

54
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.970
All right so let's start with the first one that installs.

55
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.390
Jim the version 0.10 point five.

56
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.350
Make sure to take the same version but basically just copy this line then just paste it here.

57
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.720
I remind that I reinstalled everything from scratch.

58
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.210
So for me it's like the first time I'm doing this.

59
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.400
But you will see we will find absolutely no error.

60
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.290
All right then you just need to press enter and this will install just very easily as you can see installed

61
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.700
collected packages.

62
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.480
Future pilot and Jim successfully installed these packages.

63
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.390
Perfect.

64
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.630
So first that done.

65
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:19.020
Now let's install Bible version 2.0 0.8 which actually comes from the pull request I made with alexy

66
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.710
because we noticed that forcing the expiration on the full episode helped the turning of the health

67
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.330
shita.

68
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.620
So this was a small contribution to the public library but still this version comes from our pool request

69
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:41.730
so let's copy this line this time and let's go back to the terminal to pasted and again press enter.

70
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.400
Collecting Bible downloading Bible at to point 0.8.

71
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.620
Right and now it's going to install it.

72
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.460
It's going to take a while like maybe one minute or two minutes so maybe I'll just accelerate here.

73
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.140
This is going well it should be out.

74
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.680
Here we go.

75
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.640
Perfect timing.

76
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.930
It should be ready in any second now.

77
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.490
Here we go.

78
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.030
Successfully installed pirate 2.0 0.8.

79
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.730
Perfect.

80
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.200
And now the last one of MPEG again you will have no issue installing it because this time you're installing

81
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.870
it through Konda which will directly install it in your Anikin that packages.

82
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.970
Here we go paste and let's install the final package or module Evanson back and that's to watch the

83
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.530
videos on your monitor.

84
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.320
After you read the Bible that environment with Jim.

85
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.970
All right.

86
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.880
So again it's going to take a few minutes.

87
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.690
All right.

88
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.750
Perfect.

89
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.750
Then you just need to press Whyfor Yes and then press enter again.

90
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.240
It's going to install basically all these packages here come the F and pay x 2 x 4 and certify.

91
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.640
These are just basically some dependencies that you need for a impact so everything is all good.

92
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.660
So as you can see it's going to be ready pretty quickly.

93
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.490
All right.

94
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.270
Only one to go.

95
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.650
The last one we go is accusing transaction and done.

96
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.440
Perfect.

97
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.310
Now we have everything you can just close the terminal as you can see.

98
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.240
This was quite easy.

99
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.010
We installed everything with no issue.

100
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.610
And besides these commands above only installed what you need to get the Bible it environments and display

101
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.680
them on your monitor.

102
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.210
And no AI framework such extensive or by torch was needed to be installed.

103
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.440
So that's the beauty of what we're doing in 2018.

104
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:30.910
This Erris was not implemented with the need of any complex frameworks such as dance floor by torch.

105
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.760
It was only implemented with none by all right.

106
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.450
Now moving on to part 2.

107
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.740
The hatched environment so I just quickly describe what it is and what we're going to do.

108
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.030
And mostly I remind that we have to import this Bible at arms because it is the module that contains

109
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.030
indeed the health the environment.

110
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.700
So let's have a look.

111
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.730
We will play with the help and varment inside which will train with our A-R as a cheater to run across

112
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.430
a field.

113
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.700
The name of this environment is how to tablet and zeroes.

114
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.540
That's the first thing we're going to do here we're going to copy this.

115
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.140
And remember in our Python code we left it blank here.

116
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.320
The environment Nomes.

117
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.670
Now we have to specify that we want to play in the House to pull it out of environment to train our

118
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.820
health CIDA on how to run across a field.

119
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:30.140
All right so that first thing done but then indeed I explain that the environments of pilot including

120
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.240
this one belong to the pilot ohms module pilot.

121
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.520
So we have to include the following import at the beginning of our Python implementation and importing

122
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.100
the library's code section.

123
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.220
Here is import import Bible at arms.

124
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.350
And that's the last thing we need to do to make all this work.

125
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.160
And basically that's the last thing we need for the show time.

126
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.760
All right.

127
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.100
Import Babolat arms.

128
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.070
Let's save it.

129
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.350
That's our last save.

130
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.820
Everything is ready now.

131
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.960
It's time for the results.

132
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:08.300
Indeed at the end of my degradation I'm telling you it's time to have fun so let's do this let's go

133
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.440
back to our code.

134
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.510
And now time for the show.

135
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.250
I'm selecting everything by pressing command a and then I'm on the map here.

136
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.290
So the shortcut to execute everything is command plus enter for Windows or Linux users.

137
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.300
You can press control plus enter to execute.

138
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.390
And here we go.

139
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.630
The training has just begun.

140
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.890
So we have a couple of warnings here that's totally normal It's just related to Jim.

141
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.960
But right now we are in the first step.

142
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.690
Step zero of the training and you're going to see we're going to start with some very negative reward

143
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.830
around minus 900.

144
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:50.510
But again that's totally normal because it's the beginning of the expiration so the updates of the weights

145
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:56.930
have just begun to try to find the best directions that lead to the highest reward and therefore you

146
00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:02.840
can see we're going to start with minus 900 something and then we're going to increase the we were told

147
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.550
minus 700 minus 500 until we reach the threshold the first threshold zero you know to reach the positive

148
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.880
range of reward that will be by the way our first goal you know to reach the positive range to reach

149
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.610
we were that is positive.

150
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.990
And then I'll set up some of the goals like the next checkpoint will be to reach 500 for example 500

151
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:32.430
plus 500 reward would be pretty amazing and with 500 the help today is likely to work properly.

152
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.790
But then there is another goal we will be hoping to reach 700 which is another trishaw and then 900.

153
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:46.680
The ultimate range of reward which will definitely give us a very functional walking cheetah.

154
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.570
And by the way you can see that a new folder has populated this is the X folder containing the Buras

155
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.800
father and the money.

156
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.730
Her stepfather was already some for his videos but these were automatically added.

157
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.160
These are not interesting but here we go we have the first one here.

158
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.450
This is a real first video of our cheetah trying to run.

159
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.440
And so here we go.

160
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:15.060
First step step zero reward a super negative reward of minus nine hundred and sixty two.

161
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.420
So don't worry it will increase.

162
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.550
Our goal is first to go over zero but it's going to take a few steps to go over zero.

163
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.170
Here we go another video.

164
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.480
It's going to take a few steps to go over zero.

165
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.170
But the final goal the ultimate goal that is you know the checkpoint where we are sure that the hatch

166
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:39.610
that can run is once you reach around 700 800 and 900 is the best.

167
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.530
Like if we're getting something close to 900 or even 1000.

168
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.200
Well we can be absolutely sure that it will run very well.

169
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.840
All right so as you can see we can already see it is greasing a little bit went from minus 9 6 to 2

170
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.590
months 9 4 5.

171
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.200
But it's going to increase even more sometimes it's going to decrease again.

172
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.740
As you can see because it is still exploring.

173
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.490
That's normal.

174
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:08.840
You know it is still exploring different directions different updates of the weight to find a way to

175
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.450
work.

176
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.710
And I would just like to remind that training virtual robot like this helps you to learn how to walk

177
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:23.750
is extremely challenging and if you try this with the previous Emile's of 2016 or 2017 you will see

178
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:30.080
that it will even take much longer to train you like maybe a couple of days on this computer but now

179
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.320
you're going to see that we're going to get the result in maybe 10 to 20 minutes talking about the first

180
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.330
result where the house is already running OK.

181
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.450
So what I'm going to do now is accelerate this.

182
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.720
I'm going to say hi again once you reach the positive rewards because I'm going to do something else

183
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.430
at the same time.

184
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.410
And we'll check from time to time how we're doing with the word we can already see.

185
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.330
It is increasing.

186
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.350
That's pretty good.

187
00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:01.490
But I'll say hi again when we reach a reward of zero and mostly I'll come back to you with the final

188
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.100
show.

189
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.600
The big congratulations once you reach something around 800 or 900.

190
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.610
All right.

191
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.210
Season

192
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.850
guys regulations we've just reached the positive word.

193
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.600
Fifty point nine too.

194
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.530
That's awesome.

195
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.550
I'm not saying that from now on it's going to be always positive.

196
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.690
Well here we go negative again but at least this is a very good sign and just by looking at this we

197
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:45.490
clearly see that the reward is increasing over the steps and sometimes due to expiration purposes.

198
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.440
Well we decreased a little bit more and then we increased.

199
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.650
So here it's pretty well decreasing but it's going to go back up into the positive range.

200
00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:02.390
And at some point we will only be in the positive range and we will go higher and higher up to hopefully

201
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.450
800 900 or even close to 1000.

202
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.800
And here we go again positive again.

203
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.570
That's awesome.

204
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.450
It is clearly working.

205
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.180
All right.

206
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.550
So we have just reached the positive reports.

207
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.850
Let's say this is the bronze medal.

208
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.250
Now we're going to go for the silver medal.

209
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:28.650
And as I'm feeling quite ambitious let's set this gold silver medal to reaching 800.

210
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:36.100
We will get the silver medal if we reach 800 and then even more ambitious but very challenging.

211
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:41.280
I'm setting the gold medal to 900 900.

212
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.620
It's going to be tough.

213
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.120
It's going to be super tough.

214
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.660
Even the silver medal it's going to be tough but we can do this.

215
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.950
Are you ready.

216
00:13:48.950 --> 00:14:00.150
Here we go.

217
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.320
All right guys perfect congratulations.

218
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:16.090
We have reached 800 and therefore we just got ourselves the silver medal on step two hundred sixty two.

219
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:23.340
So we have reached 800 and again it's going to decrease from time to time then increase again.

220
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.920
I'm going to let it continue but I think now it is time to have fun and watch the videos because we

221
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.780
are any way around a hundred.

222
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.640
Here we go.

223
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:37.150
Let's watch the videos of all the videos are here populated in the monitor subfolder.

224
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.790
The easiest way to have a look at them would be rather in this folder.

225
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.890
I will have a clear visual of it.

226
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.390
So beris monitors that these are the exact same videos as the one we see here.

227
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.760
So let's have a look at them.

228
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.360
There are not many of them but we'll see the progress very clearly.

229
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.630
All right.

230
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.000
So let's have a look at the first one.

231
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.000
I remind that the first one was populated automatically.

232
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.290
And these are basically some random action.

233
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.170
So it's going to fall pretty quickly if we press and play indeed.

234
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.400
Here we go.

235
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.190
It's falling right now it's just lust to cheat or just fail.

236
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.270
And that's the end of the game.

237
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.860
We forced the expiration.

238
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.840
So it is still trying to do some things but the IRS hasn't come into play yet.

239
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.580
All right.

240
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.360
So same for the second video.

241
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.340
Have a look at it.

242
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.870
Random action still and weird random actions.

243
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.830
It just ended up in this situation in this position.

244
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:42.330
So I think we have a third and last one with random actions trying to jump with this frontal leg.

245
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.400
It's nothing of course.

246
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.280
And now let's check the date.

247
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:55.210
So 11:23 11:24 so maybe that's our first attempt with the Apress.

248
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.010
Let's have a look.

249
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.420
OK.

250
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.470
Not good.

251
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.790
Still falling and it's going to stay in that position.

252
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.410
So maybe that was still among the first but let's have a look at this one.

253
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.470
This one should be slightly better but maybe we're still you know in the negative words.

254
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.230
Yes we are.

255
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.210
But still it now manages to stay balanced with its back leg.

256
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.160
So that's some progress.

257
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:24.400
But of course we are still you know at this time where we were in the negative range of what we just

258
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.270
got new video by the way let's have a look at the next one.

259
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.540
Still falling.

260
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:36.810
OK that's totally normal that's because we are in negative rewards range.

261
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.440
Let's have a look at this one now.

262
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.840
Whoa.

263
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.880
OK so see the same bounds now and it kind of starts to understand how to stay balanced but definitely

264
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.760
doesn't understand how to walk.

265
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.090
Let's have a look at the next one.

266
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.330
You're going to see at some point it's going to get better and better once we reach the positive rewards

267
00:16:59.330 --> 00:16:59.740
range.

268
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:05.740
But it took us 46 steps 40 steps to reach the positive rewards.

269
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:11.730
So all right we're getting there.

270
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.150
See.

271
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.340
Now it's trying to do something it starts to be working here right.

272
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.040
It's working very weirdly.

273
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.410
I admit this but it's starting to work.

274
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.420
Write that's interesting maybe that's when we start reaching the positive rewards.

275
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.260
OK.

276
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:38.560
So we're going to get now closer and closer to the real ability of a cheater to work.

277
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.760
Let's have a look at this one ready play.

278
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:47.530
Still the same trying to walk but doesn't know exactly how to walk yet doesn't know which muscle emotions

279
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.980
have to be in the different parts of the body.

280
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.490
So it still has a lot of trouble walking properly but we can see that it's trying.

281
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.890
You know it's moving forward but it's definitely not working well yet.

282
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.420
All right.

283
00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.160
Next one now it should be a bit better.

284
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.070
I'm not quite it's moving forward.

285
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.830
It's trying to walk but no worries.

286
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.960
This is not the final result.

287
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.240
OK.

288
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.820
So we've definitely reached the rewards range now.

289
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.430
So it's going to get better and better.

290
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.540
We're getting there soon.

291
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.130
Let's press play.

292
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.420
OK.

293
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:33.690
OK.

294
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.560
It's starting to understand something it's starting to see some patterns on which muscle in portions

295
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.790
the jeweler has to do it in the different parts of the body to walk.

296
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.660
This is already better.

297
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.610
This is already an improvement.

298
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.860
Let's check out the next one.

299
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.780
All right better or much better.

300
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:59.830
Now it's walking doing some weird curved thing on its front leg but the back leg has the right movement

301
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.190
I think.

302
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:07.300
You know it's pushing with its back leg to move forward and still doing this weird thing with its front

303
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.500
leg but now it is definitely moving forward and kind of walking right next video.

304
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.050
Not bad.

305
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:16.850
Yes.

306
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:17.990
So now it is.

307
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.550
Yes it has chosen a pattern to walk right.

308
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.530
It's working pretty correctly.

309
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.270
Let's say it's moving forward anyway which is why we were puzzled.

310
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.930
OK good.

311
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.010
OK.

312
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.290
Now let's maybe jump straight ahead to the last video because it's starting to be the same and also

313
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.620
because I can't wait to take this gold medal challenge.

314
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.570
Ok now it is clearly running better.

315
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.410
Let's see if the head manages to reach the right side of the screen and the finish line.

316
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:52.230
That would definitely mean that it runs faster than before because that would be a first.

317
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.250
And yes it did.

318
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.700
Perfect.

319
00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:00.970
So that's still around the world is still around 800 it reached 800 again.

320
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.740
Here again here.

321
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.500
Eight hundred again so it is still increasing.

322
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.450
All right.

323
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.090
So what medals we have here.

324
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.650
Yeah we have the bronze and the silver medal.

325
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.700
Now let's go for the gold one 900.

326
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.650
This one is going to be super tough.

327
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:30.610
Let's go for it.
