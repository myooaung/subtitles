00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,430
Hello and welcome back to the course on power be-I.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,030
In today's tutorial is starting a brand new section and we're talking about maps.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,640
Scatterplot and interactive b i reports it's going to be an exciting couple of tutorials.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,350
So let's get straight to it.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,210
As usual we're going to need a browser and we're going to need to go to w w w dot superdad assigns dot

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,730
com slash power be-I.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,890
And if you scroll down here to section for maps and scatterplot you'll see the data set.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,930
So just go ahead and download that.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,600
And in the meantime the comments says that teched Excel file has two tabs you will need to join the

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,170
two tables in power.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,860
Interesting so we're going to learn a new technique as well about joining data sets.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,730
All right so the file has been downloaded.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,370
And let's go ahead and open it up in Excel.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,450
There we go.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:00,150
So here we've got our first stab and it's got Order ID order date the customer name so the person who

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,840
placed the order.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:10,550
The city county region where the order was placed the segment what kind of segment in our company does

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:19,880
that has that order being placed within the shipping date the shipping mode the state of the country

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,470
in which the order was placed.

20
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:33,380
And so then we got the long issue and the latitude of the city of that specific location and then order

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,520
breakdown the order breakdown has the breakdown of those orders so sometimes orders can include more

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,820
than one more than one item.

23
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,160
So in this order let's have a look.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,120
So we've got a look here so we've got here an order that has two items so the order is the same.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,440
But then there's two items within this order and you can see the product name the discount the sales

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,660
the profit the quantity the office the category and the subcarriers.

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,900
So that's very interesting here we've got information about the order and where it went who placed it

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,290
and so on.

29
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,940
But then the actual sales and profit information is provided on an item level.

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,510
And there might be multiple items in order so that's what it meant.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,370
So that's what we mean when we need to only say that we need to join the two tables we need to actually

32
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,020
combine these two tables.

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:36,080
So if you look at this table it has if it goes to the bottom by pressing QUANTRILL down it has four

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,200
thousand 118 rows or minus one with the header and this table actually has 8000 rows so there are many

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,460
more rows in the second table.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,750
We're going to need to find a way to combine them.

37
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,000
So let's go ahead and get started.

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,070
Let's put this data into power be-I we're going to say that.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,680
All right so now I'm going to bring up power be-I And here we're going to hit a click or click and get

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,450
data.

41
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,260
It is an excel file.

42
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,340
So let's go find it.

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,110
There it is.

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,320
And here once it loads you'll see that you have two options.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,700
These are the two tabs that we have the list of orders and the order breakdown.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,550
Now you can select either one which you want to import but in our case we want to import both.

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:29,560
So we're going to select both metrically Kloed give it a second to load.

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,600
There we go.

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,890
And now we've got two separate tabs or two separate expandable menus here.

50
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,900
And now what happened.

51
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,710
Did they get connected somehow.

52
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,300
How are they.

53
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,050
How do these two data sources interact.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,720
Well to see that we need to go not to this tab not the data tab because the data table tell you how

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,720
they are presented the structure of each one one by one but we need to go to this last tab with the

56
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,010
relationships tab.

57
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,770
And here you will see the two data sources that we have and how they are connected.

58
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,410
So this is the first one.

59
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,130
The second one.

60
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,580
And then if you click on this connection if you just double click it you'll see that we've got EDID

61
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:26,400
relationship here and this is kind of like an advance view of what's going on.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,260
It's many Tujuan and Crossfield so we don't want to really get into into this right down what we want

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,470
to do is actually want to just once you've selected the relationship click manage relationships and

64
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,110
this is a much simpler approach and you can see right away how they're connected.

65
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:54,160
So here you've got the connection specified so the table on the left is order breakdown and then the

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,240
column that is being taken is order ID and it has been this table is being connected to this call.

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,190
Also on the order ID column and that is correct so we know that the Order ID is a shared column called.

68
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,630
And so you can.

69
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,120
The way you can adjust is if you ever need to can detect.

70
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,810
Right.

71
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,480
If you've updated the tables and or changed something and then it can pick up some relationships.

72
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,670
You can create new relationships right.

73
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,910
So here you can select your table that you want the information to come from.

74
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,680
So we're back at that menu again.

75
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,940
So here you select the column that you want.

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,070
Then the second table and then again the second the column that you want and then the type of a relationship.

77
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,210
So one to many one to one or many to one.

78
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,620
I know this is a bit of a complex.

79
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:56,580
This might seem a bit complex but these are basically left joins inner joins and writes joins.

80
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,430
So the one over here on the left would be a left join.

81
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,650
This is an inner join in this or right join.

82
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:11,110
I know these things don't make a lot of sense right now but what are we going to do is we're going to

83
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,150
just leave it as it is for now.

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,480
So we're just going to leave this relationship as it is because it's been detected correctly and then

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,140
in the next three tutorials you will find information on joint information on the joints.

86
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm going to include it as an expert with turtles or they might be somewhere else in the course or as

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:37,210
bonus tutorials but you see them there'll be tutorials basically about understanding left or right inner

88
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,910
and outer joins a tutorial on the joins with duplicate values and a tutorial on joining on multiple

89
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,400
fields so after those two journals you'll know everything about Joines if you haven't studied them before

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
if you know already then feel free to skip those patrols.

91
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,290
But if you'd like to refresh your knowledge or learn more about joins then there will be three very

92
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,060
in-depth tutorials about Joines that explain how all of these things work.

93
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,100
But for now all we need to know is that we've got this table with the order ideas and it's been connected

94
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,450
to this table with the information here what information on the orders.

95
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,290
Here we've got information on the items within those orders.

96
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:25,680
And then after you've checked out the Joines you can come and have a look at this information and like

97
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:35,580
I'll give you a heads up right now that this is this is a correct joint so that the joint has been done

98
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,970
correctly.

99
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,430
And one is that well because we remember that in this table we have about 8000 records in this table

100
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,210
have 4000.

101
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,400
So here we do have duplicate values.

102
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,510
So therefore the relationship should be many to 1 so multiple records from here should be joined to

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
records from here.

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:02,640
And that is exactly what we need because there can be duplicate records here so basically arose from

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,850
this table should be duplicated in order to match these.

106
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:12,750
I know it's a bit complex right now but after you've had a look at the joints turtles it will all make

107
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,620
total sense.

108
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,840
All right so that is how our joint is performed.

109
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:24,440
And basically from here we can proceed to working on our visualization.

110
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,150
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and you were able to follow along.

111
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,130
And I look for see you next time.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,030
Until then happy analyzing.
