00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello and welcome back to the course and part VI in this section of the course we've got a very exciting

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,640
challenge we're dealing with data from a bank and we're going to be visualizing different things about

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,120
this back and creating a business intelligence report.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:24,320
So as usual to get the data set we need to go to your browser and go to Dr. predestines dot com slash

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,620
power be at one word.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,030
And if you scroll down here you'll see Section 5 building a robust be-I dashboard.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,270
So here's a data set.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,550
Just go ahead and download that.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,030
It's the CACP file.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,330
And just here's a quick caveat that today's dataset is dummy data for an imaginary bank operating in

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,170
the UK so you don't have to worry about this information being sensitive.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,030
This is all made up information.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,660
It's not real banks information of course.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,210
And so once you've done load the file this go ahead and open it to explore what columns we have here.

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:07,100
So we're going to zoom in a little bit and we're going to be able to better so here we've got customer

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,540
I.D. we've got the name the surname the gender of our customer the age of the region where they're from

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,550
in the UK.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,040
The job of discussion whether they're white color blue color or other.

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,570
And then we've got the date when they joined the bank.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,930
So this is all relatively new bank.

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,070
All the customers joined in 2015.

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,020
And then we've got the balance that these these customers have on their accounts.

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,390
So there we go that's all of the information that we have and what we need to do with this information

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:50,640
is we need to create a business intelligence report that will show the executives of the bank how the

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,430
will portray the geo demographics segmentation of the bank so you'll show them where the customers are

26
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,000
from what their age groups are.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,710
What is the split by gender.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,970
What kind of balances they have with this the distribution by balance and so on.

29
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:15,740
And so if you scroll down to the bottom you'll see that we have 4000 and 15 rows actually 4000 thousand

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,370
14 because one goes ahead.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:24,260
And yes it's a moderately sized dataset and it will be interesting to see what kind of distributions

32
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,230
we'll find in here.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
So let's go ahead and close this.

34
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,460
And now we're going to bring a power be-I and connected data set.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,780
So is.

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,660
This is a new report and now we're going to just get data at the top.

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,640
This is LCAC files.

38
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:50,920
So x v UK bank customers give it a second and there we go we can just check that that is correct.

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:03,410
That load and voila there they are so we can always go in here and make sure that we've loaded the correct

40
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,340
data set and at the bottom you can see you can confirm that it is 4000 and 14 rows total as we saw in

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,410
our file it's always good to confirm those things.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,990
Okay so that's it for today.

43
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,040
We know what's the deal has about we know the challenge is and very you loaded the data in the next

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,220
tutorial will start and proceed with the first charge for our business intelligence report.

45
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,600
And I look forward to seeing you then.

46
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,170
Until next time happy analyze analyzed.
