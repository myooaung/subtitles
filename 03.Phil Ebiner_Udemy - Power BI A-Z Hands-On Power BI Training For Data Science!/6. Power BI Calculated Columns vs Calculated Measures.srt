Hello and welcome back to the course on Power BI, in today's tutorial we're going to add some character to
1

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,770
our map.
2

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,920
We're going to change the sizes of these circles and we're going to add some color and in addition to
3

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,130
all that we're going to also learn a new feature in Power BI which is calculated measures and how that is
4

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,050
different to calculate columns.
5

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,540
All right so let's get started.
6

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,260
First of all we're going to add sizes to our circles so we could differentiate them by sizes.
7

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,880
And as the size, we're going to select the sales for the associated geography.
8

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,920
So let's go ahead and drag sales or let's open first of all the field here and drag sales into size right
9

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,210
away.
10

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,520
The size of the circles have changed.
11

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:53,480
Now what we want for the color of the circles is the profit margin in the associate region.
12

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,410
However we don't have the profit margins here in our data set.
13

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,730
And that is fair enough because our data set is at the Order ID or actually item level.
14

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:13,720
In this case in the case of this table it's at the item level and since the store to this table there
15

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,900
the whole thing is in the item level.
16

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,190
Now how would we be able to calculate the profit margin at the level of the region if our dataset is
17

18
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,670
at item level.
18

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,840
And this is where the calculated measures will come in handy and help us out.
19

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,270
So let's learn about calculated measures.
20

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,540
I prepared some slides.
21

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,500
Let's go through them.
22

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,700
All right: calculated columns vs measures
23

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,050
We've discussed calculated columns
24

25
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,520
So this is going to help us understand how calculated measures are different.
25

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,060
So let's imagine that we've got our data set and on the left we've got all these rules so every blue
26

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,250
block here or a rectangle represents a row.
27

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:01,180
Now what happens when we aggregate our data is certain rows are combined together so for example in
28

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,420
our case they might be in the same region.
29

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,280
So some of them might be in UK some might be in Germany some of them might be in France and they'll be
30

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,210
aggregate together.
31

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,350
So they're aggregate it.
32

33
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,250
And for example in the case of sales which we just put on our map there summed up so all of the rules
33

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,700
relating to us and region are added up together and then rows really into another region around it together
34

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,610
and so on.
35

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,530
And then there are displayed on the map.
36

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,000
So as you can see here the red ones would be the U.K. green ones Germany orange ones France.
37

38
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,040
And that's just an hypothetical example.
38

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,540
Of course the number of rows doesn't have to be three per geography it can be different can be varying
39

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,830
and so on but this is the main concept that we have data at the row level.
40

41
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,600
Then we have data that is aggregated to the level of granularity of our visualization.
41

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,520
And finally the data is displayed on our visualisation.
42

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,400
Now what are calculated columns which we have discussed previously in this course.
43

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,660
Well let's imagine that we have some data in these red rows.
44

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,320
So let's say 10 20 50 100 400 150
45

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,500
And the numbers on the left are the profit for the sales of each item.
46

47
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:22,480
So $10 profit and $100 sales so that the number on the right is sales and then $20 profit $400 in sales
47

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,330
so basically the item was sold at $400 but the profit is only $20 because there was a certain expense
48

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,950
associated with purchasing the item in the first place.
49

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,450
This shipment of items with them marketing of item and things like that so there's a profit and there's
50

51
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:48,070
a sales, now the aggregation in this case what it does is it adds up the profit and adds up sales so
51

52
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,600
we've got some of profit which is 80 sum plus 20 plus 50.
52

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,050
And sum of sales which is 650 100 plus 400 plus 150 keeps 650.
53

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,660
And what we visualized as the size of the bubble on our map was the sum of sales which is pretty straightforward.
54

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,790
Up until this point everything is quite straightforward and very intuitive.
55

56
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,410
But next what we want to do is let's say we want to create a calculated columns
56

57
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,070
So something we've talked about before and this is a very simple procedure.
57

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,260
Basically we calculate something a column based on our existing columns and we add it to our data.
58

59
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:33,640
And here is a calculated column which represents a profit divided by sales for each individual row which
59

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,560
equates to the profit margins in the first case for the first sold item.
60

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,570
The profit margin is 10 percent or 0.1 or of the second one in 0.05.
61

62
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,530
The third one is that two point thirty three.
62

63
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,110
And that's also fair enough it's a pretty straightforward procedure just the right one to call.
63

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,990
by other and add this synthetic column in a dataset.
64

65
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,500
Wonderful.
65

66
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,920
But now what will happen with this additional column when this whole dataset is aggregated.
66

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,330
Well now we're going to have a new aggregation which is the sum of the calculated call or hypothetically
67

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,240
it's going to be there but we can if we want to we can add that to our visualization and we can add up this
68

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,530
column just as we did with profit or as we did with sales.
69

70
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:25,390
But the thing with the profit margin is that it doesn't make sense to add up the profit
70

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,130
margin for each individual item.
71

72
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,430
Right.
72

73
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,710
So if you had more items you could come out you could easily get a profit margin of over 100 percent
73

74
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,470
and that makes no sense at all and therefore adding up the profit margin isn't going to be useful to
74

75
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,610
it.
75

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,820
So in that case what is the profit margin for a whole region.
76

77
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,760
The parameter that we're looking for the parameter that we want to add to our visualization, But let's get rid
77

78
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:56,230
of these calculated columns and the profit margin for the whole region is it's it's quite intuitive that
78

79
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,680
the whole profit margin for the whole region is actually the division of these two numbers so 80 divided
79

80
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,480
by 650.
80

81
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,190
So the profit made in the whole region divided by that sales made in the whole region.
81

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,260
So 80 divided by 650  gives us top a sense or 0.12 to and that is the number we were off.
82

83
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,790
So how do we get to that.
83

84
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,030
Well this is our profit margin.
84

85
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,180
And in Power BI This calculation is actually called a calculated measure.
85

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,430
So we're taking two columns and we dividing them one by the other but off to the aggregation.
86

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,530
So this is the main difference between calculate culms and calculator measures calculate columns are calculated
87

88
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,820
before the aggregation so at the roll level whereas calculated measures are calculated off to the aggregation
88

89
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,200
has occurred.
89

90
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,920
And also as a consequence of that calculate columns once you've calculated them they're stored inside
90

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,670
your data set.
91

92
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,470
They're stored inside your just alongside of the rows that you got originally whereas calculated measures.
92

93
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,830
They are calculated every time you recreate your visualization or you recalculate your visualization.
93

94
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,060
So they're not actually stored in your data set.
94

95
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,210
They are a dynamic thing that gets calculated on the fly when it is required.
95

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,790
So that's the main difference and hopefully this explanation made it a bit more a bit easier to understand
96

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,910
it's a bit clearer now.
97

98
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,380
And now let's go back to visualization and perform a calculated measure and add it to our chart
98

99
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,190
So here we are.
99

100
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:38,950
And now let's go ahead and create a calculated measure so basically just right click anyway here and
100

101
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:51,070
select a new measure and here you've got measure over there appears so type in profit margin equals first
101

102
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,970
performed aggregation on the first column that we're interested in which is profit.
102

103
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,760
So make sure that data set pops up so close aggregation divided by the aggregation.
103

104
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,570
of the second column we're interested in which is sales.
104

105
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,870
Again make sure that dataset pops up and close aggregation and click enter.
105

106
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,980
There we go now we have a profit margin here.
106

107
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:21,420
And as you can see the Icon is a bit different to what we had when we were creating calculated columns.
107

108
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,530
All right so now we're going to take profit margin and we're going to drag it onto color saturation
108

109
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:35,740
and now we're going to adjust the colors going into data colors and here minims going to be read Maxim
109

110
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,870
is going to be that select I don't know.
110

111
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:46,880
maybe a blue on blue blue that's a bit too neon.
111

112
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,650
I think something like that so there we go.
112

113
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,490
We've got red and blue.
113

114
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,020
And the beauty of this calculation is that it is dynamic and therefore as we drill into visualization
114

115
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,920
as we learned previously this calculation will update to the correct level of granularity.
115

116
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,140
So watch this we're going to move, let's go back here, so we're going to move we're at country level
116

117
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,440
right now.
117

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
We're going to move to state level.
118

119
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,170
So as I expand the next level you'll see that it's being recalculated and now our profit margin is calculated
119

120
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,980
the state level can even go further down.
120

121
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,460
Go to the level of the city.
121

122
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,710
Yes it's a very cluttered.
122

123
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:34,080
But as you zoom in there'll be more space and you can see here the profit margins for the cities and
123

124
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,280
you can also see the sales which is represented by the size of the bubble.
124

125
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,640
So probably let's go back up to the state level that should be sufficient for us.
125

126
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,370
And that's pretty much it.
126

127
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,820
That's how calculated measures work in Power BI.
127

128
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,080
And that's how they're different to calculate column.
128

129
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,030
So the main things to remember are the calculated columns are calculated at the row level and they are
129

130
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,570
actually stored in the data set calculated measures are calculated after the aggregation has been performed.
130

131
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:11,120
And as a consequence they are not stored in the data set but rather calculated on the fly whenever the
