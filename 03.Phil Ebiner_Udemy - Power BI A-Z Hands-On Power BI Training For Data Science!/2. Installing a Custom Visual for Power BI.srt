00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,540
Hello and welcome back to the course and party.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,740
Today we're going to explore custom visuals in a park and we're going to learn how to install them into

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,580
our software on our desktop as well.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,950
So we've said that we need to go to is app daughter Parvi dot com slash visuals.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,640
You can also find it quicker if you just go to Google and search for Barbie visuals or custom visuals.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,970
And then this will be one of the top few links.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:38,670
So here you can find all these amazing custom installations that are not by default present or prepackaged

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,020
in your power be-I So here is that here you can see a lot of his positions and they're very colorful

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,630
there.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,700
Even the little thumbnail is very descriptive as well so you've got bubble charts here which are present

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,180
not by default Imparja But so you can get them here.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:05,550
I got word clouds you've got Sancti diagrams you've got dial gauges Mukoko I've never actually used

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:12,030
to make a chart never got box and wiskers you got network navigations.

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,520
So just looking at most like the most popular ones I guess the bricks shard both Tyche are liquid filled

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,340
which is quite a fun way of demonstrating KPI as you got stars.

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,160
What else do we have here.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
This is a critical one force directed graph.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,940
That's that's good.

19
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,510
So like let's just have a look at a couple of them here once you click on the one you like.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,340
You've got an option to download the visual or you can download a sample download the visual is like

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,830
a plug into your power be-I and it actually installs that Israel into your Parbat.

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:55,230
A sample is a sample Part B or workbook that already has a plug in installed and it also has some examples

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,950
of how to use it.

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,760
So go ahead and look this.

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,640
All right so as you can see it's it's loaded and it's it's like a dynamic type of his possession and

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,570
this position is called School Frenzel.

27
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,070
Assuming that it's showing who's friends with who at a school.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,010
So you can see here some people are friends with them.

29
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,010
Which other nobody else.

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,130
And like that.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,680
So yes the size represents the number of friends that person has.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,850
And then you could just grab any one of these and you can drag it around and then just fall back into

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,800
place or somewhere nearby.

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,700
So this is pretty cool as fun to play around with.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,620
And I think one of the kind of dominant places or visualization tools that creates these really well

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:55,270
is D-3 So the javascript language D-3 there a session package and so there they're done really well

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
but this is also a good implementation as well.

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:07,700
The Road We've got company communications right so i guess who's this probably who is who's boss or

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,130
something that's pretty cool.

40
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,800
Pretty fun to play around with.

41
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,900
And here they've got one which demonstrates all the features so they actually can have little icons

42
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,200
at the ends.

43
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,280
And so you can also put arrows you can change the width and so on.

44
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,450
And then they also give you some hints.

45
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,920
And so you can see here now you've got this force directed graph appeared in your Weasel's.

46
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,310
So that's kind of like how the plugin is installed.

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,060
And then you can also use it for your Alsatians if you prefer to do so.

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,330
All right.

49
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:48,650
So just as a normal visualizations we just click it it appears and then you drag some you drag some

50
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,540
like Jack some dimensions or measures into it and then you get the result they go.

51
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,710
So it's as simple as that.

52
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,330
We're not going to say this because we don't need a force directed graph.

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,960
There's just an example of how to download and look at a sample.

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,670
The one we're going to be using for all of Weasel's election purposes is a chord diagram and they are

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,190
very interesting and very powerful as well so we're going to learn how to use the core diagram.

56
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,010
Let's go ahead and download it.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:28,550
And this time instead of downloading the sample download the visual writes a hearing to agree if you

58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:37,240
agree to the terms and once you've downloaded the visual you just need to copy it into your folder where

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,530
you are performing or all of your analysis for this section and then so then bring up part B.

60
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,600
So this is the same work that we've loaded the data in.

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,130
So the euro debt crisis.

62
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,690
And now let's go ahead and just install.

63
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:03,370
So here click the import from file import a custom visual click Import and here select the file that

64
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,680
you just downloaded.

65
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,370
OK.

66
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,790
And there you go.

67
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,240
The file is ready or the insulation is ready.

68
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,100
So it's as simple as that.

69
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:24,270
We've installed the power vi chord chart into our software and we can now proceed to use it and we'll

70
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,020
continue with this in the next tutorial and until next I'm happy analyzing.
