00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello and welcome back to the course and party.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.350
In today's tutorial we're going to continue with our venture into this challenge and we're going to

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.010
do two things.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.620
First of all we're going to just the colors of this was all zation.

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.300
So they actually represent something else or actually represent something because right now they're

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.190
quite random and then we're going to create another chord diagram and the chord diagram is going to

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.250
be for the debtors.

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.220
So if you want to pause this video and create the chord diagram for the debtors yourself just next to

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.510
it so you just create one right next to it and then come back to the video then you're welcome to do

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.220
so and that will give you an additional chance to practice creating chord diagrams.

11
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.310
And moreover more importantly interpreting them so try to see what insights you can derive from them

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.820
based on what we discussed in the previous tutorial.

13
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.170
All right so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to adjust the colors on this.

14
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.630
All right.

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.360
So let's get straight to it.

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.460
The color that I want to use for this resolution is actually should be associated with this risk column.

17
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.470
So I want to use color to demonstrate how risky a certain country is when it's the one boring money.

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.690
So if I go to the formatting here and I go to data colors you'll notice that there is no option to set

19
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.460
a column to be responsible for the colors here.

20
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.010
There's an option here and also there's an option here.

21
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.030
So all we are left with is to manually set the colors and unfortunately that's what we're going to have

22
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.770
to do so.

23
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.110
But hopefully in the future I will come up with an option for this specific chart for the chord chart

24
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.030
for you to be able to set it.

25
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.320
Set the color through a call.

26
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.640
All right.

27
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.910
It won't take very long.

29
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.410
We're going to use our debt crisis data set.

30
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.340
And so just sort the data by debter.

31
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.730
And that way you'll be able to see.

32
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.360
So you'll be able to put them together so you won't have to search for different countries separately.

33
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.110
So here we've got United States.

34
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.060
The risk is stable.

35
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.180
So let's go ahead and change the color here.

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.710
We'll use this gray just of the black.

37
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.760
All right so then we're looking at Spain medium risk.

38
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.610
So for medium risk we're going to use We're going to use.

39
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:39.510
I mean she's a yellow that's two two light I'm going to use that yellow then Portugal Portugal is high

40
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.890
risk so for higher risk we're going to inches this or enjoy here.

41
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.290
Next one is Japan.

42
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.760
Japan is stable.

43
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.890
So let's change that to the gray as well.

44
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.980
Italy is higher risk so we're going to change that to orange over here that dark top orange.

45
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.320
Ireland is high risk.

46
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.780
So it's change that as well in Germany.

47
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.540
So you can see we have got Greece here and we don't have it in here because they didn't actually lend

48
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.310
money to anybody.

49
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.350
Germany is stable.

50
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.560
So it's stable.

51
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730
Then you've got France low risk.

52
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580
So for low risk we're going to use a yellow but we're going to use not that yellow We're going to use

53
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.650
even letter yellow so that one can see there a little bit different.

54
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220
And for Britain we've got stable so stable that's great.

55
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.750
Now you'll notice that we've got some blue away here and that is going into Greece and inflation.

56
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.020
We cannot change the color.

57
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.220
But what we're going to do is we're going to change the default color here.

58
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.060
Greece is high risk so we're going to set that.

59
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.490
And luckily we only have one color.

60
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.330
One country that is affected by that is Greece so in this case we're able to find this ad hoc solution.

61
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.980
All right so we done with the colors.

62
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.480
And now we can go ahead and create a second core diagram for the debtors the stand so you can just go

63
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.820
ahead and create a new diagram and take this time.

64
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.450
So here we had from creditors to debtors and values amounts here again to do the opposite.

65
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.290
In fact you might just go and delete this whole copy paste this and we'll take this chart and here we'll

66
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.830
take debtors and put them into the from creditor's into the two.

67
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.860
And now we just need to rename this chart.

68
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.880
Remember to rename it.

69
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.790
This is going to be debtors.

70
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.110
OK.

71
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.050
And with the colors as you can see unfortunately they've all reset to default so we're going to have

72
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.240
to adjust that.

73
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.700
I will let you do this on your own so I'm going to end this to Tauriel here.

74
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.290
I'll let you do this on your own.

75
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.240
And then while you're once you've done Also you can explore the start but we'll continue that in the

76
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.450
next tutorial and other curtsying next time.

77
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.170
Until then happy analyzing.
