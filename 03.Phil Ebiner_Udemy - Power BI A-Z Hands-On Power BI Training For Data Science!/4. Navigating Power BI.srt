00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,340
Hello welcome back to the course and party.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,330
And here we can see where we left off last summer we can get our data set.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,430
And today we're just going to explore.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,170
Then invigoration of this tool so we're not going to create anything specific we just play around so

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,120
that we get more familiarized with how Paul VI is laid out so that we can navigate the controls easier

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,680
for the down in the course.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:25,940
All right.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,440
So here at the top we've got a navigation bar that stands out right away.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,000
And let's go through it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,500
So here we've got to get data something we've already worked with recent sources.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,030
We'll get to the recent data sources that you've explored in power be-I enter data.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,780
We will be using this much.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,160
But basically you can just add some data manually will be connected to our data sets instead.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,350
So let's cancel that EDID queries brings up that same window that we saw before so this is the window

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,420
that actually connects to your data when you load it for the first time.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,370
As you recall we there's another way we can adjust our data followed to calling that window we can go

17
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,070
in here and correct things through the modeling tap here if we want to.

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,020
So there's two ways of doing that.

19
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:26,370
And then we've got the refresh button which refreshes the data sets in case you've adjusted the data

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,740
set outside of power be-I in the original file and you just click this button and it will refresh the

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,340
data set and your visuals will be updated.

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,500
New page just creates a new page in your layout but it's much easier just to click and you page and

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,280
the left on the bottom here and you'll create new pages for you.

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,660
I think of them as new pages in a PowerPoint or something.

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,880
So basically like a new slide in a PowerPoint.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,790
And that's that's the point.

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,230
So if you want to have several of the selections then you would just create several pages from Nuvigil

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,310
just as a resolution to your current page.

29
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,590
We also probably won't be using this button that much because it's easier to use the buttons over here

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,650
and we'll see how that works in a second.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,010
Then we've got a text box you can just add a text box to your visualization you can add an image or

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,900
you can add some shapes if you like.

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,400
So those are pretty straightforward page view.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:35,490
And basically adjusts your page how like how well it is fitted to your working space.

35
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,010
I prefer to leave it at a 52 page manager relationships.

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,260
We'll talk about this further down in the course it's about when you have several data sources and a

37
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,950
new measure so there's new measures.

38
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,080
You call them we'll talk about that as well and publish again we'll talk about this later.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,880
So these are a bit more advanced features and will definitely cover them off for them.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,500
Of course then you've got the modeling tab which contains even more advanced features again you've got

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,880
the Vange relationships and you measure and you call them new table salt.

42
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,020
BI So some of these we won't be using some of these will cover further down the course.

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,880
And for now we won't worry about this tab.

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,080
We will go to the modeling tab as we need it throughout the course.

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,140
So let's say on the hometime here on the left we can adjust that data as we discussed.

46
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,610
And this is one of the cases when we would use the modeling tab because we can change the categories

47
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,300
here and here we would.

48
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,740
We can adjust the relationships but that's a few sections away there's a bit of an advanced technique.

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,630
So we'll get back to it later on.

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
And finally so after all that on the right here we've got the controls of our vessels and this is where

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,650
we'll be spending most of our time when creating visualisations.

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,410
So here you can choose the results and you want to create.

53
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:59,010
These are different bar charts line charts area charts pie charts and so on.

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,550
And then you wrote this dot dot dot.

55
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,810
So we'll talk about this as well.

56
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,960
You can import customisations very powerful feature mix of power be-I is something that actually makes

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,110
this tool stand out in the marketplace that there's a lot of customers and will definitely cover that

58
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,030
off in this course.

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,980
It will be exciting to toile then we've got some controls here so these will do the change depending

60
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,470
on your visualizations.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,050
But some controls and some filters and we'll explore those in just in a second than you was some formatting

62
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,720
which also changes based on your selection.

63
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,310
And finally you've got your data set.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,480
You can put these like collapses if you want some more space or if you're not using one of them and

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,700
that's pretty much it for the controls.

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,830
But now to understand this better let's just play around let's track some columns onto bills the visualization

67
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,610
and we'll see what we can get.

68
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,290
So basically we're going to select out of our dataset wish called We want to use in isolation.

69
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,220
So let's select for example region right.

70
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,970
And then just drag it onto the whitespace.

71
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,890
It's that simple.

72
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,690
And then let's say units so the number of units sold and right away when we drag it into Bill or resolution

73
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,320
like that we get a table.

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:24,300
And as you can see here the table option has been hard for us so Microsoft RBI has dramatically selected

75
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
which option is going to show.

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,370
So what if we don't want to table.

77
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,140
What if we want a bar chart just like the bar chart over here.

78
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,980
The first option and as you can see we've got a bar chart and we've got central east and west.

79
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:44,640
And if you are over you'll see a tool to pop up so in the Central Region 1199 units were sold in total

80
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,940
than in the East Region 691 in the West 231.

81
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,740
And here you can see that these controls have adjusted.

82
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,320
So now you can go into Younus click this dropdown and you can see that it's the sum if you want to change

83
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,930
it you can change it to something else.

84
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,140
But we can all play around with this further down right now we just won't explode the visuals so you

85
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,600
can change to a different bar chart like that.

86
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,440
So what else have we got.

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,370
Let's try.

88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,810
So that's just basically our Eric Arbor's not really the best option in this particular scenario.

89
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's try a pie chart so you can see.

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,780
Now we've got a pie chart instead of our bar chart and again this is very telling.

91
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:35,650
This election further down the course we'll learn how to control these tool tips or these labels so

92
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,710
that they actually specify the percentages.

93
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,270
But even from here we can see that the central regions sold the most number of units.

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,450
What else can we do we can do in this case we can do donor charter right.

95
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,780
So this is already a powerful feature that in all these tools you have to jump through many hoops to

96
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,950
get a donor answer here just one click of a button you have a donor chart ready and so on just click

97
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,300
on see what you can get.

98
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,920
There's a tree map and here you even have waterfall chart so there's a beautiful beautiful wonderful

99
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,240
chart and you can see how the different regions add up into the total right there.

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,810
So I'm going to leave it at that.

101
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,090
Play around with this try dragging different columns onto the result zation you can remove a column

102
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,930
by just unchecking the box.

103
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:35,650
It's a very straightforward and intuitive control set that this still has it's just a matter of actually

104
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,910
practicing and playing around with food to get comfortable.

105
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,130
And once you've done that procedure the next tutorial and we will begin creating our Weasel's for the

106
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,330
section and of Accorsi next.

107
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
Until then happy analyzing.
