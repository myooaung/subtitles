00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.900
Hello and welcome to the course on power night as you can see we've created the second chord chart and

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.640
color it already and we're not actually going to explore right now.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.060
So we'll do all of that in the fall to Tauriel when everything is ready when the whole visualization

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.800
is ready.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.220
For now we're just going to add a final element or two final elements of isolation just so that when

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.640
we are exploring it is completed and we can derive all insights that we need.

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.150
All right.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.740
So we're going to add a tree map which we're going to add to tree maps.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.790
So we're going to add a tree up here and you guessed it we're going to add a tree map here.

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.210
So one is going to be for the creditor's Another one is going to be for the deaders And so let's go

11
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.080
ahead and do that.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.590
We'll take this very simple just say creditor's put them in here automatically goes into group take

13
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.810
them all and put it in here goes into values.

14
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.300
Simple that power be-I at its best.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.630
Creating things is very simple and so is this anything for this.

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.000
Before we proceed further that is amount done.

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.110
So now this the format is in view I remember we switch that element on so that now we can see the grids

18
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.500
and that will help us with the formatting.

19
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.880
Let's maybe take it all the way up to here.

20
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.610
And I'm just trying to count 1 2 3 7 7 boxes right 1 2 3 4 Less than 7.

21
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.290
OK so we've got to split this one somewhere here.

22
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.890
All right.

23
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.030
Yep that's good.

24
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
And this one as well.

25
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.040
This is the most fun part.

26
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.940
All right there we go.

27
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.480
Don't you think kind of like I don't like about partya is that we've put into charts and to this onto

28
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.000
this worksheet is in the same worksheet but the colors are different so you can see here and say let's

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.030
have a look.

30
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.190
Germany's red Germany's yellow.

31
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.710
I don't know.

32
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.670
And then Spain is grey Spain is yellow and so it's a bit of a nuisance to update the colors every single

33
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.340
time for every single Alsation And even if you like copy one from the other it still doesn't always

34
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.450
work the way that you want it to work.

35
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.970
So we're going to have to adjust that and we'll do that just now.

36
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.060
But what I want to show is that already we have a very powerful position here because I can.

37
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.510
When I click on something here this adjusts and all of these are just and again you can see like whoosh

38
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.350
and when you click on everything adapts and that's what we're going to be exploring in the further tutorial.

39
00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.460
But for now what I don't think is the best option for all these is that select a country here you can

40
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:10.590
see that these boxes in in the totals or in the tree maps they're actually only kind of adjusting so

41
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.920
the only highlighting is sort of like a whole box re-adjusting itself.

42
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.000
It's only highlighting the exact amount.

43
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.110
So first of all if we're going to do is we're going to add the labels.

44
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.980
Right so we're going to go to data labels.

45
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm going to put them on so that we can actually see the man's here and same thing here.

46
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.960
But the other thing that I wanted to do is I don't think the highlighting is the best option for us

47
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.220
so we're going to change that to a filtering so to do that we've already discussed this a bit in price

48
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.380
in the course such a selective resolution is going to be the most high resolution go to format quick

49
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.550
edit interactions.

50
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.470
And here you can see that you've got the option sites highlighting changes to filtering then uncheck

51
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.880
then like this one this is going to be the monster same thing changes to filtering and then this one.

52
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.420
So right now if I click this again it's also highlighting so click here filtering and click and click

53
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.130
on this one.

54
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.610
It's a monster now.

55
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.990
Click this and click filtering these ones as you can see they don't even have an optional highlighting

56
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.280
because that's the type of chart that we're working with Precourt diagram sort of possible to highlight

57
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.110
things and it will be restructured so.

58
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.750
OK.

59
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.580
So there we go.

60
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.680
So now when I click you can see that the whole chart is just a updating right away and it's easier if

61
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.050
I think it's easier to understand.

62
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.530
Again you might have a different opinion.

63
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.500
That's totally fine.

64
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.940
So do do it the way you think is right.

65
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.960
I personally think that it's easier to read when the whole tree map has adjusted like that.

66
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.860
So again we're not we're not right now we're not analyzing anything we're just making sure.

67
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.730
So we kind of performing the job of the developer of this Zeshan and the analyst.

68
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.860
That's what we're going to be doing in the next tutorial where we're going to be analyzing this resolution.

69
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.860
Now the final step is the colors obviously we can't leave the colors like so different right.

70
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.210
We could leave the colors different to the top part so we could change the colors to make some difference

71
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.480
differences but definitely these two boxes can have like United States green and then will you know

72
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.870
States not even on this one Spain yellow.

73
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.070
And then Spain gray or Germany red.

74
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.260
And then Germany yellow in this one it's just confusing.

75
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:37.980
And so we're going to need to change that so let's go into that data colors and again by now we already

76
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.810
know them off by heart.

77
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:49.650
We can just check here so there's only France and Spain that are not the medium and low risk.

78
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.670
So this is what Spain that's just that to this color as we had before.

79
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.400
The only thing here is now the currency the name the title here.

80
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.130
Not the best.

81
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.970
All right let's have a look at what this will look like.

82
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.500
France say again you can't really see the color and to see if we can change the

83
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.600
labels here.

84
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.110
The label maybe make it black.

85
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.490
Maybe that'll be better.

86
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.970
Well let's see how to look on the gray.

87
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.140
So that is gray.

88
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:27.930
Portugal is Iris Ireland higher as Italy high risk Britain.

89
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.730
Yeah it looks good so we'll leave it like Germany stable.

90
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.180
France and Japan.

91
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.970
OK.

92
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.520
There we go.

93
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.140
So that part is done.

94
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:47.300
And now we just have to do the same for this data labels black data colors.

95
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.810
It's a bit of a tedious process but that's what sometimes happens when you want to create something

96
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.150
amazing for your audience.

97
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:09.660
Greece high risk Ireland's high risk Portugal hydrous Spain Spain was medium risk Germany stable Italy

98
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.310
high risk by the end of this.

99
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.350
You are going to be an expert in the euro debt crisis of 2011.

100
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.050
OK so there we go and title here.

101
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.820
So let's just do this as well.

102
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.110
We're just going to change this to.

103
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.400
Or actually the total we had was actually the right amount like creditor and then this one as well title

104
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.570
changes to 12.

105
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.960
All right.

106
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.800
So there we go.

107
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:48.140
Everything is ready let's save that and let's have a look at how beautifully it adjusts.

108
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.720
So you can see very very beautiful resolution that we've created.

109
00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:01.200
And yeah so now we have to do all we have left to do is from some analytics and derive some insights

110
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.130
from this session and see what it's actually telling us and will proceed with that in the next tutorial.

111
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.570
Hope you enjoyed this one.

112
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.610
I'll see you next time.

113
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.350
And until then happy analyzing.
