00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Welcome to the Vue.js Academy course.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.775
I'm excited to have you with me.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:12.180
My name is Chris, and I'm a web developer and also an experienced online course creator,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.750
teaching thousands of satisfied students.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.510
Vue.js is one of the most up and coming JavaScript frameworks available today.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.930
It's also one of the most fun to learn and it's packed

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.960
with lots of amazing features enabling

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.425
you to build both small websites right through to complex single-page applications.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:39.570
So why choose this course over other Vue.js courses available?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.900
Well, this course takes a project-based approach.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.820
We will see exactly how each concept you will learn immediately fits into real projects.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.210
The course is beginner friendly too.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.070
We start by building a guest list application where we'll start off with the basics.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.520
I have provided a [inaudible] starter template for

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.555
the first project so we can dive straight into learning what Vue.js has to offer.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:12.020
During this project, you become confident with how Vue works,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.710
and also the core concepts such as binding data,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.505
methods, computer properties, and so much more.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:24.475
You will also learn about the Vue life cycle stages we can tap into.

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:28.480
Project 2 builds on what we've already learned so far.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.730
We introduce you to build tools and also improve

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.770
our workflow by using the latest technologies such as the Vue CLI,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.950
Webpack, and Bubble too.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.980
This project will be a greeting card application where the user can

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.925
edit and create their own personalized greeting card.

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.730
Along with this being a fun project to build,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.040
you will learn so many techniques,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.970
such as using components and how to pass data between

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.745
them along with integrating your app with Firebase for image storage.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.790
Also, we will cover adding animations and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.635
transitions to your apps to make sure they really stand out.

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:15.080
Everything you learn will be immediately put into practice in the projects to really

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.620
give you a better understanding of how they all fit into real applications.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.215
