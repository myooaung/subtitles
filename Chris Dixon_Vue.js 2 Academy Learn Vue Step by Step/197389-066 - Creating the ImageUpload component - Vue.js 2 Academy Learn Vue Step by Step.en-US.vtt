00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.925
Hopefully, now you should have Firebase initialized in your app with no console errors.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:10.530
If you do, then you're ready to create the image with flow components.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.445
This component will be responsible for doing a few things.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:21.180
You will have a HTML file inputs to allow users to select an image from a system.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.690
You will also push the selected image to Firebase.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.480
You will have a progress bar to show the progress of the upload to Firebase.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.330
They'll be an image preview thumbnail.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.900
Also have a bone to then confirm we want to use this selected image.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.855
Then finally, it will emit the name of the image selected to the parent components.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.720
Later on, this image name will be passed to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.765
the image output component to download the file from Firebase.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:56.060
Lets begin by creating the components.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.730
So go back over to the projects.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.095
Then inside of the card folder,

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:08.250
let's create a new file called image upload.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.450
With the dot view extension,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.660
the component will first use the card from the file.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.645
Let's go over to card front and import and register it.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:25.730
Down in the script, we're going to copy

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.710
the import statements then changes to image upload.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.050
The same with the file path.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.280
Then registered this down at the bottom as a components.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Somewhere combine ccImageUpload.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.265
Now we can insert the components as an element's wherever we want to.

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:07.130
I want to place mine just after the first text box.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.975
Scroll back up to the templates.

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:14.295
Just after this first cc text inputs,

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:24.100
I'm going to add ccImageUpload and the closing tag.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.870
I'm also going to add a horizontal line just to keep these separate. Then save that.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.780
Now we can add some HTML content inside of the component file.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.285
Let's go back over to the image upload.view,

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:47.220
and we can add our templates.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.685
Again, with our surrounding container,

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:58.775
which is our div, and let's add some bootstrap classes for the styling.

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.740
This is going to be a row,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.235
and let's inside of this div we can add a second div,

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:18.330
which is going to have the class of col-sm-12 to make this the full width.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.200
Then we want to add h4 with a text of upload image.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.960
This is going to be displayed at the top of the upload section.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.370
You can see exactly which section they are in.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.410
Then we want to add another div,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.450
which is going to be for the form.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.700
This div is going to have a bootstrap class of form group.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.270
Then inside here we can add our file inputs.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.410
This is the area which we can select a file from all system to upload to Firebase.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.840
The input type is of file,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.870
we'll add some styles of form,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:30.280
control file, will also need the ID which we'll use later of file upload.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.885
After this section, we're going to add a break tag.

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:37.070
Just add some space in.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.450
Then we can add to add our image elements.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.690
I'm going to give this an ID of image.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.145
What is the image source empty?

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:55.835
Because we had this later with JavaScript and we'll do that in the next video.

00:04:55.835 --> 00:05:03.305
This is effectively a empty elements until a image has been selected using the input.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.150
Then finally we can add a button at the bottom.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.750
This button is going to be used to set the image.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.275
Once the user can see the preview,

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:17.275
this button will then push the image of the Firebase.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.120
Let's add a type,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.160
a button type of button and also an ID which we'll use later of set image button.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.550
Then we can add up the script tags.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.965
Now no export defaults.

00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:45.240
Nucleus was empty just for now.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.520
Then finally, our style tags to finish off these templates.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.265
Now if we save that and go to the browser,

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:57.020
if we see no errors,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.235
we should now see the new components on the screen.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.700
We have the edge for title,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.225
we have the image upload section,

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:09.540
which we can click on and choose an image from a machine.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.860
We also have the set image button.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.155
This is all working fine.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.275
If you don't see the components or have a blank screen,

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:20.735
check over you call for any errors,

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:26.105
and also check the terminal and the console for any clues to where the error may lie.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:28.745
This is now the basic components setup.

00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:32.360
Next up, we'll continue with this components to display

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.880
the image thumbnail and also allow the selected image to be pushed to Firebase.
