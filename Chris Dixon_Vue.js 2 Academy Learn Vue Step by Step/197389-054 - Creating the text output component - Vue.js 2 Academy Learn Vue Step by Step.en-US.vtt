00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.425
We now have the text input components created and also display into the screen too,

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.325
now I'm going to create the text output file.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:16.500
This is going to be the component which displays the text onto the card.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.870
Again, just like the inputs,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.690
we'll be using three of these components to display the text onto the card.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.095
First, we can delete the textbox value fields from the card front file.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:34.540
Let's remove textBoxValue1, 2 and 3.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.210
We've already tested these and we know it's not working.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.149
As we did with the input components,

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.385
let's create a new component file,

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:49.105
this time called TextOutput.

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:51.990
Go over to the card folder,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.340
create a new file called TextOutput, with the.veu extension.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.700
Now we can add our template.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.415
For now this template is going to be pretty simple,

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.290
all I'm going to do is create a div as a wrapper,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.130
and then inside the div,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.770
just add some text,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.090
just of sample text so we can see the components on the screen.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.560
Just below the template, we can add our script tags too,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.550
and I'm just going to create a empty export default for now,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.170
followed by the style tags.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.880
Once you do that, we'll then need to import and register

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.490
the component inside of the CardFront.vue.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.000
We're down to the script section and then I'm going to just copy these import statement,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.545
and then paste it below.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.050
But this time change it to TextOutput.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.860
The same for the file path.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.380
Down in the component section, add a coma.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:36.870
I'm looking at our ccTextOutput.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.015
Give that a safe. Now we have access to the component in this file.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:48.130
It's times now add it to the card display area inside of the template.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.150
Go over to the card display section,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:00.640
and then we can add ccTextOutput and, the closing tag.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.175
As mentioned, we are going to be displaying this three times.

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:12.800
Eventually these output sections will display

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.020
the text from these three text input sections.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.605
Save that, and then start up the servers with npm run dev.

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:24.995
If you need to, then we can go over to the browser,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:28.045
and we see the component in action,

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:33.410
but we will pass the text to user types to the component in the next video,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.260
we'll take our first look at using props.
