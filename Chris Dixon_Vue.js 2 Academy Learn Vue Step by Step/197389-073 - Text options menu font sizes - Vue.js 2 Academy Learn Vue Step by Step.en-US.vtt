00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
We now going to return to our text output components and add an options menu.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.860
The menu will appear when the user hovers over the text with

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.840
the mouse over on the right-hand side to allow us to change the font size,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.295
text alignments, and even bold or italic options.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.150
In this video, I'm going to begin by setting up the menu to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.800
appear on hover and also add a font size option.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.950
So let's begin by creating our menu using

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.750
v-show to show or hide once you hover over this text area.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.470
So let's go over to our TextOutput.vue file.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.430
So just below the opening div,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.170
I'm going to add a form.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.875
This menu will be form as it's made up with form inputs.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.010
So I'm going to add a class,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.840
bootstrap class of small.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.945
This makes a form a little bit smaller,

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:09.055
so it fits inside the text output better.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.400
Then we can add our v-show.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.240
So we want to bind this to show options which are not yet created.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.860
Then I'm just going to add some simple text within P tags.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
So we just add test inside there.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.170
Now, below inside of our script we can set up this showOptions data property.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.650
We scroll down and I'm going to add this just below the props,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.100
so add our data.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.570
I've got the closing comma there.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.000
So this is going to return our showOptions data.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.310
So I'm going to set the initial value to be

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.060
true just to see if this is working okay in the browser.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.639
Great. So now we have the text of test appearing at the top of each components.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.650
So now we know it works, we can change this back to false.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:30.780
So only shows each time we hover over the area. Now it's removed.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.640
So to toggle the showOptions area,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.775
we can add some mouse event handlers if the user hovers over the text output div.

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:43.790
So open up the opening div.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.370
I'm looking at advanced called mouseover.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.370
So each time the mouse goes over the text area,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.450
we can set showOptions to be equal to true.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.320
We can also do the same each time the mouse leaves,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.950
but this time we're going to set the options to be equal to false.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.735
I'm going to save. Now we see it's hidden by default,

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.750
but if you hover over the text output area,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.315
we can see the text is displaying.

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:33.215
So now with this in place, we can add a select box to allow us to choose the font size,

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.500
which we want to use to the text.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.090
So go back over to the form.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.835
We can replace this P tag with a select area.

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:48.860
I'm going to begin with a label for this select area.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.350
So label for selectBox.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.690
Then I'm going to a title of font size.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.595
Let's make some space.

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:09.585
Then we're going to add our selectBox just below this label.

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:12.210
So at this select area,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.890
I'm going to replace this name with a Bootstrap class of custom select.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.310
Give this an ID of selectBox,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.130
which matches the label just above.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.600
Inside here we can add our options,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.335
and each one of these options is going to be a different pixel value for the font size.

00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:48.390
So the first one we're going to add as 42 pixels with the text of 42 pixels.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.220
Then we're going to copy and paste this to add some farther options.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.845
So we're going to add four options in there.

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:01.080
The second one of 48 pixels,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.040
the third one as 56,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.080
and finally, the largest of 64 pixels.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.470
So save that and let's see how this look in the browser.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.410
So now if we hover over the text output,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.920
we can now see we have the options to select the font sizes.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.120
We now need a way to use this selected value in the plates as a font size.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.620
It turns out we already have some of these setup.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.325
The P tags, which display the text we want to modify,

00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:44.315
already has a style object binding to it.

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:47.280
So we can simply add to this.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.460
First we need to add a data property and I'm going to call this setFontSize.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.060
So scroll down to the data and separated by a comma add

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.970
a new data property of setFontSize and set this to an empty string to begin.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.080
We can then add this to the select inputs using V-model.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.810
So scroll back up to the opening select tag and just after the ID,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.440
I'm going to add V-model and set this to be setFontSize.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.795
With this two-way data binding setup,

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:38.360
the setFontSize data property will be set to the selected value.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.705
Now we can pass the selected value to the style object, which we already have.

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:48.620
So scroll down to the style object,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.595
which is in the computed section.

00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:55.390
Then we can set the font size property.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.980
Because this is JavaScript,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.000
it needs to become a case.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.470
I'm going to set this font size to be equal to this.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.750
and want the data option of setFontSize.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.780
Then because this is just receiving a number when this adds pixels,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.990
once again, to this let's make it a CSS value.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.875
So now this should be done. So I'm going to save.

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:31.010
Now we should be able to try this in the browser and see if it changes the font size.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:38.990
So let's add some text into that and hover over and change the font size.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:47.975
That's looks good. Great. That seems to work and each time I click on a different size,

00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:50.900
we now see the text is changed.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.120
So that's working great for now.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.380
So next up we'll continue with this menu by adding the text alignment options.
