00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
As with all my courses,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.290
I like to waste no time in getting our hands dirty and actually building real projects.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.720
This course is no different and we're going to get

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.809
started by building a guest list application,

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.270
where the user can register their interests in

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.945
an event and have the name added to the guest list.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.585
The project will be relatively simple,

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:23.325
but we'll cover all the basics.

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.910
You will need to get started building vue.js-ups.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.830
Let's go ahead and get started.
