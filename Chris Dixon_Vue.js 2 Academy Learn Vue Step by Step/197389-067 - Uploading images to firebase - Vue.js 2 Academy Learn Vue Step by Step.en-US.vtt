00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.540
We have now set up the Component button,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.635
which allows the user to select a file from their system.

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.940
We also need to push this image to Firebase for storage.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.520
This functionality can be added to

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.020
a method which is called when the file input is triggered.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.205
We can detect this with a onchange event handler.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:28.065
Let's add this over in our template for the image upload.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.795
If you locate the file inputs,

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.365
we're going to add a onchange event handler.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:42.810
So use the at change and I'm going to set this to a method called uploadFile.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.925
Now we can go down to the script and set up our data and required methods.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.475
Within the Export Default,

00:00:54.475 --> 00:01:00.930
we can add our data property just in the usual way,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.875
and in data property what I'm going to set up is for the Filename.

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:14.910
Initially this will be an empty string until the user uploads a image.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.920
Then below this data section,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.870
we can set up our methods which we just called uploadFile.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.030
So setup the methods and then add our method name of uploadFile.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.085
Because this is an event,

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:44.285
we have access to the event data by passing in a name inside of the parentheses.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.070
This can be a name of your choice,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.870
but I'm going to call this name event.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.885
To begin, we want to grab the selected file and pass it to our file data property.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.020
Let's do a console log,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.910
and then we can log the value of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.250
the events and see how we can grab this file data from this event.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.915
Save that, and then if we go over to the Console,

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:24.900
right-click Inspect and then go to the Console.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.540
I'm going to upload a file with our file upload section.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.250
To follow along with this part,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.160
you'll need to find an image,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.250
if you don't already have one stored on your computer,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.865
there's plenty of free sites available where you can download a image to use.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.580
I've got one saved on the desktop,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.465
so I'm going to go over to desktop and click on Beach.JPEG,

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:52.050
and then click on "Open".

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.405
Nothing happens yet inside of the app, which is fine.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:03:00.365
But over in the console we have the value of the event.

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:03.575
Inside here you can see we have the targets,

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:07.800
which we can open up, and then if we scroll down,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.810
we need to look for our list of files, then open this up.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.470
If you click on zero,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.265
which is the first item,

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:19.880
we can see the details of the file which we just uploaded.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.535
We can see things such as the name,

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.940
the size, and also the type of image.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.850
We're only uploading one image at a time so we can always use position zero.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.780
Now we know where the file data is stored,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
we can pass it to our file data property.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.120
Let's go over to the method and remove the Console log.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.475
Now we can select this dot file,

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:52.665
which is our data,

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:59.050
and we're going to set this equal to the event.target.files,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.520
and then as we've just seen, we need to select position zero.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.510
To push this to Firebase,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.105
we need to add a Firebase storage reference.

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:18.365
This reference is the location inside the Firebase where want to add our files.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:22.275
We set up the storage reference like this.

00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:30.730
Let's select Firebase.storage.ref.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.770
Since we're referring to the storage and

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.275
ref methods which are parts of the Firebase module,

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:43.030
we'll also need to import Firebase into the file.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.270
Let's do this at the top of the script.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.040
So import Firebase from Firebase.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.345
Down in the ref, we're going to do two things.

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:07.285
First, we tell Firebase the folder name to store the images in.

00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:11.795
If the folder doesn't currently exist, it will be created.

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:15.985
This is the first argument which is passed in as a string.

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:21.620
Let's create a new file called user_uploads,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.470
followed by the forward slash.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.520
We can then add the file path after it.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.435
We add onto the end of this the Filename,

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:39.650
which we currently have as a data property.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.430
We're going to add onto the end this.file.name.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.170
This folder name plus this Filename

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.630
will create the file path to store the image inside a Firebase.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.040
We can then install this line of code inside a variable called storageRef.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.915
Now we have the storage reference.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:11.840
We can call the Firebase put method,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.740
to actually upload the image to Firebase.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.390
So the image you want to add is this.file.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.700
Now this is setup, we can go ahead and test this out.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.730
If we go back over to the Firebase Console.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.690
Go over to Firebase and then click on the Console to be taken to this page.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.915
Select the Creative Cards app,

00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:49.110
and then on the left-hand side we should see the storage option, click on that.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.339
This is the contents of our storage.

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.600
Currently there is no images listed here, so let's give this a go.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.220
If we go over to our app,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.820
we can attempt to push an image to this folder.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.035
Select the Image Upload,

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:10.900
and then choose the image and click open.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.109
Then let's go back over to Firebase and refresh.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.820
We can see after the refresh that nothing happens.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.050
We still don't have any images listed in the storage.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.635
If we go back over to the app and open up the Console,

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:33.330
and let's see what happens here.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.410
We can see that we have a error in the console.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.035
The reason we get this error is because by default,

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:45.625
Firebase security requires authentication.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:48.155
For the purposes of this demonstration,

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:53.405
I'm going to disable this just for our example so we can focus on view js.

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:57.370
Of course, for production level apps, we should not do this.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.465
To set the rules to public,

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:04.095
we need to go to the Rules tab and change this.

00:08:04.095 --> 00:08:08.460
Select rules from within the storage section,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.815
and then what we need to do is to change the write section,

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:19.690
and then we need to change this to allow read and also write.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.305
Delete this and just leave allow read,

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:28.080
write, and then click on "Publish".

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.190
Okay, so now let's go over to our app and then refresh,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.895
and then choose New File.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:45.475
I'm going to select the beach image again and click on "Open".

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:50.190
That's a good sign, we don't see any error messages in the console.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:57.465
Let's go over and then go to the files. Okay, great.

00:08:57.465 --> 00:09:02.670
Now we can see a new folder has been added called useruploads.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.820
This is the file that we added inside of our storage reference,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.030
and then we can go over to Firebase again and open up this folder.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:20.970
Now we also see we have the file of Beach.JPEG added.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.065
If this didn't work instantly for you,

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:28.985
you may need to just give it a few moments just for the new settings to take effect.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:32.195
Congratulations if you've managed to get to the stage.

00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:35.215
This is a big part of our app taken care of.

00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:37.350
Now we'll move on to the next video,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:43.620
we will add a image preview thumbnail so the user can see which image they've selected.
