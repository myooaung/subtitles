00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
In this application, we want to create

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.005
components to display the different sides of our greeting card,

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.840
such as the front and the back.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.990
We also want to switch between these components.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.110
When a user clicks on the menu links.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.895
Using Dynamic Components allows us to achieve this effect.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:27.910
We can switch between Multiple Components and place them in the same mounting points.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.465
All we need to do is to use the Reserve Component Elements.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.365
It can go in place of the Card Front Components.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:39.980
So if we go over to the app.vue,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.950
you will continue this current page output, so lets begin.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.950
Then if we delete the card front and replace it with components,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.620
make sure this is in the opening and closing tags.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.620
So now instead of rendering

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.515
the card front, component elements will render whichever section we click on.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:16.255
So already keeping track of the selected page using the Column Page Data.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:20.510
Now we can use the ease attributes to dynamically bind

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.970
the current page data to this new component elements.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.595
So inside of the opening tag,

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:34.010
we can use the v-bind directive and then binds the attributes of is.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.190
Inside here we can add the data property of Current Page.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.735
Remember we can also use the shorthand syntax,

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:46.280
which is just the colon.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.660
Now each time a page is clicked in the menu,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.600
the data is passed to the parents app.vue

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.920
file components and listens to this amazing event,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.350
and then updates the current page data.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.865
The component elements then changes the component it displays.

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:14.755
Based on this. We can see this in action in the browser.

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:18.290
If we save that and then refresh.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.320
Now if we click on the front,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.700
this is fine because we do have the card front component available.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.810
However, if we select any of the other three sections,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.370
would you see a blank page.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.975
So this is fine this means that everything is working.

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:40.320
The rest of these links will work from a create,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.400
the rest of the card components.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.530
We'll do this in the next video.
