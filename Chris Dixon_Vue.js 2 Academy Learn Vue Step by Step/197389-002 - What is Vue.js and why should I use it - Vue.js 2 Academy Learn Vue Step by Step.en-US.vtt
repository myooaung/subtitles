00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.825
If you are unfamiliar with vue.js or JavaScript libraries and frameworks in general,

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.315
some of the questions you may be asking is,

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:13.575
what is vue.js and why should I learn it in the first place?

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.115
Well, vue.js is a really fun and easy to use

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.165
JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:24.745
The core of the framework is very lightweight and fast,

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:30.170
and it can be used in projects of any science from easily dropping it into

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.050
an existing website or application to just using it to control a small part,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.434
such as adding a new components,

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:43.055
right through to medium or large single-page applications.

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:46.940
Considering the lightweight size of the vue.js core,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.370
it is still packed with lots of features which you will learn about during this course.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.240
The core can also be extended to add more features,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.445
such as frontend routing and state management.

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.810
If you've built websites before,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.375
you should already be familiar with HTML,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:11.085
CSS, and JavaScript, which are the building blocks of vue.js applications.

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.130
This means you can make use of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.140
your existing skills to [inaudible] up and learning even faster.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.675
Vue.js handles the view layer only,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:25.294
meaning you're free to integrate it with any of the libraries backends,

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.870
making it really easy and flexible to adopt.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.215
If you've used other frameworks or libraries such as React,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.170
a lot of the core concepts will be familiar,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.905
such as using a virtual DOM and building reusable components.

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.715
React is also great to use too,

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.050
but to my opinion,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.595
vue.js is a lot easier to get started with,

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:55.105
and is also being seen to outperform React on certain performance tests.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:59.690
These are just some of the reasons why vue.js has seen a huge rise in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.020
popularity and also looks at to become an even bigger player in the future.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.450
Now, we know some of the benefits of using vue.js,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.510
now let's get Visual Studio code setup,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.870
so we can jump straight into building our first project.
