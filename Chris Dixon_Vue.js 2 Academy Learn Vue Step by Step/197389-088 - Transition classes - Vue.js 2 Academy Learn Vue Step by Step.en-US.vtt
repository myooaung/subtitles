00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
When working with enter leave transitions,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.760
there are six classes which are applied during various stages of the transition.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.645
We have free for the interface which deals with starting,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.370
ending and also the active phase.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.530
The same also applies for the leaving phase,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.885
where we also have access to the starting,

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.545
leaving, an active classes.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.780
To understand what each one of these do,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.315
I've setup a simple transition drawn,

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.960
which sets the opacity of an elements or components.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.210
Here we have the interface and the transition begins in the v-enter class.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.345
Inside of this class, we can, for example,

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:47.060
add CSS classes to declare how the elements or components will begin to transition.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.765
In this example, our elements will begin as transparent.

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:54.320
So we could set the opacity to zero here.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.185
This only takes effect for the first frame of the transition.

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:01.660
So only use it for the initial startup phase.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.700
After this first phase,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.675
v-enter then removed, and then v-enter-to takes over.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:13.075
v-enter-to sets the ending state for the enter phase.

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.495
For example, here we could set the opacity to be one,

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:19.470
since the element is now inserted.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.935
During the full interface,

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:27.000
we also have access to another class called v-enter-active.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.795
Because this cozy full inter-phase,

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:36.470
this is an ideal place to add CSS to set the time duration or delay of the transition.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.710
Then we move on to the leave transition.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.535
Here, we basically have the same as the first three classes, revised.

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.895
For the first frame of the leaving transition is triggered,

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:52.015
we set the initial state with v-leave.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.300
Just like the interface is lasts for one frame,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.335
then v-leave-to, is responsible for the ending state.

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:03.500
Undecided when v-leave is removed after the first frame.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.210
V-leave-to is where we add the ending state for the transition.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.540
Just like before, the leaving transition also has a class which

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.995
covers the full leave in phase called v-leave-active.

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:24.030
Also too, this is ideal for certain things such as the duration of the transition.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.775
So these are the six classes we have access to during the transition.

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:32.735
The class names all begin with the v prefix by default,

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.335
when used with the transition elements.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.285
We can also add a name to this transition,

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:41.315
and this name would then replace the v prefix.

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:45.050
For example, if our transition had the name of fade,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.510
the classes will be called fade-enter,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.095
fade-enter-active and so on.

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:54.425
But these are some things which we'll take a look at in more detail in the next video.

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.450
We will begin to put this into practice.
