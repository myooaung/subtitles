00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.680
As it begins to build bigger projects both later on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.755
in this course and hopefully on your own in the future.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:12.225
It's worth knowing a few ways to make our code a little more compact.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.850
Even in the small app so far,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.815
we've used the V on and V binds quite a few times already.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:26.100
For this reason, view provides us with a little shortcut to make the syntax more compact.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.244
For the V by underactive,

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:32.595
all we actually need to do is to remove V-binds,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.455
leaving only the colon and the attribute we are binding.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:41.150
Let's open up our index.html and let's go ahead and replace all of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.090
our binding attributes with the shorthand syntax. I'll show you the first one.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.280
If we go to the first row,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.535
we find it the style of app styles.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.740
We just need to remove V bind,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.240
leaving only the colon and style, and of course,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.210
this is something you could go ahead and do yourself if you want to pause

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.355
the video and go for the index page and give us a go,

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:09.585
and then of course come back when completed.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.570
I'm going to keep moving down the,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.765
up and changing this.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:19.365
We also have the second row just below with the app styles too.

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:27.720
Let's change this. We don't have the "card header" with the class of form "submit class."

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.505
Let's change that, and then scrolling down.

00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:36.530
We also have the class on the input side,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.690
and then a little further down, it looks like the last one is

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.825
the final row with the class of "app styles."

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:50.635
Let's change this. But is also a shorthand for when using v-on.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.540
We used v-on inside of

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.845
the form elements to trigger a method every time the form has been submitted.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:02.890
Instead of using v-on, we can simply replace this with the at symbol.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.900
Let's go ahead and replace this now.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.610
Let's say this and just double-check it still working in the app.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.415
Our style seem to be working too.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:15.785
It looks like the classes is still bind it,

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.145
and now if we add a name to the form input,

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:23.120
we see that the name is still added to the guest list,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.300
which means that the submit button is still working.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.025
The shorthand syntax is optional and evil way is totally fine.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.115
As view JS deals with always in the background.

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:35.570
But for the rest of this course,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.200
we'll be using the shortest syntax just to keep our code more compact.
