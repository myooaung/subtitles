00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.240
So far, when using transitions,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.945
we've used the classes provided to us by vuejs,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.580
such as v-enter and v-leave, which you can see here.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.085
This is ideal for lower cases,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.180
but maybe times we want to use our own custom CSS classes.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.610
These situations can arise,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.780
particularly when using a third party library for animations.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.995
Animation libraries such as animate.css,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:36.645
work by including the library as a CSS file or by using a CDN link to the library.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.205
Then to access the animations,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.800
we use the custom class names for each animation,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.255
such as class equals bounds, f or example.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:51.080
We count out this custom class name using the hooks provided tools.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.200
However, instead, vuejs provides us with

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.570
some custom classes to replace each transition class.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.550
For example, we can add the anti-class attribute,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.985
with our own custom CSS class.

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:08.565
This will then replace the v-enter class.

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.440
We can see this in action if you head over to our app.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.860
Let's begin in the image output file.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.450
We gave this transition a name of scale,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.480
for the remove image button,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.740
also over in the app.vue,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.840
down in style section, down at the bottom.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
We then created the class names.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.955
We using of scale enter active and scale leave active.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.095
Rather than using these preset names,

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.105
we can ask the custom classes,

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.160
which we just looked at in the slides.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.535
To do this, over in the image outputs,

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.215
we can remove the name which you provided before.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.009
Lets remove the name attributes,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.160
and then on the next line I'm going to add some new attributes,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.900
to then set up our custom class names.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.300
So I'm going to start with enter active class,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.360
and then set is to our custom name of custom enter active,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.845
of course this can be any name.

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:18.900
Then I want to do the same for leave active class,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.990
and again set this to our a custom name.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.080
So I'm going to use custom, leave active.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.185
Now to link this to the CSS,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:38.135
let's go back over to the app.vue and then go down to the web-scale classes.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:44.125
We can then change is to activate phases to be our custom CSS class names.

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.880
So the first one, rather than scale,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.090
it was custom, enter active.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.995
Then of course the same for the leave phase of custom leave active.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:01.880
So give it a save and then let's refresh or check this out on the browser.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.620
So if all works well,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.730
we should now hover over the remove image button,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.065
and see it scale in and out just like before,

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.360
but this time using our custom classes.
