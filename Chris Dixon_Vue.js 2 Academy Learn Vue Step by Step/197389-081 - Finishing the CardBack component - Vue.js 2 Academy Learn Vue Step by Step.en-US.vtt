00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
We're now getting towards the end of the project,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.040
so well done for getting this far.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.220
The back is the last side of the card we need to finish,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.515
and it will look like this.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.260
Again, it should be simple because we've already

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.900
completed the components which make this up.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.600
We need to add the image upload and outputs,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.610
then just a simple copyright logo to finish things off.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.500
This will be a good chance to give this a go by

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.410
yourself by adding the image upload and then the upper components.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.710
Just remember, this one needs a callback method too to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.060
clear the image just like we used in the card front components.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.725
Let's head over to the card back components. Select that.

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:53.570
All we have at the moment is the text of the card back.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.110
I'm going to remove all contents and then go to the Card Front,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.995
select all and copy,

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:07.000
and then add this inside of the card back.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.325
Remember, the styles are no longer scoped,

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:15.430
so we can remove these, unless it will still apply.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.810
We don't have any text in the section,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.455
so only the image upload and image output.

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:27.170
We can remove the first two components.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.370
We are going to make use of this clear image method, so we can leave that in.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.790
Then open the data section,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.410
we only need the image name because we're not working with any of the textbooks values.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.805
We can also remove the imports for the text inputs,

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:53.190
and also for the text output,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.045
and then get to work on our templates.

00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:02.360
We need one CC image upload, which we already have,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.990
so we can remove the free text inputs,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.165
so the one from just above,

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:11.070
and then two from below.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.460
The same for the outputs, we can move the text outputs from

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.690
above and the two outputs from below.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.525
Now we only have the image upload,

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:26.630
and then the image outputs on the right-hand side.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.470
We're going to use the container heights,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.080
and this time I'm going to set this to be 400.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.095
We still need the clear image prop,

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.590
because we're going to use this to remove the image and then trigger

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.265
the method to then set the default image, which is here.

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:53.110
When all that done, let's hit our save and see how it's looking.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.390
Go to the back of the card,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.695
choose a file, then

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.790
set the image.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.510
Good, that's working.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.250
We also have the ability to drag the image.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.530
Then let's try and remove an image.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.990
Great. That's our default image working with the card back.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.720
Now this is working, this is the last section to be completed.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.305
We now have all the sections of our card all working.

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:34.820
I'll see you in the next video.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.740
We'll take a look at the event boost.
