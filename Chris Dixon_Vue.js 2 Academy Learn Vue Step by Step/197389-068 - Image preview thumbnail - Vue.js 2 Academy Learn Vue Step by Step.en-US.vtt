00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.060
We're making good progress with our greeting card up.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.150
The next step we want to take is take the image file data, which we now receive,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.820
stored in the file data property,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.865
which is just here, and display it inside an image preview on the screen.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:23.265
To do this, we're going to take advantage of the JavaScript file reader object.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:28.920
We'll use File Reader to read the contents of the image file, which we provided.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.400
We'll then pass the results of the events to

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.755
our image tag as a source attribute inside here.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.000
So let's take a look at how we can use it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.155
We're going to add this inside of our upload file method.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:48.990
So make sure that this is within the code basis.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.595
So this means that this will be triggered each time a file has been uploaded.

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:59.190
To be able to create a newly constructed file read object,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.655
install it inside a variable called reader.

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:06.040
So this is a new FileReader.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.510
Then inside this variable we can access a new method called readAsDataURL.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.725
This method reads contents of the file in which we pass to it.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:26.505
So the file we want to read is this date object here,

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:31.030
which you can access with this dot file.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.085
The A's and onload event handler,

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:36.855
which could also use.

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:39.790
So reader.onload.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.265
This onload event triggers a function.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:50.159
Each time reading operation has successfully completed,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.000
this function will take in the event as a parameter which holds the file data.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.030
This time I called the event E.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.390
Just not confuse it with the event name we've used before.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.910
So here will be good places at the image source where we want to display the thumbnail.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.320
We already have the image tag inside of our templates,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.090
which you just here, which has no source attributes. At moments.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.570
We can select it by the ID of the image and set

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.505
the image stores to be equal to the events target results.

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:35.450
So back down, we can select this image using JavaScript.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:48.540
So documents.getElementByID, and ID we gave the image or simply image,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.965
and we can use dot source to set the source equal to these events.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:03:03.250
So do that with e.target.result. To finish things off,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.200
we can add a max-width to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.790
this image to make sure large images don't mess with our layout.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.560
So within the same file,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.720
I'm going to go down to the startups,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.150
and this time it's going to be scoped,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.270
so only applies to this final.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.960
We can then target the image and then set

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.100
the maximum width of the image to be 200 pixels.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.130
So this should be all we need to now do.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.300
Select start up the server if it's not already running with npm, run dev.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.350
Once it opens, we should be able to select a file image and see appearing as a preview.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.010
Someone's choose my beach image once again and open it up. Okay, great.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.080
So now the file reader is all working and we can see

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.580
the image preview displayed on the screen by setting the image source.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.895
So next we'll add a image upload progress bar,

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.280
and also make this file data to the parents.
