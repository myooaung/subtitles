00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.415
This section is focused and how we can use build tools to improve our projects.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.085
Also, how we can improve our workflow,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:12.870
making it more suitable for mobility larger scale applications.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
We're going to use these new build tools to setup our next project,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.635
which is called Creative Cards.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.970
In this project, we'll build a greeting card application where the user can create

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.950
their own custom greeting card with their own custom texts and images.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.270
Hope you're looking forward to getting underway with the new project.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.570
Let's begin by installing both Node and NPM.
