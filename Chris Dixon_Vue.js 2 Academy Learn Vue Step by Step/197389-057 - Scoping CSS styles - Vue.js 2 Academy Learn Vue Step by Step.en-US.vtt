00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.390
Early in this section, we created all of the cards' components.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.635
We created the my copy card from file.

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:13.680
This file already had some styling inside the style tags.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.650
If we go down to the bottom of Card Front,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.810
we can see in between style tags,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.655
we have the edit area and card display styles.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:30.735
Duplicating this file also added the same styles to all of the card files.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:35.610
For example, if you go to Card Back and scroll down to the style,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.490
we can see we have duplicate code.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.370
If we're to delete the styles out of this CardBack.vue file,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.255
let's save that and see what happens.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:54.430
We go to the browser and then if we go to the "Back",

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.650
we can still see that the styling still applies because we have the background color,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.510
the padding, and also the height of 800 pixels applying.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.410
This is because any style in which we add inside

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.970
the component file will still apply everywhere in our app.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.715
To reduce the code inside of our app,

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:21.785
we can delete all the styles from the Card Back, which we've already done.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:29.560
The CardInsideLeft, so move these to styling sections.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.000
Then finally from the CardInsideRight.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.820
This now just leaves our styling inside of the original CardFront area.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.265
Leaving the styles only in the CardFront file because they will apply to all the rest.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.110
But what if we had a case where we want to contain

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.595
the CSS to a single particular component?

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:03.580
For this case, we can add "scoped" to the opening style tag just like this.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.590
Add the scoped attributes and save that.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.005
Now we go over to the browser.

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.360
If you go to the Front,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.610
we can see that the styling applies inside the Card Front.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.775
Let's try InsideLeft, InsideRight,

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:25.695
and also the Back.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:31.375
Now we can see that the styling is restricted to a single file component.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:36.300
I'm going to go back over to the Card Front and remove "scoped".

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.160
This is because you want it to apply it to all of the other pages.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.435
However, we do have some uses for using scoped inside our app.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.510
For example, over in the TextOutput file,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.850
we can output the text inside of the HTML p tags.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.120
We can then style this text and have the styling only

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.720
apply to the text displaying on the actual card,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.540
which is this area inside our templates.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.685
Let's go down to the style and add "scoped" inside here.

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.805
This only applies to the TextOutput.

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:20.675
Then I'm going to set a new font family to apply only to the card section.

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:25.410
I'm going to go over to Google and select a Google Font.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.250
I'm going to search for Google Fonts

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.360
Tangerine and then select that.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.460
This is the font that I'm going to use for this project.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.980
You can of course change it if you prefer.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.035
Once you've selected your font,

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:52.750
click on the plus symbol at the top,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.110
and then we can expand.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.690
Here we're given some instructions on how to add the Google Fonts.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.200
The first thing you want to do is copy the link at the top.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.380
This is the link for the style sheets.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.740
Then go over to the index.html,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.560
and then we'll add this just below the bootstrap link.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.620
Paste that in there and give that a save and back over to Google Fonts.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.010
We can then copy the line of CSS.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.620
Copy this and then we can add this into our TextOutput file inside

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.620
the CSS for the P elements and then paste in the code which you just copied.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.680
Save that, make sure the development server is up and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.900
running then go back over to the project.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.645
We'll start typing inside the input components.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:00.115
We can see that the text is applying,

00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:03.115
although it's really small for now but it is working,

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:05.735
and we can see the fonts are applying.

00:05:05.735 --> 00:05:10.815
To fix this, I'm going to go back over to the file and add some more styling.

00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:17.020
I'm going to set the default font size to be 42 pixels.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:25.260
I'm also going to match the line height of 42 pixels.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.740
Just to give it a little bit of a better look,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.509
I'm going to add the text-shadow of two pixels,

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.005
two pixels, two pixels for the three sides;

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.370
and then the color of aaa.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.210
The color of the text,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.010
I'm going to add mine as 4d4d4d.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.889
Going to also add some margin,

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.080
five pixels on the top and bottom,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.260
and zero on the left and right,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.515
just to give it a little bit of spacing.

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:05.400
I'm also going to add a border and we'll see why soon.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.320
Just a one pixel dotted and a gray color.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.720
Then the white-space property of pre-line.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.720
Pre-line preserves the line breaks,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.660
which stops all the texts appearing on the same line.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.610
If the user hits "Enter" and starts typing in a text box on the line below,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.960
the same will apply on the output side so everything's not on the same line.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.390
Then finally we're going to overflow of hidden,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.595
just in case the user types in too much text which can't fit on the area.

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:52.000
We save that and see how that looks.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.965
Now we see the text is a little bit bigger,

00:06:57.965 --> 00:07:00.980
and we also have some font shadows.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.600
I don't seem to see the dotted,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.025
I will change that to be dotted and there we go.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:13.005
You notice that we have some pretty, ugly-looking dotted lines.

00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:15.725
This is because without the text,

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:18.455
the dotted line border has no height.

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:21.470
We can ignore these for now because we'll pass

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.515
down props to these components in the next video,

00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:27.249
which will set the height of the components.

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:31.040
Then we'll have a nice dotted border around each section.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.935
The main thing is a text for the card is style now.

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:38.400
These styles are scoped to apply only to these components.
