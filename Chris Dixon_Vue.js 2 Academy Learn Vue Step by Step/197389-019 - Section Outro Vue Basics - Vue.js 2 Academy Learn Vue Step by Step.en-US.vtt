00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.780
Congratulations on reaching the end of this section.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.075
Hopefully already you can see how fun and easy is to get started with view JS.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.135
You've already learned a lot of new concepts,

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:15.105
such as how to set up the view instance,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.150
two-way data binding, event handling,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.475
lists handling and much more.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.520
In the next section we'll step things up a little by

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.535
covering even more essential view topics,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.639
along with completing our guest list application.
