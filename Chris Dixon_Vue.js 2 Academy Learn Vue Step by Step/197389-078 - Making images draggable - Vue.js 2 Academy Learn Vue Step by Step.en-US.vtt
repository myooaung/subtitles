00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.365
All the image functionality is nearly in place now.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.630
One of the problems as we have mentioned,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.445
is if you upload an image,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.865
which is larger or smaller than the Cal Container,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.100
it doesn't look too great.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.340
We can add jQuery into our app,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.955
to easily make our image draggable, by the user.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.430
If you're not familiar with jQuery,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.670
it's a JavaScript library which allows us to easily,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.074
add features, such as DOM manipulation,

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:34.020
animations, and event handling, to name a few.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.585
On top of this, there is also the jQuery UI Library,

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.050
which adds user interface functionality,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.560
such as effects and interactions.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.555
This will be the library which gives us the draggable feature.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:54.370
Let's begin by linking our project to jQuery.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.050
I have gone to Google, gone to search for the jQuery Google CDN.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.275
The one we need is these hosted libraries,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.970
so I'm going to click on this.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.420
Here from the menu on the right,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.330
we first need to grab the jQuery recall,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.925
we click on the jQuery band.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:28.445
I'm going to copy the latest version free,

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:31.645
and add it to the, /index.html.

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:36.010
We'll copy the script tags for version three,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.330
and then go over to the /index.html,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.840
and we can add these just after the Google fonts.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.510
Paste I enter. Then we can select the jQuery UI link.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.085
Click on the jQuery UI,

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:07.100
so emoticons copy the script and not the style sheets.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.275
Copy the script section from the opening to the closing tag,

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:16.630
and then paste this, just blew the jQuery, recall.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.260
This is important, it must be placed below the jQuery recall,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.310
for it to work, correct.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.450
Give them a save and then if we go over to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.440
the image output components, we can set this up.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.700
Scroll down to the bottom of the script,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.100
locate the closing script tag and make sure this code

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.985
is outside of the view JS incidence.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.860
Under only view JS code,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.950
I'm going to add a JavaScript function called, SetDraggable.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.800
This is just plain JavaScript.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.360
In this function we need to grab the image which we want to drag,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.630
by its ID, so the image has an ID of outputs image,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.220
which you can see just here.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.660
Back down to our function.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.715
Within a function body, we can use the $ symbol.

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:23.420
We use this $ symbol in jQuery, to select an element,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.980
rather than when using vanilla JavaScript, such as document.getElementByID.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.540
Inside the brackets, we can add this as a string,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.525
so you see '#' because it's an ID,

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:40.210
and the ID was output image.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.410
We then add /.draggable to the selected elements.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.415
All is now left to do is to call the setDraggable function, where we need to.

00:03:55.415 --> 00:03:57.380
I'm going to add this function call,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.260
inside of the display image-watcher,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.755
just after the Image Source.

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:05.945
If we scroll up to the display image,

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.890
and this is inside the watch section.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.225
Just underneath the Image Source,

00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:17.440
we can add this call to the function, of setDraggable.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.765
This is our draggable functionality now setup.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.050
Let's see if it's working okay in the browser.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.580
Give that save on it's head over to Chrome, barcodes projects,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.770
and then we need to select an image,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.370
and then click Set Image.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.165
Once it loads up, we try clicking on the Image you can now,

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:54.390
drag the image around the section,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.320
and lets go to finish this off with one piece of CSS.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.290
If we go back to the image upper components,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.015
and scroll down just below the button,

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:09.695
select the image, and then all want to do,

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:14.850
is set the width of the image to be a 130 percent.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.365
This makes the image a 130 percent of the container,

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:23.020
and I have added this in for two reasons.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.920
First, it deals with the problem of images being a lot bigger,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.485
or a lot smaller than the container.

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:34.580
Second, by making the image a little bit bigger, than the container.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.705
It gives the user some extra freedom when dragging the image around.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:42.604
This is now done with the image and text components,

00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:46.680
we can now go ahead and add these to the rest of the card.
