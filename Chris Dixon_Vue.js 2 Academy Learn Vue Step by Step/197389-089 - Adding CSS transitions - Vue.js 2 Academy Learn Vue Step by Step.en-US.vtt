00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
Back in the creative cars projects to begin to put some transitions into practice.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.180
Now we've seen the transition classes we can use.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.210
The first technique I want to show you is to apply

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
a transition refer to elements or components.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.680
I'm going to head over to the TextOutput.vue file.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.535
So it's like the TextOutput.vue.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:31.125
I'm going to add this transition wrapper around the form elements.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.250
This is the options menu which appears when you over the text.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
This is ideal for adding a transition because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
currently it only shows and hides without any type of effects,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.465
such as fading in and fading out.

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:51.250
So what we need do above the form the transition wrapper.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.080
So the opening is like that and then down at the closing form,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.990
going to close off this transition and give that a save.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.030
Beware though that the transition elements can only be used in certain cases.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.860
We can use it with V,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.160
if of V show also we components,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.070
which we'll look at soon.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.020
This form section works with V show.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.105
So we find in the last video we mentioned naming the transition.

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:28.790
To provide a name, we add this name inside of the transition opening tag.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.390
So back up to the transition. Open the tag.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.460
The transition will be used to fade the menu in and out. Let's call this fade.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.010
So name equal to fade.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.685
This transition name replaces the V prefix in CSS.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:52.165
So let's set this up in the style section.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:56.420
So scroll down to the style tags down at the bottom.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.015
We're not this just after the select.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:03.555
Here we can add all of our transition classes.

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.880
Let's begin with fade-enter,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.740
fade-enter-active,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.880
fade-enter-to, fade-leave.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.540
The last two is fade-leave-active.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.140
Finally, fade-leave-to.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.490
This fade is the name of the transition which we've gave.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.990
This is the replacement for the V prefix that we mentioned before.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.855
This may look like a lot of things going on here,

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:54.320
but we can't simplify things for this example.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.930
So if we look at this example from before,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.085
V answer has the capacity of zero.

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.610
Also in the leaving transition,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.515
v-leave-to also has the capacity of zero.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:11.515
So we can combine these Inside the CSS to make things a little bit more simple.

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.715
So over the top we have fade-enter.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:20.160
I'm also going to add fade-leave-to put

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.710
this section and enter the braces and have them combine this with fade answer.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.550
We're going to set the opacity just like we've seen in the example before.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.820
This is going to be zero.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.205
Also v-enter-to and v-leave has the same CSS opacity of one.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.080
So we could also combine these.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.195
However, we don't need to do this.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:58.415
The reason is because CSS opacity is set to one by default.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:02.710
There is no need to declare it unless is something other than defaults.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.025
The opacity we set at zero will be removed after the first frame,

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:09.290
which will then restore the defaults.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.635
This means we can remove v-enter-to.

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:19.210
Also v-leave for this example. Let's remove those two.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.955
So this just leaves us with the active classes for the enter and leave phases.

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:32.270
We can use a certain length of time the transition takes to appear and also to remove.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.030
These two classes can also be combined.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.380
Set the same transition time, keep it even.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.010
So let's cut this one.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.470
Then let's add this just in there.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.215
Then let's add transition to both of these classes.

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.070
So we're going to use CSS transition property.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:05.100
So we want to set the opacity of a 0.5 seconds. So give that a save.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.295
Now if we go over to the browser,

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:10.565
and then if we hover over one of the elements,

00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:16.450
we can see that the menu nicely fades in and out of a half seconds.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.610
This just looks a little bit nicer than did before.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.675
Another thing we can do is we can also move the CSS for this phase fade

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:28.490
transition and add it into the up-to view file as a global style.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.015
They'll be useful if we wanted to add the fade style into all the elements.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:35.985
Let's go over to the CSS.

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:40.875
If we cut out the styles, save the file.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.880
Then if we go to the app.vue,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.020
can paste these in as global styles.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.800
So just at the bottom, paste these in.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.630
Now if I hover over the menu,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.920
we can see that the phade still applies.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.450
While we're at it, we can also do the same for

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.970
the remove image button to make it nicely fade in and out.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.115
So I've got the image output file

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:10.165
and then to round this button we can do exactly the same.

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:18.120
We can add the transition wrapper and then give this a name of fade.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.560
Then close off this wrapper.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.700
Just like that and give that a save.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.185
Now if we go to the app,

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.060
we can now see that the button,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.285
as well as the menu, nicely fades in and out.

00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:38.405
So this is a simple example of a transition,

00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:41.960
but it really makes a difference to the look and feel of our app.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.410
Next, we will look at adding inCSS animations.
