00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.755
Congratulations for reaching the end of this section.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:09.630
We have covered so much in this section including working with Firebase,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.970
adding the text options menu,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.595
working with components, and also alternative ways of passing data between them.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.230
By now, we should also have

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
a fully functional greeting card application packed with features,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.865
and hope you've learned a lot from it, too.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:31.245
You have now learned a lot about building applications with Vue.js.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:35.500
Now, let's continue learning in the next section.
