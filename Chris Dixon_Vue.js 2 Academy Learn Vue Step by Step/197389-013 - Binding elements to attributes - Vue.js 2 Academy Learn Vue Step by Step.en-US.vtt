00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.055
I want to now show you how to use a directive called v-bind.

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:11.665
We use this directive to work with normal HTML attributes such as class,

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:15.110
source, and the href attributes.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.390
These are all just normal HTML attributes.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.250
However, we can not pass in reactive data to them using the double curly brace syntax.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.860
So in the index.html,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.000
if we locate the event date div with the class of card-header,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.310
it would try to add a new class with the name of

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.135
[inaudible] and add this using a double curly brace syntax,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:44.150
this won't actually work.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.970
So to demonstrate this, let's add a new property over in app.js inside the data objects,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.715
just below the guestName array.

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:58.250
So let's add 'formSubmitClass'.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.520
We'll use this to add a new class name whenever our form is submitted.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.400
To change the background color of the card headed div and also the blue button to green,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.525
I will initially set this to be an empty string.

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:17.195
To begin with, because we only want to add a class when the form is actually submitted,

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:20.095
so down in the form-submitted method,

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:24.835
right at the very bottom, I'm going to add the formSubmitClass,

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:29.390
and then we can set this to be something new each time the form is submitted.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.580
So I'm going to set this to be a text string of Submitted.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.125
So now each time a form is submitted,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:40.255
formSubmitClass will be set to the value of Submitted.

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:41.910
Now down in the CSS,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.990
we can set the submittedClass to have a background color of green.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.480
So let's save that and go over to the browser.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.685
So you can see if we refresh and then hit the Submit button,

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.630
that the background color doesn't change.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.360
So this is expected behavior because we mentioned before that

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.035
the cards add dynamic data as an attribute.

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.630
So to apply this class in HTML,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.505
we need to do two things.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:20.390
First, we need to remove the curly braces from

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.590
the class and just have the data property inside of the causations.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.190
Then second, we need to add the v-bind prefix to the attribute name.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.840
So now it's worth noting as you can see

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.500
inside of this element we do have two class attributes.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.280
One is the static HTML class which you can still

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.750
use and also the one we just added with v-bind,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.400
which is reactive and under the control of view.js.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.925
We can also bind this attribute on more than one element, too.

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:59.480
So let's add the formSubmitClass to the submitButton, too.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.615
This also means that if our data changes,

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:06.370
the update will be reflected everywhere,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
too. So now let's give this a go.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.075
If we save that and then refresh the browser and add a name,

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:18.580
we can see once the form is submitted that we do get the new background color.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.730
So just as a quick recap of what we have done there,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.500
we went into the HTML page and then added a class of formSubmitClass.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.205
Then inside of our data objects,

00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:34.125
we set this formSubmitClass to be empty originally.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.760
So this means that initially no new styles are added.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.114
We then changed his empty string to be the text of Submitted,

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:44.945
just below inside the formSubmitted method.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:47.750
So each time the form is being submitted,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.785
the text of Submitted is added as a class.

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:53.960
So we're not limited to just binding to classes,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.455
but combined to any normal HTML attribute too,

00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:00.530
such as we can add a source attribute if we are working with

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.595
images and have the image file path controlled by view.

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:07.205
The same with adding the style attributes,

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.380
and this is what we'll look at in the next video.
