00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.605
For this course, we will need a few things to get up and running.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.245
First, we need a text editor.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.370
You may already have a preference or one that you already use.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.850
For this course, I'll be using Visual Studio Code,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.145
which is ideal for JavaScript coding,

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:22.210
and also has a built-in terminal which we'll need later in the course.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.690
You can use any text editor you like but here are some popular texts editor options,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.345
such as Atom, Brackets,

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.260
WebStorm, and of course, Visual Studio Code.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.880
If you already have one of those and have a web browser,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.415
feel free to move on to the next video.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.865
If not, I would recommend that you go over to

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:50.155
code.visualstudio.com and follow the download instructions for your platform.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.580
Once you've done this, comeback and we'll add

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.310
some plug-ins to help them working with Vue.js.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.345
Once the installation is completed,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:02.525
I'm going to add a plug-in to add Vue.js to

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:06.730
code snippets and also some syntax highlighting.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.010
If you open up your text editor and click on

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.850
the extensions icon at the bottom of the options,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.325
you'll see I already have Vue 2 Snippets installed.

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:25.070
To install this, you can click on the search bar and search for Vue 2.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.965
What I'm going to use is Vue 2 Snippets,

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.740
which is by [inaudible] ,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.345
then click on the install button and you're good to go.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:37.280
Finally, you will also need a web browser.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.740
I would recommend Chrome by Google,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.860
but you can use any web browser you like.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.900
This is it for the initial setup.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.970
Now let's jump into building our first Vue.js application.
