00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.985
We now have all we need to enable us to create the image output components.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.525
Let's actually display the image over on the card.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:14.490
We begin in the usual way by creating the image output components.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.610
I'll go over to Visual Studio and I'm

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.330
going to add these components inside the current section.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.990
This is going to be called ImageOutput.vue.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.890
So let's begin by creating our templates at the top and then our script tags,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.570
we use for now an empty export default.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.990
Then finally the style tags and then save that.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.860
Then once this is done we need to import and register inside of the CardFront.vue.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.745
Remember the CardFront is going to be the container,

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:08.810
which contains all the image and the text components.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.370
So scrolling down to the script section,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.290
I'm going to import

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.080
our ImageOutput from./ImageOutput.vue.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.210
So we should able to see a little bit of a pattern emerging here.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.050
If you look at the front of the card,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.800
we have the TextInput and TextOutput,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.305
followed by the ImageUpload or the ImageInput and then also the ImageOutput.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.990
So putting data in,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.670
passing it to the parent components and then passing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.015
this data down to this child as props.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:57.010
Now let's register this in the component section.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.060
So I'm going to call this ccImageOutput,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.110
which of course is the ImageOutput which we just imported.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.505
This now means you can place the components inside of our selected location,

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.950
inside the card display.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.940
So inside of this card display section,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.730
I'm going to remove the double curly braces from before and then adding our ImageOutput.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.520
Just like the editor area,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.190
I'm going to add this as the second component.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:46.020
So cc-image-output and the closing tag.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.655
Next we need to pass in some props.

00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:56.870
First the name of the image to download,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.895
which you store in the image name dates property, which is just here.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.455
Let's add the first prop into the opening tag.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:12.690
So use the colon to bind this and we're going to call this prop the displayImage.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.730
Then pass down the value of imageName.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.455
Then the second prop we're going to add is also this container heights,

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:38.335
which is just the same as the textsOutput.

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:42.215
So this time I want the image to be a little bit bigger than the text,

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:49.275
so I'm going to set this to be 350, so save that.

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:54.015
Now we can go over to the imageOutput and begin working inside there.

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:56.685
The template is pretty simple.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:01.640
At the moment, we will just need an image element to display this image.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.790
So let's create the div as the wrapper.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.275
Then inside of that we're going to create

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:17.250
our image and then we don't need a source for now.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:25.560
All we want to do is add an ID and set this equal to outputImage.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.345
So remember this component is receiving props,

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:35.230
so we need to have prop validation.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.310
Down in the export default,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.435
we can add our props inside here.

00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:43.760
Then this is going to be an objects.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.695
So the first one is for the display image,

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:51.460
which is the first prop which you pass to it.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.270
Inside here we're going to set this to a type of string,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.140
then separated by comma.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.040
We can also add the container high prop.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.160
This would be a type of number.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.180
By default we'll also set this to be a value of 200.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.400
Now what I am placed test,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.920
we are actually receiving these props looking output

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.965
the display image up inside the template.

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:38.840
So open up the double curly braces and then output the display image,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.190
which is a prop which we're receiving from the parent, which is just here.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.085
Give that a save and let's check this out in the browser.

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:54.910
Choose a file and upload the image.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.680
So we can see the name has been downloaded and this is

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.920
a probe which is being passed to the components from the parents.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.310
Then let's add some styles to match the textbox dialing.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.340
So scroll down to the start section at the bottom.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:24.180
In fact, we want to add a class to the surrounding do first of image container.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:34.055
We can use this target inside of the style section, so.image-container.

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:43.000
Then inside here we're going to add our border which is going to one pixel and dotted.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.280
Just like the textbox,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.680
the overflow can be hidden.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:03.100
Also a margin of five pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.430
So at the moment we're receiving the container high prop,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.630
which we've been passed.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.430
But we're not actually using it to set the height of the container.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.230
If we go over to the textOutput.vue file,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:27.270
we set to obey computed property to use this prop as a style objects.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.860
The code inside the image output will be exactly the same,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.740
so I could just copy and paste this computed section.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.930
Then go back over to the imageOutputs.vue.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.910
Then we can paste this inside of our objects.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:53.840
So locate the closing props tag and add a comma and then paste this in.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.595
Now all that's left to do is to bind the styleObject to the container-div.

00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:07.830
So go up to the surrounding container using

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:13.180
the column we combined the dynamic styles and set this to our styleObject,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.915
which is the computed value that we just added so save that.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:23.450
Start the div server and let's load this up inside the browser.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.970
The first thing you will see if it's all working correctly is there is

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.860
a image container which is larger than the textOutput container.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.855
This is because we set the image to be 350 pixels.

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:46.580
Whereas we only set the container for the textBox to be 130.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.220
Then we can also see if we upload our image.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.800
The image name should be passed to the card via props.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.345
We have this working correctly, well-done.

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:07.820
You are now ready to use the image name to download and display the image onto the card.
