00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.155
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:10.545
By now, you should be feeling a lot more confident of building applications using vue.js.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:13.364
We have covered a lot so far including,

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:15.930
learning how to install vue and to how to use

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.470
the vue Instance along with all the properties we can add to this Instance,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.279
such as data, computed, methods and filters.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.605
During building these projects,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.725
we've also looked at list and conditional rendering,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:38.500
two-way data binding, and also directives which vue.js providers us, to name a few.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.265
We then dive a little deeper by setting up a better workflow

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:46.430
by using modern build tools such as the vue-cli,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.800
where, pack and also bubble.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.760
This allows us to take a step towards building larger,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.440
more maintainable apps by split up our code into components,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.235
a passing data using various methods.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:05.250
Thank you for taking this course and bye for now.
