00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
I hope you've enjoyed this section and building your first project.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.690
By now, we should be getting a lot more familiar with

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.885
how Vue.js works and what it can do.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.290
If you still feel a little overwhelmed, don't worry.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.870
This is completely normal and you'll get

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.435
lots more practice of what you've learned so far.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:26.700
We are now going to move on to a new section where not only will we begin a new project,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.025
but we'll also look at how we can use build tools and how they can improve

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:38.020
our project setup along with our workflow. I'll see you there.
