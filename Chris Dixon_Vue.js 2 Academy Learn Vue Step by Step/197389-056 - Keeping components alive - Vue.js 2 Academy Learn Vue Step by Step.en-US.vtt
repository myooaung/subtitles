00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
When using dynamic components and switching between them like we are here,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.500
there is a small problem created which we may need to address.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.635
If we type something into one of the text input boxes like this,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.130
we see the result on the right-hand side.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.845
The problem occurs when we switch the active component using the manual links.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.605
If we select a different components,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.840
such as Inside Left,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.190
then return back to the Front.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.845
We see the text we added is lost.

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:43.100
Also late in the project when we add text and image inputs to all pages.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.690
The same thing will happen to all these components too.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.210
Why does this happen? Well, early in the course,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.550
we looked at the view lifecycle,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.160
which is the stages of view instance goes

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.375
through from curation right through to being destroyed.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.195
When we change the dynamic components,

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.175
component or move away from,

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.950
is then destroyed and removed from memory.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.500
View jazz providers with a simple solution to this.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.540
All we need to do is to wrap

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.290
our dynamic components with ANOVA reserved elements called keep life.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.030
If we go back over to our text editor and then go over to the app dot view,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.050
we have a component which is registering the current active page.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:44.190
Let's wrap this inside of the Keep-Alive wrapper to add the opening tag,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.830
and after the component,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.720
we can add the close tag too.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.915
I didn't save that. Now if we go over to the browser,

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:06.560
we can start by adding some data inside the first text area,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.330
and a now if we move away and then go back over to the front,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.120
we'll see that the data is now being preserved.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.950
This is a really simple solution which view

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.570
GS providers to keep dynamic component data inside of the memory.
