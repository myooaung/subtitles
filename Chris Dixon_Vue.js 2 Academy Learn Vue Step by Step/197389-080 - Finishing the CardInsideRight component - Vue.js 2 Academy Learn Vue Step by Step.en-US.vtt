00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.725
Now, we're going to move onto the inside right of the card.

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:09.690
This should be pretty straightforward as we've already done most of the work.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
We just need to add the three text inputs and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
output components to make this open like we can see here.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.265
It's pretty much a repeat of the inside left,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:25.515
but we need to add three components and also three date properties too.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:29.250
Let's head over to the card inside right.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.375
Currently, we just have the text of card inside right.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.285
I'm going to go to the inside left section,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:38.655
which we added in the last video,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:47.130
"Command" or "Control A" to copy all and then go into the inside right and then paste

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.390
this in place of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.870
the current data and then we can duplicate the text input two more times,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.715
so copy this and paste it in two more times.

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:06.600
The only difference is that we need the textBox to be value2 and then value3.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.750
Also, the same for the textOutput,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.920
got to "Copy" and then paste this in two more times,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.795
changing the textBox value to be one,

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.130
two and then three.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.010
Then I'm going to set the containerHeight to be height of 240,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.495
so all three can fit on the card and then now down to the data,

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:40.400
we already have our text input and output components.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.555
These both in imported, so that's fine,

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:51.640
but I need to return a textBoxValue2 and also three.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.990
We already have the components set up,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.215
so all we need to do is save and see how it's looking in the browser. This is the front.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:06.060
Move over to the inside right,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.690
so we've got the three components, so box one,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:23.300
box two, and box three and we can also see once you hover over all three,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.910
they will still have the individual menu for each one.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.520
Because these have the own dates property,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.290
these all work independent,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.785
so the menu options only apply to the section.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:39.220
This is now the card front,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.565
the inside left and inside right completed,

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:47.930
which leaves us with just a back to complete and we'll do this in the next video.
