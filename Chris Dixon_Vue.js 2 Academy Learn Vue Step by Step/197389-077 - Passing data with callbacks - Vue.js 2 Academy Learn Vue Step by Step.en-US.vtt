00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.950
We've already looked at parent-child component communication.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.975
We know a parent passes data to a child via props,

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:15.375
and also a child passes data to the parent with a custom event.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.715
There is an alternative too,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.695
which we want to make you aware of,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.755
and this is by using callback functions.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:27.720
I'm going to demonstrate this with a button which were added in the last video.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.545
It works a little differently to emitting custom events.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:37.290
This time, we need to add the functionality inside of the parent components, so,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.490
we need to create a clear image method inside of CardFront.vue, so,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.320
let's go over to the CardFront ,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.625
and then open this up, and then we can go down to the method section.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.355
In fact, we need to create this.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.630
I'm just going to add this after the data section,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.180
so, add this in there with the comma to separate.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.140
I'm going to add the method of clearImage,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.980
and this of course, will be used to remove the image from the screen.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.675
When we get to triggering this method,

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:28.730
we want it to replace the current image with a default placeholder image,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.015
so, the card doesn't look so bad.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:35.015
You can use an existing image you already have inside a Firebase,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:37.720
or you can add a new one.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.150
I'm going to go over to the Firebase console and add a default image, so,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.250
open up the Firebase console,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.100
then open up our app,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.050
select Storage, and there's our user uploads.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.390
At the moment, I've just got the beach.jpg image inside there.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.530
I'm going to go over to upload file and select the file from my desktop,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.750
so, I'm going to select this one with the name of Sea.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.720
Now, I'm going to copy the name of this image, so,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.810
copy the name of this one over the one you just uploaded,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.255
or an existing image which is from your list,

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:40.230
and now we can use this name to set our image name date property.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.595
To do that, we select this with this.imageName,

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.525
which is this value just here,

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:53.365
and now I'm going to set this to a string value of the name of the image.

00:02:53.365 --> 00:03:00.020
With this setup, we can now pass it as a prop to the ImageOutput child components.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.470
Scrolling back up, we can look for the cc-image-output,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.175
which is just here, and now we can add a third prop.

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:13.380
Remember to use the colon,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.800
and call this clearImageProp,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.110
and this is going to be equal to clearImage,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.170
which is the name of the method which you just set up just here.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.160
Then over in the ImageOutput file,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.340
we can now add this to our list of props, so,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.640
go to ImageOutput.vue, and then up to the script section,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.375
let's locate the props.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.290
We're going to set this up as

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.135
a validated function and we can add this to the end, just after containerHeight.

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:58.330
The name of the prop was clearImageProp.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.570
We're going to set this to be the type of function,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.845
then to trigger this function from this child component,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:12.440
we can call it with a click listener on the button,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.960
so, scroll back up to the button inside the templates.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960
Then just after v-show,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.325
we're also going to add a click listener, then inside here,

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:34.215
we can add the name of clearImageProp and give that a save.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.705
Now, if we go over to the browser,

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.910
and then open up our project.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.510
Let's check if it's working.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:52.930
If we upload our beach image then click on open, and then set this.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.680
Now, if I hover over and select the button,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.180
you should then trigger this callback method to then set

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.440
the new default image with the name which you passed to it,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.820
which was just here.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.010
Before we wrap this video up,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.005
there is one more thing to consider.

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:20.290
We only want to set this default image if the user has already added theirs.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.645
If we have a blank screen,

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:26.995
we don't want to allow the user to click remove.

00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:29.470
All we need to do to cover this case,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.295
is to add if statements inside of the method,

00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:37.415
to check if the image name data is not empty.

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:40.699
Back over in the CardFront,

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.100
if you go to the clear image method,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.135
just above this, we can add an if statement.

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:58.470
So if this.ImageName is not equal to an empty string,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.940
so in other words, if there is an image present,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.660
then we can go ahead and set this.ImageName to be this default name which we just passed.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.015
Let's try that. If we refresh,

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:17.850
and now if we click on the remove button,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.750
we see that no image is being downloaded.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.195
This is an alternative way to communicate between components.

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:31.640
We still have the issue of our images not quite fitting into the container properly.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.750
We will fix this in the next video and also make the images draggable,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.960
so, the user can move them to wherever they want them to appear.
