00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.745
As our app grows bigger,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:08.595
there may sometimes be situations where components will need to reuse the same code.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:13.860
Usually, it's not good practice to repeat the same code more than once.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.359
Inside our app, if we look at the CardFront,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.240
so go to the CardFront.vue, and then up to the script.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.185
Here we have a new method called clearImage.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.584
Also if we go to the CardBack components,

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:35.710
we also have the same repeated method just here.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.935
So do repeat the same clearImage method more than once.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:45.495
To help with this vue.js devices with mixins.

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:50.720
Mixins are an easier way to take any of the functionality from our components.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.245
This includes anything such as our data, methods,

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:59.210
and computed properties and placed in their own separate file.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.525
This file can then be imported into each components which needs access to it.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.795
Let's create this file in the source folder.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:13.110
I'm going to call this file the clearImageMixin,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.845
and it comes after the.js extension.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:23.435
Then we can export it as a constant called clearImageMixin.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:30.840
So export the constants of clearImageMixin,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.400
and you can call this anything you want,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.415
but I'm going to call this clearImageMixin as it's valid descriptive.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:46.550
Now our clearImage method can be called from inside the CardBack.vue file.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.540
So go to the CardBack.vue and then I'm going to call this full methods,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.285
not just the clearImage section.

00:01:56.285 --> 00:02:01.195
So cut the full method up to there.

00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:05.070
Also make sure to remove the closing comma.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.300
Then this method can now be pasted into our mixin file.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.570
So go backward to these objects and paste this in.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.080
Bare to mind we can also add anything else from our Vue instance here,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.000
such as any data and computed properties which may be related.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.940
This constant has been exported now.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.710
So we can now go back to the card,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.570
back components, and important the new mixin.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.170
So back to the top of the script,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.040
we can add import statements for the first three.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.520
Again, just like the Eventbus,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.135
we use the curly braces to indicate we want to impose a single member of this module.

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:54.200
In our case, the name is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.960
clearImageMixin and then we

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.790
want to import this from the file path of../../clearImageMixin.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.330
Now this is imported.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.935
We can now mix this in with the rest of our code inside the Vue instance.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.140
So within the export defaults,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.600
we can also add the mixin's property,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.100
and this is an array.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.150
I'm sure it's out the comma just afterwards to separate this from the data.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.250
So inside here we can add the name of our mixin which was clearImageMixin.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.780
So this is the clearImage method added now back into our components.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.265
Few just that mixes the contents into our existing data.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:03.440
If there are any conflicting keys inside of the object to be merged in,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.875
the components options will take priority.

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:10.670
We can split up our code into more mixins too.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.765
We're not restricted to only use a morn.

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.580
The process is the same as we've just done.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.630
We move the code into its own file, import module,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.810
and then we can also add the name of the mixin to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.930
these mixin's array separated by a comma.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.390
Now we just need to do the same inside our code from file.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.200
We will also add the clearImage method.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.760
Save this file and go over to the CardFront.vue.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.705
So we'll do exactly the same.

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:49.805
We need to remove the full method from the Vue instance.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:54.385
We then need to import the clearImageMixin.

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:58.500
So add these onto the bottom of the imports,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.290
just as we've done before.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.990
So clearImageMixin.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.890
The file path is the same, it's../../clearImageMixin.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.200
Then we go down to our export defaults and adds our mixin's array.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.930
We only have one, so clearImageMixin is the only value inside the array.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.130
Now we can head over to our app and test the clearImage method is it

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.115
working inside both the CardFront and the CardBack components.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:50.000
So save this file and go over to the browser.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.095
We can begin inside the CardFront section.

00:05:55.095 --> 00:06:05.439
Let's choose a file, then insert image,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.240
and once it downloads, head over to the image and click on the removal.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.490
Good. So that one is still working.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.750
We'll also test this inside the CardBack from pressures will find to.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.220
So choose an image, open it up,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:31.440
set the image, then hover over and remove the image.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.835
Great. So that's all still working.

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:39.785
So remember that we can use as many mixins as you want inside of our app.

00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:43.535
The word bear in mind if we need to use code in more than one place.

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:50.340
So mixins are a good way to organize our projects and also avoid any code repetition.
