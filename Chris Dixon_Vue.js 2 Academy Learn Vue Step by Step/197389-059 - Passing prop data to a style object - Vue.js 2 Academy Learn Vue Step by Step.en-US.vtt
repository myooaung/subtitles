00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.960
Our app is now being passed a validated prop,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.375
which is a number.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.590
We can use this number to set from the outside the height

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.430
we want the text box on the right-hand side to be,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.905
which is this area over here.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.125
This prop is called contain heights,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.330
and we're going to pass the value to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
a style object to set the container height using CSS.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.280
To do this, let's set up a computed property inside of the text output file.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.500
We will only re-render when there is a change to the container height prop.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.940
Let's add our computed section just underneath the props,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.470
separated by a comma.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.595
I'm going to call it a computed property our

00:00:53.595 --> 00:01:03.240
styleObject and then we're

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.530
going to return the height.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.500
I'm going to set the heights to be equal to this.containerHeight,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.110
which is our prop which is being passed to.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.665
Then because of being passed a number and wanted to be a CSS value,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:29.320
we can also add px for pixels onto the end.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.395
This style object will add a CSS high property,

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:35.705
sets out the value of the prop,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:40.615
which is currently 130, which you set here.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.900
Then inside the object,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.190
we add px to declare this is a pixel size.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.500
Now our style object is created We can add it to our opening p-tag as a style attribute.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.265
Scroll back up to our templates and inside the opening tag,

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:07.780
use the colon to bind the styles as these are dynamic.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.520
This is going to be equal to our computed property, which is StyleObject.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's add this to a separate line. Save them.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.015
If we go back over to the card,

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:36.115
we can see we have the free text output boxes set to a height of 130 pixel,

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:39.365
and this is why we earlier set the dotted border.

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:42.720
We can clearly see which section is which.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.715
Let's go over to the developer tools and we should also be able to see this CSS property.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.045
If we select the text output box,

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:55.895
we can see inside of the p-elements,

00:02:55.895 --> 00:03:01.780
we have the style set to a CSS height of 130 pixels.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.030
This is how we can work with our props,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.490
which are passed down to the component.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.175
Note that this is okay to do as we're not modifying the value of the prop directly.

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:18.150
We are only using the prop value and then adding it to a CSS object.
