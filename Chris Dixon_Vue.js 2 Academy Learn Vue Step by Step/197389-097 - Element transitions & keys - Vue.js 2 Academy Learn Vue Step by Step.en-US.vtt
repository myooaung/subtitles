00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
The transitions we have looked at so far have only

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.900
involved one single element for example,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.190
the remove image transition was a single button element.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.460
Also the text options we fade it in and out,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.415
although these had many elements nested inside,

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.940
they will still a form as the main outer element.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.635
We can also transition between two separate elements too.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:30.135
A common need finish is when using v-if and v-else.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:35.010
I'm going to head back over to the first project where we can apply this too.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.515
But first I'm going to copy the scale animation from the app.vue of your file.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:44.440
Go down to the CSS,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.445
soften the scale, enter active.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.000
In fact, we rename this to custom,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.290
but for now let's just copy this and change this in just a moment.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.660
Now let's open up the cast list application from early on in the course.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.570
Drag the project into visual studio.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.880
Then we're going to open this up by double-clicking the index page.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.985
Let's get to work on this in the index.html file.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:24.925
We have an if else statement to show the names added to the list,

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:28.275
which is just down here.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:33.275
Both these if statements and else section below displays a div.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:36.010
This if section displays the name.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.055
If any names that are available inside the guest list name array.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.775
If not, we then have a separate div just below,

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.720
which says the text of no names added yet.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.960
This is perfect for switching between these two div elements.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.425
To do this, all we need to do is add our familiar transition mapper.

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.670
Let's close this side bar for more space.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.345
Then just below the div with the class of card block.

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:06.430
Let's add the transition wrapper.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.940
Let's make some space, then after the no names add adjective.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.090
We can enclose this off, just like that.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.375
Now we can add the name of scale to link this with the animation CSS we added before,

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:36.630
so let's add name to the opening tag of scale.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.095
Then in no app.css.

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:43.610
We can then add the CSS which you copied from all previous projects.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.750
All we need to do is replace custom with

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.175
the scale name or for the enter active and also for the leave active so save that.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.425
Now we've opened up this index page in the browser and then refresh.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:04.570
We can add a name to the guest list and then submit.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.090
We can see that the name is added just like before.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.000
We can't see any of these scaling in effect.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.195
This clearly doesn't work.

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:17.150
The reason why it doesn't work is because we're switching between

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.635
two div elements with the same if else block.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.895
The problem will always arise when both elements are the same.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.360
If they are div tags or any of the elements.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.050
To fix this, we need other key to each elements,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.550
so view JS can distinguish between them.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.760
Let's go back over to the app.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.425
Then inside the v-if block,

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:48.190
I'm going to add a key and we're going to call this names.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.895
Then in the second block for the else statement,

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:58.890
most won't add a second key with our name of list empty.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.415
This can be any name you want, so give that a save.

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:05.635
Now if we go back over to the browser and then reload,

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:09.540
let's add a name to the list and enter.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.575
Now we can see we've got the scale in transition.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:15.275
It looks a little strange because we're transitioning

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.720
the fold div rather than just a name.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.245
But we can clearly see it's now working.

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:24.920
Remember if we're transitioning between two elements which are not the same,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.590
such as AP elements and a div,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.370
we'll not need to add this key.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.150
If we add more names,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.830
you can see the transition does not apply after the first name.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.305
Transition with lists works a little differently,

00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:44.270
and we'll look at how to do this next.
