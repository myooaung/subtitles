00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's try with the final method.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.950
So we get a single employee get all implies now all we need to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.280
do just try to remote employee so we don't want to write the code again and again.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.995
So let's copy the previous method and paste it and just make a slight modifications.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.760
So our equity is going to be git,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
remove employer equals right,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.825
so so git remote folder named shape over here.

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:34.925
So what does it matter?

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.115
Okay, so remove employee,

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:42.350
so not get the requisite going to be removed employee.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.780
Sorry, it's it's a response.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.705
So that is outcome and input is going to be get, sorry again.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:57.140
So remove employee request which contains the employee ID as the input.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.570
And this my response.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.205
I'm I doing much faster so you can keep it slow and you can do it slower.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.360
Because we already tried multiple methods like that's why I'm going much faster here.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.770
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to write a new method here which will return a Boolean,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.840
which means to saying like,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.815
okay, so Boolean, I want a method or

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:29.300
a Boolean to saying this status for that the daily deleted or not.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.740
So I'm going to use the services dot remove employee.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.130
That won't be any methods inside because we're going to create one now.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.455
So remember employee which accepts the employee ideas or request.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.980
So dot get employee ID.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.020
Okay, so now what do we need to do?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.240
We'll have an error here because the method is not available,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.315
so we're going to create metadata, right?

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:59.170
Okay, so now we have the method in mind, implementation.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.760
All we need to do the implementation,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.320
but so here, so first thing we need to retrieve the list of information.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.210
We already have the list of employers here, right?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.395
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use employee,

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.110
a list of employees dot.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.190
Let's use either with other,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.890
we want to perform some new items, right?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.950
So I'm going to create a variable.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.920
So I tutor off a list of employees here.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.780
And then note I'm going to do,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.400
let's, let's use a loop.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.310
While you guys might have about what I'm gonna do now.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.765
So I twitter dot has next.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:48.590
So, and then I'm trying to him play between the employee.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.025
Employee is equal to and what is the item just searches,

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.745
contains that IT to dot next rate.

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:56.990
Exactly.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.520
So now I have my employee.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.860
So all I need to do is whether this employee has the same idea as the input.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.360
So which is, which both of matches,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.655
which means I need to remove the employee, right?

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:17.870
So if my employee ID is equal to a and p dot, get employee ID.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.320
So if that matches what I'm gonna do,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:30.155
I'm going to remove the employee from the i-th or so I theta dot remote.

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:35.045
Okay, and then so successfully remote island of return,

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:37.760
true because I'm exploiting him boolean, right?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.200
So to true.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.155
Okay, what happened if it is not going inside?

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.300
Are there none of them ID matches.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.920
Finally, what I need to do, I need to return the second.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.800
So I need to provide the written as the files for the METAR outcome.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.580
So here, the 10, false,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.825
which means none of the employee got a remote.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.235
So return.

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:08.810
Okay, so now we have a method in place and let's go back to our infant configuration.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.355
Yes, Now the issue is resolved.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:14.990
So now all we need to do just add the status into a response.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.705
Respond to not sit status, sorry.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:21.409
Response dot status.

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.650
And we've got the status only a dot, right?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.100
And all we need to do is pass the response to this matter.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.270
It'll create a remote employee response.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.835
So that's all. So now we've got everything in place.

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:39.530
All we need to do, just run

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.920
the application and see whether the empire has been removed successfully.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.820
So just run it. My deck few seconds, Let's wait for it.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.645
So this Spring starter,

00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:55.100
It's a few more seconds.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.500
Okay.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.780
Does ever okay. So what is wrong here?

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.400
Something's missing.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.185
Application and failed. Okay.

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:12.500
So we got an error here saying like application rent failed. What is the problem here?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.070
Okay, and a session key there, it's already in 0.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.640
Okay, got it. The problem is,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.170
just have a look at it.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.795
We just copy paste them, I thought alright.

00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:28.635
For a remove an employee, where is it?

00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.635
Get him blowing it all employee.

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:34.430
And here it's supposed to be a remote employee.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.080
Okay.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.700
So Remo employee, I forgot to change the name.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.845
That's not the actual issue.

00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:44.870
We used to get all employed equity,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.630
which is already used before in some other amount that we need to use

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.860
the proper payload which

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.890
is remove all employee request here or is

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.365
it remove all employee request to the resident hall and played it.

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.230
Okay. So remote employee request and come back

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.040
here and just paste the proper employee requests here.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.585
So now that's the problem.

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:17.390
Let's run it again. You're going to use the same again and again, right?

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.240
So if you're writing a method, make sure that that's up there.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.290
Proper input request and which is either method would not have the same request method.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.350
So Spring starter.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:34.290
Now, let's few more seconds.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:42.270
One-to-one fast. Intelligence kind of silicon band reckless by the way.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.030
Hopefully you don't get any issues now.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.625
Okay. So that was started.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:13.405
All we needed to just come back to me and then reference our visual.

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:18.205
And let's see, get all employees.

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.400
Let's run it. We have a multiple implies 123.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.280
So I'm going to remove the employee 1, 2, 3.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:34.690
So get or remove employee and I'm going to use 123 and click Go.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.245
It returns true, which means the employee got tele there.

00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:42.485
Let's call the get all implies method again to see whether the 123 is remote.

00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:47.030
See now that it's onto three is not available anymore, right?

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.930
So this is how we're gonna make use of all the methods. So let's create a week.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.070
They did a few methods, right?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.755
So we need to try to implement some security has to end.

00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:57.180
So we can do that in the next video.
