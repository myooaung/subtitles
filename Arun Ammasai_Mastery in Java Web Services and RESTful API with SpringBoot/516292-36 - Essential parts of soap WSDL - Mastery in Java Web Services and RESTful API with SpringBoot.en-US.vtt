00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:05.670
So it's time for us to understand what exactly are we still contained.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.380
So we have been using for awhile,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.050
but we need to know the Asian cell parts of an a visitor.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.860
And in just in case if you're if you're seeing some wisdom in the future unit.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.675
I understand. So what an eight,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.095
what each and every one of them in the visited.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.900
So does our wisdom, right?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.235
So whenever you open a wisdom,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:28.725
you will see this particular x I just shrink to all the nodes here.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.255
So let's go one by one.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.955
The first thing we will have a type and then we have a message.

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:35.685
After the message we have a port type and then binding.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.515
And we have a sudden there are multiple things.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:42.515
So all you need to know is what each and every one of them.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.540
So first of all, let's expand the type.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.670
So what is the type in the first place?

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.065
Type is nothing but it will just give you the information I would this schema details.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.570
So what is this schema which is used to,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.010
to create the visited?

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.510
If you expand the schema,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.105
you should be able to see our entire existence here,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:00.860
see our good employee request.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.580
And it has the employee ID is an integer type and get employed response.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.965
It has the complex rape of employee details.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:08.630
Employee details, which contains

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.815
the multiple information here and which means all essential parts of our Xs t.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:16.685
So if somebody is asking you what that type is content,

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:23.620
it's pretty much contains the schema details I would do where Xist gene, right?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.275
And then, so what is the message?

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.510
So we have a lot of misses here, message2,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.680
message and the message and message 123456,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.510
Okay, There are six messages here.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.310
So what basically messages,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.694
so message is the one is defined.

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:42.640
What are the request and response we are going to handle the entire wisdom,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.465
right? Think about this scenario.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.040
We are, we are, we are going to be credited three different methods, right?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
14 get employee and secondary target all employees and terminal for remote employee,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.485
there are three methods and six input and outputs.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.150
So if three requests and three response,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.235
and that is why we have a six messages here.

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:04.290
So the first one is when new employee response and second on its remote employee request.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.900
So and third one is a request and and the next one is get all in Blair aqueous,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.005
which means you have a multiple methods in your method.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.280
I mean you have multiple methods,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.990
the newer a wisdom, right?

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.640
So each and every one of the month,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.890
it must contain a request and response.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.355
All there it goes, and responsive demand in the messages.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:26.360
Okay, So you can just have a look at the message and you can tell anybody

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.515
saying like this particular ways they'll contain these other equids types.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:35.420
And if you want to know in detail about specific request and response,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.865
you can expand that wisdom is and you can see it.

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.640
So what are the part element that it removed employee response,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.660
which is coming from our existing schema only.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.605
Okay, now we know what is a type and we know what is our message.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.370
Now, we need to understand what is a poor type.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.385
Let's expand the podium and see what it contains.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.480
Just have a look at it.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.870
The prototype contains different operations.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.120
You can call the method different operations

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.805
or you can call them as at different methods.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:08.330
See renew employee, which is a method,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.305
get employee again a method and get all employee.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:15.650
Let me go back to the Chrome and I'll show you this visual,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.840
right, when you try to use them,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.100
see, you can see three methods.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.530
Get all employee get to employee remote employee.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.850
The same thing here.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.970
So get employee, get all employee, remove an employee.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay, So each and every operation belongs to a method.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.520
And what is the input message for the operation,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.060
which means what is the input for the method and what is the output for the method.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.620
See now we have a three of them here,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.245
which means we have a three inputs and outputs.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:43.790
So it is just an XML format of our method.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.310
In Java, we write three different methods, right?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.630
Those are our Java format.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.215
And we're just converting the three methods into XML format.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:53.630
You can keep it in that way to remember that.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.120
Okay, so now we understand the poor type as well.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.215
So what is the next thing?

00:03:57.215 --> 00:03:59.645
What is a binding in the first place?

00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:01.655
So if you open up binding,

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.500
again, you could see the same thing.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.360
So what are the different methods?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.265
So it's like a, a gateway or it's like an interface.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:11.615
Right?

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:15.365
So and what is the style document and what does it transport? Transport?

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.585
How we are accessing the services?

00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:19.670
Are we accessing this RVs over

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.555
the internet or are we trying or different in any other way?

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.270
Since it is a soap that are multiple ways you can access

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.750
through UDP or else you can access through the MQ.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.230
For now, we are using only the transport using the Internet.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.715
That is why we have the HTTP here and what are the methods?

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:41.870
So this is just an interface and then what could be in the service,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.815
which means it's the detail how the client can access my services.

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:50.045
This is the address for them.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:52.055
So you do you remember this is the address.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.185
This is the pattern which we need to use.

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:56.210
And this is the pattern Halford that,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.810
that would be multiple endpoints

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.680
like one which we use data that is employee surveys done wr,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.090
write the similar way.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.815
You can have a multiple things.

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:11.810
So basically the service is nothing but how the user can access our methods.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.085
Right?

00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:17.600
So these are the pretty much important things or whatever the things are available,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.075
pretty much all the users are racist.

00:05:20.075 --> 00:05:23.225
You can see types, you can see messages,

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.700
and you can see the port type a can see binding and salaries.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.810
All of them are belongs to the implementation of your thoughts.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.740
Thank you.
