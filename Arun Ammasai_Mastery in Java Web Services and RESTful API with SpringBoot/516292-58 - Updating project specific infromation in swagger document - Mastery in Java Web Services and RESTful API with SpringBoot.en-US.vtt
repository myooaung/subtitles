00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.455
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.455 --> 00:00:02.385
Welcome back.

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.885
So we discuss a boat or the swagger documentation and what are the important elements.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.270
But when you take a look at the documentation,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.800
the information which is provided here,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.115
it is not quite which is relevant to our project.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.320
But you can not see in the document like this to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800
a client because the information which we are sharing to the client,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.495
it has to be a project-based so we can not send the some default values.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.195
So now what we're gonna do is we're trying to modify

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.095
this document information through a configuration file.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.200
This can be modified using our configuration.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.615
So let's go back to her ID and let's try to implement the documentation API changes here,

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.315
but I don't want to keep the changes in the same class.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.560
Let's create a separate class to handle these flyer configuration.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.120
So I'm going to create a new Car class here saying swagger configuration.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.170
Okay, So, and we had to do a first few things here,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.975
and this is the first thing we need to enable the swagger.

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:05.960
And then we're going to provide some configuration in this file.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.015
So we're going to annotate with the configuration.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.805
So what are the first thing we need to do?

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.834
Okay, So we're going to write a new method,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.620
and that is going to be bean method,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.315
which will return a docket.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:20.690
So dark it is nothing but which will append the information with

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.984
D documentation docker I'm in now a swagger documentation.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.620
Okay, So and as I mentioned,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.940
it is going to be a bean methods,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.650
so undated the bean here.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.215
And then the method is public and they do it on a Docker, right?

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:38.615
Sorry, dot kit, by the way.

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.540
So dark it and the method name.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.040
So you can probably any name, CSO,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.690
new APA I'm going to provide.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.220
So it has to be done new docket, right?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.700
So written return nil dot cat.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.245
Okay, So here's the deal.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.420
So what kind of documentation type we have on our use,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.119
we are going to use the span and to documentation.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.635
There are multiple versions as Swagger,

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:05.975
the one we're trying to use, it's a swag at two.

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:11.030
So documentation type dot swagger

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.150
underscore to the documentation type which I'm going to use.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.670
If we just provide this information,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.160
we will get the same documentation.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.080
That won't be any updated documentation.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.840
We will Dundee the default documentation.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.950
So all we need to do,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.410
we need to override the information.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.105
Okay, so to do that,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:32.270
the next thing which we need to docket dot,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.025
we need to use the ABA info.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:39.859
So the APA infer which will override the IS information.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.900
Right? So let's do that.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.730
So APA info, but if you take a look at it,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.000
APA info which will accept AP info object.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.800
So now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a new method called API info,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.350
which will return a API.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.200
And then I'm going to write,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.430
I'm going to create a method here so I can internally configured the APA.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.150
So create method here.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.830
Okay, So here what we need to do,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.755
we need to return a new API info.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:16.535
So, so we're gonna use the APA builder.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:20.370
So new APA info builder.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.210
So which will build the APA info?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.670
The first thing which we need to do, what is the title?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.190
So I'm going to provide employee service.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.310
So that is the first element, which is the title.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.160
And the second one, we need to provide a description.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.650
So if you take a look at the postmen,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.730
see we have the description and we had a version, title, everything.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.085
So we did, we provided the title and

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.725
we have to provide a description Astral, that's what we are trying now.

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:53.140
So description, description or you want

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.304
to provide employee services to our documentation.

00:03:56.304 --> 00:04:03.075
Employees or race with Swagger documentation.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.315
Okay. So what else we can provide here?

00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:10.130
So we can provide the terms of terms and conditions

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.470
are the terms and services you are with the help of service,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.985
you are here, you need to provide some,

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:21.430
we've said that where they can go and see the towns of surveys.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.560
So I'm going to provide our blog here.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.050
Like don't fight, go to the last 13.com.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.490
Slash or eight is eight, et cetera.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.940
Okay. So we decided we declared

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.250
the title description and Tom So service and what

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.590
is we can provide so I need to prove it.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.180
The contact information.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.370
Correct. So the contact information which will tell us which order the point of contact.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.920
So I'm going to use dot contact.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.360
So the contact is accepting another object which is a contact object.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.585
We will build that contact in a later point.

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:04.820
For now I'm going to provide null here.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.680
And then what we're going to provide.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.985
So we have to provide the license just in case if you have any license for now,

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:12.065
we don't have anything specific.

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:20.165
I am going to provide employee license version 1.

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:23.360
And then what if we can provide we can draw a D. We

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.405
had a license and we need to prove any license. You are ready for that.

00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:35.405
So I'm going to simply provide the same here and license.

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:38.375
And then we have to provide the version as well.

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.385
So what does that documentation version?

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:43.620
Let's keep it as like 3.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.395
And once everything is,

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:48.860
then all you need to do just build the API.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.360
So when you call the build method,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.620
which will construct the final object info.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.860
Okay, so then now we have the contract.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.810
So what do we need to the contact for now

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.269
I'm going to the contact to show you what contains.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.825
So APA in for Builder which accepts a contact.

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.400
So what is content?

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.050
Content is a, another class which contains the name URL, an e-mail,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.470
which means if you need any clarification about

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.585
the documentation or any methods or any inputs and outputs.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:23.930
That is us, that is some person which we need to contact.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.420
So we can use this particular contact ASA,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.470
point of contact, POC.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.925
Okay, so let's do that.

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:33.245
So what I'm gonna do here,

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:35.390
I'm going to create a new contact here.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.770
It's going to be a static one.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.405
Notice that I'm going to provide something like public static.

00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:46.430
Final and then contact object conduct is my object, right?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.215
So contact, which is available spring Fox documentation.

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:57.090
And then it is going to be support.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.740
Support contact is equal to.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.205
And here you're going to create a new object for your contact.

00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:06.305
And we need to provide the name.

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:07.505
First one is a name,

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.995
and second one is the support URL.

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:12.710
You can go and look for help.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.525
And third one is the e-mail.

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:16.729
So the first thing, a name,

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.850
maybe let's say January as a support person.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.905
And then you are,

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:23.600
I'm going to provide the same here,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.810
like our blog URL here.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.340
And then the next thing, the email.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:38.480
So support at mail.com.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.805
So this is my support.

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:42.470
Okay, So all we need to do,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.910
we have the contact here, right?

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.995
Let's add the contact here.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.140
Say as simple as that.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.260
Okay, so now we have the docket here which

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.230
acts up this Wagga to in the swagger default swagger,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.400
I'm trying to modify

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.680
the document information and then we can add some additional information sas cell.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.849
So what kind of input and output data it will produce and consume.

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:10.430
Okay, so let's talk about the producers first.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.815
If you take a look at it, it, the producers,

00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:16.040
which takes a set of string as the input,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.570
which means multiple types.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.115
So now what do we need to do?

00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:21.800
Let's create a new setup string here.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.305
Maybe I can do it here.

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.540
Sit.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.860
Doctype, right?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:36.790
So producers, producers, produce per reuse.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:46.120
Okay, produce is a quilt and new HashSet,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.320
so it's gonna be a string,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.110
by the way, input class.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.345
And then what we're gonna do,

00:08:55.345 --> 00:08:59.200
we're gonna provide private some hardcore value here.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:07.750
So like maybe what I can do is I can simply create a direct link.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.225
Like how normally how,

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:12.520
okay, let's create an ArrayList and we cannot improve assessed.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.050
Okay?

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:22.025
So arrays, sorry, res.end S list and we're going to provide two inputs here.

00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:28.985
And that is going to be oneness add JSON and the other one is application slash.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:33.710
And the second one is application slash XML.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.480
That's up to our own definition.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.155
So this is the produce and consume.

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:43.190
Pretty much the same consumes.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.610
And again, it's going to be a JSON and XML.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.435
So I'm going to pause live producers here.

00:09:50.435 --> 00:09:53.550
Produce,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.930
produce, and let's keep it in a same way.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.679
Okay, and so now I said they produce and consume.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:07.750
So that A's request.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:14.869
And it is going to be 1000, 1000.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.650
Lot of spelling mistakes today.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.135
So can zoom here. Okay, So now that's it.

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:26.890
So now we have our new document here and which has all the essential information here.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:33.070
So now all we need to do is it's a bean method and it's enables Bagger two configuration.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.295
So now let's start the application and we'll explore

00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:39.985
how these changes will impact your documentation API.

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:42.835
It's ran the server.

00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:44.950
It might take a few seconds.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.070
Your application is getting started.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.425
Getting, okay, So, yes.

00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:54.925
So our application is started,

00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:57.700
it's running on port number 8 or 8 1.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.530
So let's go back to Postman.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.975
And here this is the old document.

00:11:01.975 --> 00:11:04.460
I'm going to hit the Send now.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.930
Okay, see, we've got a successful response,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.784
but how I look at the documentation now the description is employee.

00:11:11.784 --> 00:11:17.245
So with this wagon documentation and that ideal employee service and terms and service.

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:20.710
And we have our one URL here and the contact details,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.875
the name, URL and e-mail.

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:28.040
And then I'll license and the host these following information.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.255
I'll pretty much is the same.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:34.175
The one information which you modified is the application information.

00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:38.915
So this is the way you need to send the documentation to the client,

00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:42.740
but then go to scenario, but it's all a JSON base, right?

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.965
So it's difficult for the customer to understand that.

00:11:45.965 --> 00:11:48.590
So how we can make it even more, much better.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.900
So there are two ways of handling the documentation.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.835
That one is this JSON format,

00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:55.715
and the second one is Swagger UI.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.400
So in the next video we'll talk about this Swagger UI.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.620
We should pretty much gives the same input.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.990
I mean, inflammation in the UAE aswell.
