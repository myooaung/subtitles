00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.070
So finally we had some introduction about what is

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.675
the Spring framework and what we can do using spring,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.850
using auto yEd components and what are

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.775
the different modules available and different projects.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:18.630
And now it's time for us to create our first web services.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.000
And now we're going to create so pips,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.540
that is not the rest services because once we completed this hope IP service,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.630
we'll move on to the rest API services.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.270
So under the soap web service,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.180
we're going to use our intelligence to create

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.020
a project and we're going to export that services.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.125
So what are we going to cover in this entire project?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.840
So, so we're gonna create soap if service,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.655
but instead of ipsa is what you're gonna do.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:51.860
So we are going to create an application which will manage the employee service,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.335
maybe like a headshot MS services.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.210
So while building the app,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.145
we are going to build multiple methods.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.110
Each method serve some purpose.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.355
So what are the methods?

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.215
The first method which I'm going to prefer,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:07.055
it's to fetch and a specific employee detail.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.645
And the second one,

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:09.950
fetch all the employees,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.065
which means a list of employees.

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:19.955
And another thing, how to remove an employee from our database or from our collection.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.715
So we're going to apply all of this in

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.660
our project and we're going to create a web service out of it.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.490
So the next video,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.410
I'm going to create a simple project.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.180
And we'll show you how we can create direct question response and other things.
