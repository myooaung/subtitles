00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.780
So now we have the basic setup ready.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.180
We have they exist using the existing we created the request and response classes using

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.615
a plugin called St. Court has module,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:18.350
so we created that and indeed the SRC dot domain dot java folder,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.335
that is where we can see there good employee request and they applied it in.

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.985
So the next thing, what do we need to do?

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.315
So we have to write the endpoints.

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:28.700
So endpoint is most important things.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.915
So what do they end point?

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.910
If any request comes,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.250
which means you need to identify

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.310
what is the request type and if buddy that request comes,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.945
which method needs to be called?

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:39.620
Correct?

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.865
So for now what I'm gonna do,

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.920
I have the good employee request to,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.240
I have to write a method which takes get employee request as the input.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:01.010
And it will return get employee response as an output.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.320
So we need to write a method according to this particular signature.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.600
So what we can do, so we had to create a class which will handle the endpoints.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.255
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a new class.

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.700
So I'm going to create a new class here.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.080
First of all, let me create a new package here like config.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.285
And another conflict.

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:26.900
I'm going to create a new class called endpoint configuration or in point set

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.725
up our endpoint configuration.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:34.550
Okay?

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.080
So the first thing which we wanna do,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.879
this is a, this particular class is PR purposes endpoint.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:48.909
So what we need to do is we have to annotate the class as an endpoint.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.650
So we need to use annotation ASA in points.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.730
So which means that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.375
our spring configuration we light into fitness classes or Endpoint class.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:01.000
So which will come and look at what are the maggots are available

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.420
inside and it will load the mat That's accordingly.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.150
Okay, So as we discussed before,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.920
what are the methods Significant you're looking for?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.315
We're looking for a method which will take the request and the response.

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:16.070
So I'm going to create a method here.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.625
And what are the response? Get employee.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:27.200
Respondus is outcome and get employee that the metonym get employee and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.665
the input is going to be get employee request L. Okay?

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:37.730
So now this method nasal retina, employer response.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.220
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create some hardcore data here.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.090
So response is equal to new employee at a response l k. So now what I'm going to,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.695
now I'm going to modify something here.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:51.470
So response dot set employee ID,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.570
I'm going to get the employee from the request, right anyway,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.670
so request dot set employee ID and then let

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.920
me add something else like response dot Sit employee name.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.410
So let's modify the other details later.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.870
Employee name as Nancy.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.570
So what else here? So response dot sit, location, right?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.065
So location is going to be India.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.910
In then we need to provide as the code or anything, right?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.105
So is it coats it as the code.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.440
So I'm going to provide some you want to prefer.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.625
Fine.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:33.180
And then finally, I have to return the response back.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.560
Okay, so now everything looks pretty cool.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.240
These classes are in pointless,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.710
but this method is not an not have the baby method.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:50.600
So we have to tell the spring this method is a method, right?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.800
So and this mother needs to accept this employee request.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.770
And so when this method is have a baby or you need to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.680
provide what is the namespace for them?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.310
Because these get employer it was created using,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.135
once again to get right some get employee ID.

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:11.390
So this get the employer equals created through

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.090
the axis t. So when you're creating a method here,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.190
you need to provide something like diploid.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.175
What is the payload I'm going to provide here?

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:23.630
Okay, so, and we're going to use at payload root.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.970
So here there are two parameters you need to provide.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.470
So what is a namespace?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.495
And the second one is,

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:31.715
what is the local part here?

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.670
Okay. So what does the names, businesses place.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.625
Do you remember when we created the xs t,

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.140
We provide some namespace.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.240
So this is a namespace which we are looking for.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.600
This is the namespace.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.340
So copy this namespace.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.230
Because in this particular endpoint,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.160
all the requests that comes with the same endpoint name,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.990
I mean the namespace.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.460
So here what do you need to do?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.390
You need to provide the namespace and then we need to look for the local part.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.520
So what is the type of request?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.280
That type of frequencies that get employee request.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.150
So copy that and go back to our class and you need to provide the employee request.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.940
Okay, so now this is an identity with this method will be

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.630
invoked whenever this namespace comes into the picture and the local partner,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.900
it means that a equals type as they get imply request.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.735
And what is this input?

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.730
Okay, So this input,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.200
is there a request to pay load?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.610
So tell explicitly it's a request payload.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.350
This is the payload root,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.080
which means the entire thing then directs is three.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.995
And here it is, it just yet a request to pay load.

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:46.595
And so the moment I provide it said equals payload,

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:50.090
obviously, this meant that a has to return something.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.700
Okay, let me, I'll tell you what is the request payload

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.150
this method has to return response payload.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
Okay, the reason for the request payload,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.360
we are getting, getting employer request correct.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.815
And that particular employer has to convert it into a Java object.

00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:08.180
So that particular process,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.970
the request payload will be taken care at the same day.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.770
Once everything is processed,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.300
the unit is in the response,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.790
but you're going to directly send us a normal response you need to

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.210
convert back to as a XML formula.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.320
The x is the format or based on the XSD. We need to convert back.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.330
So when, when that equals to enter,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.440
we need to come out as a Java,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.060
but, and that equals,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.800
I'm in the method returns a response.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.455
You need to again do the reverse engineering part here.

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:36.320
So we need to use a response payload.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.120
So in the next, in the next video,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.450
we'll see how we can add the confint.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.770
We just created a method,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.435
it's just a web API method,

00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:45.680
but we need to do,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.250
we need to create a configuration to check what are

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.830
the different configuration and we still

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.160
configurations and other information that you need to provide out.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.910
So we'll have to configure all of them and we'll configure all of them.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.720
And then we'll create a and then we can test it out.
