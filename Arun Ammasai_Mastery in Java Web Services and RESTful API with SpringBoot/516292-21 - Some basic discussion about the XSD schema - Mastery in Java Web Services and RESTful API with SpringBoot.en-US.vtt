00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:02.940
So what is the next thing?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.785
So we have the application up and running.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.160
So since we are creating a soap service,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.395
you have to remember a few things.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.560
For the first one, we need to have the XML,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.410
which means our request and response.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.365
And second, we need to create a wisdom where we can have the endpoints.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:30.720
This vision as an automatically created in spring based on our configuration.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.030
We'll create the configuration file in sometime later.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.490
So based on that, it will create the endpoint.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.350
So we have the request and response or the other.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.670
Another thing here, the first,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.680
I think it's the most important thing in XSD schema, schema file.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.270
It's also kind of a XML file which contains the requests and responses.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.750
And we're going to use the XSD schema to create our question respond Java file.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.145
So basically how it will happen,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:05.810
we will create a Xist which contains the request and the response mappers.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.910
And then what we're gonna do,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.085
we're gonna use the existing file to create our jacks be classes.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:17.135
So we're going to convert our Xist into a Java classes.

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:20.015
Okay, So first thing which we need to do, Let's create exists.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.890
If you're already aware of XML,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.195
it's not going to be a big issue because it's pretty much same as XML only.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.595
But if you're not sure how to use NX CISD,

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:31.670
I'm going to give you a small other way to have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.435
an easiest way to create the xsd schemas in a visual way.

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.610
So for now, the first thing which I need to do

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.370
create the xs d. So once we have the accessibility,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.950
then we can go work in a way we can use the access to,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.190
to create the XML or Jack's your objects, right?

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.690
And to be very frank,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.895
the third one is the first step we'll wanna do.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:51.260
So under the resource,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.880
I'm going to create a new file,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.145
which is going to create an XSD file here.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:57.545
So right-click New File,

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:02.630
I'm going to call them ASA employee dot XSD file.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.910
So when it creating existed,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.195
there are few things much important.

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:10.190
It's not only in XSD,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.950
even in XML, these things are very much important.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.110
The first one is a namespace.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.880
Namespace, and the second one as XML.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.930
And as it's again, the namespaces,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.530
namespaces just nothing but we'll provide something like how should it be.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.255
And I'm going to use something like bytecode,

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:39.950
velocity and.com slash MS.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.570
So we're going to use this particular namespace for Hachette, our XSD.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.010
The reason when we create a Erik was using those exit STI.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.240
All of them are going to use this same namespace. Okay?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.640
So just understand I would the namespace names,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.640
which is the kind of key factor for x and Melinda access to even for

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.955
your Jacks we objects, right?

00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:04.985
So now I'm going to create a simple example here. The what's the first thing?

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.260
Let's create a schema.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.550
So Xist Asia, I think what HSS KML

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.060
file and what are the first thing which we need are in the schema.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.599
We need to have the namespace.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.640
And before that, what we're gonna do here.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.500
So we need to use what a definition we are going to use.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.110
Okay, so we had to grow it. What do they definitely are going to use?

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.495
We're going to use the W3.org.

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:39.390
Okay, so anyway, so I'm going to use something like

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.320
http slash and we're going to use www.org 2001 dot XML schema.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.580
So I'm going to use this one.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.935
This is mandatory. And the second thing is

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.910
here we have to provide the target and namespace.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.300
Target namespace here and here as I mentioned,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.225
I'm going to use the namespace is like this.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:06.740
So save it. And this is my target namespace.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.905
And another thing is so I know how to use something like the element from a default.

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:14.435
So this is going to be qualified on.

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:18.680
So we can the field which you are creating in say the XML or x is 3,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.869
those are all qualified elements.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:24.470
So that is why we are mentioning element form default, okay?

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.685
But here it's not that easy to create the X's, T's.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.470
So we're gonna use something else.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.970
Yes, For example, I'm going to try something

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.370
like I'm going to create a first element here.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:46.835
So this element name is going to be a good employee employee request.

00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:52.280
Okay? So this employee request as subtype.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.520
So what kind of type is they get employed as a complex type.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.625
Okay, so I'm going to provide some name for it.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.380
So the type is a called a,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.140
and I'm going to use Git employee request,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.190
get employee or a request.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.985
Okay, So I'm here what we're gonna do,

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:16.715
I'm gonna use the prefix here.

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:21.755
So that is why I'm going to create a 11 namespace here to identify the prefix here.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:28.265
So the XML notes, maybe XML namespace.

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:31.460
And maybe I can use as something fall as a T and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.900
S. And I'm going to use the same namespace year,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.060
Control C and Control V. And here I'm going to use the DNS here.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.525
Okay, so now we have a simple existed,

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:54.005
but I don't want you to try something like that if you're not out of the XML

00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:57.800
and if you're not aware of how to create the XML's our x's days,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.570
okay, because in the next video I'm going to use some visual editor to create the design.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.335
The XSD, which will be helped us to create the excess, is much faster.

00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:08.700
Let's do that in the next video.
