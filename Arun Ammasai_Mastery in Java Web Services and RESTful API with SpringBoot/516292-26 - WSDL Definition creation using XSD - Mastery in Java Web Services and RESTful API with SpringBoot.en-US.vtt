00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.105
So we just created a simple method to handle the request and response.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.250
Another thing, this is not a normal method, correct?

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.185
This is a bin.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.710
So we have to annotate the method ASA been.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.110
If you're, if you're not provided the beam,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.380
this matter will not add it into your application contexts.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.760
Okay, so the next thing,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.725
I'm going to create a one mode method,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:26.835
which will help us to create the visitor actual visible.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.880
Right? So and again,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.355
that is going to be a main method.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.190
So the method is going to be public.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.800
So I'm going to return a visit del, correct.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.600
So I'm going to use a default.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.040
We still, there are multiple ways to handle that,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.900
but for now, we're gonna use this simple one.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.865
So default wisdom at definition.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:55.370
And from this meant that we need to return this default wisdom 11, definition.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.120
Okay, so here I'm going to create a method called create wisdom.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.115
And the wisdom is looking for some input which is nothing but the schema.

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:08.210
Do you remember is the schema which we created employed at excess read that schema,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.235
we need to provide it as the input here.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.985
So that is an accessory schema here.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:18.755
So schema, got it.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:20.690
Okay, So all I,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.430
all we need to do is create objects for our wisdom definition.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.280
We still definition. Okay, so now what we need to do,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.615
we need it in the wisdom, right?

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.340
But before we need to return the wisdom,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.185
we need to provide some information.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.470
So we have to provide something like the port type.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.410
So is del dot sit port type,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.575
we'll talk about what is bought and what is bought him in the later part.

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:50.345
So I'm going to name that Dasa employee port here.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:59.140
And then there is another important thing with del dot, sit location URL.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
So do you remember the location which you mentioned the URL here.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.230
So this is a location.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.465
So we need to provide the location here.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:09.430
We don't have to provide a star, okay,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.480
so because that is for the request dispatch it but this is just the URL.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.040
I mean, their location for you.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.420
What are you all?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.310
Okay, so now I'm,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.890
I mentioned my location URL.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
So the next thing we need to add the schema as well.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.405
So we still dot set schema.

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:31.525
And I have a schema and my input.

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:34.030
And then the next important thing,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.625
and it is at most one.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.540
We provided all the information for their wisdom.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470
There are four important parts when it comes to a visited the port and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.150
the location you are a and the schema and most important thing that target namespace.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.110
Let me show you that.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.235
So just have a look at the XSD.

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.250
So this is the, our target and namespace.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.415
This URL we have to provide in the default was delivered definition here.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:09.090
So what I'm gonna do here is del dot set target namespace.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.995
So the moment I prefer that are,

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:16.740
okay, let me return the first time that we're still first.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.360
Okay, So this is a wisdom which contains

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
all the methods which we have done in the end point.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.950
So now you understand the,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.780
the endpoint we have the namespace.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.445
So how this names is referred,

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:32.825
the namespace we're referred through the wisdom is because we have the indication yet.

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:35.090
So we need to make sure whether the right goes

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.835
over is calling they have the same namespace.

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:38.720
Ok.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.670
So now we created the beam,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.990
but another important thing,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.220
we created a schema it,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.010
but we need to inject the scheme of us place.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.840
So how are we gonna do that?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.080
That's the simple one. So what I can do is I can go to one more bean method which

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.190
will create the existing schema because we have the Xist gene,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.900
our local, I mean package itself right under the resources.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.810
So I'm going to call it a matter to return that.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.815
So Blake, so this is the one which are 100 thousand, right?

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.215
So excess risk schema here and x is a gamma.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:14.900
And like saying, I employee, employees came out.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.545
And so all I need to do is just return the schema.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.760
Ok, how we can load this game on the plus sign into return on asset is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.380
going to be simple existing schema because we

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.720
have only one X as Z in our allocation, right?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.105
When we have a multiple, we need a 100100 different way.

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:30.950
Since we have a one-to-one XSD,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.195
I'm gonna use the simple XSD schema and you need to provide the path.

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:37.350
So you need to use them.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.240
Hello class, but the resource and all you

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.760
need to do is just provide the access to name employee dot XSD.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.840
Okay, so now we have a three main methods.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.645
One is for requesting that response,

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.595
handling the request and response.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:08.450
And the second method which will create the actual wisdom with the help

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.670
of all the information port location you are in a direct namespace and a schema.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.550
This schema we injected through auto wiring.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.685
So when you start the application, it'll automatically happens.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:23.540
So in the next video, we will render obligation will see a simple response.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.110
Thank you.
