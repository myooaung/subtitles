00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome back.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.265
Let's talk about how the web services

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:08.759
work and what is the thump rule for the web services.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.590
So the web services are following a definition called W three C.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.020
So WTTC will define how suddenly cell has to work.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.495
So these are the important key points.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:22.010
If you're creating a website OF US,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.700
which means it has to be software which is designed to support,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.090
of course, you need to have a software which means it will have the design,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.250
so it'll get the input from the user.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.005
And it's interoperable, which means interoperable means it has,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.645
it has to have the ability to share the information,

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:40.625
a client and the server.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:46.115
So you will service, needs to have the capability of communicating to the another,

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:48.695
a machine or a person, right?

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.260
So the sulfur, which is designed to support

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.050
and it is interoperable and it's a mission to mission,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.510
of course, lead has to communicate to the machine dimension.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.980
So if it has the ability to communicate to mission, to mission,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.700
that is why it is called as a interoperable and the same temp,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.575
it needs to know how to interact.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.970
So if you're giving some requests,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.765
which means it needs to know how to send a response back to the client.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.820
And whatever we discussed so far,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.490
is it all happening over the Internet?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.770
These or the thump rule for the W3C, a definition.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.470
And there are three important key factors when you're talking about web services,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.210
which we already discussed.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.370
The first is interoperable.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.164
So which means it needs to share the information.

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:38.239
It has to have the ability to share the information.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.360
Regardless. It doesn't matter what kind of platform it is.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.455
It has to work on.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:46.625
All the platforms will talk about the platform independent in the next slide.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.465
And then the second factor is a mission to mission.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.420
Or you can call them as the obligation to obligation.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.270
And the interaction, which means the communication.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.090
These are all the key factors when you're using a web services.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.335
So if somebody is asking,

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:05.074
so what are the important key factors when you're writing a loop services,

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:06.560
which means you will waive service needs to be

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.370
interoperable and its need to have communicated with

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.510
the mission to mission and your web service needs to know how to communicate.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.610
I can call them as the interaction.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.390
So let's see some simple diagram to understand how the platform independent works.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.440
Think about this scenario.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.460
Web services, right?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.065
So web service or working on,

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.300
on top of the Internet.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.365
So which means the application a and application B and application C.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.645
So I have an application which is developed in Java,

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.760
and you have an application that you developed in Python.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.430
And somebody else have another application which is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.445
developed in some different application.

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:52.805
But your web service has to respond in a same way to all the applications.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:56.060
It doesn't matter which Platform they are calling from.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.240
There might be calling from a different technology.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.515
They might be calling from Java,

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:02.195
they might be calling from Python,

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:06.335
and they might be calling from the PAPR scalar a different kind of languages.

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:12.140
So each and every language has the ability to make a request.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.560
So if someone is requesting are,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.770
if someone is trying to hit your request to your Web Services,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.170
which means you will service should be able to respond back.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.799
So this is what we called as the key factor.

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.295
You were service needs to be communicated to

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:36.095
all the platforms regardless what kind of technologies, it doesn't matter.

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.030
So Java, Python, PHP,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.285
all of them making a request and we have the web service in the middle.

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:44.810
So it takes the input and it's passing the information to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.380
the business logic where we return the logic,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.110
DO receive the input and processing them and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.035
get the data from the DB and combining them and everything.

00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:59.195
So these are the key points which we need to know to understand a VIP services.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:00.650
And if you're writing a web service,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.860
make sure it has to fall in all the criteria.
