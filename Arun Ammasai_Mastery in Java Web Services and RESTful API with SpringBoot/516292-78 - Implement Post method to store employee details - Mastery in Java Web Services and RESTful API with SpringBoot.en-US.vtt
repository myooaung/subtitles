00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.265
So we tried to get employee by ID, right?

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:06.600
So we've got the response back.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.900
What happened if I provide something or invalidate the employee ID which is not existing.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.930
Seen we've got the proper edit message response

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.730
because this is not the default error message.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.730
This error message manually handled through our exception handling.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.670
If you take a look at it, edit message description and the date and have do you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.125
remember the class which we created employee exception response,

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.170
though, we'll send the response back in a proper format.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.505
The reason here, if employees null,

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.085
we are throwing your employee not found exception.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.965
So whenever employee not found exception triggered,

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:46.190
we have a global extrema on hand liability taken care of it.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.425
Right? Okay, the next thing,

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:51.200
Let's go back with another method which is a Save employee.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.900
Let's copy this method and keep it in the repo controller here,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.610
and I'm going to paste it.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.220
So, so JPA, employee slash user,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.840
okay, and the employee is fine, right?

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.375
So JB is slash employee,

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.610
which will take the employee as an input,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.860
but it's not going to use the service

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.875
anymore because it's going to use the employer repository.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:26.545
So employee repository and dot and here we are going to use the method called a sale,

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:27.940
which will accept an entity.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.509
We already have an entity in our place, which is an EMP.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.425
Okay.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.600
So as part of this employee,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.835
you not only you can store the employee,

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:40.270
you can store the department information as well.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.460
The reason employee in Donnelly has

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.450
a map emitted department which is a foreign key constraint.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.680
Okay, so let's see how it can be done.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.835
So let's restart our server.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.130
That's the first thing that you'll do. We always,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.540
whenever make some changes or applications getting started.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.840
Okay, Got it.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.655
So our application is up and running.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.320
So what is an API?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.790
We have an on-call, we're going to use the GFP is slashed employees just copy this one.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.330
It will take employee as a request body.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.840
So let's create a new request and it's going to be a post method

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.140
because we want to insert something, right?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.455
So fresh to TB and localhost and port 800,

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:36.125
81 dash JP employee end.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.600
We have to use the body as well and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.540
the information that you're going to pass if that raw JSON.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.375
Okay, so next thing, if you want to know that JSON,

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:47.210
you can go back our GET requests and here again,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.210
pass something like some proper information and you can fit some of the detail from here.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.830
Okay, So let's say I'm going to get this one,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.710
okay, Maybe let's try something else which has us more information.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.315
More information.

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.670
So I'm going to use this one.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.275
So okay, let's try employees as well.

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:21.490
Okay, so I'm going to copy this one alone.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.700
And let's go back to a post method.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.240
If you're able to manually manipulate the JSON XML,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.275
which is even pretty good.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.990
But for now time being, I'm just using the one which we

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.320
received from the response of our gate.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.050
So we're going to, we're not going to pass the ID, right.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.760
Because that is going to be auto-generated.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.170
Even the department also,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.940
we are not going to use the ID because again,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.530
it's going to be auto-generated.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.360
And this guy is a new one,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.525
so we have to insert a new person information here.

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:53.365
Okay, so so we're going to insert Thomas here.

00:03:53.365 --> 00:04:00.940
So Thomas at gmail.com and he's from he is controlling the hijab Department.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.575
I'm going to use the responsibility of handling the high chair department at beautified.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:06.160
Okay.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.650
So now all we need to do just trigger that request and make

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.730
sure this regard will be inserted in our real database.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.500
Before that, let me go to the database and I'll show you whether this particular data as

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.140
existing data with you're trying to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.200
insert to the thalamus and we don't have any intriguing for Thomas.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.280
Let's go back to our postmen and will trigger the request.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.980
Okay, So it says invalid input.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.345
So why is that?

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:38.855
So the reason we have the validator in place,

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:43.820
okay, let's go back to our code and let's see the employee.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.620
Employee name minimum three character, maximum five characters.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.700
Okay, that's the problem.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.670
So maybe I can provide something like something small,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.840
maybe I can use anything. Anything is fine, right?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.375
Let us is Paul here.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.650
And I'm going to use paul dot my.com.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.555
So let's trigger it again.

00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:10.340
Okay, so two, not one,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.100
which means that recording instead of successfully how we're going to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.790
validate either you can go back and run your employee,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.015
any of the employee which will pick the information or the data with right?

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:23.224
See here you have the ball information.

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:26.750
Right? And let's go back to our database.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.005
And here, let's trigger the request.

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:33.500
See, we got the new employee added here,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.285
which is a poll.

00:05:35.285 --> 00:05:39.620
So next, let me remove all the departments from here.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:48.440
And then I'm going to just insert only employee information.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.775
So Danny, and I'm going to click it again and it concreted.

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:56.600
So the employee which we're not trying to look for, it's a danny.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.960
Okay, so now we have a Danny here.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.940
So now what I'm going to do,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.580
so we have a danny without any department information.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.850
So now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna add some department to the existing employee.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.770
So let's go back to the user.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.685
Then. Our employer control.

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:24.660
Here you're going to create a new method to add only the department for an employee.
