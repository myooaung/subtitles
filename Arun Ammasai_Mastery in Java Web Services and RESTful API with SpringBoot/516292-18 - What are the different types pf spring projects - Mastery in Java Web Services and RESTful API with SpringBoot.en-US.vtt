00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.610
So we discuss about what are the different modules in a spring, right?

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.205
And we need to know what kind of projects,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.630
different kinds of projects available or provided by a spring.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.905
So you can go to the spring.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:15.870
I would add projects that you can find out what are

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
the different kinds of projects provided by a spring.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.725
So you can go here and you can just mouse or

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.540
project here you can see different kinds of Spring Boot framework,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.990
Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Dataflow Spring Data Integration,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.480
batch security that are much more.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.685
So you can use a spring boat.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.810
It's a normal string. We'll start our application and you can use

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.570
the Spring framework to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.900
communicating to the web and the data and messaging and much more.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.640
And you can specifically use spring for a data for database,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.085
I mean, to communicate to the databases.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.825
And you can use a spring Cloud and Spring Cloud flow and much more

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.735
integrations available when you go for a spring because

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.705
that'll multiple projects available in spring.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:03.260
And you can combine multiple projects into a single project and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.995
you're going to create a bigger application here, much secured application.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.475
And obviously it has amazing capability,

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.115
integration capability with some different technologies like

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:17.195
Kafka and J unit test cases and LD app,

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:20.870
and also for web services,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.350
one of the main thing so we can watch string with services.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.840
So we are going to do that in the next video.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.115
So we're going to create,

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:31.760
we're going to use this spring web service projects to create a web service.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.280
And that is going to be a soap web service.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.585
We'll do that in the next video.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:36.860
So there are different types of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530
projects just before you're starting your spring development,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.020
just go and have a look at what are the different portals are

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.365
available and just get some idea would water the H and a,

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.255
each and every project is about.

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:49.820
And if you know each and every projects,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.560
and if you have some idea about it,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.930
you can decide for your project,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.240
what I'm in for your projects,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.345
what kind of project unity go for,

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:01.670
whether it is a Spring Boot, our Spring framework offspring,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.035
Cloud offspring, their services.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:07.085
You can decide one leaf you have idea about the projects.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.885
So in the next video,

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:12.440
we'll start implementing service.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.420
And that is going to be a soap service.
