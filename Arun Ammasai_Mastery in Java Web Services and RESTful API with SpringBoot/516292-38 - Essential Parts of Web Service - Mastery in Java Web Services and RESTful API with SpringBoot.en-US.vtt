00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.380
So before we implement the first method,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.590
we need to understand what are the different types of operations

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.085
which we can perform in a rest API?

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.235
There are four important my thoughts.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.505
The first one is going to be the gate Matata,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:20.625
and the second one is post,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.940
and the third one is put metadata.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.970
And a four to one is tell it these are the four most important thing,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.870
but pretty much most of the places that you could see you only get and the post

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.510
methods and the client which we're going to use is going to be a postman client.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.565
So when do you need to use the a getMethod?

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:41.270
Greg?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.060
So for example, let's compare the database operation.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.590
So you have a list of employees,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.690
how you retrieve the employee information from

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.105
the table we are gonna do select star from, right?

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.205
So when you're fetching the information,

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.425
you need to use the get d.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.735
You need to use the get method.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:01.400
Okay, So retrieve details.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:11.070
Okay, So for example, fetch employee details.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.375
Okay, So the next thing, post.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:19.055
So when do you need to use the post when you insert?

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.550
So I don't want to fetch the information.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.780
I have a new employee,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.270
I want to insert the data into a database or you want to insert

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.960
the day the employee do some collection.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.340
So in those kind of scenarios,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.720
you need to make this a post method.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.409
For example, you can say insert operation, insert employee details.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.185
Okay, so now I know when to use Git and when to use post and when to use the PUT method.

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:49.370
So I have an employee and I inserted some wrong information.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.070
So I need to update the information.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.745
Correct.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.110
So and those kind of situation,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.735
you need to use the update operation.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.915
So for update operation you don't use the PUT method.

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:03.799
So update employee details.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.270
The next thing, okay?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.340
Of course you know what is a delete?

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.290
So when you're performing some error,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.360
delete operation or remove something from

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.950
your database or your repository or your collections.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.430
Those kind of scenarios so we can make use of the delete method.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.800
So delete employee details, okay?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.975
And the client, as I said earlier,

00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:28.310
is going to be postmen,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.430
but how the URL looks like, right?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.350
So when you're using getMethod,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.210
the URL, it'll be just like,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.330
Let me minimize this one so you can see in a broader way,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.605
okay, so the URL will be like employees.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.170
Maybe here you might have something like

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.680
our local host and the port number eight, there are 80.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.905
And here we have all the information.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.385
So the next thing, so when I want to insert something,

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.140
the URL is pretty much the same.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.340
So let's copy this.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.810
And additionally, you will get something else here.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.415
You'll get some new information.

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.710
Which means if you're trying to insert an employee,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.150
they had the first name, last name,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.425
e-mail, and other details, right?

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:12.260
So those will be sent through this part.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.380
This is just a path that information will provide an indie body.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.390
Okay, so if you want to put something,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.980
which means you're updating something,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.450
so how does it looks?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.270
So we're not going to send all the employees and other employee.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.750
We're going to pass some specific employee ID.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.200
So we can simply say the employee ID.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.835
So update.

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:35.800
You can pass on specific employee,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.600
then you're going to update it and delete

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.315
operation is pretty much the same as the update.

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:44.950
So you're going to pass this specific employee ID information to delete the operation.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.930
But here we don't have any differentiate, right?

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.260
So what we can do, we can prove it another dimension here.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.795
So this, when this particular URL hits,

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.295
it will call the update method,

00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:56.590
and when this hits,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.785
it will called the delete operation.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:06.035
Right? So that is how the GET and post and PUT and delete, that will work.

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:11.340
So anyway, we'll create a simple methods and we'll explain how it is going to work out.
