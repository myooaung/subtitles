00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.245
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome back. So now we're going to create

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.190
a another month on because I don't want to handle one I'm at I mean,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.100
I don't want one method to handle all makes options, right?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.140
I want to handle my exception handler

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.530
will handle each and every exception and a separate way.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.645
So now all I need to do is just copy the same method here until C and Control Paste here.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:29.129
So we need to change the handle.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:35.040
Employee not found exception,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.619
okay, so you need to tell the application saying whenever this exit handler OKRs.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:46.055
So first of all, I need to tell what kind of exception does methanation handle.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.290
Do you remember we created something like employee

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.825
not found exception here, the custom exception.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:55.115
So I had a provirus here for so whenever the employee not want excipient rises,

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.250
I want you to run this particular block of code.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.440
So employee not found exception dot class,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.380
sorry, I haven't employee not funded class.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.080
Okay, So here, this simple thing which we need to modify,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.900
we're not going to send us an internal server error, correct.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.030
Way how to send ESA not phone,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.140
which is a four, not four.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.185
Now, our error message looks even more, much better.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:25.415
And initially it sends as a 500 error message because that is a common error.

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:27.200
Because all exception now I have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.485
a specific method to handle these specific error message.

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:33.005
So all we need to do just to reshare your application

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.365
and go back to your postman and just hit the URL again.

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.690
Or application is getting.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.719
Starter might take few more seconds.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160
Okay?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.035
Okay, So our application up and running,

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:55.010
all we need to do is just go back to our Postman and just hit the same your leg in.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.760
Let's take a look at the error message now for the moment,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.945
if you hit the Send now it has to throw a four not four letter.

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:10.165
See, now we've got four not folder and their message employing on phone the same thing,

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:12.790
but the thing is the error message. The reason.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.129
In our exception handler,

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.850
we have written a specific method which will only handle

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.465
the employee not found exception.

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:24.790
And before previously this malate is not available,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.905
so this mother will handle all the exception.

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:31.150
So another way you might add some other exception are saying like

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.905
how I can handle database connection or connectivity issues.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.700
So you need to find out which exception and handle our connectivity issue.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.950
Or maybe you might get null pointer x2.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.945
So even if you're good now Pinter issue,

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:47.650
you have to specific LEA send an error message in

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.230
a different way because NullPointerException in

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.110
pretty much belongs to a development stuff, right?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.460
I mean developer point of view.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460
So we cannot 10 NullPointerException to the user.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.920
So we have then the appropriate message to them.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.440
So our, our, our ultimate goal here is for each and every year exception side,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.285
you need to have your specific one-off one way of handling the exception.

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:11.035
Okay.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:17.815
So so let's go on to putting on more time and let's go back to our post method once.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:18.940
Just take a look at here.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.390
Here, I'm just running the application, okay?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.375
The moment I create a new user,

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:28.780
I'm sending it to 100 as an okay message because I'm trying to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.090
post when you use getMethod to a 100, it's okay,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.785
but when you're trying to enter something,

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:36.740
the data has an integer successfully and then you need send

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.770
appropriate, appropriate response back.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.050
So saying like, I'm in the employee has been

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.050
inserted into tables and they might need to know.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.820
So what is a employee,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.835
what is the unique keys created for my new record?

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:52.865
Some additional information to the client.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.310
Okay, so let's do that in the next video.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.480
How we can handle that.
