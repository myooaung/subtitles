00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.635
So before we proceed in the next method,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's finish the requisite response because we plan to write a different method.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.060
The first one is the good employee and second one is to get all the employees.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.445
And third one is just to delete the employee.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.175
So we need to have a proper request and this one's right.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.820
So all we need to do, just update your existence with all the required information.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.880
And then once it they exist is updated automatically.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
You will Milan, which will pick the changes and we'll create the jacks pick classes.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.100
So now I'm going to show you the existing classes.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.175
So these are the existing plazas,

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:37.410
get employee requests and get employed response.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.840
Now what I'm gonna do, we're gonna make the changes in the Xist.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.460
Adding a few more equals Lakeview,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.409
get all employee require responses,

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.255
get all imply a request and everything.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.890
And for delete employee.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.180
So I'm going to go back our Eclipse and because we have the visual editor over there,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.635
right, so I'm going to use that to finish creation of all the requests.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:00:59.390
So now we have get employee right,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.890
the next thing which we need to do,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.435
Let's need to have one more request to get all employee details.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:06.770
We can do that.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.090
Okay, So let's go.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.720
So I'm going to right-click and create a new element here.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.810
I'm going to get all that's happening here.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.560
So get all employees

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.400
and element.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.989
So get all employees.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.710
And it's going to be

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.650
another complex type Git on employee request.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.230
So we have adequate for vision all the employees at the same time,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.775
you need to have that its rate.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:04.780
So greater than one element for all employee response.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.865
And again, it's going to be a complex type.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:15.950
Said type is equal to new and get all employee response.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.800
Okay, So in a blade responds,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.035
we are going to have some complex type which,

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:29.530
which contains all the detail information about D employees, right?

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.955
So what I'm gonna do here,

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:36.130
let's go back here, right-click, create orange.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.380
Let's go to the source here.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.145
And here we have a good employee response.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:47.005
And we have, what else do we have here?

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.480
Okay, so let's try that.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.910
So under the Get all employ response,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.670
I'm going to create something like employee details.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.510
Employee details.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.850
And it is going to be a new type.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.140
Again.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.360
Set type is equal to employ retails.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.380
Employee details.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.785
Either you can right-click and add new elements or you can go back to the source.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.810
And I think we can make the code even

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.180
better as we go because they haven't get all employ response,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.714
right, which has the all the elements.

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:26.870
Correct. So what I can do is I can copy the same thing here,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.220
control C, and I can keep it here.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.610
So sequence from here

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.450
to there to see,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.100
and I can keep it here.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.585
So which means, let's come up with a design you might take.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:55.015
Okay, So indicate employee response.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:04:00.715
So we have get all employee response which contains the employee details.

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:02.770
At the same time we have a good employee response, right,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.970
which contain the same grass,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.230
I'm gonna kind of response.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.200
So what, how we can make the code a and much better.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.685
So what I'm gonna do, just copy this thing and keep it here.

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:22.750
So both of them or both of them going to use the same kind of input and output.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.790
So even when you're calling a good employer response,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.455
you will have the same information like employee ID,

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.390
employee location, and the zip code.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.970
And when you're using get all employees also,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.560
you will get the same output.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.470
But when you call that thing a single employee,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.150
you will get only one. That is one.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.045
But any call, this get all employees.

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:47.739
You will get multiple list of employees.

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:50.860
And instead they get all employees employed.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.135
It is going to build his stride.

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.390
So which means you need to provide something like to make sure when they exist.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.900
Your object is these acts big glass is greater.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.995
To make sure this will get us a list of employee details.

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:04.460
So you have to introduce another element here.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.145
So max, I guess is it called unbounded,

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:09.140
which means it's a list type.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.260
So now what we can do, Let's go back to the design and we'll just have a look at it here.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.950
So now we have everything in place so that the next thing which we need to do,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.110
delete an employee, okay,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.325
or remove an employee.

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.960
So I'm going to create a new element here.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:39.529
Right-click Add Element, remove employee request.

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.450
And it's going to be another complex type.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.435
So remove employee request.

00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:53.975
But the employer requests must contain some valid employee ID, right?

00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:55.040
So you can pass in,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.315
plug it in, you can remove it.

00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:58.700
So here I'm going to add one more element inside

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.465
your employer is going to be employee ID,

00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:05.760
which is an integer.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.680
Okay, just save it and go back.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.000
And now we need how the response for the remote employee, correct.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.230
Like saying employee removed or some some status.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:27.950
So add element, remote employee response. What is happening?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.945
Remove employee response.

00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:40.885
And again it's going to be

00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:49.105
new type, remove employee response.

00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:51.685
So in the remote employee response,

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:53.440
we can have any kind of output.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.870
Maybe you're going to have a simple string which will run

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.464
as a employee has many more successfully.

00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.540
Or else I can have a Boolean like true or false.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.595
True means employed delta.

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:06.405
So right-click and add element inside.

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:10.410
I'm going to call asset status,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:21.215
element S status, and that type is going to be a Boolean.

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:22.340
Okay?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.080
So now go back.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.970
So now we have everything in place and get

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.190
all employee AND gate employee and remove

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.695
employee everything as a request and the response.

00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:32.300
If you go back to the source,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.490
everything is modified in a proper way.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.110
So the next thing we're gonna do,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.545
we're going to simply copy this all lakes as D and put it in our original project.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:48.390
And we'll see whether our map and picked it up and it will create the new JSP files.
