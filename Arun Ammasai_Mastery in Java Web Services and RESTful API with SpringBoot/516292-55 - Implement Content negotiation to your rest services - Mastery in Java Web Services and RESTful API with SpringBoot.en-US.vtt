00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.185
So we covered a lot of things here.

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.605
So we discussed about exception handling and the validation and

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:13.510
implement headway is the next thing that you want to talk about is content negotiation.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.405
So what is the content negotiation, right?

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.055
So whenever you trigger a request,

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.270
so basically what is happening?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.905
Let me open up Postman to show you that.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:29.745
Okay. So when I'm trying to trigger the request, you know what is happening,

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.510
I'm getting a response back in a JSON format because our rest API is by default,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.905
they will support the JSON type and we don't have to specifically as Saint,

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.370
any description here, like saying like

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
this particular web service needs to accept one leader, JSON.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.050
Maybe the way or maybe I can show that Accept application dot JSON.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.400
I don't have to provide this.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.370
Just click Send again. It will give you pretty much the same thing,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.255
but not everyone required the JSON type.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.460
Some people might exploiting an XML ocean

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.040
because think of a scenario people there is still

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.080
using the slopes are visa and they will call for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.410
the visitor and they're expecting our response as an excellent,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.300
well, so how this thing's going to work

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
out and how they can receive the response as an XML.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.425
Okay, let's try to modify this application slash.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.735
Let's try to use XML.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.975
And I'm gonna trigger the request again.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:27.110
So you won't happen for not six, not acceptable,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.900
which means you're trying to send your request is

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.305
an XML format which is not acceptable one.

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.830
So, so how, how to make things work?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.415
So even if they want to send us a XML, it has to walk.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.875
So to implement that,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.480
that is not much of a changes,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.090
all you need to do is go to your palm, read XML,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.470
add additional dependency called Asset J exon.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.040
So Jackson is the one is the response taking the responsibility of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.685
converting your JSON into x. I'm on our XML into JSON.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:02.510
So if you include that dependency, everything will.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.940
Let's go back to our Intel J.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.555
And here what we're gonna do is it's opened up home.html file

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:14.060
a that just copy-paste it and let's modify the names.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.365
So you can simply go to your browser and you can search for com.org.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.930
You can simply provide Jackson data format XML map,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.300
and it will give you the details as well for now,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.685
since I know I'm going to datatype it here.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:31.775
So faster xml dot and I think it's Jackson.

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:37.460
So Jackson dot data format.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.290
Okay, So data format.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.895
So this is the group ID com dot foster xml dot JSON dot data format.

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:48.115
So the artifact ID is going to be

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:54.475
Jackson data format IF and XML because it automatically gives you the solutions.

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:59.305
So I just given the artifact ID.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:02.260
So whenever we make a change in a permanent XML,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.905
all we need to do is just stop your application.

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.950
We have to build your application once and then we'll start it.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.690
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just simply going to random haven't billed ones.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.370
May take a few seconds.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.795
Let's get going.

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:24.505
Okay, the build is success.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:27.045
So let's go back.

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:29.105
And so okay, The world is success.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.830
Now we need to start the application.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.179
So just tried to application.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.130
So application is getting starter.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.560
Okay, so the application is shattered and our server is up and running.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.660
Let's go back to the man.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.150
And let's trigger the same request.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.995
Initially it had four, not six,

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:58.925
not acceptable levels since we enabled the additional Jackson's support,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.560
it has to work now.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.490
Okay.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.690
So still you're seeing four,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.669
not six, not acceptable.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.180
Sometimes it might not reflect immediately.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.520
All you need to do is go back to your project and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.145
stop the silver ones and started one more time,

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.740
if possible, try to run them out and build one more time.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.740
So let's go back to our Intel J and re-shot your application once.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.630
It might take a few more seconds,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.710
but it's worth the wait.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.090
Some applications getting started now.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.350
Okay, so an application is up and running.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.219
Let's go back to the postman and will trigger the same request.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:41.120
See, it is an XML response,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.580
which means the change which you made, it is working.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.290
You don't have to do any code changes.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.900
Think about the traditional application where you are sending

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.065
the JSON and they user is exploding XML format.

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:57.965
You have lots of code to convert your JSON XML into a JSON to XML,

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.325
XML to JSON you how to do it in the both way.

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:04.310
Okay, so now let's go back and search for something else

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.535
like a specific employee details.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:09.560
Let's hit Send again.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.675
See, it still works.

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:13.850
Even the data which we use,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.960
the links here that is also mapped to the XML response back.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.905
Okay, So how we can use it for the post method we use to send requests XML, right?

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:26.150
I mean requestor JSON,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.665
right, in a JSON format.

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.665
So now what I'm gonna do, let's try to call the method again.

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:32.855
Let's get some any employee details.

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:36.980
Let's copy this item and Control C. And

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.360
let's go back to our post method where we create a user here and here.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.430
Let's try to add the accent matter here.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.780
Okay, so it's the estimate in headers.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.405
So accept and application slash XML here.

00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:58.880
Okay, And now we had to go to the body method.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.895
And here in the raw instead of JSON,

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:04.460
we are going to use the XML.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.790
Okay, So this will not allow as an XML.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.695
So now what we need to paste the XML format,

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:16.130
so we don't need the employee because we are automatically generated through the courts.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.855
So just remove it and click the beautifies.

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.040
It will arrange the code.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.645
Now all we need to do is just click the Send button.

00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:26.540
Okay, it's a two, not one creator,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.200
which means this record has been created.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.270
Let's go back to our getMethod and

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.380
let's remove this so we can call all the employee details.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.280
Just click and see you have 1234123412346.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.495
And that is a 101 new one is four because the list size is three and plus 14,

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:46.235
I just created the same entry again.

00:06:46.235 --> 00:06:51.110
So we should be able to send XML HTTP request

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.194
and we should be able to send back the XML response as well without any code changes.

00:06:56.194 --> 00:07:00.379
So that is the advantage of using the Jackson format.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.500
So that is a, another important thing which you need to know.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.240
So when, whenever you are trying to add some new implementation or new announcement,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.680
you don't have to write it ANSOFF,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.150
avoiding all you need to do it.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.645
We need to find out which dependency you need for the change.

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:16.490
So once you add the dependency,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.725
you might need to make a small minor changes.

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:20.780
That's all your application still.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.665
Bach.

00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:23.310
Thank you.
