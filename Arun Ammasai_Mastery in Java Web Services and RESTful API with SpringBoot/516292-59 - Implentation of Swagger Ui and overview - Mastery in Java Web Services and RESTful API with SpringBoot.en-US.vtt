00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hello everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome back.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.215
So we discussed about the swagger documentation,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:07.125
which is the JSON format.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.340
And we need to find a way to press and even much more better.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.075
So that is where the Swagger UI comes into the picture.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.305
The same kind of information which will be provided in the UI format,

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.615
but it has its own advantages.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.750
So you don't have to make any code changes since we already enabled

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.135
this Wagga to in our configuration file here.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:32.090
So we have as well That's swagger enabled.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.230
All we need to do is just go back to our browser and load the EU

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.820
or at the yourlist http localhost

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:51.600
and port number is a 0 81 slash swagger iPhone, you dot HTML.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.570
See, it's much cooler than the,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.015
our normal JSON, right?

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.660
If we take a look at employees are easy description and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.895
the employee surveys with this Swagger documentation

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:07.715
that I tell and the terms of service,

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:13.835
end contact details, Danielle and send email to Daniel.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.395
And what is the license version?

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.480
So these are our application information.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.400
And what is the base host?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.425
I'm in the base URL which is provided here.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:24.080
You can compare with the postman response here,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.465
see all the information which is provided here.

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.330
Everything in a visual representation in d, u.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.215
But u is much more.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.950
It's not only shows us what kind of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.769
application information and the contact information and the license information.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.290
It as much more, if you take a look at it,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
it will tell us what are the controllers available here.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.035
And the control which we are using is employee controller,

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.180
which is nothing whatever risks controller.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.540
If we expand it, it will tell you what are the methods,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.890
even this methods we discussed in the API documentation as well.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.625
And it's a JSON format here we have it in a UI format and here it tells employees,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:13.310
and it's a GET method and it's getMethod and employees search based on the employee.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.125
That's also a GET method.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.390
And there is one more called delete method,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.700
which is a daily to employee based on the employee ID.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.345
And there is one post method which will create a new user,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:30.365
new employee based on the inputs which will provide.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:34.220
Not only we can see what are the methods.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.260
Actually, instead of course menu,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.365
you can use the Swagger UI to test your web series as well.

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:41.810
You might think, How is that possible then?

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.450
Why do we need to go for a post man, right?

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.610
So when you enable swagger,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.450
it gives you the opportunity to run.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.280
You are rest APIs as well.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.900
So for now, I'm going to check,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.450
get all matter expanded.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.090
It will, it will show you no parameters,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.060
which means for this matter you don't have to pass any input.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.465
Right? And let's try it out.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:09.110
Just, you have a button here which says try it out, just click.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.480
Then it will read to execute,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.855
because you cannot execute them at that without trying it out.

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:16.130
And now what we're gonna do,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.920
just have a look at the response code 200.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.205
And this is where our output will load here.

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:25.910
And you see 401 unauthorized and four not 3404 are

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.975
forbidden and non fun because we don't have any authentication implemented so far.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.210
So now I'm going to execute it.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.145
The moment you've got executed,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.275
just take a look at the response body here.

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:40.385
We've got all the information, 123123451236,

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.770
all the information which

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.355
received a successfully and the response code is going to be 200.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.410
So the Swagger UI,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.435
which you can use it for testing purposes as well.

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:52.235
Okay, so let's try something else.

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:54.740
Let's try get a specific employee.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.110
Here. Employee ID is required.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.075
Do you have data input here?

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:00.935
So let's see a try it out.

00:04:00.935 --> 00:04:04.100
And here you need to provide the employee ID is for example, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.345
It's much simpler than the man when it comes to execution path.

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:12.065
And let's click Execute. See what happen.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:13.520
Employee ID 1, 2, 3,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.825
4 and named Nancy.

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:19.580
And also we got the Hadu AS links as well,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.665
which means it will give you the link information I bought to fetch all the employees.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.950
Okay, So the good mother is working at the same time.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.760
The good employee ID also working, right?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.075
So now let's try to add a new employee here.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.745
So click Try it out.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.410
It automatically gives all the information.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.600
All you need do is fill the information.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.730
So dummy and employee ID,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.090
we don't need to prove it anyway because it's automatically populated in the program.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.900
And here the name.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:05:00.275
Okay, so email is dummy at mail.com and name is Tammy.

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:01.865
Let's just test user, right?

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:04.595
So let's click Execute here.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.020
What happen?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.460
So we've got two, not one code which means inserted.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.170
So let's go back and get all employees call method.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.420
I'm going to get all implies method will execute it and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.895
we'll see why that the new employees received here or not.

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:26.525
See we got the new employee dummy, dummy gmail.com.

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:33.845
So let's try to delete this one using the last API which we used for delete method.

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:39.155
So this is the mother which we need to try now and try it out and just see him.

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:41.660
I'll show you on auditing. So the employer,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.035
which I'm trying to radius of four and execute,

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:47.915
see what happened 200 response code, which means successful.

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:52.115
Let's go get all method and execute one more time.

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:57.530
Now, you only able to see the employee ID for because it's remote.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.390
Okay, so another thing,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.290
just have a look at the coloring for each and every month.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.660
That's because del it is something we are trying to remove.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.130
So it's highlighted the red colored box and insert something. It's a green.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.390
And finishing operation.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.950
It is a kind of a light blue.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.870
So it will give you

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.175
the visual representation and would have met thought and what it does.

00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:20.240
Right?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.820
And if you want to explore what are the models are available?

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.905
We have the employee, great,

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:28.100
because when you are trying to save the employee, it will die.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.275
I mean, when you're trying to retrieve single employee,

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:32.570
it will give you the employee has a response, right?

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.770
And if you expand that,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.810
it will give you the internal information.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.390
So what are the data available into the employee?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.355
And the similar way Entity model,

00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:42.275
again to the module content and employee.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:46.430
But another thing is we'll have the links as well here.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.815
And links.

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:51.410
And we don't have any view and model view here,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.880
so we don't have to worry about that.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.370
So what are the in the most information which you are not a 100 person inflammation which

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.270
you're looked at in the swagger response API here.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.145
Similar thing or the same thing which would be represented in the IEEE format here.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:15.650
So using this, you can make the visual presentation at the same time.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.430
You can use it for your own testing purposes asset because it has the eligibility to it

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.660
has the at once options like you can see them at that at the same time,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.860
you can execute them as well.
