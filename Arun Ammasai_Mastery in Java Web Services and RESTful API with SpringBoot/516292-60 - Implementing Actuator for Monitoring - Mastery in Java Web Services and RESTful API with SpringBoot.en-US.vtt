00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.700
So we implement a different kind of functionality so far, right?

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.410
Even we discuss about how to document

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.840
your entire application and how to modify them as well based on your project needs.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.290
But now think of a scenario where you are implementing lot of services,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.120
but who will monitor those?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.910
Because we need to know whether the services up and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.015
running or is there any memory leak out dish.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.270
Right. So we need a someone to stay

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.690
over there and check whether the application are up and running.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.090
So that is where the actuator comes into place,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.290
which he said monitoring tool.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.240
But another thing, you don't have to do any code changes here to enable the actuator.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.570
All you need to do is you need to add two dependency in your palm,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.420
that XML which enables the, the monitoring tool.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.985
So how we can do that? What are the first one?

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:58.190
The first one which we need to do is start a actuator.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.510
So which will collect all API details,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.920
but how to see them,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.980
to visualize them, we're going to use something called hol browser.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.290
So we are going to enable these two inner part XML.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.980
Then we'll see how it is impacting our application.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.510
Let's go to browser and search for starter actuator,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.170
my oven, and always try to get the latest version.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.235
So let's choose 2.5 and let's copy this

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:42.905
to C and go back to our palm nut XML and just add the new dependency here.

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:44.060
And this is not enough.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.875
We need a one more dependency called as spring a rest to haul roads or Mallon.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:58.670
So again, go for the latest 13.3.3.9 and copy all of them.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.455
Control Z and go back to your intelligence or your Eclipse and paste.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:07.430
So we just add up these two dependencies, right?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.205
So now all we need to do is just start your server.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.980
I mean, we added a few new dependencies, right?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.390
So we need to update

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.555
our mountain projects are related to project or if you're using Eclipse,

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.780
update your Maven properties, right?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.540
So maybe our services up and running.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.905
What are the next thing which we need to do?

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:28.129
So we need to make sure that our two URLs,

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.280
which is available and which will help us

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
to understand what are the different services provided by that.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.835
The first one to access that http,

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:42.889
localhost and 800 81,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.560
which is our port number and actual later.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
So this will give you all the API information about how to visualize them using

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.300
Hal blows air to access with hobos are sometimes

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.705
you can only provide it has to be local host and the port number that is enough.

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.180
But sometimes that won't work in that scenario,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.960
you need to provide a fully or a grocer slash index dot HTML.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.330
Let's try the first one.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.385
So let's open the browser and paste the URL and okay,

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.350
okay, so the thing is,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.390
I haven't started the application ready,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.370
Let's start the application.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.750
Started.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.595
My take a few seconds,

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.560
or applications getting started now.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.780
So I'll say can you get done?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.850
Okay, So the damn cat started at the boat number age raid 1.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.390
Let's go back to the browser and refresh the page.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.465
See, now we've got the actuator,

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:46.690
and here we have the list of services provided.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.725
The first one is actuator and the health to minder the hilt.

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:55.030
You can go to this link and it'll tell you whether the status is up or down.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.420
And a similar way if we have something else as well,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.815
so actuator held path.

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:03.040
So here you need to provide some specific information,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.240
some parameter to know

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.210
that specific ID path for is

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.980
when you have multiple surveys red unit to provide

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.665
some specific idea in to check whether that's up and running.

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:15.140
Okay, fine. So these are our,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.050
Do you think in these informations are enough?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.100
Now actually not.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.190
We have a lot of information which we need to monitor, okay?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.930
And these are the basic information.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.205
So if you want to access are if you want to bring all the information,

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:33.125
we have to modify some properties in our application dot properties.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.745
It's go back to intelligent Eddie,

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:36.380
anyway, I'm gonna make changes, right?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.130
So let's stop the server and good application at properties.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.420
And here we need to do,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.400
we have to add a property here.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.520
So management, sorry. Management.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.400
Door, endpoints, dot web,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.544
dot x poster, dot include,

00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:02.090
we have include and exclude.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.340
So for now I'm not gonna do anything specific.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.270
So I'm going to star which means collect all of them.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.585
So management don't endpoints dot-dot-dot exposure,

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:14.435
dot include is equal to star,

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.325
which means it will take and cut off everything.

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:19.460
Or if you want to include only specific services are

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.045
specific functionalities. You can defend them.

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:26.060
But for now, we're going to use this tab.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.560
Let's start the application again.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.370
The application of integer pointer,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.505
but actually enabling this functionality with the star,

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.100
it's not advisable because it will take lot of

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.860
emitted because they know there's an array when we have a hundreds of service,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.710
how many Rick was unresponsive or keep on going.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.150
So everything will be dropped,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.700
so it will make the heavy load for your server.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.200
So application is up and running.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.720
Let's go back to our browser and refresh it again.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.220
For now, I can see 123,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.735
but the moment I refresh,

00:05:55.735 --> 00:05:58.165
you should be able to load of them.

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:01.180
So here it will give you all the information

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.030
about what is actuator and what are the beans available in

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.910
your application and what are the cash and health for

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.064
evacuated and conflict and conflict properties.

00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:12.520
We have application on properties, right?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.500
Those information, To be very frank,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.155
it has all the information I want a particular application.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:20.000
Even we can see some metrics ASL,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.600
but in this view it's not that clear, right?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.640
So we can use the hobos,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.690
which will tell us even much clearer array cells governors,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.160
who you say you are right, this copy and go to your browser and open it.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.370
See what happens now.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.405
Now we've got some proper UI. So what do we need to do?

00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:48.620
Let's search for actuator and go see now we've got all the information.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.565
So beans, health, conditions and properties,

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:59.315
info, matrixes and head down by thread dump log as everything will be monitored here.

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.760
Okay, So if you take a look at this tab,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.080
what are the information available here?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.400
The same information available here,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.080
but only the view is different.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.910
Okay, So let's explore some other.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.530
Let's go inside the beans.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.510
So when you go inside the beans,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:18.140
which contains lot of information because when this Spring Boot application started,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.005
there are a lot of supporting beans will be initiated,

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:22.940
but we are not worried about that.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.220
Let's talk about the BGN which we created.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.600
So we do create or something like swagger configuration.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.760
And here we have a bean called new API rate.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.570
So let's go back.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.870
I'll bro, so let's search for the new APA bean.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.585
Let's search for it here.

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:41.555
See here, this is our new API.

00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:44.120
And the type is dot get,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.345
because the archivist that has been we're sending back from the API, right?

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:50.210
So, and that's a bean method.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.195
So basically in this particular property will handle all the beans.

00:07:56.195 --> 00:08:00.030
So let's go back to activate it and see what else is there.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.660
And we have a beans and the same damn configuration property.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.870
Let's go to confession property and we'll search for a rate one.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.520
So that is where we updated the port.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.225
So the port and the valleys, 800, 81.

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:24.760
So pretty much all the information about your application.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.455
So let's see what else is there.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.410
Let's go back to activator.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.990
And it will tell you some metrics as well if you want to see the metrics.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.670
But here you will have only less information.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.810
But when you have a bigger obligation,

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.640
you might have a lot of things here.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.575
So this is the a matrix and here we have a lot of different matrices.

00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:48.055
So let me search for this particular property alone.

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:52.090
And you can simply grow at the property here and click Go.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.130
You know what happened.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.815
It'll give you the specific information about that particular property alone.

00:08:57.815 --> 00:09:01.100
Write a description, seconds and the measurements, the statistics,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.980
all the information, and see the values that you are a tax them dozer and actuated.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.965
These are the ones which we already used.

00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:14.915
Right? So let's go back and see what else is there.

00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:19.340
So basically, you can simply mind that everything from here.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.405
Okay?

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:22.940
So, and as I mentioned earlier,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.925
to enable this with the star,

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:32.750
it's not advisable because it might load a lot of memory into your servers.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.015
Okay, so use it wisely and it's a handy option for a developer's.

00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:39.630
Thank you.
