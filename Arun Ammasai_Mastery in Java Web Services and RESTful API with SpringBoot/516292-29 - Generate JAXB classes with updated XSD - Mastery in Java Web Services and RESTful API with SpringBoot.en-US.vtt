00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
So now we have all that equals non-response in place.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.075
So now we need to just copy the entire exit day.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.970
The reason why I'm coping, we need to put it in our world didn't project.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.640
So which is available in our IntelliJ IDE.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.770
So just Control C and Control V.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.155
And we all good.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.940
So now what we need to do,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.835
just stop the server and see,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:25.350
just take a look at this particular file,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.735
a hatch animals we have only get employer egos and get employed response.

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:33.635
Now, the moment I just do a map and build one more time,

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:37.760
this particular package is automatically refresh and it will create it,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.495
it will create it with the new another geography classes like it.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:42.920
Forget all employ requests,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.490
get all employee response for the employee and remember a response,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.600
everything will be created here.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.890
Just have a look at it here.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.380
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just install and run it.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.980
So there is an error here,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.480
so cannot find symbol.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.110
Where is it?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.580
Okay, So we had to make small modifications, right?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.265
Because see, the build is failed.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.400
But the same time the class has been picked up and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.420
exits changes has been picked up and the new class felt has been created.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.010
The reason why we are getting error.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.440
Previously, we just directly hard coded

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.670
the data and we just modified their request and the response model.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.330
So gave it, it's a good template response in the ghetto, employ respond.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.600
We have the employee details inside the employee did is we have all the information.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.460
So just make a small change.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.100
Just Control C and go back.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.780
Control we employee debts.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:57.425
So now what we're going to do employee, okay,

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:03.890
and then finally, response

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.640
dot employee details, dot.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.780
Or I can simply directly use set the employee details.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.330
And here I can use that thing.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.630
Okay, so what is entered here?

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.290
It is, it goes a lot.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.895
We don't have it here.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:35.675
So I just want if it has a pink color so I can simply modify it,

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:42.200
sit in code and just made the change and the last one on.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.410
Okay, so now everything is as usual and now we've got all the classes has been created.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.535
Right?

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:55.130
So the next thing, we need to prepare some local data kind of offline repository.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.520
So the reason why we are getting offering repository,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.634
because when we have a multiple employees,

00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:05.345
we can use a good employee method to fetch a specific employee details.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.145
Okay, So, so for that,

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.980
I'm going to create a repository.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.730
And then we'll move on to the next method.
