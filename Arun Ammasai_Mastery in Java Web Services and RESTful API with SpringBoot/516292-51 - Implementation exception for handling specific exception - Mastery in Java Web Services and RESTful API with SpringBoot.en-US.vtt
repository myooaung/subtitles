00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
Hello everyone.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.755
Welcome back.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:05.145
So when you're trying to insert an employee, see,

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:09.270
I've got a two hundred two hundred status message, which is okay.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.455
And that is no response in the body at all.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm not getting anything back to my client saying

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.600
like the employer has been inserted successfully, that is no error message.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.620
That is no proper messages to the client, right?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.945
So that's not the right thing to do.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.010
So we had to make some changes to provide them proper error message I mean,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.835
not their messages, proper response back to their clients.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:37.140
So this is the at the Save employment or which we tried before.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.965
So we're going to make some modifications to this method to make it even on much better.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.230
So the first thing which I need to do,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.810
I had to go back to the same employee matter.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.360
So once employees created

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.830
successfully ion interests in the employee back to the, our controller.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.010
So return a and B.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.950
Okay, so now let's go back to our controller here,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.475
and here we have to make some changes.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:09.635
So now what I'm gonna do here,

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.090
I'm going to create an employee.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.995
So it's going to be a new employee.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.050
So basically what I did,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.170
I saved the employee and say Would employee

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.724
information get it because I want some details from the response.

00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:28.160
And then I can send the same thing to the user.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.450
Right?

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.980
So how we can do that,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.380
we basically we need to send a response in detail.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.544
So whenever you are trying to modify in the response,

00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:38.720
say this is the part we are trying to modify, right?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.400
This is a place you're trying to send something which mean this sees the response body.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.810
This is a request body.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.940
So I'm going to make change the response body.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.810
So obviously when you are making change in the response body, you know what happened.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.970
You have to change the return type.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.115
This is not going to be a void.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.470
We have to send the response entity back.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.510
So response entity and we know don't at all.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.325
So we're going to pass the object here.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:06.050
So now the next thing,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.755
the response entity, we have to send a proper details.

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.750
So we ended a phage some information from

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.740
the current request and we'll add some information to eat.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.345
So to hair. To do that,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.950
we have to do something.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.520
So who can give you the information about your current request?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.170
Of course, you are subtle, It's terrible.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.455
This is the one is handling the request and responses.

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:29.015
So all we need to do,

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.670
just go you the servlet.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.020
So subtle, let URI.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.805
So we have a classical servlet.

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:42.140
You are a component.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.580
The reader EGN from current request.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.605
So from the current liquids, what are you going to do?

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.300
I'm going to take the path.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.255
It's not exactly taking the bus whenever poverty in the path,

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:58.910
it allows you to append some informations in the response back to the user.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.140
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.960
I'm gonna provide something like employee ID here.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.450
Employee ID.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.795
And then, so once it is done, what do we need to do?

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:17.435
We have to build and send a response back with some proper rate details.

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:21.650
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna use a build and expand.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.590
So here you need to get some information from the request and you can send

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.350
it back to the and so we have the employee right.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.650
So being retrieved from the new employee name, employee dot,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.805
get to employee ID, right?

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.690
And then to you URI,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.210
a method which returns the, the updated URI.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.265
So now we're going to create a variable to store that.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.630
This will return a URL it.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.105
So let's create a variable for that.

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:48.695
So this will give you,

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.855
let me put it in a proper way here.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:55.400
So path and build and to URI.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.820
Okay, so here I'm just using the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.360
solar to retrieve the current request and I'm just adding something,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.840
another request and I'm just building expanding,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.170
which means I'm getting some information from my updated information,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.920
which means our new employee and I'm adding it and I'm creating the DES and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.060
you are a because this URL we're going to provide in saying the response entity.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.880
So the next thing, we need to return something, right?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.585
So written, obviously we have written the responsibility.

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:30.620
All right, So new response entity here.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.510
So in the response entity,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.920
the first thing which we need to do,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.290
what we need to create the respondent to, right?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.270
So we have the response entity as

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.180
an object for now we have to create the response entity.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.990
Seen that great matter which takes the array as an input.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.885
Great, So URL which we already created.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:57.905
So ERA and weld metal will happen.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:02.630
Creator you or I.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.330
And then we supposed to show the building otherwise not showing here.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.845
Okay. It's not near as function.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.565
So response entity that greater New URI.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:19.220
The reason why we're not creating the new here,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.560
because I'm going to build an object here.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.705
So this will return the object,

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.390
so you don't have to use the new keyword in there before.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.570
So now there is something.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.010
So all we needed to just restart the server and go bug and see how it is working.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.315
Okay?

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:38.030
See you whenever you make changes in the response body,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.910
which means the the input and the output response which you are sending the sending to

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.180
the endpoint user are the clients which will impact the response body class.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.680
So just understand this.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.910
This is a request body. This is

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.355
the response body we are working on the response body now.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.215
So now it is set to a 100, right?

00:05:57.215 --> 00:05:59.670
So now let's see what's going to happen.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.780
Okay, This arrow is up and running.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.910
So all we need to do, Let's run

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.600
our first method which will give you all the employee details.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.675
So just hit enter.

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:19.775
Okay, So we've got all the employees.

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.620
Now I'm going to create a new one.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.870
So let's try the Jack.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.600
Okay, so I'm going to hit Send now.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.330
Just have a look at the response body here.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.064
Okay, still we're hitting something.

00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:35.990
And you might see why there's nothing here but that is something.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.745
But just take a look at the status here.

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.050
It is two, not one,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.480
it is not the 200 because 200 and

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.600
specifically for getting the information fetching operation.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.775
So whenever you use get 200 is appropriate response, successful cold,

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.880
but when you're trying to insert something to a 101,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.675
but where is the information which we need to send us to the client's right.

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:58.280
Just go to the head dissection.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.750
See here as GDP local versus age or age at one end,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.760
employees and the user.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.285
The value which we passed is 44 is the one which we pass desert.

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:15.020
I mean it's not past the Jack is a new user to create a right,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.495
so he has an employer BSL4.

00:07:17.495 --> 00:07:20.989
Let's go back and run the surveys again that get all employee.

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:23.345
Say here, the employee ID is four.

00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:27.215
So if you want to check slash for C,

00:07:27.215 --> 00:07:29.000
we've got the employer you back.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.835
Okay, So this is our year to make use of the different methods and different editor,

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:38.930
I mean the different response code handlers, right?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.360
So in the next example we're going to try

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.715
and you're going to be going to perform the delete mapping,

00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:46.580
which means we have tried to get and a post right down on the.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.990
Another important thing is how to delete out or use the delete method.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.220
We'll talk over the next video.
