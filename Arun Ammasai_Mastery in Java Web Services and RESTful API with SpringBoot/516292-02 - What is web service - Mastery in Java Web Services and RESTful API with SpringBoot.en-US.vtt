00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.455
Welcome back.

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:06.745
It's time for us to understand what is their services.

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:08.890
So we are going to create a Web Services right?

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.635
Before that. When done, understand what is the web service? Correct.

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:16.000
At client is communicating to a server.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.420
I'm requesting something and someone is giving responses,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.580
what is called, it is called communication.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.830
But the same communication is happening over top of the Internet,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.375
which is called as a Web Services,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.340
which means basically in a simple term.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.390
So WE, which is offered by a device or a server to another device,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.925
to another person on another server.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.700
And communicating through the www,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.080
which is World Wide Web,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.810
we can call the Internet.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.840
So those are, these are all called ASA web services, right?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.610
For example, you are trying to send out

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.085
a message from your walks up to some other else Watson.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.545
So the moment you sent out a message, what happens?

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:59.014
It's not directly going into the the other person's inbox.

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:03.425
The first, the message which you send it to reach the server,

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:05.195
which means a host.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:06.440
That host.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.690
Once it has reached the dual,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.120
read that the information's to the end user,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440
which means another person.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.660
So that is how the web services will walk.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.360
So if you're using something and if you're trying to,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.270
if you're trying to request something and if you're getting a response,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.120
which means somebody in the middle where they're working, means the server.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.640
You're trying to create a request and somebody is responding to you,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.235
which means that it's an intermediate person.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.125
The person is called SAS server.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.155
So server is running on a computer and listening for

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:39.890
all the request that are multiple people can request at the same time, right?

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.990
The salaries need to be capable of having multiple requesters, right?

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.265
So not only that,

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.890
when you're transforming the information through the Internet that

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.680
are different ways or different formats.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.810
For example, HTML, JSON,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.940
XML and plain texts and much more.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.570
So each and every format which will help us to solve some kind of a business problem.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.940
So all of them are,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.935
Harvard is working through the Internet protocol.

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:14.335
So the web services or using the whip now web technology called as a hash GTP,

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.270
which means we all know what is HTTP,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.585
that transport protocol. Right?

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:24.640
So now let's see a simple diagram how exactly the Internet is working.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.500
So we have a web layer.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.750
So in web layer will request something,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.030
but we blend, doesn't know what to respond.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.190
So the web layer will take the information,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.390
it will bring it to the business,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.534
which means the backend logics.

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.020
For example, in the web layer,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.320
you are trying to provide a username and a password.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.045
It will not directly give you,

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:46.180
or it will not directly respond back with your inbox.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.259
First, it will take your inputs to the server,

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:53.615
which where we have the business logic return.

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.270
So the business will take the inputs and it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.750
will verify the information within the database.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.900
So the data layer, which will pull the data from the database.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.940
So there are multiple things will happen.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.440
So the business will receive the information from the user and it will take it compare

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.050
the information with the database and our data layer is going to help us read.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.880
So basically what happened.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.495
The information is shared through the internet from one end to the UNAR, that end.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.240
So that is how the web services is going to.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.670
I mean, that is how the web service is working.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.625
And we have a lot more examples, okay,

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:33.440
so in the next video,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.705
we'll talk about what is a definition.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:37.905
So what is a basic rule for all of them?

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.230
I'll talk about in the next video.
