00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.015
Let's take a closer look at the machine learning process

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:07.825
and understand when our model is ready for deployment.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:10.840
In machine learning, the algorithm looks at the data,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.955
derives pattern, and creates a model.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.100
Let's start from data.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.965
Typically we received broad data and then we do the data preprocessing.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.340
Data preprocessing involves stapes,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.875
lake data cleansing data standardization,

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.650
fixing issues with null values,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.795
missing records, unknown values,

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.445
and various other things.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:39.145
During data preprocessing, we also convert categorical values, two numerical values.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:43.095
Because machine learning models can work with numerical.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:46.760
This step can be performed within the machine-learning boundary,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.310
or it can be performed by another team.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.250
For example, a team which specializes in big-data Spark,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.059
which is a very popular technology for data preprocessing.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.375
For many models, we also do feature scaling.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.810
That is bringing all the features to the same scale so that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.410
the model will not get biased or influenced by the particular feature.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.730
Once that is done or data is ready for machine learning algorithm.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.400
Depending on the problem we're trying to solve,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.315
we might repeat this process several times to get the perfect data.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.370
For our machine learning algorithm.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.090
We feed the data to an algorithm, a model.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.040
But is that the final model?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.105
Once we get a model,

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:33.935
we test the accuracy.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.145
We refine to the model to get higher accuracy.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:41.030
If we go back to the data preprocessing step and generate the data again

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.410
and feed it to the algorithm again and to get the model with the desired accuracy.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.240
Apart from accuracy, we also check whether the data is overfitting and underfitting.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.355
And once we are happy with the model,

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:56.220
we deploy a particular Watson to production.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.520
So that is the final model and that gets used by different applications.
