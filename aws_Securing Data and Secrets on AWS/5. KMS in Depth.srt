1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,140
So let's talk a little more about KMS in depth, starting with key rotation.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,440
Key rotation is what happens when we update a key's backing material,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,060
and AWS saves the old key material so you will always be able to decrypt

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,680
information that was previously encrypted with an old backing key.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,490
Now for the standard AWS managed keys, and these are,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,940
of course, the default keys you see for each service in each region,

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,140
the key material is automatically rotated every three years.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,160
You can't change or disable this,

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,060
and this rotation happens in a way that is completely transparent to you,

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,870
and when a key is automatically rotated,

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,750
you don't actually need to update any references to keys in your application,

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,240
because it's only the keys backing material that has changed,

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,310
not its ID or alias.

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,050
For a customer‑managed CMK with AWS‑generated key material,

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,490
the key material can optionally be rotated automatically every year,

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,490
but you must enable this yourself.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,800
So notice this is every one year, and not every three years,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,640
like the AWS‑managed keys.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,870
But for a customer‑managed CMK with imported key material,

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,820
there is no automatic rotation option at all,

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,640
you must manually rotate the key material yourself,

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,300
which involves creating a new CMK,

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,460
importing the new material, and updating the existing

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,670
key's alias to point to this new CMK.

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,070
I'll talk about the process for doing this in the demo.

26
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,660
Now there is one advantage to importing your own key material,

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,700
which is that you have total control over the key rotation

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,140
schedule when you have AWS‑generated key material.

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,320
So that's both for the AWS‑managed and customer‑managed

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,910
CMKs with AWS‑generated key material.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,620
The three and one year rotation schedules for these

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,830
are fixed and cannot be changed, but with imported key material,

33
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,470
you could rotate it every six months, or every month, or

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,110
whatever is required in your environment.

35
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's hop over to the KMS console and I'll show you what I'm talking about.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
In this demo, I'll show you how to create new customer master keys.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,170
I'll create a CMK with AWS‑generated key material, then I'll create

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,540
another key and discuss how to import your own key material.

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,770
Now here we are in the console.

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,070
I'll go to kms, and you see I don't have any keys yet,

41
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,840
so I'll go over here and click Create key. By default, keys you

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,320
create in KMS are what are called symmetric keys.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,870
These keys never leave AWS unencrypted, which is obviously a best practice.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,510
Now you could choose asymmetric here,

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,430
but I'll leave this as symmetric, and then show you the advanced options here,

46
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,510
which is where I choose between KMS for the key material origin,

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,300
which is AWS‑managed key material, or external,

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,440
which means I would import my own key material.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,640
You see CloudHSM is also an option here,

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
and we'll discuss that a little bit later on in

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,580
this module, but for this example, I'll choose KMS and click Next.

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,910
Now here's where I give the key and alias,

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,290
so I'll call this mycmk, and I won't worry about any tags for now.

54
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,320
Now here on the next screen is where we set up the elements of the key

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,630
policy, which we'll discuss more in a bit, but here we can choose key

56
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,520
administrators, so the users and roles who can administer the key, and

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,730
I'll choose my awscourse account for now, and we'll grant that account

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,410
permissions to delete the key as well; and this permission is an

59
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,330
important one, because deleting a key is usually not a good idea, and in fact,

60
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,190
if you do attempt to delete a key, you can't just delete it right away.

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,250
AWS will force you to choose a waiting period between

62
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,430
seven and 30 days before the key is actually deleted, and

63
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,900
there's good reason for this.

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,300
If you delete a key and let's say there's an EBS volume out there or

65
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,220
something else that's using that key for encryption,

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,180
you're going to need to copy the data off of that

67
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,790
volume while it's still attached, or you won't have access to it anymore,

68
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,510
and I'll click Next, and now we can choose the users and roles who have

69
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,820
permission to actually use this key to encrypt and decrypt data.

70
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,330
So again,

71
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,310
I'll choose my awscourse account, and you'll see here, I could actually

72
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,840
add another AWS account here for cross account access.

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,330
Now I'll click Next, and here's the default key policy.

74
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,240
We won't go through this right now, we'll talk through it

75
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,630
in more detail later in this module, and now quickly here,

76
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll just show you how we could create a CMK with imported key material.

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,230
So we'll click Create key again, we'll choose symmetric, and this

78
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,360
time under Advanced options. we'll choose external for our key

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,050
material origin, and before I proceed,

80
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,820
I have to acknowledge that I understand the security availability

81
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,280
and durability implications associated with this.

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,040
So I'll click Next, and again I have to give my key an alias,

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,600
so I'll call this one myimportedmaterialkey, and click Next.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,970
I'll choose the same key administrator and key usage permissions, and so

85
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,950
here is our key policy, and now when I click Finish,

86
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,940
you'll see that I'm being prompted to download a wrapping key and import token.

87
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,900
So the actual process here is beyond the scope of the exam.

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,250
But what you would do here is click download,

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,860
and once you've saved this file,

90
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,820
you basically have 24 hours to use the wrapping key to encrypt your

91
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,840
own key material, and you could use something like OpenSSL to do this

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,560
encryption, but then you come back here and you upload the file

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,930
containing your wrapped key material,

94
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,820
as well as the import token from the file you originally downloaded.

95
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,660
Then you click upload key material, and now you have a CMK

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,890
with imported key material, and keep in mind that if you

97
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,800
wanted to rotate this key,

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,370
you would create a new CMK, import your new key material using the same process,

99
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:09,000
and then update the alias to point to this new CMK, and that's how we create new customer master keys in KMS.
