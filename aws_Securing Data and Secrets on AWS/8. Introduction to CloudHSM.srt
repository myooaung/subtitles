00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's wrap up this module with a brief discussion about CloudHSM.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,590
CloudHSM might appear on your exam,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,030
but there probably won't be any in‑depth questions about it.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,310
Now as you saw in the demo, when we created our CMK,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,540
we were given the option to use CloudHSM as the source of our key material.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,810
So CloudHSM is a cloud‑based hardware security module.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,640
Now keep in mind that KMS is also backed by hardware security modules,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,520
but those HSMs are multitenant, which means,

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,640
of course, that they are shared by many different users.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,240
So let's say you have a compliance requirement that says

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,230
you must use your own dedicated HSM.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,840
In that case, you're going to want to use CloudHSM.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
CloudHSM is single tenant,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,710
which means it belongs exclusively to you and it sits in your VPC

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,560
along with your EC2 instances and anything else you put there. So

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,130
you can configure a CloudHSM cluster that spans multiple

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,730
availability zones within your VPC to get high availability and you

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,120
pay an hourly price for it.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,160
Let's take a quick look in the console, and I'll show you how to create a

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,940
CloudHSM cluster. So here in the console, let's go to CloudHSM and the first

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,200
thing we need to do here is create the cluster.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,310
So for our cluster,

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,320
we need to select a VPC and some availability zones, so I'll just

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,090
choose my default VPC here, and obviously, we need to select at least

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,240
two availability zones for high availability.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,440
So I'll just pick my default subnets in 1a and 1b here,

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,110
and we're going to create a new cluster by clicking Next.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,290
We could add tags here,

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,310
but I'll just skip ahead and click Create cluster and this process takes a

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,340
few minutes so I'll go ahead and speed up the video here.

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,220
Now, once the cluster is created,

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,310
we need to initialize it. So I can click the cluster name here and

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,950
then click Initialize, and in order to initialize it,

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,420
I have to choose an AZ here in which to create the HSM.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,100
So I'll just go ahead and choose one here and click Create,

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,140
and this process will take a few minutes as well.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,330
So once the HSM is created, there are some additional steps here,

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,810
and this gets to be beyond the scope of what you need to know

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,220
for the exam, but from here you would need to initialize the

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,100
cluster and then activate it and you'll be good to go and then

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,570
to interact with your HSM, which includes administering users, generating keys,

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,620
etc, this all has to be done with the CloudHSM client software,

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,000
which is available as a download from AWS for Windows and Linux. So that's CloudHSM.
