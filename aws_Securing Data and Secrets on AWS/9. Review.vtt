00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.140
In this module,

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.530
we introduced encryption and the differences between encryption

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.030
and transit, or over the network, and at rest,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.340
which is data stored on a disk in the cloud.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.850
We looked at S3 in depth and discussed its default encryption options,

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.070
as well as options for customer managed keys, where AWS still performs

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.100
the encryption, and client‑side encryption, where the data is sent to

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.230
AWS already encrypted. We looked at other AWS services and how they

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.870
generally require you to enable encryption at the time you're creating

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540
a new resource.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.130
Then we looked at the AWS Key Management Service and

12
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.920
created a new customer master key.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.720
We talked about how a master key can be used to generate a

14
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.840
data key to perform envelope encryption,

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.240
which is useful whenever you need to encrypt more than 4 KB worth of data.

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.840
And finally, we discussed CloudHSM,

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.180
which may be useful if you have a requirement to use a

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.340
dedicated hardware security module.

19
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.600
You are well on your way to mastering the data protection elements

20
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.240
of the AWS Certified Security ‑ Specialty exam.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll see you in the next module, where we will discuss secure parameter storage. Come back soon.
