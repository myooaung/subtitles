1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,220
In this demo,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,220
we will enable Cross‑Region Replication between S3 buckets in different regions.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,310
We will also examine the JSON policy for the IAM role

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,370
permissions that are required to support replication.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,590
So here we are in S3, and you see the bucket we created earlier in

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,090
this course, and it's in the us‑east‑1 region.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,550
Remember that we enabled default encryption on this bucket with SSE S3 as well.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,480
But first I'm going to create another bucket in a different region

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,800
so we can demonstrate Cross‑Region Replication.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,610
So I'll come over here to Create bucket, and we'll call this bucket

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,620
awscoursereplicationbucket, and we'll put this bucket in the us‑west‑1

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,470
region, and now that we've created that,

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,160
I'll choose the bucket I created earlier in this course, and up here,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll go to Management, and on this screen,

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,530
I'll select Replication, and now I'll click Get started.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,750
So you'll see the first thing it's telling me here is that I

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,950
need to enable versioning on the bucket,

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,660
which fortunately I can do just by clicking this button here, and now I

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,520
can choose to replicate the entire bucket, so that's anything added or

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
updated in the bucket from this point forward, but it won't replicate any

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,350
existing items that are already in the bucket, and here you see I have

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,730
the option of also replicating objects encrypted with KMS. So when I

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,960
check this here,

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
you'll see it selects the keys from my account in this bucket's region.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,950
So anything encrypted with either mycmk or the default S3 key can first be

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,180
decrypted using those keys in the source region before it gets replicated to

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,410
the destination region and re‑encrypted there with a key stored in that

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
region, and I'll go ahead and click next,

29
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,380
and you see here that my destination bucket could be in

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,760
this account or another AWS account.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,300
But I'll go ahead and choose my replication bucket here, and you'll see

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,490
I also need to enable versioning on that bucket, and here now I can

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,070
choose my KMS key from the destination region.

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,880
So I don't have any of my own CMKs in us‑west‑1,

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,130
but I can choose the aws/s3 key here,

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,780
and that will be the key that is used to encrypt any

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,890
objects replicated to this bucket, and I'll go ahead and click Next.

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,510
Now if I already had an IAM role with the appropriate

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,500
permissions as we discussed earlier,

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,330
I could choose that here or just have a new one created, so I'll go

41
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,460
ahead and choose Create new role, and I'll give the rule a name and

42
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,340
make sure it's enabled, and click Save.

43
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,470
So here you'll see the name of the IAM role that was created for us, but

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,110
what I really want to do here is go through the JSON policy for this IAM

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,240
role, and walk through what it's doing. So I could drill in through the

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,740
console to IAM, and find this new role and look at the associated policy

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,680
document for it, but just like the sample key policy we looked at earlier

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,790
in this course,

49
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,060
the policy consists of a long series of statements, so I think

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,810
it's easier to break it down statement by statement here and show

51
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,410
you what it's doing; and if we follow the effect action resource

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,440
pattern like we did before,

53
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,150
we see this role is allowing S3 to call the list bucket operation, as

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,400
well as a bunch of get operations on my source bucket.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,160
So this allows us to get the version of the object that needs to be

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,160
replicated, along with its ACL and any tags, retention properties,

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,230
etc. Then jumping over to the next statement, we see we're

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,140
going to allow these replicate actions on our destination

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,580
bucket, and here we have a condition.

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,720
So where the object is encrypted using kms or AES256, which is

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,110
SSES3, and where the key ID we specify here exists in the

62
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,050
destination region, and then this next statement allows S3 to

63
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,920
perform the decrypt operation on items from our source bucket; and

64
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
here you see a ViaService condition.

65
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,510
So when the request is coming from S3 in the us‑east‑1 region,

66
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,330
which in this case is our source region, we can decrypt the items from our

67
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,280
source bucket using these keys from us‑east‑1, and finally,

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,010
this last statement allows S3 to perform the encrypt operation on

69
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,550
items in our destination bucket, and again with the ViaService

70
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,960
condition to say when the request is coming from S3 in our destination

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,550
region, us‑west‑1, for our destination bucket using the key we

72
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,380
specified in us‑west‑1. So again,

73
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,760
I encourage you to go through the JSON policy documents for your IAM

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,130
roles in detail, because it will be very helpful as you prepare to

75
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,190
take the exam to see exactly what kinds of policies AWS generates to

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,040
support these kinds of operations.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,850
Now that we've enabled replication, let's go ahead and see it in action.

78
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,120
So I'll go back to my source bucket here and click Upload,

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,390
and I'll pick a random text file here and click Upload, and remember,

80
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,210
we have default encryption enabled on this bucket.

81
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,030
So you'll see if I go over here, and here you'll see the

82
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,730
file's replication status is already completed,

83
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,510
so this file has already been replicated.

84
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,340
But down here, you see we have the AES256 encryption on this file.

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,220
So now let's go into our destination bucket, and here's the file we just

86
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,740
uploaded to us‑east‑1 sitting in our destination bucket replicated in

87
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,100
us‑west‑1, and here you see its replication status is replica, and there's

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,740
the AES256 encryption on this file as well.

89
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,110
So remember, to get this object replicated, our IAM role

90
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,320
permissions allowed S3 to decrypt it in the source bucket

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,070
using the S3 key in the source region.

92
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,760
Then the data was encrypted in transit as it was sent to the

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,140
destination region, and then it was finally re‑encrypted in the

94
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,220
destination bucket using the S3 key from the destination region; and

95
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,000
all of that happened in the blink of an eye. So that's Cross‑Region Replication with S3.
