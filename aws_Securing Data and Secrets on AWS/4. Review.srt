1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,040
And with that, we've made it to the end of this course.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,630
So let's quickly recap what we've learned.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,740
We started with a discussion about encryption.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,000
We learned about encryption in transit,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,490
encryption at rest, envelope encryption, and how encryption is deeply

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,650
integrated with almost every service in AWS. We learned about keys

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,850
and saw the AWS Key Management Service, or KMS,

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,710
where we created customer master keys, or CMKs,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,720
which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data in AWS. We learned how to

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,800
securely store sensitive parameters and secrets in AWS,

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,940
either in Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,950
We then learned about replicating data across AWS regions,

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,660
whether via cross‑region replication, or CRR, in S3,

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,200
or copying snapshots from EBS and RDS,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,720
as well as how we can use this process to enable encryption on a

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,400
resource that was not initially created with it.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,930
And finally, we wrapped up with an overview of Amazon Macie and saw how

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,140
it uses machine learning to classify and protect data stored in S3.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,630
Thank you so much for watching this course.

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,410
I hope you found it valuable.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,700
And if you're planning to take the AWS Certified Security ‑

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,730
Specialty exam, I wish you the very best.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,310
Please feel free to ask questions or leave any feedback you

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,330
may have on the discussion board for this course, or reach

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,820
