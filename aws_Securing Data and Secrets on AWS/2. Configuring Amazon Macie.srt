1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,220
In this demo,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,200
we will enable Amazon Macie in our account, view the information it

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,270
collects as it analyzes the S3 buckets in our account, and configure

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,780
a data discovery job that uses a regular expression to match a

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,930
custom text pattern when scanning objects stored in S3. Here we are

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,470
in the S3 console,

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,140
and I just want to quickly show you that I've

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,830
created a couple of new S3 buckets.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,370
One is called myawscoursepublicwritablebucket,

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,950
which, as the name implies,

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,440
has public access and is writable. So that would

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,040
obviously be a problem in the real world.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,370
And the second one is called awscoursefakepiibucket.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,030
And inside that bucket, I've uploaded some files that contained fake PII,

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,500
including data in a FakeEmployeeID field.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,840
And I'll show you how we can configure something like an

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,720
employee ID number as a custom identifier when we create the

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,350
job that tells Macie to scan this bucket.

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,190
But keep in mind that Macie will always be scanning for other PII such

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,810
as Social Security numbers and credit card numbers. And keep in mind

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,520
that having publicly‑writable S3 buckets or even objects containing PII

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,030
in S3 wouldn't necessarily mean that something was being done

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,320
maliciously, but it's definitely something you would want to know about

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
as soon as possible.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
So what I'm going to do first is enable Macie in my account, and that will

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,100
examine the configurations of all the S3 buckets in my account and start

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,410
assessing my overall security at the bucket level.

28
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,820
So to get started, I'll go here to Macie,

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,330
and then I'll come over here and click Get started.

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,720
And you see here on this screen,

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,130
Macie is telling me I will be giving it permission to discover,

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,540
classify, and protect my data,

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,590
as well as to generate alerts about potential security issues.

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,840
So I'll click Enable Macie,

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,250
and you'll see that doing that takes me to a page that gives me a quick,

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,220
high‑level assessment of all the S3 buckets in my account.

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,720
So you see, it's giving me a count of my publicly‑accessible buckets,

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,190
my unencrypted buckets, and my shared buckets.

39
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,170
Now you may have noticed earlier that I have four S3 buckets in

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,820
my account, but it's only showing three here,

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,500
and that's because we're filtered to the Northern Virginia US East‑1 region.

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,210
As you'll recall,

43
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,950
that fourth bucket was used for replication to the US West‑1 region.

44
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,520
So this is useful just to get a snapshot of my overall

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,530
security posture within S3, but keep in mind,

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,070
this has not yet actually scanned any of the data in the objects I have in S3.

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,040
In order to do that, I'll need to configure what's called a job.

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,100
But before we do that,

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,480
I want to create a custom data identifier for my employee ID numbers

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,230
because maybe to my organization that's considered sensitive

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,290
information, but I don't want to have an S3.

52
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,560
So here, under Settings,

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll go to Custom data identifiers, and I'll click Create. And here,

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,240
I'll give my data identifier a name and a description.

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,080
So I'll say Employee ID, and then I have to specify the regular expression.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,740
So let's say my Employees IDs always start with the letters EID,

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,090
then a dash, and then five numeric digits.

58
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:16,550
So here I can say EID‑. and then \d to represent a numeric digit, then a

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,640
{5} in curly braces will signify five of those digits.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,290
And if you want to learn more about regular

61
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,130
expressions and how to construct them,

62
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,280
because you can definitely get much more advanced than this,

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,360
I encourage you to search Pluralsight's library because there are some

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,270
great courses that cover regular expressions in a lot more detail, but

65
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,970
this is good enough for our purposes. And over here, you see you can test

66
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,080
your regular expression, so I can enter EID‑12345 and see that it does

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
match my regular expression.

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,470
But if I take away the fifth digit here, now it doesn't. And it's

69
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,550
worth showing that adding an extra digit on the end would still match

70
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,830
my regular expression as I have it now, but this is certainly good

71
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,800
enough for demonstration purposes,

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,060
so I'll go ahead and scroll down here, and here you see that I can also

73
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,410
add keywords to match or even words to ignore to determine whether or not

74
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,080
a match is something I actually care about.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,810
So maybe I'm only concerned about employee IDs if they appear in the same

76
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,780
paragraph as the word payroll or action or something like that,

77
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,770
in which case I could put those keywords here and specify a maximum

78
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,440
distance to still count this as a match with my identifier.

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,360
So I'll click Submit, and that will go ahead and create my identifier.

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,440
And now that I've done that, I can go ahead and create my job.

81
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,020
So I'll come over here to Jobs and click this link

82
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,320
to select buckets to evaluate,

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,140
and I'll go ahead and choose my fakepiibucket and click Create job.

84
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,250
So I'll say Next here, and here I can specify whether I want to run

85
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,920
this job on a schedule so that could be daily,

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,240
weekly, or monthly or if I just want to run this job one time.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,060
So I'll choose One‑time job for this demo and leave the

88
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,620
sampling depth at 100% to make sure it scans all the items in

89
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,340
the bucket and not just a subset of them.

90
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,260
And I'll include my Employee ID identifier,

91
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,610
so I want to know if that identifier with all the parameters I specified

92
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,710
earlier appears in any objects in this S3 bucket, and click Next.

93
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,280
Now I'll give my job a name, and then on this summary screen,

94
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll click Submit, and now that job is running.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,600
And even for a small bucket, it might take a while to complete,

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,740
so I'll come back later and refresh the screen.

97
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,610
So here we go.

98
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,620
The job is now complete.

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,080
And if I go up here under Show results and click Show findings, here we see

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,890
we have a couple of high‑severity findings, and you can see in one case the

101
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,170
Finding type is Financial, and for my Employee ID document, there are

102
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,590
multiple findings. So I can click the finding here, and over on the right

103
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,540
you'll see more information.

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,340
So in this file, for instance, i't found eight credit card numbers.

105
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,990
And if I come back over here and click my other file,

106
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,410
you see Macie found 17 Credit card numbers, 28 Addresses,

107
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,340
32 Names, and if I scroll up a little bit under Custom data identifiers,

108
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,940
we see it found 236 matches for Employees ids.

109
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,010
So now we've enabled Macie in our account and seen how we can

110
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,040
configure custom data identifiers and jobs.

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,000
But I still have to drill in here through the console to see the findings. So let's talk about how we could automate this process a little more.
