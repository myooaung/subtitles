00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.390
So let's talk a little bit about snapshots and EBS and RDS

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.130
and how we can copy them across regions.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.740
And we may want to do this for any number of reasons,

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.140
but from a security standpoint,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.540
we probably want to do this for backup or disaster recovery purposes.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.280
This is another scenario where compliance requirements may come into play.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.940
If you're required to keep a backup copy of your data in some area that's

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.570
geographically separated from where your application or database is hosted, or

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.340
maybe if there's some sort of AWS regional outage,

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.230
you may want to be able to quickly spin your

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.840
application back up in another region.

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.680
So the way we accomplish this is by taking frequent snapshots of our data

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.620
and then copying these snapshots to another region.

14
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.540
And remember these snapshots all live in S3 behind the scenes.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.020
Now when we talk about encryption at rest,

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.000
when we have a snapshot that is unencrypted, so when we take a snapshot from

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.240
an unencrypted EBS volume or an unencrypted RDS instance,

18
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.820
the process of copying it gives us an opportunity to

19
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.000
encrypt that snapshot as part of the process.

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.510
And we've been talking about copying snapshots across

21
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.160
regions, but this would hold true even if we just copied

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.640
the snapshot within the same region.

23
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.070
So as you'll recall earlier in this course,

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.190
when we created a new EBS volume or a new RDS instance,

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.830
the only opportunity we had to enable encryption was at the time we

26
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.620
created the resource, but this snapshot copy process effectively

27
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.030
gives us an opportunity to add encryption to a resource we've

28
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.750
already created after the fact.

29
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.720
Now, obviously this won't retroactively encrypt the original resource,

30
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.610
so we would still need to delete that resource and restore

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.900
the encrypted snapshot to a new one.

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.940
So there is still some work involved on our part to do this,

33
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
but it is possible to add encryption at rest for EBS and RDS in this way.

34
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.360
Now if the snapshot is already encrypted,

35
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.260
the copied snapshot will always stay encrypted,

36
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.050
but, and again, this applies within the same region or across

37
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.840
regions, you will be given the opportunity to use a different KMS

38
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.040
key to encrypt the copy. And across regions,

39
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200
you'll have to choose a different KMS key because you'll need to choose

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.170
a key that exists within the destination region. Now let's go ahead and

41
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.120
see how this process looks in the console.

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.270
In this demo,

43
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.700
we will copy snapshots of an EBS volume and an RDS instance across regions.

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.170
We will also see the options for copying snapshots

45
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.000
that are encrypted and unencrypted.

46
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.070
So let's go to the EC2 console and we'll go to snapshots where

47
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.530
you'll see I've already taken snapshots of two EBS volumes that I

48
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.600
have here in the US‑East‑1 region, and one is an encrypted snapshot

49
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.590
taken from an encrypted volume,

50
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.240
and the other one is unencrypted from an unencrypted volume.

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680
So I'll start by selecting my encrypted snapshot and

52
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.220
I'll go to Actions and then Copy.

53
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.640
And here, I can choose a different region so I can copy this from

54
00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.160
US‑East‑1 to US‑West‑1, and then I can choose the KMS key to use in the

55
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.140
destination region to encrypt the snapshot there.

56
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.460
And I don't have any of my own CMKs here,

57
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.370
but I can always use the default AWS managed key for EBS, and you'll

58
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.350
notice the encryption check box is checked and disabled so I can't turn

59
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.080
off encryption when copying an encrypted snapshot, and I'll click Copy

60
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.980
and that will initiate that process.

61
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.150
Now,

62
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.360
if I select my unencrypted snapshot and go to Actions and then Copy, here again,

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.670
I can choose a different destination region, but here you'll see I

64
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.790
have the ability to check the encryption box so I can encrypt an

65
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.700
unencrypted snapshot when I copy it.

66
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.960
And you see here in this region,

67
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.330
I do have a CMK, or again, if I choose a different

68
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.040
region where I don't have any CMKs, I can still use the default EBS key.

69
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.260
So I'll click copy here,

70
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.870
and that will encrypt this copy of the snapshot when

71
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.740
it's copied to the destination region.

72
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.330
Now quickly,

73
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.400
let's go to the RDS console, and again, I'll go to Snapshots and here I

74
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.090
haven't manually created any snapshots, but I can go to System and choose

75
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.250
this one here, and you'll see this is for an RDS instance where I did not

76
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.140
enable encryption at the time I created it.

77
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.160
But if I go to Actions and Copy Snapshot,

78
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.530
you'll see here I can choose my destination region, and again,

79
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.620
just like with my unencrypted EBS volumes snapshot when I copy it,

80
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.990
I have the option to enable encryption here, and again, to

81
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.920
choose a key from the destination region.

82
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280
And I won't show you this separately, but if I had already

83
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.200
encrypted this RDS instance when I created it,

84
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.460
then my snapshot would be encrypted and I wouldn't have the option to

85
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.170
disable that encryption when copying it, but I would still need to

86
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.810
choose a key from the destination region.

87
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.170
So hopefully this helps you visualize how the snapshot copy process

88
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.910
works for EBS volumes and RDS instances and how you have the option to

89
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.000
enable encryption as part of that process, even if your snapshot is not already encrypted.
