00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.440
So we've seen how Macie can identify issues with our S3 buckets

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.640
and objects to help us protect our data and display this

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.440
information to us in the Macie console.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.640
But equally important from a security standpoint is the ability

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.950
to proactively monitor your data and take quick automated

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.270
action when problems are discovered.

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.330
To do this, Macie integrates with CloudWatch Events,

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.140
which allows you to configure targets for notifications that

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.240
are generated by different AWS services.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.810
These targets can be anything from a simple notification service or

11
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.860
SNS topic configured to send an email to a system administrator or a

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.190
lambda function that automatically updates an S3 bucket policy or

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.220
even a workflow using step functions. Macie can generate two types

14
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.030
of events, alerts,

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.590
which include things like an item containing PII being found within a

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.780
publicly accessible S3 bucket and findings, which include things like AWS

17
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.490
credentials discovered inside an object stored in S3.

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.590
Let's take a look in the console to see how Macie

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.970
integrates with CloudWatch events.

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.040
In this demo,

21
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.380
we will view the alerts and findings Macie can generate for data security and

22
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.180
see how we can set up CloudWatch events to notify administrators or

23
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.910
automatically take action when data security issues arise.

24
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.730
So here I am inside the CloudWatch console,

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.340
and I can come over here and click Events.

26
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.620
And if I click Get started,

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.400
you see that CloudWatch Events uses rules that

28
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.440
consist of event sources and targets.

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.640
So for my Event Source, I can go to the Service Name and choose Macie.

30
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.840
And for the Event Type here, you see we can choose Macie Alert or Macie Finding.

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.340
So if I choose Macie Alert,

32
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.270
I can scroll down and click Show sample event(s), and this

33
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.300
will give me some examples of the JSON payload that CloudWatch

34
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.160
events would receive from Macie.

35
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.490
And if I scroll down, you see there's a ton of detail in here,

36
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.480
and here's an example alert for Bucket is writable by all authenticated

37
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.550
users, so things like that. And if I go back up here and change this to

38
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.530
Macie Finding and look at these sample events,

39
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.140
you see information for some things like the count of sensitive items.

40
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.890
So if you'll remember, our employee ID document that had 236

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.590
employees IDs, and 17 credit card numbers, 28 addresses, things

42
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.070
like that, those numbers would all show up here in the detections

43
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.040
section of the event data.

44
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.800
So those are the event sources, and then we have the targets.

45
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.520
If I click Add target, you see we can have up to five targets for a single rule,

46
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.480
and I can choose Lambda function or an SNS topic or

47
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.890
even a Step Functions state machine.

48
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.650
So depending on what the metadata is within the event,

49
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.020
I could use SNS to email a system administrator or have a lambda function

50
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.840
update an S3 bucket policy to remove public right access,

51
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.720
or maybe even kick off a workflow that determines whether an

52
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.080
object ACL needs to be updated based on exactly what was

53
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.220
found within a particular object.

54
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.240
And we can set all of this up to happen automatically.

55
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.430
So if we configure a data discovery job within Macie to run

56
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.180
on a schedule and then have the proper rules set up for

57
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.200
Macie within CloudWatch Events,

58
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.000
we can set up a really powerful system to quickly respond to security incidents in an automated way.
