00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.115
Hey, welcome to this class.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.680
If you are a web development beginner and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.590
want to just jump in and build some fun projects,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
you've came to the right place.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
The idea behind this series is to show you what you can do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.250
with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.830
I'm not confusing any frameworks,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
any boilerplate, any libraries or any templates.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.970
Instead, we're going to be building everything completely from scratch,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.130
step-by-step to show you how these free technologies all work together.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.520
With this project we're going to create a photo effects application.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.840
It's going to involve creating

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.475
a photo uploader where we can select the image from our computer.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:54.365
I select one just here,

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.445
and once we open this up, this file will then be displayed inside the browser.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.950
This is the original image and then over on the right

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.460
we have some options to change the effect.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.750
We can change this to be grayscale.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.520
We can add things such as a Sepia effect.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.450
We can invert the colors.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.725
Images are made up of pixels which are red,

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.065
green, and blue values.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.200
We also have some options to switch around the order of these colors too.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.405
This gives us some nice looking effect,

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.970
which can really change the look and feel of our images.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.550
Once we are done and we have a nice looking image which you want to use,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.290
we can also download this image too.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.300
This project will give you a chance to learn lots of new things.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.940
We'll create a user interface with HTML.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.400
We will then add styling with CSS.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.700
But the main focus in this video is going to be the JavaScript,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.090
and also working with pixels.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.425
You will learn how to upload images,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.345
create file reader objects,

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.699
how to draw to the HTML canvas.

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.950
Then once we have that image in the canvas,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.855
you will learn how to read all of the pixels from this image.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:59.900
We'll then loop through all of these pixels and apply various effects.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.060
We'll also learn how to reinstate

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.110
the original image and also download the modified version too.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.600
If this sounds really complex, don't worry.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.280
This course is designed for beginners.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.960
However, little JavaScript knowledge would be a real advantage,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.460
and ideally this should be the fifth project

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.210
which you take from this JavaScript from series.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.175
All of the other projects are also available here on Skillshare.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.495
It would really benefit to take these classes in order.

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:32.910
Hope you're now excited to build this photo effects up and I'll see you inside the class.
