00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
With the knowledge we now have over just in that pixel values,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.650
we can now add some effects and link them to our buttons.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.540
The first thing we're going to do is begin with our grayscale button.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.880
So we can change this example function to grayscale.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.490
With this, we also need to modify our click listener,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
from change, this also needs to be our function name of grayscale.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.170
For this grayscale effect, we need to create a color of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.960
gray and then add this to each one of our red,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.075
green, and blue values.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.880
Inside of our loop, we're going to create a constant for our gray value.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.220
Then we need to create our gray value.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.920
We're going to do this by, first of all,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.965
selecting our red color, which is data i.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.640
We're going to add this to our green,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.705
which is data i plus 1.

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:54.120
Then we add these to our blue,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.250
which is data i plus 2.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.190
All we're doing here is simply add in together all three of

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.010
our colors for each pixel on the screen.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.110
To reduce this to be a shade of gray,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.095
we also need to manipulate these three values.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:15.395
So the red value, we need to multiply this by 0.21,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:18.365
the green color which is in the middle,

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:26.255
multiply this by 0.71 and the blue is multiplied by 0.07.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:30.215
Now there's no hard and fast rule we need to use for this gray color.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.965
This is simply a formula which are found when researching the subject.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:37.375
We can use any different values inside here.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:42.460
Now we can grab our gray value and set this as our red,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.045
also as our green,

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:48.090
and also as our blue values.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.220
Let's test this out over in the browser.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.120
We can refresh, choose a new image.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.455
Let's try our grayscale effects.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:03.555
Good, our grayscale is now working and next week we'll move on to the sepia effect,

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:08.265
which is basically a warmer version of a grayscale image.

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:10.770
All of these functionality is going to be similar,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.695
so we can copy our grayscale function,

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.920
and add this just below.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.890
This one is called sepia.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.965
We still grab in all of the image data,

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:26.270
but this time we need to manipulate this in a slightly different way.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.275
So we're going to use the base gray color from the grayscale function,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.420
but instead we're going to add some extra red and green values.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.740
So for the red value, which is first, we can add 95,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.515
a green value, we're going to add 58,

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.950
and this will give our image a slightly warmer tone.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.630
We can then call this function by our second button.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.770
Let's copy this, querySelectorAll

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.165
and then we can select our second button with the index number of 1,

00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:00.075
the function is sepia.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:08.445
Let's try this out. View as an image and click on the button.

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:11.930
This gives us this warmer version of our grayscale image.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.835
Next we have the invert function,

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:16.385
so we'll copy the sepia function.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.850
Add this just below.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.510
This one is our invert function.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.525
Under the invert effect is also known as a reversed image.

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:27.210
The colors are reversed,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.185
for example, a black will become white and so on.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:34.129
This will give us a similar effect to old style photo negatives,

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.150
which we used to get when developing photos.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.655
For invert, we don't need to use this gray section,

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:43.880
so we can delete this line here, instead,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.780
we need to deduct the value of 255 from each one of our colors.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.670
The reason we do this is because an RGB value will go from 0-255.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.665
If we deduct 255,

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.140
this will give us the opposite effect.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.665
For data i, which is red and deduct the data i.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.385
Green value, we do exactly the same,

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:13.335
this is 255, and then deduct data i plus 1.

00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:16.350
The blue, this is 255,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.380
and then deduct data i plus 2.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.250
We then color this with our button and this button is position 2,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.160
and the function name is invert. Let's try this one out.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.125
Here's the file. This one is now working too.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.960
Now, we have our first three buttons now hooked up,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.215
we're going to now move on to the next video,

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:51.150
where we'll then swap around all the pixel values to give us our final four effects.
