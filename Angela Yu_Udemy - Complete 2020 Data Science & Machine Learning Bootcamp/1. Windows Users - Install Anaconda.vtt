00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.400
Okay so it's time to set up your computer and install the necessary software for this course.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.900
In this lesson I will show you how to install Python and configure your local environment so that way

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.060
we don't have to rely on the trial environment on Jupiter dot org.

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.290
I will show you how to install Python Anaconda on a Windows machine.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.130
So if you've got a Mac skip to the next video.

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.620
But before we begin let me explain what Python Anaconda is and why we're downloading it.

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.640
Anaconda is a python distribution.

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.250
And this means that Anaconda aims to provide everything you need for data science in one place.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.460
It's essentially a bundle of software and code that makes it easy for getting set up for Data Science

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.150
and machine learning.

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.930
For example the anaconda bundle already includes the Jupiter notebook so you don't have to separately

12
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.180
download it and install it and it also includes tons and tons of Python packages and libraries that

13
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.520
we'll be using in this course.

14
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.440
What do I mean by libraries.

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.820
Well remember how we wrote import pandas or import Mac plot lib or import psychic learn in our first

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.040
project.

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.740
Usually you'd have to download all these packages one by one before you can use them in your project.

18
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.160
But by downloading Anaconda we're going to be getting all these packages in one go that way we don't

19
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.610
have to worry about setup and configuration.

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.320
Later on in the course one word of warning though.

21
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.560
If you Google the word Anaconda you're probably not gonna get what you're looking for.

22
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.030
You'll want to search Anaconda Python to find the Continuum dot Io Web site or alternatively click on

23
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.340
the link in the lessons resources to be directed directly to the download page.

24
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.900
Now don't click the download button just yet.

25
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.690
First you have to do a very important check on your machine your laptop or your desktop computer will

26
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.730
come in one of two flavors.

27
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.910
You will either have a 64 bit machine or a 32 bit machine.

28
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.920
And here's how you check which flavor of computer you've got.

29
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.140
You can go to your control panel and there under a system type you should see whether you've got a 32

30
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.850
bit operating system or a 64 bit operating system.

31
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.540
So with that in mind make a note of the type of processor and go back to the download page on continuum

32
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.840
that Io here you should see a big green download button click on that big green download button.

33
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.550
Only if you've got a 64 bit processor if you've got a 32 bit machine click on the link below.

34
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.040
The thing about Python is it also comes in two flavors.

35
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.630
We're going to go with the newer version of Python Python 3.

36
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.450
So while Anaconda is downloading this is a good time to go for a coffee or tea after the download completes.

37
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.920
You can start the installation.

38
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.240
We're gonna be presented with one of those standard setup Wizard's so we're going to click next.

39
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.350
Then when I agreed to the license agreement for probably signing away our first born child at this point.

40
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.020
But on the next parts of the Wizard I'm just gonna go with the recommended options so I'm gonna say

41
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.490
install for just myself and for the destination folder I'm also going to stick with the default for

42
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.840
the advanced options.

43
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.310
I'm going to leave them as they are in the installer as well with the first one untucked and the second

44
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.860
one ticked now.

45
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.400
My computer actually isn't as fast as it appears to be because I'm speeding up the video here but this

46
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.760
installation process actually takes a little while too.

47
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.210
So just be patient and after the installer finishes it's going to click finish.

48
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.000
Now it's time to fire up Anaconda and the Jupiter notebook just to see if everything's working click

49
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.750
on your start menu and then go find the anaconda command prompt you should see a little black window

50
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:16.640
like this appear and in this window type Python space dash dash version and here you should see the

51
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.740
version of Python that you've installed.

52
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.160
And as we've mentioned before.

53
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.950
Make sure the version of Python is three point six or higher.

54
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.210
Now it's very useful to have the anaconda command prompt handy so in your taskbar at the bottom right

55
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.690
click and pin this program to the taskbar.

56
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.660
That way you can fire up the anaconda prompt very quickly.

57
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.360
Next let me show you how to start up your own Jupiter notebook.

58
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.690
You can do that by simply typing Jupiter.

59
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.850
Space notebook and hit enter.

60
00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.070
Now give it a minute and you should see your browser firing up with the folder structure on your C drive.

61
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.050
And when you click on new you should be able to start a new Python 3 notebook so congratulations on

62
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.280
getting that working.

63
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.460
But starting up is only part of the equation.

64
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.760
Also have to be able to shut this down properly and to shut down open notebook go to file close and

65
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.330
halt and you can log out and close your browser window.

66
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.230
But the important part is actually to terminate the notebook from the anaconda command prompt and you

67
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.350
need to do this with a keyboard shortcut.

68
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.190
You can see here in the instructions it says use control C to stop the server and shut down all kernels

69
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:52.290
twice to skip confirmation so on your keyboard press controls see twice you should then see the messages

70
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.350
interrupted shutting down kernels and that's how you close out of Jupiter completely.

71
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.870
Finally let me show you all the components that were installed along side with Anaconda and to do that.

72
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.060
Let me show you the anaconda navigator.

73
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.490
This is also an alternative way of firing up the Jupiter notebook instead of going through the anaconda

74
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.380
prompt after it finishes loading.

75
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.540
You should see a window like this from here.

76
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.940
We can launch the Jupiter notebook or the spider Python I.T. or even our studio.

77
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.480
So congratulations on getting set up.

78
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:36.850
If you have any problems or had any issues ask in the Q and A section for this lesson I'll see you in

79
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.640
the next videos.
