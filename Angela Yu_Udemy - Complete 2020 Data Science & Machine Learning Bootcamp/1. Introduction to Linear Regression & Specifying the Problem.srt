00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:08,590
Welcome to the first module in this module we'll learn about how to use data science to solve a practical

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:16,840
problem and we will also introduce our first machine learning algorithm namely linear regression regression

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,920
is the workhorse of data science business analytics and research.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,120
You'll find people using regression whenever someone is looking to model a phenomenon or make a prediction

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,620
or discover the hidden relationships among things.

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,410
Also I want to show you how to solve problems using Data Science.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,980
So what kind of problem are you going to look at.

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,220
Well imagine that you're a film producer you provide money to make movies and when the movies make money

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,850
you make money.

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,620
And when the movies lose money you lose money.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,930
But today you discover a problem.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,710
You found out that you just put a whole bunch of money into a movie called Zombies rise again.

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,800
Part 5.

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:07,030
And if that doesn't sound like a terrible title for a film then I don't know what does worse yet you've

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,070
staked your reputation on this film.

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,990
You've mortgaged your house you've sold your car.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,830
You've sold your grandmother's silverware to fund this film.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,740
So is your money gone.

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,210
Will you go bankrupt.

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,490
Well to answer these questions you would have to be able to predict the future.

21
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,710
And this is where data science will come to the rescue.

22
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:33,700
Let's have a think about how a data scientist would approach this problem well first a data scientist

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,910
would carefully formulate the question that they're looking to answer why.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,540
Well a clear and well formulated question will determine the research and it will also affect the kind

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,900
of data that you will go out and gather in fact.

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:59,930
Step 2 is gathering the data that will help us answer the question but real world data is also messy.

27
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,030
So we have to clean the data.

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,260
We have to look out for missing data or incomplete data.

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,880
We have to look out for errors and even bound formatting.

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,530
In fact we have to explore the data that we've gathered.

31
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,540
And often this means visualizing the data so that we can better understand what it is that we're working

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,860
with a graph or a chart is much more helpful than a table of numbers.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,730
And after we've done all that.

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:33,110
The next step is actually training our algorithm using our computer to identify patterns in the data.

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,000
In our case that algorithm will be our linear regression.

36
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,420
And finally we have to evaluate the results.

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,240
How did our algorithm do.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,090
Did it answer our question how accurate was our algorithm.

39
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,900
In answering our question the process that I've outlined here is the process data scientists used to

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,470
solve problems.

41
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,850
This is their workflow for understanding and making sense of the world.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
So let's tackle that first step.

43
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,660
Let's formulate our question.

44
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,450
So here's our first shot at this.

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,830
How much money will our movie make now.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,830
This is actually not a very good question.

47
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,260
The problem is is that this question is too vague.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,970
For starters what do we actually mean with the word money.

49
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,350
Can we be more specific.

50
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,570
How about this.

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,220
How about how much revenue will our movie make now.

52
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,040
This is already a much better question because revenue is something that means something very specific

53
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,510
in the business world.

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,330
It's something that accountants actually measure and track and that means that we can actually find

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,610
data on movie revenue.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,350
But what does movie revenue actually depend on.

57
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,950
Let's have a think about this.

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,820
Maybe it depends on the actors do movie starring Scarlett Johansson do particularly well or maybe depends

59
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,470
on the script or maybe what actually matters is the film's overall budget.

60
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,610
Because after all you have to pay good actors and you have to pay for special effects and marketing

61
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,310
costs a lot of money too.

62
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,480
So maybe the overall budget would be the best thing to look at.

63
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:22,040
So if that's the case then we have a hypothesis the movie budget could indeed be the thing to investigate.

64
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,930
After all there are many famous examples of big budget films that did exceptionally well at the box

65
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,790
office.

66
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:38,240
Movies like Avatar Titanic and The Avengers cost an absolute fortune but they were enormously successful.

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,200
But can the success of these movies tell us something about the success of our movie.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:52,090
If we knew how much movies like Avatar The Avengers spent and how much they made Can we predict how

69
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,420
much we'll make.

70
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,260
Based on how much we're spending so let's go back to our original question and let's make it a little

71
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,720
bit more specific.

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,060
Can we use MOVIE BUDGETS TO PREDICT movie revenue now.

73
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,380
That's already a much better question.

74
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,280
Why.

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,910
Well it's testable and by testable I mean that we can actually check if there is a relationship between

76
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,760
movie budgets and movie revenue.

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,630
This is something that we can measure using data and linear regression.

78
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,590
And as data scientists we can actually look at this question and identify exactly what it is that we're

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,930
trying to predict namely the movie revenue a data scientist would call this the dependent variable and

80
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,000
in machine learning this would be called the target.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,930
Also we can identify what it is that we're using to make the prediction namely the movie budgets a data

82
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,410
scientist would call the budgets the independent variable and in machine learning this would be called

83
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,620
a feature.

84
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,600
So now that we've formulated our question we can move on to Step Two.

85
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:05,320
We can go out there and gather some data and we'll do just that in the next lesson.

86
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll see you there.
