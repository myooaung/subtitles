00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome to this brand new module.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.020
Let's start with outlining the premise and talking about the problem that we're going to be trying to

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.720
solve in the upcoming lessons imagine that you're looking for a job in the field of data science or

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.430
machine learning.

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.400
Every company out there is swimming in data.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.980
So there is a lot of demand for data scientists and machine learning experts.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.260
And that's good news for you because guess what you've just found a position advertised in the career

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.960
section of your favorite company.

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.880
So naturally you go ahead and you polish your CV and you carefully research the company and you write

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.870
a cover letter and you send off your application and you start practicing your interview questions with

11
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.920
your most patient friend or career advisor.

12
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.070
Now meanwhile at the offices of your favorite company that you just applied for the job applications

13
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.200
from the candidates just start flooding in.

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.820
There is many many applications and it's not even easy from the company's perspective to select a good

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.290
applicant.

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.180
So you know even though there's a lot of job opportunities in the field of data science and machine

17
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.530
learning these days it's still super competitive.

18
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.740
In fact the classic job application process of selecting candidates based on their CV is their cover

19
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.870
letters maybe a numerical test and then how people do in interviews just isn't really working that well.

20
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.240
So what more and more companies are doing is giving their applicants a project to work on.

21
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:53.700
For example my friend recently applied for a job at Uber and prior to the interview they basically wrote

22
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.950
him an email that said well we need you to predict demand for our taxes.

23
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.970
Here's some data send us your solution to this problem by next week.

24
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.660
Bam.

25
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.780
And how is it.

26
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.110
My friend spent the next week toiling over this problem to produce a solution for these guys and move

27
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.700
on to the next step in the application process.

28
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.090
So let's imagine that this is exactly the kind of situation that you find yourself in right now.

29
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.860
You receive an email from the company that you've just applied for in response to your job application

30
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350
and they liked your CV and they're giving you this opportunity to show what you're made of during a

31
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.660
project.

32
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.280
Here's the gist of the email our team receives too much spam.

33
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.920
We only want legitimate emails in our inbox and we want all spam to be filtered out.

34
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.980
Here's some data.

35
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.950
Send us your solution by next week.

36
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.680
Tick tock the clock is ticking.

37
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.500
So what do we do next.

38
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.800
Well the first step is always formulating the question.

39
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:07.370
And with this usually means is translating a business problem into a machine learning problem.

40
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.430
Now what I mean by that.

41
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.150
Well we have a clear business objective in this case from the company we need to filter out spam emails

42
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.370
but what does this mean from a machine learning perspective.

43
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.460
Well to filter out the spam e-mails we first have to know which emails are spam and which e-mails are

44
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.720
legitimate.

45
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.730
In other words for each incoming e-mail we have to assign a category.

46
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.810
If the e-mail is legitimate then we have to classify it as not spam and the e-mail is then allowed to

47
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.330
go on to the inbox.

48
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.730
However if the email had the characteristics of a spam email then our algorithm must detect this and

49
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.970
label this email as spam and classified as such.

50
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.140
Thus our objective is to learn what characterizes a spam email so that we can start to classify all

51
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.420
the emails.

52
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.320
So if you think about it this is actually quite a different kind of problem from when we were estimating

53
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.060
the real estate prices in the previous module.

54
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.180
Previously we had to estimate a quantity given a set of characteristics for a property.

55
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.160
We were estimating the house price.

56
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.740
We had something that was called a regression style problem.

57
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.920
This time we have a different problem.

58
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.980
We have to categorize things.

59
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.630
We have a classification style problem with regression.

60
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:45.460
You're fitting to the data but with classification you're separating the data regression and classification

61
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.460
style problems are in fact two of the very very common kind of problems that you will find yourself

62
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.930
solving.

63
00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.610
Typical examples of regression problems have to do with estimating quantity like say next year sales

64
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.200
or how much time a particular task takes and common examples of classification style problems are things

65
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:16.740
like segmenting your business's customers detecting cancer or in our case filtering out spam emails.

66
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.770
But you know the thing is there is an additional niggle with this problem here that we were given previously.

67
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.710
We were working with numbers we were doing calculations with these numbers and feeding these numbers

68
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.140
into our algorithm.

69
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.620
But now we're gonna be dealing with emails instead.

70
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.790
We're gonna be working with text data.

71
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.930
So how do we train our algorithm when we're given text.

72
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.160
Can we just pipe in our emails directly into the algorithm and get a sensible answer.

73
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.140
Probably not.

74
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.030
Text data just isn't suited to run calculations on in its raw form.

75
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.530
So this means we have to find a way to translate our text data into a format that an algorithm can understand

76
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.740
and work with.

77
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:14.860
We have to process the emails before handing them off to our algorithm to do the calculations so you

78
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.000
can see there's already a lot of challenges ahead.

79
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.180
But we've already taken the first step.

80
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.980
We've looked at the business problem at hand and we've translated this problem into a machine learning

81
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.200
problem.

82
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.580
Here's how we can formulate our objective in a machine learning kind of way.

83
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.090
We're gonna take the emails from the company and the first thing we're gonna do is pre process that

84
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:51.340
text data then we're going to train a machine learning model that can classify an email as either spam

85
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.420
or not spam.

86
00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:01.420
And finally we're going to test and evaluate the performance of our trained model and with our trained

87
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:10.180
spam classifier at hand we can filter out all incoming spam emails very very quickly and you never know

88
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.080
right by sending our train model back to the company along with an explanation of our methodology.

89
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:22.650
We should be able to clinch that job offer or at least get invited to the next round for an interview.

90
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.540
Hey I'll see you in the next lesson.

91
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.960
Take care.
