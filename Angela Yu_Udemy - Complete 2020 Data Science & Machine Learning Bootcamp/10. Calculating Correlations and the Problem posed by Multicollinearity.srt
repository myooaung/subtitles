1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:08,190
First let's add a markdown cell and some late tech notation so it changes to markdown put two pound

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,100
symbols there.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,170
Right.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,040
Correlation.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,500
The latest notation we're gonna add it's gonna look like this good all the signs and then I'm going

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,640
to have the Greek symbol for row and then we're going have an underscore open curly brace.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,590
X y.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:34,710
Closing curly brace and then equals core c o r parentheses X comma Y closing parentheses.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,030
And then to add all the signs.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,010
Let's see what this looks like.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,190
I think this makes a nice section heading just for completion.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,220
Let's add two more pound symbols to Dollar Signs minus one point zero and then let's have the following

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:01:00,210
tag slash l e q and then we'll have slash row space underscore and then curly braces.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,510
X Y and then another Q tag.

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,440
So slash at least Q plus one point zero and then two dollar signs at the end for the closing tag.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,970
Now we've got the minimum and maximum values of the correlation in our heading as well and in the latest

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,510
notation the Greek symbol row is given like this with the slash and then the keyword we create the subscript

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,590
x y with the underscore and then the curly braces.

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,730
And finally we've used the slash and then Ellie Q for the less than or equal to symbol.

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,280
So now that we've added our section heading let's calculate the correlation between the average number

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,510
of rooms and the house price.

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,740
Now before we just punch in the python code what would you expect to see.

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,820
Do you think this correlation should be positive or negative.

24
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:03,200
Do you think that the correlation between the number of rooms and the property price is strong or weak.

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,930
So looking at the latex notation in our section heading here pick out a number in your head between

26
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,150
minus 1 and 1 Ready.

27
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,450
Did you make your guess.

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:14,930
Okay.

29
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:24,300
So to get the answer you simply call the core method on the series object so data square brackets single

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:35,580
quotes price dot c o r are open parentheses data square brackets single quotes R M will retrieve the

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,760
price column from our data frame.

32
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,710
So this is our series object and then call the core method on that series object and then as an argument

33
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,220
between the parentheses for this method we supply a single piece of information namely the series that

34
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,610
we want to calculate the correlation against.

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,690
In this case the average room size hitting shift enter.

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,520
You see that the correlation is indeed positive and around zero point seven and that makes sense right.

37
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,020
The larger the property is the more rooms that house the more expensive it should be.

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:21,750
Now as a challenge I want to do the same thing for the property prices and the pupil teacher ratio.

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,570
I want you to calculate the correlation between this feature and the property price point before you

40
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,230
type in the python code.

41
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,890
I want you to make another guess at the correlation.

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,800
So pick a number between minus 1 and 1 and then write your python code.

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,740
Do you think that the house prices will be positively or negatively correlated with this feature.

44
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,240
How.

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,410
Figuring out the reason for this is probably harder than typing in the python code.

46
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,440
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and just give it a shot.

47
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,410
All right ready.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,300
Here's the solution.

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:05,790
I can simply copy what I've written in the cell above pasted in and then change R.M. to the name of

50
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,820
the feature that I want to calculate my correlation against.

51
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,310
And this is P T ratio in all caps.

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,990
And when I hit shift enter I see that the correlation here is negative zero point five.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
But why is that.

54
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,740
What does this number actually mean.

55
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,690
So the first one was a positive correlation.

56
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,610
It was fairly strong.

57
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,040
Zero point seven.

58
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,200
And this is a fairly strong negative correlation minus zero point five.

59
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,780
Now let's have a little think about why this might be.

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:47,130
If you had one teacher and two students what would the value of P T ratio be equal to the P T ratio

61
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:55,570
would be equal to two because there's two pupils and one teacher now two students and one teacher.

62
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,570
It's kind of like having private tuition.

63
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,560
So if we take this thinking further what if you had 15 students per teacher then the value inside peachy

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,620
ratio would be equal to 15 and with 15 students instead of two.

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,280
Each student is getting less attention from the teacher.

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,410
Sort of that class size grows.

67
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,940
What if you have 30 students then each student is getting even less attention from the teacher.

68
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,540
You can imagine the students in the back of the class giggling passing notes playing clash Royale on

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,590
their cell phones and throwing paper airplanes right.

70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,000
In other words there's T ratio feature measures the quality of the education the quality of the schools

71
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:47,700
the schools with many kids and few teachers are under-resourced and they tend to have a lower quality

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,840
of education and this quality of education is reflected in the house price.

73
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,990
If the PDP ratio goes up which is a bad thing because we have so many pupils per class then the property

74
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,850
prices tend to code down and this is why we see a negative correlation.

75
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,370
Okay.

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,060
So we've picked out two correlations one by one.

77
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,240
I can't start target against our house price.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,360
What if we wanted to calculate all the correlations at the same time because doing this one by one is

79
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,610
gonna be pretty painful right.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,230
Well panders has got us covered in this next cell here.

81
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,630
I want to take my whole data frame data and call the correlation method on it.

82
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,360
So data aren't core parentheses and shift into will produce this.

83
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,640
This is an entire table that doesn't just show the correlations with the house prices.

84
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,820
Those are in the last column here.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,570
It also shows the correlations amongst all the different features.

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:03,410
For example how the average number of rooms is correlated with the amount of crime in this table.

87
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,610
You can still find these two values.

88
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,870
So price versus room size and price vs. peaky ratio.

89
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:18,630
If I go down here the first value zero point seven is here and that second value minus zero point five

90
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,440
is right here.

91
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:28,920
But the other interesting thing about this table is this diagonal here you see these cells of ones along

92
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,250
the diagonal all the correlations are equal to one.

93
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,220
And that's because the correlation of a variable with itself will always be equal to one.

94
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,090
So crime correlated with crime is equal to one.

95
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,070
The correlation of number of rooms versus number of rooms is equal to one.

96
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,590
The correlation of age against itself is equal to one.

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,950
And so on.

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,640
So you can pretty much ignore this diagonal.

99
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,340
It's not telling us anything interesting.

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,560
In fact you pretty much can also ignore half of this entire table.

101
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,810
You see this table is symmetric.

102
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,800
This value here.

103
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:14,550
Crime versus zoning is the same as zoning versus crime and industry versus zoning is the same as zoning

104
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,500
versus industry.

105
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,280
In other words the two halves of this table split along the diagonal are the same.

106
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:29,430
Let's come back up here to this correlation method and hit shift tab on our keyboard to bring up the

107
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,270
quick documentation if hitting the little plus sign expands.

108
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,390
This whole thing and we can see something kind of interesting.

109
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,240
Now it turns out that we didn't supply any arguments to this correlation method.

110
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,130
There's no value here.

111
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,440
We didn't put any inputs between these two parentheses.

112
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:59,570
And what this means is that going with the correlation methods defaults and it turns out that there

113
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:07,360
are multiple ways you can calculate a correlation and we're using that default way of doing this calculation.

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,360
Our specific type of correlation is the Pearson correlation.

115
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:20,180
There's two other ones down here which we could have picked but Pearson is the default correlation that

116
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,940
we're going to be looking at.

117
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,000
So we look at this as a comment here in this cell.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,470
I'm going to say Pearson correlation coefficients.

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,140
That way there's no ambiguity here.

120
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:42,600
Now since we brought up this table here this kind of brings me to our next point.

121
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,540
We spoke about kind of two things that we look for with these correlation calculations.

122
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,940
We look for the strength and we look for the direction of the correlations but there's actually also

123
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:02,160
a third thing that we kind of care about because in this table we didn't just have the correlations

124
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,750
between our features and our target house prices.

125
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,820
We also had the correlations or the features with each other.

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,760
So let me ask your question.

127
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:23,330
If two features were perfectly correlated would that be a good thing or would that be a bad thing for

128
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,930
our regression model.

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,210
And the answer is It depends.

130
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:36,260
But it could be a bad thing and something that we probably want to discover early on.

131
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:43,550
Let me explain the problem that high correlations between features could pose for our regression model

132
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:51,830
with an example suppose your medical researcher and you're analyzing the bone densities of people.

133
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,970
Your goal is trying to figure out what makes people have strong healthy bones and you have all this

134
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,250
data on people and you're running your regression and the kind of data that you're feeding into your

135
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:14,470
regression model includes a person's age a person's body fat and a person's weight.

136
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,640
These are your explanatory variables.

137
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,240
Now here's the catch.

138
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,810
It turns out no one looks like this.

139
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:30,200
The people who actually do look like this get put up on a stage and cast in movies like Conan the Barbarian.

140
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,150
And the thing about these people is that they have a very high weight but very very low body fat.

141
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:47,530
But in this world they are very very few tall heavy but lean bodybuilders for most of the population

142
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,020
body fat and weight are actually really highly correlated.

143
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:00,160
Most people who weigh a lot tend to have high body fat at most people who are very very skinny tend

144
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,620
to weigh very very little.

145
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,230
So given this pattern in the data what does this imply for the medical research that you're doing.

146
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:18,100
Because body fat and weight move together you're going to have difficulty telling apart their effects.

147
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:27,280
In other words body fat and weight are highly correlated and it becomes very difficult to see the individual

148
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,220
contributions to bone density of either of these two explanatory variables.

149
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,660
One of these features is redundant and this problem that you've just encountered in your hypothetical

150
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,520
medical research actually has a name.

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,860
It's called multi colon the charity now healthy calling the charity of the word that only a statistician

152
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,420
could love but put simply multi calling the charity is when two or more predictors in a regression are

153
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,730
highly related to one another.

154
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,310
So for this example it was body fat and weight which are very highly related.

155
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:14,230
Each of these do not provide unique and independent information to the regression.

156
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:21,370
Now the result of your regression having this problem of multi colon parity means that the estimates

157
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,000
start becoming unreliable and your findings stop making sense.

158
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,790
Put simply the models starts getting confused.

159
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:37,270
But the thing to remember is that high correlations don't automatically mean that you have this problem

160
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,920
of multi colon parity.

161
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,530
I wish it was that easy however what it does imply is that we should be looking at these correlations

162
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:52,520
between our features we should be investigating if our features are highly correlated and if we find

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,500
a high correlation between our features we should investigate why that is the high correlations can

164
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,040
be an early warning sign that there is some sort of problem high correlations between your features

165
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,760
are kind of like a toothache that make you go to the dentist the tent is well then investigate further

166
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,330
to see what the actual problem is.

167
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,960
So having introduced this topic we're going to keep this in mind for our regression analysis stage.

168
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,100
This is when we're going to be revisiting this question of multi calling charity.
