1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,450
Let's revisit our old friend the scatter plot we saw in the previous lessons.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,430
How important it is to use plots in conjunction with descriptive statistics to spot patterns and outliers

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,910
using both of these tools together.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,920
We get a more complete picture of what's actually going on.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,990
So far we've been visualizing our data and looked at the distribution of values of some individual features

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:36,270
like our M for like the average number of rooms or are a D the index of accessibility to highways.

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,950
We can dig deeper into the relationships between these feature pairs as well as between the features

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
and our target value with some scatter plots.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,520
The correlation matrix that we created already hinted at the fact that there are relationships amongst

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,360
the features that we can visualize so on that note I'd like to start this lesson off with a challenge.

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:09,650
First I want you to picture what the relationship would look like between the annual X and DHS features.

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,910
If you recall an X was a measure of pollution and gas was a measure of distance from employment centers.

13
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,610
Picture a graph in your head hand then write the two lines of Python code to visualize the scatter plot.

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,030
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video before I show you the solution.

15
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,770
Ready.

16
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,580
Here we go.

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,750
So we've created a scatter plot many times before with PDT which is are mapped plot load module dot

18
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,930
scatter and then we have to supply two things the data for the x axis and the data for the y axis.

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,960
So on the x axis we're gonna have our data square brackets.

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,290
Yes.

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,020
So this is going to be our distance which is going to be on the x axis and on the y axis.

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:07,030
We're going to have our pollution measure which is going to be data square brackets and 0 x and then

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,150
finally PDT dot show.

24
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,560
So hitting shift into just gave me this error because I've come back to this notebook and I haven't

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,260
run the cells above it yet.

26
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:25,270
So I'm going to go to cell run all and then when I wait a little bit scroll all the way down.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,950
And here we go.

28
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,610
What's this the relationship that you imagined in your head.

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,230
A kind of downward sloping line.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,740
Let me add some labels to this graph before I give you my interpretation.

31
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:51,760
So PDT dot X label it's gonna be the IRS distance from employment and say font size 14 and then for

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,100
the Y label copy this line pasted in.

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,510
Change it to the Y label.

34
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:09,480
Change that to read n o x nitric oxide pollution and then my finger size I want to change as well.

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:19,230
So when I make it a bit bigger someone say peel T dot figure parentheses fix size equals parentheses

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,720
say maybe nine and six.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,730
And then I'm also going to add a title here and I say PDT dot title parentheses single quotes yes versus

38
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:42,300
n0 X font size 14 we refresh this graph see what we get.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,760
Okay so this makes the relationship between distance from employment centers and n0 X are nitric oxide

40
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,660
pollution much much more clear what we can see here is that as distance increases as we go more to the

41
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,580
right of this chart here pollution goes down and this makes sense right.

42
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,380
The city center of Boston is going to be an employment center but city centers would also have much

43
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,510
more air pollution than in the suburbs on the outskirts of the city.

44
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,930
Now one thing that might be quite interesting to add to this graph is a little bit of transparency on

45
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:29,190
these data points as well as the maybe putting down the correlation that we've calculated up here and

46
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,530
including that in our title.

47
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,670
So let's do that now to calculate the correlation.

48
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:48,890
I'm going to add a new X underscore DHS core variable set that equal to data square brackets and X dot

49
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:59,060
core parentheses data square brackets the IRS and then when I wanna do is in the title I'm going to

50
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:08,420
use this variable here and I mean I included in my string and I'm going to use python's f string notation

51
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,710
to accomplish this.

52
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,400
So when I put it f in front of the single quote and then I'm going to modify my string as follows I'm

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,160
going to say parentheses correlation and here's the key.

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Curly braces n0 X underscore DHS on a score core.

55
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,750
So this is going to grab our variable from up here.

56
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:41,680
It's gonna grab our correlation between distance and pollution and it's going to inserted into our string.

57
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,100
And that's thanks to the effect that we have.

58
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,750
The curly bracket notation outside of the variable name and this little f in front.

59
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,550
So let me hit shift enter and see what this looks like.

60
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,320
What.

61
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,400
Now we've got a graphical representation of our data and the correlation.

62
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,500
All in one place and the correlation is indeed negative and it's quite high actually with zero point

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,440
seven seven now in terms of styling.

64
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,350
You might say to yourself you know what this number is way too precise.

65
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,710
It's difficult to read because it's got too many values after the decimal point.

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,790
So why don't we round it and we can do this with the python round function.

67
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,760
So I'm going to do it up here where I've actually calculated the correlation and I'm just going to surround

68
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:37,590
my correlation calculation with this python function so round comma at the end and then a value for

69
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,920
how many decimal places I want to round it to someone to run it to three decimal places and close my

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,580
parentheses at the end.

71
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,020
If a press shift enter now it should refresh and we should get something like this which should get

72
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,760
minus zero point seven six nine.

73
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,460
The other thing I quite like doing with scatter plots is adding a little bit of transparency to the

74
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:10,050
data points so that we can get a better feel for how dense particular areas of the chart are.

75
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,700
So in my line of code where I'm creating my scatter plot namely this one I'm going to add some other

76
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,290
keyword arguments.

77
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:25,430
The transparency is set with the alpha keyword and I'm going to set it to a value of zero point six.

78
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,140
It shift into and we can clearly see that there's a lot more data points here than over here.

79
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,900
I think this is a nice touch but we can make this even more explicit by changing the size of our dots

80
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,830
and making them a little bit larger.

81
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,740
So if I choose something like 80 s equals 80 as a keyword argument changing the size then I've got slightly

82
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,150
larger dots for my data points.

83
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:58,340
Now of course we can continue adding keyword arguments here to style the graph as we see fit famously

84
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,900
color and there's quite a few to choose from.

85
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,980
I'm going to go with indigo and give my scatter plot a purple make over hook.

86
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,970
So I think creating a counterpoint with my plot lib is pretty straightforward.

87
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,160
But now let's do the same thing with the Seabourn module to mix it up a little bit because remember

88
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,430
I said that Seabourn builds upon my plot lib.

89
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,390
Well you're gonna see in a minute how Seabourn really add some nice little touches to these visualizations.

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
Check this out.

91
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,770
So when it come down here a few more cells and then I'm going to write the following code.

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:47,980
I'm going to say S.A. dot joint plot so has an S being the name for Seabourn module and then joint blunt

93
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,620
being the function to create our scatter plot.

94
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:04,870
So there's a joint plant X equals data scrap rockets DHS and Y equals data square brackets and X and

95
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:14,340
then on the next line up with APL T dot show it shift into and what we get is something like this.

96
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,870
Now again I've only specified two parameters in my function call here but you can really see that there

97
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,250
is some sort of histogram on the side and there's some additional data being provided here in this corner.

98
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,480
Now if you can't read this on your screen this is actually the Pearson correlation coefficient down

99
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,310
to two decimal places minus zero point seven seven.

100
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,730
I can make the chart a little larger so that it's a bit more clear by going to the arguments and fighting

101
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,220
the sides argument.

102
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:53,170
Some of the signs equals seven increase the size a little bit but not too much.

103
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,010
Now you should see the chart appear a little bit larger on your screen but I think these histogram is

104
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,420
and the correlation coefficient and the fact that it adds some labels for the y axis and the x axis

105
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,960
automatically straight out of the box is a really really nice touch in terms of styling.

106
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,010
One thing that you might notice is that that the Jupiter notebook remembers how you've styled charts

107
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,420
previously.

108
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,130
So if you're working in a new cell and you want a new look for the chart you might have to reset the

109
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:31,670
styling the way to reset the styling for Seabourn is with a function called set.

110
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,540
So S.A. start set parentheses will reset the styling to the default styling.

111
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:44,780
So now if I press shift enter I get the default parameters for the styling and we kind of get this look

112
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,640
right here.

113
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,100
The set function is a good function to remember if you've ever got like a little bit of a longer notebook

114
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,670
that we've got here and you might have written some code up above.

115
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,320
That changes the styling of these charts and you want to do something different and you and your note

116
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:08,710
book is behaving a little bit unexpectedly so SNL starts that resets the styling to default and S.A.

117
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:18,730
dot set and the school style allows us to choose kind of like a template style to use for the chart.

118
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:25,370
So there's a couple of templates to choose from one of them is called white and then and this template

119
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,510
will make our chart look like so which is kind of what we had before.

120
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,440
But there's another template called white grid which then have these grid lines to the chart like so.

121
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:43,820
Now of course there's also like dark red and dark and pressing shift tab on this function will actually

122
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,690
show us what some of the options are dark grid dark dark white ticks.

123
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,020
Got a couple to choose from if we want and if you've got some examples on how you would use them.

124
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:03,870
So for example if you wanted to use ticks you can even provide the tick size as an additional argument.

125
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,250
All right.

126
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:11,280
So that's a little bit more detail on how you can control the aesthetics of your Seabourn chant in your

127
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,440
notebook.

128
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,880
But the last thing I want to mention is that there is an additional template that you can mix and match

129
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:27,540
with say white grid or dark grid and these templates are called contexts if you will.

130
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:37,830
So S.A. dot set underscore context parentheses will allow us to put in a template here for how does

131
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:46,710
charts gonna be used for example a context might be talk and if I use that then you can see that the

132
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,170
font size is a lot larger and the dots are a little bit more clear.

133
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,170
So this is presumably because you want to present this chart somewhere.

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,810
Now there's a couple of other contexts as well.

135
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,560
You can use notebook which will make the chart look like this.

136
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,230
This is a template that's quite good if you're viewing this kind of stuff on a monitor and you're not

137
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,730
having to throw it up on a screen or like a presentation and pressing shift enter on contexts shows

138
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,920
us that there's a couple of other options as well.

139
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,550
So there's paper they're supposed to and there's talk and notebook which we've already looked at.

140
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm going to go with talk just to make it a little bit more readable on the video the very last thing

141
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,260
I want to mention on the styling front is how you can get the similar sort of transparency and the color

142
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,290
that we have here on Mac plot lib.

143
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,860
So I want to show you how you can set that by supplying certain arguments the color argument is pretty

144
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,450
straightforward.

145
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:05,530
So color indigo will give us a purple chart but when it comes to the transparency you have to supply

146
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:12,190
the argument in a different way because joint plant doesn't take an argument called Alpha that's only

147
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,180
for mad plot lip.

148
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:23,880
Instead you have to go to the keyword arguments so joint underscore kW us and then equals.

149
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:31,450
And here you provide a dictionary a Python dictionary so that uses the curly braces notation and then

150
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:42,130
a key value pair alpha for their key colon and then say zero point five for the value if I press shift

151
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,260
enter now we'll have the transparency applied to our data points.

152
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,920
So I hope you find it useful to see two different ways of generating this chart with different modules.

153
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,780
The first one that plot lib and the second one being seaborne.

154
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,390
Now there's a really cool thing I want to show you next.

155
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,560
And that's to do with the fact that this joint plant method sexually incredibly powerful.

156
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,840
So let me copy to sell and paste it below.

157
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:16,270
So I have two copies of it now and what I want to do is just for comparison I want to modify how these

158
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,000
data points are represented here.

159
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,100
So I'm going to go with a blue color to set them apart.

160
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,050
So I've got my blue one here purple one here.

161
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,300
And then what I want to do is want to show you this keyword argument that I'm going to change in the

162
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:43,630
quick documentation so pressing shift enter on joint plant shows us that this keyword argument kind

163
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,200
is set to scatter by default.

164
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:57,250
But there's other values that this can take for example KDE e r e.g. reserved and hex.

165
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,290
So we've actually got a choice between five different values.

166
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,390
Let me show you what one of them does.

167
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm going to go ahead and delete this argument here where we've set our alpha value.

168
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:18,060
And if I press shift enter you can see that we no longer have any alpha values on our chart.

169
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:27,910
But if I come in here and I change the kind to hex so writing kind equals and then single quotes hex

170
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:36,540
and a head shift and we get the following We get a chart that looks like this and what this chart is

171
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,620
doing is that it's aggregating the data points that all fall in a certain area and then it shades them

172
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,900
in depending on how many data points there are in that particular sector so you're aggregating the data

173
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,980
points over like a little 2D area.

174
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,030
And again the shading gives us a very good idea of the density of the data points in that particular

175
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,520
part of the plot.

176
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,350
In other words we're aggregating the data in a hexagonal grid.

177
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,280
And I think this is a quite a beautiful visualization actually.

178
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,290
And it's one that you don't tend to see that often but it does remind me a little bit of a board game

179
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,970
called Settlers of Catan.

180
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,110
But maybe that's just me.
