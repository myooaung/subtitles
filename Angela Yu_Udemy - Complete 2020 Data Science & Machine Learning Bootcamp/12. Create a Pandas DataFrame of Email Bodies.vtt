00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.990
Ha right.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:09.600
So in the last lesson we've looked at one particular folder spam one and we've loaded all the message

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.140
bodies into a data frame.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.780
What I want to do in this lesson is call RDF from directory function.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.210
A few more times to load all the emails that we've got into a single data frame and have extracted all

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.620
the bodies from those emails.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.190
So that means that in addition to our spam one folder we're going to be loading in our spam to folder

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.040
our non spam one and our non spam to folders as well.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.240
So let's get right on that.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.620
I'm going to modify this cell right here and what I'm going to do is take my spam underscore emails

11
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.250
data frame and we're going to overwrite it.

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.640
We're going to append the emails from the other folder and updated so spam emails don't append and what

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.790
are we appending.

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.880
Well we can append the return value from RDF from directory function.

15
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:18.630
So yeah from the rectory spam to path comma one will extract all the emails from our second folder containing

16
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.260
the spam emails and then just append all of those values to our data frame.

17
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.370
If I hit shift enter on this and also hit shift enter on shape we can now see that we've got one thousand

18
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.980
eight hundred and ninety eight values instead of the 500 or so that we had earlier.

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.350
Now one other thing we can do to make our code slightly more readable is to change this value here.

20
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.660
This one to a constant.

21
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.000
That's a little bit more descriptive tells us a little bit more about what this one actually stands

22
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.850
for scrolling back up to her constants.

23
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.550
We can add another constant here namely spam underscore S.A.T. shortfall category.

24
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.910
Set that equal to one hand while we're at it we can also add a ham under school category constant and

25
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.690
set that equal to zero.

26
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.170
So henceforth every time we need to refer to the category we can use these constants right here using

27
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.640
the word ham to refer to non spam emails is something that you'll actually see a lot in the literature

28
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.220
on spam classification.

29
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.740
I'm not exactly sure why but I suspect it's because this group of people really liked wordplay.

30
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.120
So spam and habit is for us as well.

31
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.340
How is scrolling back down to our last cell where we left off.

32
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.790
I want to pose a challenge to you.

33
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.070
I want you to create a data frame that contains all the emails from the non spam directories and then

34
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.430
I want you to also print out the shape of this data frame and then we'll take it from there.

35
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.950
So pause the video and give that a shot.

36
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.080
Create a data frame with all the non spam emails similar to what I've done for the spam emails.

37
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.340
Did you have a go.

38
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.980
All right.

39
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.540
Here's the solution.

40
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.430
Ham underscore emails.

41
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.680
It's gonna be what I'm going to call my data frame.

42
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.600
I'm going to use my data frame from directory function and I'm going to pointed to easy non spam one

43
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.880
path and you use the ham category have to that.

44
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.950
I'm also going to do the same thing I did before.

45
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.190
I'm going to use my ham emails data frame and I'm going to append the data frame from directory pointed

46
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:59.190
to easy non spam to path and also using the ham category Finally we said we'd print out the shape right.

47
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.730
So ham emails dot should give us what we're looking for.

48
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.320
Hitting shift enter.

49
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.850
Let's see what we get.

50
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.880
So I'm getting three thousand nine hundred and two files being appended to this data frame.

51
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.870
Brilliant.

52
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.010
Now what we can do is we can get a data frame that holds onto all our emails both spam and non spam.

53
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.680
So I'm just gonna call this data frame data.

54
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.460
Got a lot of imagination as you can tell.

55
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:41.240
And when you use pandas concrete method so PD dot com cat parentheses square brackets spam emails karma

56
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:52.760
how many emails then I'll add a print statement that reads shape of entire data frame is and I'll print

57
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.950
out data dot shape and on the next line.

58
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.690
Let's take a look at the head of this data frame.

59
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.280
It's the first five rows eliminate shift enter and put this out.

60
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.280
What we see is that this data frame has five thousand and eight hundred rows and two columns.

61
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.110
Just like before.

62
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.800
I've got the file names here as an index.

63
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.880
I've got my category showing whether I've got spam or non spam and I've got the message body here in

64
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.910
the message column.

65
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:37.260
If you're curious where the non spam emails are hiding in our data frame it's gonna be in the tail.

66
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.080
So here we have a couple of category zero non spam emails hiding out.

67
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.070
All right.

68
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.390
That's it.

69
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.670
We've basically taken five thousand eight hundred files from our local disk and we've converted them

70
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.820
into a panda's data frame.

71
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.460
We've converted them into a format that we can manipulate and work with in our Python code.

72
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.170
So I think that's quite an achievement I see in the next lesson.

73
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.710
Take care.
