00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.380
To create a donor chant all we have to do is add a bit more code to this cell here.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.810
So when a copy yet pasted below so I've cut our original pie chart that I'm going to leave as it is.

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.410
And here I'm going to add my additional code.

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.020
The code I'm going to add is drawing a circle onto our chart a white circle that is so create a variable

5
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.630
called center on the school circle which is going to hold on to my circle and use matte plot lib to

6
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.490
create a circle PDT dots circle with a capital C. open parentheses.

7
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250
And now we have to supply some arguments.

8
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.240
Let me hit shift tab on the circle to take a look at the quick documentation.

9
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.420
So our circle requires one input one input is mandatory to create it and it basically needs to know

10
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.410
where to center the circle.

11
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.410
It needs an x and the y coordinate in these parentheses like so.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
So we're gonna give it a tuple of these coordinates.

13
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.840
I'm just gonna center it.

14
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.420
0 0 and that's it.

15
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.820
Let's add the circle to our figure.

16
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:33.710
So I say PDT dot GCA parentheses dot and artist parentheses center circle.

17
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.660
Now let me hit shift enter and what we get is something like this.

18
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.440
What's going on.

19
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.210
Well our circle is probably too big it's not size correctly so we'll have to supply a radius.

20
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.810
I'm going to make the circle a lot smaller.

21
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.800
Make it zero point six for the radius and hit shift enter.

22
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.160
Much better right.

23
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.130
We've got the circle now sitting in the middle of our pie chart.

24
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.570
The only problem is is that this circle is blue and it looks looks very very odd.

25
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.520
So let's make it white.

26
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.160
That way we can do that is by supplying this color as an argument to a parameter called FC FC is equal

27
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.720
to white.

28
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.360
We'll set the color of the circle to white.

29
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.590
Now we've got something that looks a bit more like this.

30
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.540
This is done look a lot better right.

31
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.210
The only thing is our offset doesn't quite work anymore.

32
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.420
It makes it look very very strange.

33
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.420
So I'm going to delete the explode argument him on our pie chart and refresh our graph.

34
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.630
There we go.

35
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.200
Not bad but I do want to move these percent labels back up here on our pie chart.

36
00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.550
We can do that with an argument called percent distance PCG distance all in lower case and if I set

37
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.280
that to zero point eight then my percent labels start moving out and they're more or less centered now

38
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.890
in their segment of the donut chart.

39
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.160
Now I'm fairly happy with this design.

40
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.150
Let's review the code a little bit.

41
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.170
We created a circle using matte plot lib so appeal.

42
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.060
Dot circle is our equivalent of PD dot data frame and then we've supplied a couple of inputs.

43
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.650
We've supplied color we've supplied a size of the circle and we've supplied where that circle should

44
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.850
be drawn at 0 0.

45
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.980
It's completely centered then what we did is we had to add this circle to our figure.

46
00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:00.120
So with T dot GCA we get the current axes so we're getting the current axes and we're adding the circle

47
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.980
with the add artist method to the axes.

48
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.910
So that adds the circle to our figure which means it gets drawn on top of our pie chart.

49
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.670
Okay so we've almost mastered the donut chart.

50
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.200
The only thing that I really want to show you is how to draw a doughnut chart with more than two categories.

51
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.720
Because oftentimes these don't a chance really come into the fore when you have three four or five categories

52
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.060
then they start looking really really great in all sorts of reports.

53
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.500
So just as an exercise let's create a donut chart with four categories.

54
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.520
Copy this so paste it below so I'm keeping the original and working off this one and I'm going to add

55
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:54.100
a few more category names so see updates and promotions.

56
00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.790
Now since we have four categories I'm going to have to update my list of sizes as well.

57
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.500
And I'm just gonna make up these numbers here for the amount of spam legitimate emails updates and promotions.

58
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:19.250
So say we have twenty five spam emails and I don't know 43 legitimate emails 19 updates and 22 promotions.

59
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.010
So we've got that.

60
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.330
Now it's just a matter of picking the colors we can keep the red and blue but we have to add two more

61
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.770
colors that fit well with this palette.

62
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.500
Going back to our American palate from Flat UI colors I think I'm going to go for the light green and

63
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.090
maybe the sour lemon here.

64
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.060
The yellow.

65
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:49.340
So I'm going to copy this update our list here making sure that the hex code of the colors and single

66
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.360
quotes and copy the sour lemon for the promotions.

67
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.430
There you go.

68
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.130
Now I've got my four categories.

69
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.440
Let me hit shift enter and see what this looks like at the moment.

70
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.600
Not bad right.

71
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.540
But what if we wanted to have a small gap between each of these categories.

72
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.290
What if we wanted to explode the doughnut chart the way we've exploded our pie chart and the easiest

73
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:27.690
way to do this is to create another list of values say offset is equal to square brackets and then maybe

74
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.730
zero point zero five zero point zero five zero point zero five.

75
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:42.490
I'll make the offset equal between all of the all of the categories zero point zero five as well.

76
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.240
Then for the pie chart we'll just say explode as equal to offset.

77
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.180
Now let me hit shift enter and look at our results.

78
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.390
Brilliant.

79
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.750
And that's really all there is to it.

80
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.020
I think pie charts are They're simple they're clear they're easy to code up but you can also make them

81
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.880
look very very good with the right choice of colors and a little thought on the formatting having them

82
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.490
some cute visualizations in the past lessons.

83
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.090
It's now time to return to do some hardcore programming in the next couple of lessons.

84
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.810
We're going to be looking at natural language processing.

85
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.510
We can't just feed raw e-mail bodies into our machine learning algorithm.

86
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.240
We need to prepare these e-mails for our base classified to work.

87
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.580
I'd say this that probably falls a bit more into the data cleaning part of the project but it will equip

88
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:48.090
you with some very very powerful tools and techniques to tackle all kinds of tax data that you're gonna

89
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.560
be encountering on your personal projects as well.

90
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.300
Natural Language Processing is a huge topic and super lucrative and super interesting.

91
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.580
So I hope you're as excited as I am for the next section.

92
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.990
I'll see you in the next lessons.

93
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.630
Take care.
