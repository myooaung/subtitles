1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,660
So now that we've talked a bit about machine learning it's time to tackle a closely related topic and

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,270
also a big part of this course.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,850
Data science data science is another one of those terms that gets thrown around a lot.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,950
But what does it actually mean.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,240
At it's hot data science is about turning data into value.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,030
But let's take a look at how it came to be in the 1980s.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,320
IBM came out with the first relational database storing things like customer details or company payroll

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,050
data.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,190
And soon after we started thinking about what useful things we can mined from the data and the term

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:46,510
data mining was coined in a paper called from data mining to knowledge discovery in databases published

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,040
in 1996.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:56,680
It defines data mining as the application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns from data let's

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,360
think about that extracting patterns from data.

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,460
We're going to see a lot more of that in the course.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,070
Up until now a lot of those patterns were being extracted with plain old statistics but we're now in

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,810
the 1990s when computer science was progressing at crazy speeds.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,060
So a lot of people were looking into levelling up data mining with computer science and they used the

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,790
term data science to refer to this new field as the dot com era exploded.

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,450
There were more and more data being generated and these days every click every scroll every time you

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,410
open an app.

21
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,010
Huge amounts of data are being generated and collected.

22
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,090
Why business intelligence.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,590
If you were a retailer wouldn't it be cool if you could predict when somebody was pregnant and then

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,530
market to them.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,700
The things that you sell to new parents well this is exactly what Target did.

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,050
They collected data on people's purchases and then based on what they bought they could use data science

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,690
to predict whether somebody was pregnant or maybe you've seen the movie Moneyball the story of how a

28
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,840
poor baseball team used data science to pick undervalued players which changed their fate from a losing

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,050
team to win 20 consecutive games the longest in American League's history.

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,220
How did they do it.

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:23,050
Data science data science is a broad term so broad that the Journal of data science defines it as almost

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,180
everything that has something to do with data.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,650
So most people think of data science as taking huge amounts of data or tapping into big data and performing

34
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,480
machine learning or using A.I. to get important insights.

35
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,980
But data science is actually much more than that.

36
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,580
Just as humans need food and water before they can start thinking about shelter or what is the meaning

37
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,360
of life in the data science Hierarchy of Needs a company first needs to be able to collect and store

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,270
their data before they can even start thinking about getting meaning out of it.

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,880
And in a large company that's usually done by data engineers.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:09,550
The role of the data scientist is to then take this data clean it explore it visualize it and then apply

41
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,180
intelligent algorithms to start answering questions with the data in the upcoming modules will be embarking

42
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,660
on projects that traverse all the layers that are the responsibility of the data scientist and the machine

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,030
learning expert in every module will try to solve a real world problem by first understanding how to

44
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,320
clean segment and visualize raw data.

45
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,630
We can then learn to apply shallow and deep learning algorithms to extract meaning from the data.

46
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:46,760
Algorithms like linear regression Bayes classification and deep learning with neural networks.

47
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,630
Also we're going to learn how to use tools like tensor flow Python Charisse panders and num pi to solve

48
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:03,070
our data problems problems like movie revenue prediction spam classification and image recognition.

49
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,340
There's a lot packed into this course.

50
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,210
So what are you waiting for.

51
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,040
Let's get started.
