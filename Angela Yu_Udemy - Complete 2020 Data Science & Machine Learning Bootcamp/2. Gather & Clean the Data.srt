1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,870
Now that we've defined and formulated our question it's time to gather the data.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,440
So let's have a think about the kind of data that we're looking to gather.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,040
First off we need data on our feature namely the movie budgets in U.S. dollars.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,740
The second thing that we need is data on our target namely the movie revenue in US dollars.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,220
So where would we go about finding this kind of data.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,200
Well lucky for us there exists a Web site called the numbers and their slogan is what data and the movie

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,770
business meet.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,030
This sounds perfect for our project.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,520
So let's check it out.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,660
So this is what the website looks like.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,640
If we go to movies budgets and finances then we get the performance records of various films and they've

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,670
even got some tables here on some common searches are common questions that people might be interested

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,240
in.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,080
For example they've got the biggest budget films right here.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,050
And if we scroll down they've got the movies with the lowest budgets to earn one million dollars at

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,850
the U.S. box office.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,480
And I think a notable film here is El Mariachi which apparently only had a production budget of seven

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,850
thousand dollars but made about two million in the U.S. box office.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:27,660
If we click on this link here where it says the complete list then we get the entire table of all the

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,990
films in the database right here.

21
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,430
And this table is actually enormous.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,420
It's very very long.

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,670
There's quite a few different entries here.

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,280
And what I've done is I've selected all of these and I've copy pasted them into a spreadsheet now to

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
save you this kind of tedious work.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,260
I've made a huge v file available under the lesson resources.

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,120
All you have to do is download it and open it in excel or in google sheets.

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,900
And once you open this file what you should see is the movies sorted by their rank.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,010
So please Number one we've got Avatar then a Star Wars film then Pirates Of The Caribbean.

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,170
All of these films are sorted by their production budget.

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,980
So column D and if we scroll down then we can see that there's a lot of entries in this file.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,260
As a matter of fact there's about 5000 entries in this CSP file.

33
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,950
So this completes our data gathering step and we can move on to the next part of the workflow namely

34
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,330
cleaning the data.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,790
So let's take a closer look at what we've actually got.

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,350
If I scroll down here then I can see there's a lot of numbers but occasionally we might spot something

37
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,610
a little bit odd.

38
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,490
For example here in columns f we have two big fat zeros scrolling up.

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,680
I can see these are the columns for worldwide gross and domestic gross and yet this movie entitled singularity

40
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:07,170
with a production value of 175 million dollars has zero revenue.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,690
And the reason for this might be found in this column our second column here.

42
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,830
What we have here is the projected release date.

43
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,610
So end of 2020 is when this movie is due to be released according to this dataset.

44
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,080
And what they've done is they've put a place holder of zero into these two columns instead of for moving

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,490
this movie entirely.

46
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,010
They've included it in the data set with one hundred and seventy five million dollars production budget

47
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,930
but because it hasn't made any revenue to date they've added some zeros here.

48
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,610
Now this might actually be a little bit of a problem for us because we're looking to make a prediction

49
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,590
for our movie revenue.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,340
And if our dataset is going to be include films that have not been released yet and have big fat zeros

51
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,210
for the revenue it might make our estimates a little bit unreliable.

52
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,900
Right.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,750
So one thing that might actually be worth doing is checking how many films out of the five thousand

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,010
three hundred actually have a revenue of zero.

55
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,390
And we can do this by sorting by worldwide gross.

56
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:19,830
If I select my data here and then open the menu and then go to Data sort range then I can actually sort

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,250
by column number E.

58
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,760
And since we don't want to include that first row in the sort I'm just going to tick this box here and

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,780
then click sort and what we see here is that there's quite a few films that have a zero entry for worldwide

60
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,880
gross and domestic gross.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,360
Now why might that be.

62
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,350
Well for some of them the release date is in the future but looking at this column we see that not every

63
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,470
film that has a 0 here is due to be released in the future.

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,100
So for example this one here Black Water Transit was supposedly released at the end of 2008 and this

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,590
film also has a big fat zero in worldwide gross why might that be.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,860
Now one possible answer is looking at the description of the Web site.

67
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,680
So if we go here then we see this line that data to the best of our knowledge is accurate.

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,620
But there are gaps and disputed figures.

69
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,120
So some of these zeros might be gaps.

70
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,770
It might just be that the data is incomplete for some films but I've actually looked up this Blackwater

71
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:34,780
transit film and on Wikipedia I can see that in post-production there were actually quite a few lawsuits

72
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,210
and there was quite a lot of back and forth between the production company and the filmmakers and the

73
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,890
producers and so on.

74
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:49,990
So this film actually never got released and this release date here of end of 2008 was probably a planned

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,080
release date but the movie actually never came out.

76
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,530
Now this might be something that happened to quite a few of these films and there might have a 0 for

77
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,180
various other reasons too.

78
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:09,100
But this poses a big problem for our analysis if we're looking to predict movie revenue based on the

79
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,660
budget then having these zero entries here is going to be a problem.

80
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:20,350
So what I would suggest given that some of these films were probably not released other ones the data

81
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,260
might not be available is that we should actually exclude the films that have zero here for worldwide

82
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,960
gross and domestic gross.

83
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,320
We should select all of these entries and delete them from our dataset.

84
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:41,320
So if I come down here to row 358 and scroll all the way up then I can select all of these rows I can

85
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,860
right click and I can delete the rows.

86
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,300
We're going to exclude these rows from our analysis.

87
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,930
The next thing that we're going to do is we're actually going to have to do some calculations and these

88
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,430
involve the production budget and the worldwide gross.

89
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,880
These other columns we're actually not going to use.

90
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,640
We're not going to use the domestic rows.

91
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,240
We're not going to use the movie title or the rank or the release date.

92
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,910
So what I would suggest is that as part of the data cleaning process we're going to delete these entire

93
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,830
columns.

94
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,810
So going to delete these columns and we're going to delete this column right here.

95
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,640
That way we can trim our spreadsheet to what actually matters for our analysis.

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,170
The next thing that we need to do is we need to have a think about these special characters that might

97
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,210
be in the dataset and by special characters I mean anything other than a number.

98
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:38,230
So we're gonna be doing some calculations with all of this data and those calculations might be troubled

99
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,790
by the fact that there's a dollar sign here or a comma.

100
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,960
This type of formatting could cause problems.

101
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,220
So it's better to remove it and have a pure number in these cells rather than all this extra stuff.

102
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,960
And the way that we can format all these numbers and get rid of these symbols is by selecting the columns

103
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:04,420
going to format number and then scrolling down which says more formats and going to custom number format.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,410
And here we can pick the second one down which is this decimal number and click apply.

105
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,110
Now we've got no more dollar signs in our columns so we're almost done cleaning our data.

106
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,410
The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to rename my column headings.

107
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,720
And the only reason I'm doing that is because I'm going to remove spaces and these custom symbols here

108
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,900
the parentheses and the dollar signs from the headings to make our lives a little bit easier on I find

109
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,800
that as soon as I have special symbols or white spaces in my headings I make a lot more typos when I've

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,910
referred to particular columns.

111
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:48,250
So for this one I'm just gonna call this production underscore budget underscore USD and this one here

112
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:56,230
I'm going to call world wide underscore gross underscore USD with these two names for a headings I've

113
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,050
got very expressive headings and yet there's no whitespace and there's no special characters.

114
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,340
This will make our life a little bit easier to underline.

115
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:12,250
So in summary for the data cleaning what we've done is we've looked for missing data we've looked for

116
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,210
incomplete data we've looked for in accurate data and we've done some tidying up by checking the formatting

117
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,380
of our data in detail.

118
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,310
And the reason we've done all of this is so that we don't have problems when we provide this data to

119
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,060
our machine learning algorithm down the line.

120
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,470
Now we can move on to the next step which is exploring and visualizing our data.

121
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,210
Mind you if we spot any more problems during this next step we might have to do a little bit more cleaning

122
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,150
as well.

123
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,300
So you'll find that very often in practice you're going to be doing the cleaning and the exploration

124
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,500
side by side.

125
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,370
I'll see you in the next lesson.

126
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:49,930
Take care.
