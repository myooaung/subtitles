00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.930
All right.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.660
So now that you know what the original data comes from and how to work with archive files and how to

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.340
work with files that don't really have a good file extension let's focus on how we'd like you to work

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.000
with the lesson resources that I've already included.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.520
These resources don't just include the spam emails but also some image files and some fonts and I've

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.180
organized everything very very nicely for you in folders as well.

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.470
So you're welcome.

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.780
Let's include the modules resources in Jupiter.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.240
All right.

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.000
So on windows I've got my email project folder here in Jupiter and I have to pull up this folder here

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.830
in Explorer.

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.960
So this folder is located right here under users and then my username.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:00.900
And if I open this up I can see that the same files that are listed here are here on Windows Explorer

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.250
so I've downloaded the lesson resources here.

15
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.170
The spam data dot zip and have a double click on it.

16
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.100
I open the spam data.

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.180
Don't zip file.

18
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.790
I have not extracted it.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.030
What you really need to do is right click on this thing and click extract all.

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.150
OK.

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.610
So now this is key.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.640
Let's see what happens if I leave the defaults and I just click extract well twiddle our thumbs a bit

23
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.200
and wait for this to complete.

24
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.430
One thing you'll notice is that this works a lot faster with solid state drives than with regular hard

25
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.620
drives all right.

26
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.440
Now let's see what we've got.

27
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.220
We've got spam data.

28
00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.080
This is the extracted folder from here if I double click on this I have a nest that folder here.

29
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.730
Spam data and then I have this one here which will ignore or you can delete but it's this folder here

30
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.630
that you need.

31
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.190
Right.

32
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.740
So this is the one where you've got processing training and testing.

33
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.090
Right.

34
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.990
So by default I've got a nested folder structure spam data his inside another folder called spam data.

35
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.720
Now take this one here the one inside and bring it over here.

36
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.530
This thing here is just an artifact from me having zipped this file on a Mac.

37
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.440
So you don't need to worry about this you can just delete this file.

38
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.370
It's not important.

39
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.660
Now here's the key.

40
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.110
Right.

41
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.470
Back in Jupiter notebook we see the spam data folder here come up and clicking on it.

42
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600
You see three folders if you open those and you see no other spam data folder.

43
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.010
Then you've got a nested folder which you don't want and will cause problems later on.

44
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.860
So this is the structure that we're really really going for the remainder of this module assumes that

45
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.250
you've got this exactly the same way I'm doing this.

46
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.220
You've got the same file names.

47
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.690
You've got the same folder names.

48
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.090
You've got the same folder structure and you've got the same location.

49
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.260
This is how we're going to roll.

50
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.150
So just double check that you're mirroring my setup here and that there is no accidental nested directories

51
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.400
anywhere.

52
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.200
And with that out of the way we're finally good to go.

53
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.890
I'll see in the next lesson.

54
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.420
Take care.
