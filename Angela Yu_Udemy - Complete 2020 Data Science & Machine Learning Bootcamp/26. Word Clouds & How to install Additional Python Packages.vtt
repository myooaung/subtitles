00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.400
In the next couple of lessons I want to show you two things.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.520
First I want to show you how to install third party modules and packages that don't come bundled with

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.370
the anaconda distribution that we're running.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.640
But more importantly I want to show you a data visualization technique for giving prominence to words

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.980
that appear more frequently in a piece of text namely the word cloud a word cloud or a tag cloud as

6
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.420
it is also called looks like this.

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.070
The idea behind the word cloud is that the words that are larger appear more frequently than those that

8
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.740
are smaller here.

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.240
I've used the Vicky PDR article on machine learning to generate this particular word cloud.

10
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.690
Notice how the larger tags catch your attention.

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.530
You'll probably find that you're not actually reading all the words in this visualization at all.

12
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.850
Instead people just tend to scan these word clouds.

13
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.420
So why use this technique.

14
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.390
It's not scientific and it's not accurate.

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.090
True but more often than not you need to grab people's attention and a word cloud can do this rather

16
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.840
well.

17
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.810
It's a little bit of a novel visualization.

18
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.820
It's a bit creative and it communicates the relative importance of the words in the dataset very quickly.

19
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.360
After all it's pretty easy to see that a word that's twice the size of another word is probably twice

20
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360
as important.

21
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.610
And in our case it appears twice as often.

22
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.670
Speaking of grabbing people's attention you can get even more creative with the word cloud by applying

23
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.110
a mask to the image here.

24
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.360
I've used a circle as a mask but you could use another image instead.

25
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.540
For example would you like to venture a guess as to what data I've used to create this would cloud in

26
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.980
the shape of a whale.

27
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.010
I actually used Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick and here I've used the data from our spam emails and

28
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.440
here I've used Shakespeare's play Hamlet.

29
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.650
Coming up I'll be showing you how to create all of these three visualizations.

30
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.980
That way you can apply this technique to your future projects.

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.360
I've seen a lot of people use word clouds on reports and presentations that say contain customer feedback

32
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.620
or metadata like tags or SEO keywords that will help you rank on Google or really any situation where

33
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.560
you quickly need to show how people feel about your product or your business.

34
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.080
These are the kind of applications where word clouds really shine.

35
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.500
All right.

36
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.890
So how do we create a word cloud in python because we're not gonna do it from scratch.

37
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.230
We will use an existing Python package.

38
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.790
Now the fantastic thing about the anaconda distribution is that it comes bundled with lots and lots

39
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.940
of different packages.

40
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.900
Straight out of the box these included none pipe pandas.

41
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.310
Matt Portland and many others that we've already used.

42
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.450
However the python ecosystem is actually huge and you'll often find that you'll want to make use of

43
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.390
a package that's not installed by default.

44
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.140
In that case you'll need to know how to download and install a custom package to add to your collection.

45
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.310
For that you'll be using the terminal if you're running a Mac or the anaconda prompt on Windows.

46
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.410
Both of these kind of look like this and this is where you can execute many different types of commands

47
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.760
the command that will be looking at in detail is called Conda install.

48
00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.480
And the easiest way to install a package is just to type condo install followed by the package name.

49
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.810
However this won't always work and it actually won't work in the case of our word cloud package.

50
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.020
And the reason is is that we also have to specify something called a channel a channel is the location

51
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.630
where Conda will look for the package.

52
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.920
If you just write condo install and then the package name then Connor will search in a default location

53
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.370
which may or may not contain the package that you're looking for.

54
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.090
If you need to specify a particular channel or you know that the package exists then all you have to

55
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:45.260
do is follow condo install with hyphen C and then the channel name this syntax that dash C works just

56
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.190
like your supplying an argument to a python function.

57
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.610
In our case the word cloud package is located in a channel called condo forge and therefore the code

58
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.220
that we will be typing into our prompt will read Conda install high fancy condo hyphen forge word cloud.

59
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.170
Let me quickly show you how to do this on Mac and then I'll show you what you'll see on a Windows machine.

60
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.220
To see the existing packages that are already installed.

61
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.210
Fire up your Anaconda navigate home and then click on environments there you can search for the existing

62
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.760
packages that are already installed on your computer.

63
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.450
The package that we're looking for is called word cloud all in one word.

64
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.130
Now since I can't find it I'm going to open my terminal there.

65
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.460
I'm going to type Conda install word cloud but just as we've discussed earlier for the word cloud package

66
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:56.320
we actually to specify a channel we need to specify a location because it's not found in the default

67
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.230
location where Conda is looking.

68
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.750
Instead we need to type Conda install hyphens see Conda hyphen forge word cloud and if you don't make

69
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.990
any typos then you should see your computer starting to do some work prior to going ahead with the installation

70
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.190
you may have to confirm that you actually want to do this and then you have to type Y for yes to proceed

71
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.540
at this point a download will start.

72
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.860
And once the download is finished you'll see something like preparing transaction verifying transaction

73
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.870
executing transaction.

74
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.130
Dun dun dun.

75
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.230
And then you're good to go once you see these messages.

76
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:45.170
I encourage you to fire up finder go to the anaconda folder then go to the packages folder and then

77
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.240
find the word cloud sub folder there.

78
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.720
This is the package that you've just installed back in the anaconda navigator.

79
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.430
You can now type in word cloud into the search bar and it should pop up.

80
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.370
Mind you I actually had to restart my anaconda Navigator for it to pick this up and that pretty much

81
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.570
concludes the setup for Mac on Windows.

82
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.420
The story is pretty much the same if you fire up the anaconda navigator and search for word cloud it

83
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.440
doesn't appear to bring up the anaconda prompt.

84
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.240
All you need to do is click on that little place symbol and then say open terminal.

85
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.870
This will fire up the anaconda prompt where you can type in Conda install hyphen C Conda hyphen forge

86
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.340
word cloud.

87
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.900
Now depending on the speed of your machine this might take a little while but you can't go in and grab

88
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.280
a coffee just yet because once again you need to type in y to confirm and proceed after you've done

89
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.230
that a download will start.

90
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.470
And I'm actually fast forwarding my video here because this took a little bit longer on this machine

91
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.740
but at the end you'll see the very same messages that we saw on Mac preparing transaction verifying

92
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.290
transaction executing transaction.

93
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.060
Dun dun dun.

94
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.810
And that's it.

95
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.160
If you'd like to see where these packages were actually installed on your computer go to your user directory.

96
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.240
So mine's called Peter D.

97
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.880
Under users but yours will have your own name of course.

98
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.510
Then open Anaconda.

99
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.490
3 Then go to the packages folder and there.

100
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.850
If you scroll further down you should see the word cloud package along with the others that start with

101
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.000
W back in the anaconda navigator.

102
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.260
You won't necessarily find the word plot package listed already.

103
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:46.290
You might have to actually quit and restart this thing because only then does it seem to pick it up.

104
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.390
Now you're pretty much all set to install any package you come across in the future.

105
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:59.430
All you need to do after all is type Conda install then the channel where the package is located and

106
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.380
then the package name and that's it in the next lesson.

107
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.550
It's time to write some python code and actually create these word clouds.

108
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.180
So I hope you're looking forward to that as much as I am.

109
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.320
I'll see you there.
