WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.890
All right.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.890
So here we're going to be visualizing our results.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:14.280
So I'll add a quick markdown sale here visualizing the results and in the next few sales we're gonna

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.500
be creating some charts scrolling to the top of our notebook.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.880
We should have already added Our input statements for Matt Gottlieb and Seabourn hand.

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960
We should have also added this percent.

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:35.000
Matt plotted in line the charts I want to create are the joint conditional probability that an email

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.990
is spam vs. the join conditional probability that an email is legitimate.

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.570
So in this first cell here that's some chart styling info.

10
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.910
And by that I mean things like the y axis label the x axis label stuff like that.

11
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:09.240
So y axis underscore label will be equal to single quotes P parentheses x pipe spam and the x axis on

12
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:20.650
a score label will be equal to single quotes p x pipe non spam the first chart we're gonna create is

13
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.760
gonna be not very fancy it's gonna be your standard map popular chant and it's gonna look like this

14
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.880
with peal T dot figure I'm going to set the size of my chart first so I'll see fake size is equal to

15
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.910
parentheses eleven by seven.

16
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:51.160
This will give me a nice size for the screen cast BLT dot X label parentheses it's gonna be equal to

17
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.310
that string that we have at a cell above.

18
00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:06.600
So x axis underscore label comma font size is equal to 14 and peel T dot y label.

19
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.290
It's gonna be you guessed it y axis underscore label comma font size equals fourteen.

20
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.070
Now let me actually plot this chart so I mean he's a scatter plot here peel T dot scatter parenthesis

21
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.090
joint at a school log on a school ham.

22
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.570
So this is going on our x axis comma joint and a score log on a score spam is gonna go on our y axis

23
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.180
and peel teed up show will generate our chart we'll see what it looks like what it looks like.

24
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:59.930
This pretty wild huh let's zoom in a little bit on this area here and set the limits of the chart.

25
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:11.080
Also I'm going to change the color of my dots here to navy blue coming back up I want to set the scale

26
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:21.130
or the limit of the axis with PDT dot excellent parentheses square brackets minus fourteen thousand

27
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:40.540
two one and PDT dot why Lim is gonna go from also minus fourteen thousand to one to change the colour

28
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.730
of the dots all I need to do is apply the color argument and provide a color name here.

29
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.710
And one example of a legitimate name is Navy for navy blue.

30
00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.250
If I refresh the cell then you can see that our chart now looks like this.

31
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.920
Not bad right but I think we can make some improvements.

32
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.440
Let's have a think about how our naive bayes classifier made his predictions.

33
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.120
Scrolling back up to this very crucial line of code here we can see that our algorithm decided on which

34
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.610
category an e-mail belonged to simply based on which probability was higher.

35
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.130
And this allows us to plot something on our chart called a decision boundary that decision boundary

36
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.730
is going to divide our chart into two regions one region.

37
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.630
It's gonna be for spam and the other region is gonna be for our legitimate emails now.

38
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.080
Any guess of how our decision boundary will look like on our chart.

39
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.170
Well let's think about it.

40
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.520
If the probabilities for one of these e-mails is calculated and it comes in in the top left corner should

41
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.140
be classified as spam whereas non spam well in this case it has a very high probability that the email

42
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.120
is spam and a very low probability that the email is non spam right.

43
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.860
Therefore according to our logic and our decision rule it should be classified as a spam email.

44
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.270
What about the lower left and the lower left.

45
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.930
We have the opposite case here.

46
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.360
An email is much more likely to be a real email than a spam email.

47
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.920
Such be classified as non spam.

48
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:45.270
So by that logic if we were to draw our decision boundary a line to separate these two regions then

49
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.990
it would go diagonally up through the middle of our chart right.

50
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.890
This is gonna be our decision boundary and this is how we can visualize the logic that our classifier

51
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:04.330
uses to separate what it believes to be a spam message from a non spam message.

52
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:12.760
So let me add a very quick section heading out it reads the decision boundary and what I'm going to

53
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:25.180
do is I'm going to copy this cell here and I'm going to paste it below and then what I'll do is I'm

54
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.790
going to create some data for a line and I'm going to do that up here actually to plot a line on a map

55
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.680
flip chart.

56
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:42.430
You need some data points and I'm just gonna call these line data and when to generate them using num

57
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.280
pi.

58
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:51.940
So with NDP dot Lin space parentheses I can generate these data points and I'm going to set a starting

59
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.320
and an ending point for these data points.

60
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:04.710
The start is gonna be equal to negative fourteen thousand which is what we're using for our axes right.

61
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.980
And I'm going to stop at say 1 and then I'll decide on how many data points I actually want to generate

62
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.240
I'll generate say a 1000 of them.

63
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.950
I think they'll be good enough.

64
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:26.220
Let me add the and u m equals 1000 to make this a named argument.

65
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:35.530
Now let's shift enter on the cell and I can come down here and modify the second chart all I got to

66
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:46.610
do is use PDT dot plot and supply an x value so it's going to plot all the X's under line data and it's

67
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:54.590
going to plot all the y values under line data as well so our x's and our Y's are going to be equal.

68
00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.080
This will give us a diagonal line and to contrast that with the navy blue.

69
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.330
I'm going to use the orange color colors equal to orange.

70
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.710
Let's see what this looks like.

71
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.440
There we go.

72
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.630
Okay so we've plotted our probabilities now but this chart is still not very clear.

73
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.850
Let me ask you this.

74
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.180
What kind of problems do you spot with this chart.

75
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:31.600
Well for starters there is a lot of data in this top right hand corner and we can't actually see what's

76
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.640
going on.

77
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.520
The second problem is looking at this chart.

78
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:45.390
We cannot identify which emails were classified correctly and which e-mails were classified incorrectly.

79
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.080
All we see is our data plotted here and our decision boundary in the middle.

80
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.800
So first things first let's tackle that first problem I described.

81
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:04.090
This was the problem of over plotting when we have many many data points and we put them all together

82
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.310
on a chart like this.

83
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.020
They're so close together that we're faced with this over plotting problem we can't actually visually

84
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.140
distinguish the relationship on the chart with so much data.

85
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.800
If you wanted to make this chart a bit more clear how do you think we can improve this visualization.

86
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:29.530
Hit pause on this video and maybe try and track down two things that we can do to make this chart a

87
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.830
bit more clear.

88
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.730
I'll give it a few seconds to do just that.

89
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.370
All right.

90
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:42.070
So first we're going to use some techniques that we've already introduced in the past listen.

91
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.180
We're going to introduce some transparency to our data points.

92
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.890
And we're also going to reduce the DOT size on this chart.

93
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.350
And this is actually really really easy to do because all we need to do is add a few more keyword arguments

94
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.010
here.

95
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.710
The transparency we can set with alpha.

96
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.010
So if I set the alpha value to zero point five and refresh myself then I can see that the chart now

97
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:15.760
looks like this and we can better appreciate some of the density in certain areas to make the dot size

98
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.230
smaller.

99
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:24.010
On the other hand all we need to do is specify a value for this argument called S for size.

100
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:31.930
And if I said s is equal to say 25 then I get something like this I get smaller dots and I've improved

101
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:39.730
my situation somewhat but you know there's still a bit of a problem here in this top right corner.

102
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.100
We've got a lot of data here.

103
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.550
And even though we've made a picture a little bit more clear we're not quite there yet.

104
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:55.230
So let's do something else let's have two charts side by side instead of a single chart most of the

105
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.470
action seems to be happening up here.

106
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:05.490
So you can create a little zoomed in version of that area and place it next to our chart showing the

107
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:13.490
whole thing to do that in my plot lib we're going to use something called a subplot so I'll take the

108
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:21.520
cell copy and paste it below and now I'll modified of it.

109
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:27.080
So for my figure's size I want to change it to say 16 and seven.

110
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:32.570
So when I go a bit wider here because I want to have two plots and then I'm going to create my first

111
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.530
subplot.

112
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:43.510
So with BLT dot subplot parentheses and I'll supply three values the number of rows in my subplot there'll

113
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.170
be one row the number of columns.

114
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.200
So I want two charts.

115
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.040
Next to each other.

116
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.890
So I'll have a two there and an index for the first chart.

117
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.180
So this will be index 1.

118
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:05.550
If I copy this line and come down here and paste it in then I'll use INDEX TO HERE.

119
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.360
SO THIS WILL BE chart number two.

120
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.630
That's going to go here up here.

121
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.540
We're going to be working with chart number 1.

122
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.210
So tell you what.

123
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:29.520
Let's keep chart number one as it is when I want to do is I'm going to copy these lines of code come

124
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.960
down here.

125
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.890
Paste them in and then to set the scale for that second chart.

126
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:42.920
I'm not going to go between negative fourteen thousand one I'm going to go between minus two thousand

127
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:51.730
and one for both my x axis and my y axis and the other thing I'm going to do on my second chart is I'm

128
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.130
going to change the size of my dots.

129
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.370
I want to make them even smaller so as equals 25.

130
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.600
Probably too big.

131
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.090
So I'm going to go with a different number here a much smaller one say three.

132
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.500
And now let me hit shift enter and see what this looks like.

133
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.040
There we go.

134
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:18.200
Now I've got two subplots I've got them side by side and I've got this zoomed in version here where

135
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:26.310
I've got many many small dots to represent each data point So yeah these are some very very easy and

136
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:32.220
very handy techniques to apply to try and tackle this over plotting problem but let's move on.

137
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:40.110
Let's try and make our charts even better and to do that we're going to use Seabourn instead of matte

138
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.450
plot lib to create our charts.

139
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.850
One of the reasons I quite like using Seabourn is because it makes creating beautiful charts very very

140
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.260
simple.

141
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.290
There's not a lot of code you have to write.

142
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.830
And because we want to do a better job with our data visualization see what makes it very very easy

143
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:03.460
to add colour and make our charts a bit more clear so let me come down here and I want to use a cell

144
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:12.190
here to add some information about chant styling and the first thing I'll do is I'll set the style of

145
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.400
our seaborne charts.

146
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:23.920
So I'll see S.A. dot set up a school style single quotes white grid and the other thing I'll do is I'll

147
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:31.810
create a variable called labels which will hold onto a string called actual category.

148
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.090
The thing about some of these seaborne charts is that they really like working with data frames so we

149
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:44.500
can create one here call it summary and a score def that will hold on to all our data that we're interested

150
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.310
in plotting.

151
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:59.710
So PD dot data frame capital the capital F parenthesis curly brace y axis label colon joint underscore

152
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:12.370
log on to scroll spam comma x axis label colon joint on a squat log on a school hem you can see here

153
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:20.400
what I'm doing is I'm creating a dictionary and this dictionary is what's going to provide the columns

154
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:29.700
for our data frame y axis label it's gonna be the column name of all our spam probabilities x axis label

155
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:39.240
it's gonna be the column name for our ham probabilities and labels it's gonna be the column name for

156
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:48.030
y on a school test so it's gonna be the column name for the true values the actual values in the testing

157
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:58.590
dataset now we're ready to go let's create our first seaborne chart to do that we're going to use C

158
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:10.890
bonds l m plot so S.A. stopped and then plot parenthesis X equals X axis label.

159
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:27.060
So this is all the x values in our data frame Y is equal to y axis label common data is equal to summary

160
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.020
underscore D F.

161
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.170
So there you have it.

162
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:38.460
We're using our data frame and we're specifying which columns of our data frame make up the y values

163
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.340
and the x values.

164
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.030
Now let me specify the size of the chart that I want.

165
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.240
Size is equal to say six point five.

166
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.920
Then I'll just say as an S start PDT dot show.

167
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.000
Let's see what we get.

168
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.310
So we get something like this.

169
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.310
What you see here is a regression right.

170
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:07.930
We've got a regression and we've got a warning here so let's modify our arguments here.

171
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.040
And the first thing I'll do is I'll get rid of the regression line.

172
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:24.650
So say fit and school R E G is equal to False and that will remove our regression line and also removes

173
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.570
this warning.

174
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:32.110
So this is how our chart looks like without the regression line using l m plot.

175
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.550
Now I know what you're thinking you're thinking man this looks a lot worse than my plot led.

176
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.320
Why are we doing this.

177
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.190
Well you'll see in a minute.

178
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:50.110
So um let's add some keyword arguments for our scatter plot and we can do this by providing a dictionary.

179
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:57.980
So with the scatter underscore K W S is equal to curly braces.

180
00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:12.590
Single quotes Alpha colon zero point five comma s and single quotes colon twenty five.

181
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.660
You'll recognize these because these argument names are what we've used with map plot lib right.

182
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.260
And uh similarly we can also scale this chart differently right.

183
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:35.530
With peel T dot X limb parentheses square brackets C minus two thousand and one and peel T dot while

184
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:43.330
in parentheses square brackets minus two thousand coma 1.

185
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.850
Let's take a look now.

186
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.620
I've actually got an error here a syntax error.

187
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:55.740
You might already be spotting it but uh I came down here on a new line without inserting a comma to

188
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.380
separate my arguments.

189
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:04.990
So adding the comma and refreshing the cell allows me to generate my chart as I intended.

190
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.530
There we go.

191
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:12.040
So this is looking a little better but I think it's still missing our decision boundary.

192
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.130
So let's add that as well so I'll add this line here.

193
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:28.510
After X limb and while I'm all that PDT dot plot parentheses line data comma line data comma color equal

194
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:34.750
to single quotes black I think will look nicely.

195
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.170
Yeah.

196
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.700
This makes our chart look very clear.

197
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:47.210
So right about now we've kind of caught up with that plot live in terms of looks but has promised we

198
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.480
want to add some color to this chart right.

199
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:58.660
The way we're going to color this chart is using a keyword argument called Hugh so I'll just copy the

200
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.460
same pasted below.

201
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.750
So we have the comparison between the two.

202
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.960
And I'll add this Hugh argument here.

203
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:15.100
And for the Hugh we're going to specify the true values in our summary unescorted.

204
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.960
Yes the true values of our data in our data frame are y underscore.

205
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.790
Test values.

206
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.800
That is.

207
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:32.620
So that's gonna be Hugh is equal to labels and heading shift into this is what we get we get some green

208
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:40.180
values up here we get some blue values done here and we even get a little legend here which has the

209
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:48.850
column name of our data from actual space category and 0 the blue ones are the non spam messages and

210
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.620
one are the spam messages.

211
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.220
The nice thing about this alleged plot function is that we can actually change these markers as well.

212
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:03.150
So you know not only can we get two different colors we can actually get different markers.

213
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:09.430
If you were to head to the mad plot lib documentation you can see that you have a whole menu of markers

214
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.390
to choose from.

215
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:17.350
So if we want to go with circles or triangles or squares or whatever stars you've got a whole lot of

216
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.360
options here.

217
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.980
So I have to set some markers as well.

218
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.250
So we've got color and shape as a differentiator.

219
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:35.860
And for the markers I'll go for Marcus is equal to square brackets single quotes 0 comma single quotes

220
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:45.480
X so now my spam messages will be marked with all X's little crosses and my non spam messages will be

221
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.200
marked with little circles like this.

222
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.760
Now there's actually two things I still don't quite like about this chart.

223
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.300
One thing is that I'd like to have a little bit more control over my legend here on the right.

224
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.900
I'd like to customize the legend for this chart.

225
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:09.290
The other thing that bugs me are actually the default colors that Seabourn has chosen for me.

226
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.800
At the time of recording the colors that were chosen here are blue and green.

227
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.460
Now that might not seem like a big issue but it could be a problem for approximately one and 12 men

228
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.120
or one in 200 women.

229
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:31.740
And the reason is is that certain color combinations actually not ideal for people with color blindness

230
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.670
and you can take this into account when you're creating your own graphics or your own charts for projects

231
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.450
that you have to show people or that you want to make look beautiful.

232
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:48.740
And one rule of thumb that I follow is I tend to avoid the red green combo the green blue combo and

233
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.540
the green brown combo.

234
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:57.200
If I if I remember because these are some of the common combinations of colors to avoid in your charts

235
00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.560
if possible.

236
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:07.010
So if on the slide you have trouble seeing this like w the 42 and the 71 I've uh I've got bad news for

237
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.280
you you might actually be colorblind.

238
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.450
So I hope you're not finding this out on the course but you know you're not you're you're not alone

239
00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.750
and very very famous and influential people are also colorblind.

240
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:24.890
So you know if you're creating your charts and you're presenting to the likes of Keanu Reeves or Mark

241
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.720
Zuckerberg or Bill Clinton they're gonna have difficulty differentiating between the reds and greens

242
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.260
in your chance.

243
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:37.040
So it's probably not what you want to pick and that's why I suspect it's not a coincidence that the

244
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:45.260
predominant color of Facebook is actually blue now Seabourn actually has a pretty nice choice of color

245
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:52.610
palettes that we can use in our projects and some of the default color palettes are found on this part

246
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:59.250
of their documentation if you scroll through here you'll see that these color palettes have names like

247
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:08.160
HLS or such two or paired or what have you and we can try them out in our notebook here by adding an

248
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.280
argument here to our little plot function called palette.

249
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:22.020
And if we set palette equal to say HLS and refresh ourselves we get this look right here.

250
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:31.680
If we set our palette to set capital S too then we get this look here orange and green.

251
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.920
And if we set it to see head then we get this look here.

252
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:45.730
Dark blue and light blue I actually quite liked HLS so I'm going to stick with us.

253
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:54.820
And now I'm going to add my own legend the way you do this is with Petey dot legend.

254
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.940
And there we can specify what should be inside the legend.

255
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:03.950
So I wanted to have three things I wanted to explain the decision boundary the non spam messages and

256
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.510
the spam messages.

257
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.940
So within the parentheses I'm going to add another set of parentheses and I'll add three strings right

258
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:24.320
decision boundary column single quotes non spam comma single quotes spam and after this first closing

259
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.320
parentheses I'll add a comma and I'll specify the location where I want this legend to be.

260
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.610
So LLC c is equal to lower space.

261
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.320
Right.

262
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.290
And now I'll have to specify as a font size.

263
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:47.230
So I'll go with font size is equal to 14 and I'll refresh myself.

264
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.780
Now what I get is I have the legend that I've created right here.

265
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:57.400
I have got the default legend a little bit to the right.

266
00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:06.350
So we need to remove this default legend here and we can do that simply by specifying an argument under

267
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:17.340
Ellen plot called Legend set that equal to big capital F and A S E false.

268
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.940
Don't forget the comma afterwards.

269
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.210
Otherwise you get the same error I had earlier.

270
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:30.910
And if you refresh your chart should look like this now coming back to the colors were of course not

271
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.140
limited to using the built in pallets from Siebel.

272
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.180
Let me show you how you can create your own custom palette.

273
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.980
The process is actually quite simple.

274
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:46.360
You just have to stick the hex codes that correspond to the colors that you want into a Python list

275
00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:53.930
and then feed that list into this Elm plot function as an argument now for this example.

276
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.780
I want to take some inspiration from some famous artists.

277
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:04.240
So I want to go to a website called Color list dot com and the lady behind this Web site basically took

278
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.640
a bunch of artists looked at their paintings and now the hex codes for us to use.

279
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:17.380
So I'm gonna go to r and I'm going to look for the troubled American painter by the name of Mark Rothko

280
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:24.390
and scrolling through here I can see the color palette of two of his paintings.

281
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.890
But looking what's available here I might actually change my mind.

282
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.670
I'm going to go with somebody else instead maybe see Mondrian.

283
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.580
See if she's got Mondrian.

284
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.110
There we go.

285
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.620
Mondrian.

286
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.650
This is a whole lot more promising.

287
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:46.760
Let me take the red and the blue from the Broadway boogie woogie from Mondrian.

288
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:54.790
I'll just copy this hex code here come back into my Python notebook what I'll quickly do is I'll copy

289
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.470
the cell pasted below.

290
00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:06.790
So I have my own copy and then I'll create a variable here called My of colors and I'll set that equal

291
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:13.240
to two empty square brackets with some single quotes inside and this is where I'm going to paste my

292
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:23.260
hex code for my red turn and then I'm going to come back take the maybe the light blue and I'll come

293
00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:35.290
back here and I'll put this one here as perhaps the second hex code in my list so I've got my red and

294
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:43.360
my blue and now all I have to do is change the value here of my palette argument from HLS which was

295
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:51.030
the inbuilt seaborne color palette to my underscore colors and then I'll refresh the cell.

296
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:52.760
Brilliant.

297
00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:59.980
So now we can see that the red is showing up here and the bottom triangle and the blue is showing up

298
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:08.770
here on the top triangle and you know what the thing is I reckon red actually suits spam emails better

299
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:16.990
than does Blue so I'll have to do to change which color corresponds to which category is change the

300
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.220
order in my list.

301
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:28.960
So I take my second hex code and put it as the first text code and then I can refresh myself to see

302
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.830
how we're doing now.

303
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.030
Brilliant.

304
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:38.320
So this is a lot more interesting tell me thing I'll do now is I want to zoom in a little bit on this

305
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.300
top right corner.

306
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.340
And the reason is is that there seems to be a lot of this sort of red fringing going on there seems

307
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.600
to be some crossover.

308
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.540
So this area looks very very interesting to me and I'm going to change this value here on my axis from

309
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:58.680
minus two thousand to 500 and we'll see how that looks.

310
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:06.370
Now not bad not bad at all but perhaps maybe a little bit too faint.

311
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:15.860
So when I take my alpha value we change it to say seven and I think that is a lot more clear.

312
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:26.510
We can see the red Xs in this blue area much much better now how I know that a lot of these modern artists

313
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:34.340
on exactly known for their data visualization and I don't really get modern art but I do think that

314
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:41.960
sometimes these guys do have some pretty cool color combinations and I do think we can draw some inspiration

315
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.400
from that.

316
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.210
So yeah check out color Lisa and let me know if you have any other favorite resources for your projects

317
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.040
in the comments on this video.
