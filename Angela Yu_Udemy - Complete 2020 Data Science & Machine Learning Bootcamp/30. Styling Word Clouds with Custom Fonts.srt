1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,040
To create our Word Cloud for our high messages and our spam messages.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,650
We're gonna use two different masks.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,980
I've got thumbs up for the non spam messages and I've got thumbs down for the spam messages.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,730
These are gonna be our masks for our respective word clouds.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,770
The dataset backing our word clouds will come from some of the previous work we've done so we've got

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:34,250
a flattened list of non spam words and we've got a flattened list of spam words.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,970
This is the data that we're going to feed into our word clouds.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,910
So let's tackle our ham messages first.

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:52,070
I'm going to add a markdown cell here and right word cloud of ham and spam messages.

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,610
Next I'm going to add some constants.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,790
I'm going to add the thumbs up and thumbs down files so I'll paste the relative path for the skull file

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:12,650
and just rename these two thumbs the school up file and thumbs on a scroll down file.

13
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,170
Of course the icon names have to change as well.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:28,240
So this one will call thumbs up dot Pinky thumbs up dot Pinky and this one will call thumbs hyphen down

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,700
dot PMG shift enter.

16
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,190
Scroll down.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:43,540
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to copy this code here for our will come down here and paste it in

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,380
there's a few modifications that we can make here that will save us a bit of time.

19
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,250
So first off we're gonna change the image to see thumbs up.

20
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:03,810
Then what we'll have to do is we'll have to generate the text as a string for the word cloud.

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,110
Right.

22
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,700
In this case I want store all of this text in a variable called Ham on the score as TR and that will

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:24,030
be equal to single quotes separated by a space dot join parentheses flat list.

24
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:32,930
So we've got a list of non spam words and we're not joining them all together into a single string before

25
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,990
I run this.

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:43,910
I have to do one last thing I have to change this novel as string to our ham underscore as TR variable.

27
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,120
That way I'm not generating another word cloud for Moby Dick.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,570
Instead I'm generating it for non spam emails.

29
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,560
And here's our output.

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,030
We still have the Moby Dick styling but we can change that very easily with a different colour map and

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,560
I think otherwise it looks pretty good in terms of colour map.

32
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,830
Let's go for winter and I don't know maybe a bit more granularity on the words

33
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,100
now.

34
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,660
I think this looks pretty good actually but there's probably one thing that you'll notice that might

35
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,520
bother you a little bit.

36
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,330
People for example is spelled without the E at the end.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,830
Change is spelled without the E at the end provide is spelled without the.

38
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,700
We can only guess what this would try.

39
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,990
It's supposed to be the reason for this is is that the data that we fed into our Word Cloud are the

40
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,210
stemmed words.

41
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,230
That's why we're seeing a word cloud presented like this.

42
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:58,690
Our flattened list of non spam keywords is coming from our nested list of non spam keywords which is

43
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:06,760
coming from our nested list which we've created up here when we applied our clean message.

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,400
No h Tam L. method.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,610
This is where we did this stemming if you recall.

46
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,920
If you wanted to see what this word cloud would look like without the stemmed words then you'd have

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:27,580
to copy this code pasted in use the original word and comment out.

48
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:38,250
This line right here if you refresh this cell and then go to kernel restart and run all then you'll

49
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:46,110
run all the cells in the entire notebook and after waiting a little while you can scroll down and look

50
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,210
at the output for the word cloud without the stemmed words.

51
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,300
There we go.

52
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,680
This is starting to look a lot better.

53
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,150
The stem words are going to be very very useful for our bayes classifier but they're actually not so

54
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,480
useful for our Word Cloud.

55
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,040
So if you've changed it like I did then it's important to make a mental note to change this back and

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,680
use the stemmed words before we train our model now I've got one final challenge for you on the word

57
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,510
cloud front.

58
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,500
I'd like you to pull up the word cloud documentation and figure out how to use the custom font that

59
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,910
I've included in the lesson resources instead of this default font here and then create a word cloud

60
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,430
of all the words in the spam messages.

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,440
I've included two font files.

62
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:49,520
The open sounds condensed bold font file and I've included the open sends condensed light font file.

63
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,820
If you look at this word cloud here what kind of font you think would work best with it.

64
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,650
What characteristics should a font have in order to make a word cloud look a lot more attractive because

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,880
in my humble opinion this default font here doesn't work as well as it should.

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,970
What kind of improvement on the font front would you make to this visualization.

67
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,870
I can think of two improvements right off the bat.

68
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,780
First off the words should probably be written in all caps rather than lowercase.

69
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:31,420
And second the letters of the font should probably be closer together and bold.

70
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,740
These are the first two things that I would try to make this look a lot more convincing.

71
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,180
So I hope you will give this a shot when solving the challenge.

72
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,930
Pause the video and have a go all good.

73
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,540
Here's the solution.

74
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:57,220
We've already added the relative path to the thumbs down file so we can already use it.

75
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,610
I'm going to copy this code right here.

76
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,070
And pasted in below.

77
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:13,730
I'll swap up thumbs up for thumbs down this line stays the same as this this one our string of course

78
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:22,280
will need to change so this will be the spam string and this will come from the flattened spam list

79
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,660
and when it comes to generating the cloud we will use the spam string instead of the hamstring for a

80
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,760
bit of visual differentiation.

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,780
I'M GOING TO GO WITH SOMETHING REDDISH from the color map.

82
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,220
In fact I'm going to try this just on the school heat color map that we've got here.

83
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:48,020
So instead of winter I'll go for just on the school heat and I'll keep some of the other things the

84
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,280
same.

85
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,220
Now when I said check the word cloud documentation what I wanted you to pick up on was the fact that

86
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:06,180
you could supply a font here as an argument and you can do so by giving the word cloud a font path the

87
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,680
font path is the font that will be used in the word cloud.

88
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:20,850
And this has to be a O.T. f or a TFSA file and a TEFL file is exactly what we've got going back up.

89
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:29,730
I'll add my relative path here for my font file so I'll call this one custom on a scope font on the

90
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:43,610
school file and this will be my Open Sands condensed hyphen bold dot t t f file.

91
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,900
You can try both of these and see which one looks better but I think I prefer the bold one just going

92
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:57,540
to make sure there's no typos here in this file name them hit shift enter on this scroll back down.

93
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:09,730
And now I can supply a font and a score path and set that equal to the custom font file.

94
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,660
The other thing that you might have had to have a play with is the maximum font size so getting it to

95
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,670
look the way you wanted to.

96
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,480
There is a mention of a font size parameter in the quick documentation as well despite the rather strange

97
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,190
word wrapping at the moment.

98
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:35,840
You can see it right here Max font size by default is equal to none but we can give it another value

99
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:46,160
as well so Max on a school font on a school size equals say I don't know I think 300 worked well last

100
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,130
time I looked at this Harlem hit shift enter and see what this looks like.

101
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,230
My computer is really struggling.

102
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,800
I think I've got too many things open.

103
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,380
Okay.

104
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,610
So here we go.

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
This is the result.

106
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,520
I think the font looks pretty good but I think we need to up the number of words being displayed in

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,020
this image.

108
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,110
Also we're still in lower case so let's change these two things.

109
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:21,350
Pretty radical and change the maximum number of words to two thousand from five hundred and when it

110
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:29,560
comes to generating my word cloud I'm going to convert my string to uppercase letters.

111
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:40,350
So spam on a score SDR dot a poem will convert all of my letters to uppercase now I can refresh and

112
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,410
see if we're happy with the result.

113
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,240
I think the red color definitely worked really well but with these last two changes I think the designer

114
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,400
should really come together.

115
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,960
Okay so that's interesting.

116
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,480
The largest word has randomly been given a white color.

117
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,350
This is probably not what I want someone to refresh this and see if I'm more lucky.

118
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,080
The second time round much better.

119
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,740
Brilliant.

120
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,800
So I quite like the look of this but I'd be quite curious what sort of designs you've come up with.

121
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,920
And speaking of your own designs I could question at this point is where can you find both fonts and

122
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,770
masks for your own projects for your own word clouds when it comes to fonts.

123
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:39,460
One of my favorite places to go to is Google fonts so Google fonts are free and open source and you

124
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,680
can just browse and download the font files that you like from here.

125
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,670
This is a brilliant resource when it comes to masks and icons.

126
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,890
You've got a lot of choice as well.

127
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,550
One place that you could check out is the icon set on font awesome dot com.

128
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:03,910
Here you can download various icons that you can then use as masks for your PMG files.

129
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,050
Just remember to double check the licensing on all of these image files that you're interested in using.

130
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,430
In any case font awesome allows you to filter on free icons which is quite handy.

131
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,660
So if we check out this accessible icon here then you can download this icon as an SPG file a vector

132
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,510
which you can then scale as large as you like with some image processing software.

133
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,800
Now with those tools in hand I think you're all set to create something fantastic.

134
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,520
If you do please post it in the comments section below this video.

135
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,420
I'd love to see what you've made in the next lessons.

136
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,800
We're going to generate the vocabulary and the dictionary for a base classifier it's about time I get

137
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,450
some food so I'll see in the next lesson.

138
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,510
Take care.
