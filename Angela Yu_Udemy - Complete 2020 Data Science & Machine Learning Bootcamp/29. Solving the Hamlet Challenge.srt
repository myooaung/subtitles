1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,320
Are you ready.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,130
Here's the solution.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:13,030
Going to the top of the file I'll add another constant and call this constant skull file and it's going

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,180
to point to the skull icon dot PMG

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:31,290
this one right here shift enter on the cell scroll back down and now it's time to put all of this text

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:39,180
that's in the Shakespeare hyphen Hamlet dot text file from the analytic resources into a single string

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:53,610
so call a variable Hamlet under school corpus and set that equal to a healthy K Dot corpus dot Gutenberg

8
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:04,890
dot words parentheses single quotes Shakespeare hyphen Hamlet Dot T X T the same file name as right

9
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:17,740
here the word list is going to be equal to square brackets single quotes dot join and I'll join the

10
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:31,030
word up from my loop for word in Hamlet corpus will give us our list of words and then I'll see Hamlet

11
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:44,570
as string as equal to single quotes with a space dot join word list that's our play as a string.

12
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:54,810
Now all I need to do is maybe go skull underscore icon is equal to image dot open.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,550
So here we're using pillow feet in the relative path to the file and now it's time to create that mask.

14
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:15,730
So I'll say image on the school mask is equal to a new pillow image object with mode equal to our GDP

15
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:33,640
the size equal to the skull icon dot size and color equal to white 2 5 5 comma 2 5 5 comma 2 5 5 inside

16
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:44,830
a tuple the RG B array for this skull image will simply be a num pi array created from the image mask

17
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:56,310
now we can create our word cloud word on a school cloud it's gonna be equal to word cloud parentheses

18
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:10,310
mask equal to the RG B array from Hamlet I'm going to choose my background color as white and then I'm

19
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:18,560
going to pick a color map the color map that I'm going to go for for my skull image is gonna be called

20
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:30,080
bone I figure that's gonna be a nice combination and for the maximum words max underscored Wood's argument.

21
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm going to pick in I'll start out with 50 and then I'm going to up it just so you can see how a higher

22
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:51,090
number will actually look a lot better then I'll use word cloud to generate to generate my image but

23
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,920
of course I have to feed in which string I want to use.

24
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,290
So Hamlet a string.

25
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,910
That's it for the word cloud.

26
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,050
Now it's all gonna be mad.

27
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,230
Plot lib peal T dot figure sets the size of our figure.

28
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm gonna go again with 16 and 8.

29
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,610
Think that's a good science for me and for the video I'll use the I am show method feed in the word

30
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:26,130
cloud along with an interpolation of by linear by linear.

31
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,700
So I think that's spelled right.

32
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,830
Good.

33
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,310
I'll remove the axes so axis parentheses

34
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,650
and then I'll show my chart.

35
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,930
The moment of truth of course is hitting shift enter on this.

36
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,970
Let's see what it looks like

37
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,010
all right.

38
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,740
So I've got a value era canvas size is too small.

39
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,180
Any idea what went wrong.

40
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,540
The reason is I've got an entirely white canvas.

41
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,740
The RG B array is fully white.

42
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:14,440
There is no place for the word cloud to draw anything and that's because I haven't called.

43
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,460
Image mask dot paste with the skull icon.

44
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,780
So I need to write image on a scroll mask.

45
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:33,550
Dot paste parentheses skull icon comma box equals skull icon and if I refresh myself now then this error

46
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,390
should disappear.

47
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:46,090
So here's my image and nobody in the world will be able to tell that this is indeed a skull image.

48
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,050
The culprit this time is the maximum number of words this number here is too small.

49
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,690
It doesn't actually help us see any of the detail in the image.

50
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,070
So I'm gonna change it from 50 to 600 and refresh myself.

51
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,830
For this many words your computer might actually run for a little while because it's doing a lot of

52
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,690
work to generate this image but I think the wait was worth it.

53
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,410
We've got a beautiful word cloud here with a fantastic color scheme and a lot of the details in the

54
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,600
word cloud being made visible by the high number of words in the word cloud.

55
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,770
Now that we're done with you to practice word clouds and using the analytic resources it's time to create

56
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,820
a word cloud.

57
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:44,390
Far ham and our spam messages those we will create from our dataset and I'll see you in the next lesson.

58
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,940
Take care.
