1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,040
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,860
Welcome to the last lesson of this module.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,550
In this lesson we're going to publish your Web site and deploy the machine learning model to the real

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,860
world.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,570
We've done a lot of hard work and we've come a long way.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,810
We've saved our tens or flow model from Jupiter notebook we've converted our tensor flow model to a

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,860
tensor flow J.S. then we styled and built our Web site and then we've pre processed our data from the

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,610
drawing canvas.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,680
After that we made predictions using our train model based on what was drawn on the canvas.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,780
And now we're on the final step publishing our Web site and putting it out there into the real world.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,470
At the moment our Web site is still running on our local host.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:56,030
So nobody other than us can actually access it for somebody other than us to actually see our hard work.

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,720
We need to host our Web site on somebody else's computer.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,990
And that means hosting our Web site somewhere other than our local machine but hosting a Web site usually

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,430
costs money.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,120
But lucky for us there are a handful of services that provide hosting for free.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,360
One of these services that provides free hosting is.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,650
Get up get up.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,000
Pages in particular.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,860
All we need to do is create a github account and upload our project files.

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,220
So what will our workflow look like.

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,680
It's gonna be a three step process.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,250
Step one will be creating a repository.

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,580
Step two will be uploading our project files.

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,860
And step three will be to change the settings on our repository to publish our Web site.

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,590
And that's it at this point.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,640
I will assume that you've already gone ahead and created your free account with GetUp GitHub if not

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,160
pause this video and sign up right now.

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,650
Once you've created your GitHub account you can create new repositories.

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,570
So just click on this plus sign and click new repository.

31
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,040
What's the repository.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,580
Think of a repository as just a folder on GitHub computers.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,070
This repository that you're creating right now is where the project files are going to go.

34
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:28,920
So let's give our repository a name maybe call it your first name hyphen math hyphen garden so this

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,370
name will show up in the your realm that you're going to get.

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,730
So choose wisely.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,460
Next let's take a look at these options here.

38
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,700
Leave it as public but then tick initialize this repository with a read me.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,020
Just take this little box here and then click Create repository.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,160
Now we're ready to upload our project files and this couldn't be easier.

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,700
You can just click on this button here which says upload files and then you just drag and drop your

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,600
files over from your computer.

43
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,390
So bring up your windows explorer or your Mac finder.

44
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,930
And then just select all the files and folders in your project folder.

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:23,130
So this is going to be our index HDMI all your math thought J.S. all the files and then simply drag

46
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,870
them over on to get up to Web site and then you should see it upload and when it's done that will progress

47
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,400
Marshall disappear.

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,850
So that puts us in a position to actually save our changes.

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,940
Saving and updating files on github is a little bit more involved than usual because github is actually

50
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,460
tracking all of these files with the files being tracked every time we save our changes.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,020
We're essentially creating a checkpoint.

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,910
And that means in future we can go back and forth between all of these different checkpoints.

53
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,860
In other words we can go back and forth between different versions of our project.

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,460
So every time we save our changes we commit our changes and we create a checkpoint.

55
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:17,160
That's why it's a great idea to add a little descriptive message here say adding initial project files

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,010
that way we can take a look at these messages if we ever need to go back to the safe point on the radio

57
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:34,130
button below leave committed directly to a master branch ticked and then click commit changes after

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,030
a few seconds you should see that GetUp has finished processing the files and we can go and change the

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,530
settings to actually publish our Web site once all your files are processed.

60
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,360
You should see a page like this.

61
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,690
So now we can go to the settings of this repository of him and then we can scroll down to where it says

62
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,350
getup.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,510
Pages.

64
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,040
This is the toggle where we go and publish our Web site.

65
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,970
So at the moment him we have get a pages is currently disabled in order to publish our Web site.

66
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,940
All we need to do is click here where it currently says none and then select master branch at this point.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,930
The website will update and appear ill say Get up.

68
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:28,730
Pages source saved and scrolling down what you should now see is a message here that says your site

69
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,940
is ready to be published at.

70
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,730
And then here is your getup username.

71
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,810
And then here's your repository name.

72
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,450
Now publishing a Web site with GitHub pages can take a little while.

73
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,490
So you might just grab a coffee and come back in a few minutes.

74
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,360
But after a few minutes what you should be able to do is you should be able to click on this link and

75
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,210
your Web site will actually load at this point.

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,310
It's been published successfully.

77
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,580
And when you refresh this page here with the settings and you scroll down then instead of having that

78
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,660
blue message here you should now see this little tick mark.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,500
And then you should see your Web site is published and then your your URL right here.

80
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,470
Now if you don't like having this your RL here and you want a custom your URL then you can actually

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,840
add a custom domain name right here.

82
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,310
However this is not a free service.

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,330
This is something you'd have to pay for.

84
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:34,040
So you'd have to separately go to a domain registrar like GoDaddy or name cheap and actually buy a domain

85
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,170
from them.

86
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,400
And once you've bought the domain from this other company then you can actually enter that here and

87
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,980
you can change the URL of your project and that's all there is to it.

88
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,780
So well done on completing this module.

89
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:57,200
I know it was quite a challenging module with a lot of moving parts but now you know how you can deploy

90
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,430
a machine learning model and make it do real work in the real world.

91
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,120
I would actually love to see your work by the way.

92
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,380
So if you've completed this project and you've created your GitHub repository and you've published it

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,050
then go ahead and share a link in the comments section below this lesson.

94
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,140
Until next time I'll see you on the next module.

95
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,680
Take care.
