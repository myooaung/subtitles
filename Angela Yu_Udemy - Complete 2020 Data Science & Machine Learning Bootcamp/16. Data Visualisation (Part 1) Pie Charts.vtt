00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.350
All right so in the upcoming lessons on and talk a little bit more about data visualization in particular

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.040
I'm going to show you guys how to create some beautiful pie charts.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.690
And afterwards I wanna show you how to create a variation on the pie chart called the doughnut chart.

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.350
Now both of these types of charts are very very common especially in business reports.

5
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.830
So it's very important that we also get these two charts under our belt.

6
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:37.250
The first thing I'll do of course is add another markdown cell and I'll call this number of spam messages

7
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.340
visualized and parentheses.

8
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
Pie charts there you go.

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.350
Now before we dive into the visualizations we should probably check how many spam how many non spam

10
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.720
messages there are for this are data frames.

11
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.810
Value counts method it's going to be very very handy.

12
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:08.710
So if we take our data frame and select the category column we can use value on a score counts and then

13
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.140
parentheses to get a breakdown of how many messages of each category we've got.

14
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.100
Here we can see that we've got three thousand nine hundred non spam or ham messages and we've got one

15
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.680
thousand eight hundred and 96 spam messages.

16
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.550
Now since we're gonna be using these numbers later on let's store them in some variables.

17
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.580
So I'll see amount on a score of on a school.

18
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.310
Spam is equal to data.

19
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.890
Category value counts.

20
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770
Square brackets 1.

21
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:52.620
And the amount of harm is gonna be equal to the same thing except it's going to be followed by square

22
00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:02.100
brackets zero zero because of access the first value in this series and one to access the second value

23
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.310
in this series.

24
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.970
How do our visualization.

25
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.180
We're gonna be using our old friend not plot lib.

26
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.250
So let's import Matt plot libs pi plot functionality as P L T at the top of our notebook going to our

27
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.770
notebook imports we'll say import

28
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.940
map plot lib dot pie plot as P L T.

29
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.430
Now as usual we're also gonna be adding.

30
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.210
Percent I plot lib in line.

31
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.010
This line of code here is Jupiter notebook specific.

32
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.540
And it allows us to export our images for our chance when we export the notebook.

33
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.310
So if you ever go to Download Download notebook as notebook then if you have this line of code in here

34
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.530
then you get the graphics as well.

35
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.890
All right.

36
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.730
So how do you create one of these friendly pie charts.

37
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.160
The first thing I'll do is I'll create a list of our category names so category underscore names.

38
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.950
It's gonna be equal to a list with the square brackets.

39
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:27.340
Single quotes spam comma single quotes the git male single quotes and the next thing I'll do is create

40
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.480
another list.

41
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm going to call this one sizes for the size of the different pieces of the pie.

42
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:45.180
This is going to hold on to the amount of spam and it's going to hold on to the amount of ham.

43
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:57.450
Now we can use these two to generate our chart BLT dot pie parentheses sizes comma and then the labels

44
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:08.660
of the chart are gonna be equal to the category names with tweet out show we can see what our basic

45
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.020
very very basic pie chart is going to look like now.

46
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.060
I don't recall if I actually pressed shift into a minute earlier on my notebook cell but let me hit

47
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.510
shift enter now and we'll quickly find out.

48
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.490
Nope get my name era PDT t is not defined.

49
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.140
This means that we have to go back up.

50
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.090
Or I do at least I had shift into on my imports.

51
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.300
There we go.

52
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:41.940
Now I can come down here and actually generate my pie chart and it looks like it is pretty ugly actually.

53
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.090
So we're gonna have to customize this and make it look presentable.

54
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.530
Dress it up.

55
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.810
The first thing I to do is actually make those font sizes on this thing look a bit larger so I can access

56
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.360
the font sizes of my labels here with the property called text props.

57
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.100
Text props is equal to and then curly braces.

58
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.540
Single quotes font size colon say I don't know maybe six.

59
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.340
See what happens.

60
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.210
OK they get even smaller.

61
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.210
Maybe not what I want.

62
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.200
Maybe I'll pick 16.

63
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.520
There we go.

64
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.160
That's a bit better but this whole thing is still very very unconvincing.

65
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.360
For starters I can see that it's not very very sharp on my screen.

66
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.110
So what I can do in this case is manipulate the figure itself so peeled.

67
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.760
He thought figure parentheses fixed size equal to.

68
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.220
I don't know say a two comma two right.

69
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.540
Changing the figure size.

70
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.840
See what this looks like.

71
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.740
It gets a lot smaller but this isn't the only thing I can change on the finger size.

72
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:05.270
If I wanted to make this whole thing look tack sharp on my screen then I can actually sent the density

73
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.960
of the pixels per inch or DP to whatever my monitor supports.

74
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.250
So I've got a pretty decent monitor that I'm working with him.

75
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:22.480
It has quite a high resolution so it actually supports two hundred and twenty seven pixels per inch.

76
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.030
And this will have an interesting effect so if a press shift enter now you can see that the whole thing

77
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.780
starts looking first of all a lot larger because it's scaled up and second of all the edges start looking

78
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.980
a bit more clear.

79
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.980
Only thing is my font size is probably a bit too large now so if I go back to font size say 6.

80
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.210
Then it starts looking a bit better like this.

81
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.920
Now when you're working on this project have a play with the different figure sizes the DP values and

82
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.910
the font size and see how it affects your scaling.

83
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.080
You're probably gonna have to use a bit of trial and error to get this thing looking good or looking

84
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.640
the way you wanted to on your monitor.

85
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.540
If you ever want to export this thing and save it to put it into a reporter what have you.

86
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:20.070
It's probably better to create a larger version of this figure and then just right click and save the

87
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:26.670
image as a larger image because then if you ever need to include it into a report or into a Word document

88
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:33.540
or whatever you're using then you can downscale it and look a lot better than taking a small image and

89
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.350
scaling it up.

90
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.980
Now let me pull up the quick documentation on the Pi functionality from that plot lib.

91
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.910
We can actually see that there's quite a few different parameters that we can set.

92
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.320
Let me show you two of them.

93
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:56.730
I want to show you the start angle which is currently set to none and I want to show you this auto percent

94
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.450
parameter that we've got here and how to use it.

95
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.500
Let's have a play with the start angle first.

96
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.370
So if I set the start angle to zero let's see what we have.

97
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:16.110
We can see that the chart looks like so then we can see that this blue portion just rotated by 10 degrees

98
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.380
from this position.

99
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:28.380
You can see this rotation actually very clearly if I start going to 20 30 40 50 and so on the blue piece

100
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.390
starts rotating counterclockwise from the x axis.

101
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.470
So from a straight line that goes from the center out to here.

102
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:49.380
If I set the start angle to 90 then our chart rotates by exactly one fourth of the way around counterclockwise.

103
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.790
All right.

104
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.560
So that's the start angle.

105
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.840
Now let's have a look at the other property that I wanted to show you.

106
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.300
Auto percent.

107
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:09.650
And we're gonna set that equal to single quotes percent sign one point one f percent sign a sensor and

108
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:19.220
what we get now is we get a pie chart where that percent of the chart is displayed on the chart itself.

109
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.070
The formatting is to one decimal point because we've put one point one here.

110
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:31.250
If instead I had one point two F then it would show me two decimal points.

111
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.890
So depending on the amount of precision that you want on your pie chart you can choose the formatting

112
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.150
of the percent sign as appropriate.

113
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:40.740
How.

114
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.880
Personally I don't like showing too many digits after the decimal point in most use cases.

115
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.990
You usually want to favor readability over precision when it comes to these visualizations anyhow.

116
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.930
If we wanted to round this to the nearest percentage we can put a zero here and then we'll get 33 and

117
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.810
sixty seven.

118
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.250
Now I find this chart here.

119
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.370
Size wise and formatting wise it's starting to look pretty decent.

120
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.050
The only thing that I don't like.

121
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.410
These are pretty awful colors that it's showing me here by default.

122
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:18.220
So let's let's change this and try to improve the design a little bit.

123
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.760
Just so we have a record of our old chart.

124
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.340
I'm going to copy this cell and I'm going to paste it below.

125
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:32.000
Now I've got two different pie charts and I'm going to spice up the design on this one and leave the

126
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.580
other one as it is.

127
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:40.330
One of my go to places for picking a nice palette is a website called Flat UI colors.

128
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.170
Let's check out this American palette here that they've got the first color that I'm gonna grab is gonna

129
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:57.230
be maybe pink glamour means I can go back here into my Jupiter notebook and save my colors as a list.

130
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:06.890
When I call it a custom on a school colors square brackets single quotes paste this is gonna be my first

131
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:13.880
color color back to the American palette and I'm going to select the color that goes well with this

132
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.970
other category.

133
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.320
So I think something that would be contrasting would be this blue one hit.

134
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.660
So I'm gonna take this one go back here.

135
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:32.860
Add that as well having added my colors hex codes to a list I can now feed them in as an argument to

136
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.420
my PI method.

137
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:47.980
So colors equals custom colors and shift into will color in my pie chart and a much more beautiful way

138
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:57.400
and I've picked some light colors so that the dark text is 33 and 67 percent is still very very readable.

139
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.340
Now one thing you can also do to make the design a little bit snappier is to break out the spam section

140
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:10.990
here from the legitimate e-mail section so we can actually have a little bit of a gap in between the

141
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:21.240
two sections and we can do this by supplying an argument here called explode so explode is equal to

142
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.150
and then we also supply a list.

143
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:31.800
This list will have two values say zero and zero point one.

144
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.300
These numerical values here set the size of the gap.

145
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:44.230
So let me press shift enter and show you what this would look like so passing in an argument of zero

146
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.150
and zero point one will get the chart looking like this.

147
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:55.190
If we had zero point five instead then the gap would start looking a lot bigger.

148
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:02.860
So I set this back to zero point one and I can also medal with the first one here so zero point five

149
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:09.760
instead of zero and we get again something like this the offset that we're applying here.

150
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:18.220
If we go to the quick documentation essentially specifies the fraction of the radius with which to offset

151
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:27.380
each wedge since we have two wedges the red one and the blue one we're supplying two numbers so in my

152
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.250
case I'm offsetting one of them by zero point one.

153
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:38.560
If I offset both of them by zero point one then the gap between the two wedges doubles.

154
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.840
Now I quite like the look of a small offset zero point one will do for me.

155
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:51.280
In the next lesson I'll show you how to take these designs a little further and make a donut chart I'll

156
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.140
see you there.
