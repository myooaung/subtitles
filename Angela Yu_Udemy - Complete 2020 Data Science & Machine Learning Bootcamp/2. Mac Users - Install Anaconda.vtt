00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.390
Okay so it's time to set up your computer and install the necessary software for this course.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.900
In this lesson I will show you how to install Python and configure your local environment so that way

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.210
we don't have to rely on the trial environment on Jupiter dot org.

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.950
I will show you how to install Python Anaconda on Mac OS.

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.660
If you're running a Windows machine check out the other set of video instead.

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.520
But before we begin let me explain what Python Anaconda is and why we're downloading it.

7
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.320
Anaconda is a python distribution.

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.130
And this means that Anaconda aims to provide everything you need for data science in one place.

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.340
It's essentially a bundle of software and code that makes it easy for getting set up for Data Science

10
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.070
and machine learning.

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.840
For example the anaconda bundle already includes the Jupiter notebook so you don't have to separately

12
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.780
download it and install it and it also includes tons and tons of Python packages and libraries that

13
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.030
we'll be using in this course.

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.070
What do I mean by libraries.

15
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.640
Well remember how we wrote import pandas or import Mac plot lib or import I learn in our first project.

16
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.020
Usually you'd have to download all these packages one by one before you can use them in your project.

17
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.760
But by downloading Anaconda we're going to be getting all these packages in one go that way we don't

18
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.210
have to worry about setup and configuration.

19
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.930
Later on in the course one word of warning though.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.160
If you Google the word Anaconda you're probably not gonna get what you're looking for.

21
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.630
You'll want to search Anaconda Python to find the Continuum dot Io Web site or alternatively click on

22
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.170
the link in the lessons resources to be directed directly to the download page.

23
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.670
The thing about Python is it also comes in two flavors.

24
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.610
We're going to go with the newer version of Python.

25
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.630
Python 3 so while anacondas downloading this is a good time to go for a coffee or tea after the download

26
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.990
completes you can start the installation.

27
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.300
We're going to be presented with one of those standards set up wizards so we're gonna click next.

28
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.370
Then when I agreed to the license agreement for probably signing away our first born child at this point.

29
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.200
But on the next parts of the Wizard I'm just gonna go with the recommended options so I'm gonna seat

30
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.850
install for just myself.

31
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.150
And for the destination folder I'm also going to stick with the default power my computer actually isn't

32
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.310
as fast as it appears to be because I'm speeding up the video here but this installation process actually

33
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.660
takes a little while too.

34
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.610
So just be patient and after the installer finishes I'm just gonna click close and move to trash and

35
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.150
that's it.

36
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.350
Now it's time to fire up Anaconda and the Jupiter notebook just to see if everything's working click

37
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.770
on the little magnifying glass in the top right corner to bring up the spotlights search.

38
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.850
Alternatively you can use the command space keyboard shortcut to bring up the same thing then type terminal

39
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.780
and hit enter.

40
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.060
Now your terminal might be styled a little differently from mine.

41
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.340
I've made my text a little bigger and I've used the the black background so that's something you can

42
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.410
set under the preferences so if it's the first time you're using terminal you probably have it set to

43
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.680
the basic theme instead of hombre which is what I've got but hopefully that will make it a little bit

44
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:50.300
easier to read what I'm about to type and in this window type Python space dash dash version and here

45
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.240
you should see the version of Python that you've installed as well as the version of Anaconda and as

46
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.470
we've mentioned before.

47
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.060
Make sure the version of Python is three point six or higher next.

48
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.530
Let me show you how to start up your own Jupiter notebook.

49
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.710
You can do that by simply typing.

50
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.290
Jupiter

51
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.120
space notebook and hit enter.

52
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.470
Now give it a minute.

53
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.440
You should see Jupiter firing up in your browser.

54
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.610
Showing you the folder structure in your home directory.

55
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.480
And when you click on new you should be able to start a new Python 3 notebook so congratulations on

56
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.910
getting that working but starting up is only part of the equation.

57
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.190
Also have to be able to shut this down properly and to shut down open notebook go to a file close and

58
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.460
halt and you can log out and close your browser window.

59
00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.680
But the important part is terminating the Jupiter notebook from the terminal and you can do this with

60
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.510
a keyboard shortcut.

61
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.470
You can see here in the instructions it says use control C to stop the server and shut down all kernels

62
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:18.560
twice to skip confirmation so on your keyboard press controls see twice you should then see the messages

63
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.620
shutting down kernels and that's how you close out of Jupiter completely.

64
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.890
Finally let me show you all the components that were installed alongside with Anaconda and to do that.

65
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.720
Let me show you the anaconda Navigator.

66
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.030
So go to your launcher and find the anaconda navigator.

67
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.950
Alternatively search for Anaconda navigator in your spotlight after it finishes loading.

68
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.140
You should see a window like this from here.

69
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.110
We can launch the Jupiter notebook or the spider Python I.D. or even our studio.

70
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.560
All right.

71
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.050
So congratulations on getting set up.

72
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.560
If you have any problems or had any issues ask in the Q and A section for this lesson.

73
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.080
I'll see you in the next videos.
