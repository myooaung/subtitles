00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.720
Now suppose we want to find the value of x that minimizes the cost that minimizes F of X it's on the

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.130
graph.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.040
We can really see that that point would be around here.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.640
But let's think about this problem a bit more deeply.

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.980
Right.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.870
So if X was equal to two if we were here on the graph then the cost would be decreasing a lot as we're

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.500
moving down.

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.230
But when X is equal to 1 then that costs still decreasing.

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.830
But by not as much because the line just isn't as steep.

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.880
Right.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.690
And by the same token when X is equal to zero.

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.420
That line is like flattening out even more.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.280
So at this point the cost is only decreasing very very slightly.

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.560
Then we'd reach our minimum and then the cost starts increasing again.

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.680
Right as we move up the curve.

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.610
So in other words the slope or the steepness of this function.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.580
Yeah it's telling us when we've reached our minimum cost because that slope is the rate of change.

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.750
And when this slope stops changing.

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.820
Well on this graph we know that the cost is equal to the lowest value.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.200
In other words the slope of this function is kind of equal to zero at the point where the cost is the

21
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.180
lowest.

22
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.150
Now you may or may not remember from school how to find the slope of a function.

23
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.600
Depends how long it's been right.

24
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.650
But as a reminder the slope of the function is given by that functions derivative.

25
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.640
So let's add this section heading down on the next cell.

26
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:50.220
I'm going to go to cell cell type mark down put two hash tags there and then write slope and derivatives

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.820
because this is what this lesson is gonna be about power as a challenge.

28
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.340
Can you create a python function for the derivative of F of X and call that function D F affects.

29
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.470
When I scrolled back up for a second here.

30
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.830
So remember F of X was equal to X squared plus X plus 1.

31
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.460
I'll give you a few seconds to figure this out.

32
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.590
All right so here's the solution.

33
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.770
Yeah if you were scratching your head at this point because your calculus is a little bit Rusty let

34
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.360
me show you what the solution is and also how we arrived at it.

35
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.040
So I wanted to find a function with the death keyword then going to call it D F and have one input name

36
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:47.500
the X colon New Line return 2 times x plus 1 and that's it.

37
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.730
So how did I arrive at this.

38
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.360
How did I know it was gonna be 2 x plus 1 so the answers I used calculus now calculus and derivatives

39
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.800
are a pretty big topic but there's a couple of mathematical tricks or shortcuts that we can use to calculate

40
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.730
derivatives very very quickly and one of these tricks is called the power rule and that we'll be applying

41
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.290
it in several of the upcoming examples.

42
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.940
So here's a very quick reminder on how it works if you have a function x to the power of and then the

43
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.910
derivative of this function is n times X to the power of minus one.

44
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.160
So that's a pretty simple rule right.

45
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.400
Easy easy to remember but before we move on let me give you a couple of quick examples.

46
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:47.380
So so we have a cost function that is X to the power of five and we want to calculate this cost functions

47
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.670
derivative.

48
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.930
If we apply the power rule then we simply get five times x to the power of five minus one which is five

49
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.770
times x to the power of four.

50
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.610
And that's all there is to it.

51
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.320
That's the function of the derivative.

52
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.300
And here's another very very quick example we can apply the power rule to this function as well.

53
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.390
X cubed plus 5 times X squared plus 7.

54
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.130
So I'm going to go through these terms one by one X cubed is pretty easy right.

55
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.060
Because X cube will simply be three times x to the power of three minus one and then for that second

56
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.530
term five x squared the five stays where it is and we have two times X to the power of two minus one.

57
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.050
And then that's 7 right that 7 just disappears.

58
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.980
That's 7 just drops because 7 is a constant.

59
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:46.180
It doesn't depend on X constant don't change and since a derivative is all about the rate of change

60
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.830
the constant drops out.

61
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.910
It's equal to zero.

62
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.100
So the 7 disappears.

63
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.610
So what we end up with is three times x.

64
00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.800
The power of two plus five times two times X right 10 X and that's it.

65
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.040
Right.

66
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.220
That's the power rule for derivatives in a nutshell so back in Jupiter notebook.

67
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.590
So we want a graph our derivative function that we've just worked out here.

68
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.450
We've worked hard to created.

69
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.560
So let's visualize it side by side with our original cost function.

70
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:29.200
So what we want is we want to chance side by side and to do that we're going to have to use the so-called

71
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.680
subplot functionality from Mad plot lib.

72
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.910
So I'm gonna show you the subplot functionality and I'm also gonna show you how to size the two charts.

73
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.420
So this is something new.

74
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.400
This is something we haven't done before but since a lot of the code will be very very similar to what

75
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:53.470
we've had up here I'm just gonna very very quickly go to edit copy cell and then go down here.

76
00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:03.150
And I'm going to go to edit paste sell above so I can reuse some of this code that we've got here and

77
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.810
I change my comment here and I say plot function and derivative side by side.

78
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.960
So this is what we're gonna do here and uh in order to size our plot.

79
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.340
Yeah.

80
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.100
In order to size it we're gonna have to set the figure size of our plot.

81
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:33.810
So we're gonna write T dot figure parentheses and then we're gonna say fig size is equal to.

82
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.450
And then we have to give it a width and height.

83
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:46.570
So let's see what happens if I put in I don't know 10 comma five in the square brackets and he'd shift

84
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:54.150
enter so you can see now that the width is 10 and the height is five.

85
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.530
I looked at the documentation for this and this is actually measured in inches of all things.

86
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560
I don't really know.

87
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.850
Oh I don't really know why that is but I hope it makes our American friends happy.

88
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:14.890
How I'm going to modify this code a little bit more so in order to have two plots side by side we're

89
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:23.740
gonna have to use this subplot functionality from that plot led so many a specialty sub plot and then

90
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.710
I have to specify three numbers in a row a column and an index.

91
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.490
So in this case I'm going to have two plots side by side.

92
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.970
So they're going to be in the same row.

93
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.820
So one row can be two columns.

94
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:46.250
And the first plots this cost function here is gonna be at index 1 is gonna be my first plot and now

95
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.930
it's time to add our second plots.

96
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.600
I'm going to say PDT dot subplot.

97
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:57.290
And for the second plot it's gonna be still in the same row row number one still two columns but this

98
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.330
one is gonna be at index 2.

99
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.270
So this is gonna be my second plot.

100
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.950
Now I have not it yet when I do that.

101
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:10.210
Now to graph our derivative when right peel to eat out plot and we're going to feed in our Excel score

102
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.090
one values and then we're gonna call our function.

103
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.350
Right.

104
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:23.290
So the first one was f of x 1 and this one is gonna be D F of X on a school one let's see what happens.

105
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.410
Now a press shift enter.

106
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.160
Huh.

107
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.620
So I've got two plots.

108
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:34.530
Now you see this two plots side by side and they're still occupying the same space as before right.

109
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.320
The overall figure is still 10 by five.

110
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:46.170
So we can see here the figure size hasn't changed but now it's split with two plots two subplots taking

111
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.760
up that same space.

112
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.400
So I can probably make use of this space here on the right a little bit better by maybe making this

113
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.910
15 by 5.

114
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.860
I think that should be about right.

115
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.690
Press shift enter.

116
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.180
I get it like this.

117
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.480
Very nice.

118
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:06.780
How what I'm going to do is add a few labels and style these graphs a little bit better so that if you

119
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.550
ever coming back to this notebook in the future you can make sense of this chance very quickly and very

120
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.070
easily.

121
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.160
So someone insert two comments first right.

122
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:23.880
So this is the first chart and this is the cost function and down here is the second chart

123
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.760
of the derivative

124
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:41.760
for the first chart Let's explicitly state that it should be blue and that it should have a line width

125
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:55.710
of maybe three and four our second chance we're gonna give it the color sky blue and a line width of

126
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.640
five

127
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.450
How does that look.

128
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.300
Pretty good.

129
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:10.130
Now let's add some title and X labels and Y labels to that second chart as well.

130
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:19.350
So I'm just gonna copy this code here and added here but instead of having it say cost function I'm

131
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:27.890
going to say slope of the cost function and on the X is still X but on the Y it's gonna be DFA effects

132
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:37.590
and then I'm also gonna set the axes so again and when I copy X lemon while limb and add this down here

133
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:49.150
but I'm gonna have it go from maybe minus two to three and from on the Y from C three to six.

134
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.530
Oh sorry minus 3 to 6.

135
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.970
Slight shift to see what it looks like.

136
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.300
So this is quite good.

137
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.070
This is very very nice and clear but there's one small improvement that I'd really like to make.

138
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.560
We're interested primarily in where this minimum is here and one of the things that be quite nice to

139
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:19.060
see on this chart is where our slope our sky blue line here actually intersects the axis here.

140
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.150
So what we can do is we can style our chart to have a grid.

141
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:33.460
This is fairly easy to do so for our second chart for our derivative all we have to do is add PDT dot

142
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.220
grid and then two parentheses for the method name.

143
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.690
No need to add any arguments here.

144
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:51.220
It shift enter and then you can see map plot lib applies a grid automatically to this subplot and now

145
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:59.560
it's very very nice to see that ha intersection of the slope of the derivative it's gonna be probably

146
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:07.650
somewhere at the midpoint between minus 1 and 0 so that's gonna be around here somewhere.

147
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.380
That seems about right.

148
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.490
So as a quick summary we've covered a three new things for styling graphs and charts.

149
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.890
One of them is this idea of sizing them.

150
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:26.590
The second thing is this idea of having plots side by side and that requires the subplot function which

151
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.800
needs to know how many rows how many columns and what the index is.

152
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:41.160
And then also we've used the grid function for the first time to superimpose a grid on to the plot.

153
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:50.820
Now as a challenge can you instead of having these plots side by side stack them from top to bottom.

154
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.830
What would you have to change in the python code in order to achieve this in order to arrange the plots

155
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.800
in a different way.

156
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:04.980
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and try it out to dissolve it.

157
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.180
Did you manage to get it.

158
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.830
Here's the solution.

159
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.740
The key on arranging the charts is gonna be where are subplots are right.

160
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:22.050
So if you want to have them top to bottom then you'd have to have two rows and one column and I'd have

161
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.750
to change this for both subplots.

162
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:32.070
So for the first chart and for the second chart I'm going to have to go 2 and 1 instead of 1 and 2 if

163
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:40.020
I press shift enter now we can see our charts arrange themselves from top to bottom but one of the reasons

164
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:48.540
why they look terrible like this is because we've constrained our figure size to be still using the

165
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.950
same dimensions 15 by 5 right.

166
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.430
So it's stretching out the charts across the whole space that it's allotted.

167
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.710
And that's why they look like this.

168
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:08.570
But if we changed our figure size with some new constraints say 5 and 15 right then pressing shift enter

169
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.180
will give us the chance like this.

170
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.960
In this case they're more tall than wide.

171
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:23.780
Now I quite like the original setup so I'm going to change this back to 15 and 5 and I'm going to go

172
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:32.300
with one row two columns for my subplots one row and two columns for both of them.

173
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.700
So this is how I would prefer to look at these two charts.

174
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:44.420
But yeah if you figure this out super handy for being able to arrange the charts in your Jupiter notebook.

175
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.150
Ha right.

176
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.200
So I hope you're ready for the next lesson.

177
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.780
House.

178
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.600
Here there.

179
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.120
Take care.
