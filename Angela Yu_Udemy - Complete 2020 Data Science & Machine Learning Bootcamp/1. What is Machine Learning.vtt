00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.650
All right.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.730
Let's get started by tackling a big topic.

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.770
What exactly is machine learning.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.430
And why is it important every day when you open the newspaper or your favorite blog.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.910
You see this word everywhere.

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.630
Machine learning machine learning machine learning but nobody really explained to me what exactly is

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.590
the significance of this thing and why we should all care the first time I really understood this.

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.890
It was huge.

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.900
And I'm going to try and explain it right here in less than five minutes.

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.140
OK let's start the clock to start.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.310
We have to look back at the history of the computer the development of the computer started with one

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.710
human urge.

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.360
It's not a desire for understanding the universe.

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.490
It's not from wanting to further the frontiers of science and it's not even because we wanted to organize

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.120
the world's information.

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.350
Computers exist because some guy let's call him Bob decided did he want to spend more time chilling

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.850
at home rather than working hard.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.380
The fundamental urge that tries any programmer is laziness.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.000
And we invented various forms of computing so that we can work less and spend more time watching Netflix.

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.490
The first thing that could be considered remotely close to a computer was the abacus now ignoring the

21
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.190
racy picture the abacus is useful because it helped us calculate and keep track of the steps in our

22
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.110
calculations.

23
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.760
But this still required us to know the times tables and we programmers were too lazy for that.

24
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.730
So we built a calculator.

25
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.160
Well there are quite a few steps in between some code breaking and a lot of movie fodder but essentially

26
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.300
we are here.

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.100
We figured out transistors and we could use them to perform logical tasks.

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.220
So we now had something that could be vaguely program just replace the Apple logo with Texas Instruments.

29
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.390
And you're basically looking at the hype around the calculator.

30
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.010
But we obviously wanted to be even lazier and that required our computers to do more.

31
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.320
So we invented programming languages.

32
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.160
We got rid of ticker tapes and started using CRT screens.

33
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.060
We were able to use a vaguely human readable language like Fortran or COBOL and converted into ones

34
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.560
and zeros that the computer could understand our programs could now be executed by the computer.

35
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.160
One line at a time if we told it to go left it wouldn't dare to go right.

36
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.440
We specified the conditions and based on those conditions the computer checked to see what it should

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.660
do.

38
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.550
So now we can play games send email and use Excel instead of an abacus.

39
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.230
But what if we could get the computer to do even more of our work work that we previously thought could

40
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.820
only be done by humans like buying gifts for your husband or your wife.

41
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.500
Okay just kidding.

42
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.510
We're not quite there yet but what about things like identifying the unripe fruit from our farm.

43
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.380
What would you tell the computer what would your program look like if object color is red then keep

44
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.200
it.

45
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.990
What if next week it's Chili harvesting time and you only want to keep the green ones.

46
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.750
Well I guess you'd have to rewrite your code.

47
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.590
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually teach the computer what a tomato is.

48
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.580
Maybe we could refine our program if something is round red and around 100 grams.

49
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.820
It's probably a tomato problem.

50
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.720
It's more subtle than that.

51
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.340
You wouldn't tell your kids that everything red round and 100 grams is edible would you.

52
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.640
So how do kids learn.

53
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.290
Maybe we'd have to show them lots of examples of tomatoes tomatoes from different angles.

54
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.820
Tomatoes of different sizes.

55
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.590
Tomatoes of different shapes.

56
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.780
Now we're getting close to machine learning.

57
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.230
It's similar to kids learning but with machines in the previous example of teaching kids to classify

58
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.770
tomatoes we gave them lots of different examples and taught them that they are each a tomato even if

59
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.160
they might look different.

60
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.720
When we do the same thing for our computers it's called supervised learning by providing legal training

61
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.550
data we can slowly teach our computers what a tomato is.

62
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.980
And once we have a train machine learning model that knows what a ripe tomato looks like then we can

63
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.820
do this and teaching computers is way more fun than teaching kids because even if you teach your kid

64
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.630
what a tomato is they won't work on your farm 24/7 sorting your tomatoes but your machine learning model

65
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.530
will.

66
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.040
So I hope you're now as excited as I am about machine learning.
