1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,780
In the upcoming lessons we're going to talk about how to make predictions using our model.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:16,140
And believe it or not this gives us a chance to link together several concepts of the past lessons in

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,080
our technical section on gradient descent.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,910
We've talked extensively about cost functions and the role of the means squared error cost function

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,130
in machine learning.

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:37,590
We've also covered how an algorithm that finds the best fit line minimizes this particular equation.

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,510
And we've also talked a lot about metrics like r squared and we touched on how to compare different

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,590
models.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,390
And finally we've talked a lot about how to analyze the residuals.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,660
So how does this all tied together.

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:01,890
Let's go back to the equation of the means quit IRA for a little bit y hat in this equation is the value

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,600
that is estimated by our model since we're using a multi variable regression with 11 features our equation

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,800
for y hat will actually break down into something like this.

14
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,230
We have all the features and then all the features taking it a step further.

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,610
We've also encountered the Y minus y hat before Y minus y hat where the residuals the residuals are

16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,300
the actual values minus the fitted values.

17
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:37,560
So what does that make the mean square error the mean square error is just the residuals squared and

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:45,000
then summed up and then divided by the number of observations and now do you see the squaring that's

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
happening here.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,880
We're squaring the differences between the actual and the predicted values we're squaring the residuals.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,100
And this is nice because we're treating the positive and the negative residuals equally which means

22
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:06,540
we can then add them up in the summation but this mathematical operation of squaring the differences

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,670
also has another effect.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,900
Think about this.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,310
What if the difference between the predicted value and the actual value was large.

26
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:24,000
What if we have a large residual what happens to the mean squared error in this case the squaring of

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
a big number will increase the mean square error massively.

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,370
Right.

29
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,940
In other words the mean square error ways the large differences more heavily and thus it punishes large

30
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,720
residuals the effect of this is is that it makes the means quite a very sensitive to outliers.

31
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,160
So that's one thing to be aware of.

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,690
Now let's have a think about how the main square error compares to our squared and to do that we're

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,940
going to check out the differences between the two in Jupiter notebook.

34
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,660
In the past lessons we've written some code where we plotted our residuals and calculated them and compared

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,770
the residual plots of three different models.

36
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,700
Now let's look at these models are squared and there means quit errors in some of the previous lessons.

37
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,730
The way we've worked with the means quit error was by importing a function from cyclic learn.

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,260
So we said from K learned metrics import mean underscore squared on a score error.

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,180
And then we use this function to calculate the MSE.

40
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,230
But in this case we're using our stats model module here and it actually makes accessing the means quit

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,390
are very very easy because again we just have to use our results object to get hold of it.

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,840
Here's how.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,670
Coming down here I'm going to add a comment that reads mean squared error.

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:00,460
And I can access the mean square error from our results objects by typing results dot M S E underscore

45
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,460
resit.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,970
This will give us our means squared error.

47
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,390
And what I'll do is I'll store this in a variable I'm going to call this variable or reduced on a score

48
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,740
log on a score.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,620
M S E and so that equal to the rounded value of this whole thing.

50
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,010
So.

51
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:28,230
Oh I see round function and have the results start MSE and the score reside inside the parentheses come

52
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,300
after it round rounded to three decimal places and close it all off.

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,450
I don't want to do a same thing for the r squared.

54
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,810
So in our comment I'll add R squared.

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,590
I'm going to copy this line pasted on here.

56
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,340
Change the variable name to all squared and change the attribute as well.

57
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:02,760
So results thought r squared rounded to three decimal places will be stored in this variable reduced

58
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,780
on a score log on a score.

59
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:13,680
R squared is equal to round parenthesis results start r squared comma three closing parentheses will

60
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,990
take this here.

61
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:22,570
These three lines of code and the comment copy them and I'm going to come down here to model number

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,990
two.

63
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,620
The original model using normal prices and all features and what I'll do here.

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Going to come down to the very bottom pasted in and changed the variable names.

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,010
The first one I'll call full underscore normal and it's quite messy.

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,160
And the second one I'm going to call full on the score normal on a score.

67
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,270
Our squared.

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,490
Now when I hit shift enter on both of these cells since I've added new code I think I didn't do it on

69
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,390
the first one but I will do it on this one shift enter and then coming up here go ahead shift enter

70
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,570
as well.

71
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,760
This leaves us with our third model the one where we admitted some variables and are still using log

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,860
prices.

73
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,270
And I'm going to paste in the three lines the comment reading mean square error and R squared.

74
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,340
And then I want to change the variable names.

75
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:27,990
Once again I'm going to call this one permitted when I'm double T omitted underscore var underscore

76
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:36,590
MSE and admitted the score bar at a score of squared shift.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:45,860
Enter and now that we've added this code calculated all these values we can look at them side by side

78
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,000
which is what I wanted to do in the first place.

79
00:06:49,220 --> 00:07:00,470
So I put him in a data frame PD dot data frame parenthesis curly brackets single quotes r squared colon

80
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,010
and now I want to provide a list a list of all the r squared values.

81
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:15,510
So the first one was reduced on the score log under school r squared the second one was full underscore

82
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:27,300
normal underscore Squid and the third one was omitted underscore var underscore our squid.

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,110
Those are all the r squared values.

84
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:38,250
When I put a comma here after the square brackets go down to the next line and add our second key for

85
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,810
our dictionary it's gonna be MSE means quit error colon and again we're gonna be putting in a list of

86
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,050
values so I can probably take this list here.

87
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,510
Copy it pasted in and then change that.

88
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,460
Last thing here in the name too.

89
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:04,490
MSE this is how I've named all my means quit era variables so that's easy enough.

90
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:11,910
Let's take a look at what we've got when it shift enter and what we see is two columns one reading MSE

91
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,360
and the other one reading r squared now the roads are still indexed by 0 1 and 2 but we can change that

92
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,440
by adding an additional argument here.

93
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,160
I want to put a come up here and then I'm going to supply the index argument and I'm going to make this

94
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,660
equal to again a list.

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:42,080
So square brackets and when put three values the first one it's gonna be our reduced log model.

96
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:51,170
The second one is going to be our full normal price model and then the third one is going to be our

97
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,790
admitted

98
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,790
variable model refreshing our output.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,860
We see the names listed here very nicely okay.

100
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,170
So let's interpret what we're looking at.

101
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,750
First off the r squared.

102
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:20,480
We know that r squared is always between 0 and 1 for every single regression model out there.

103
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
But what does this mean.

104
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:31,100
R squared is a relative measure of fit and r squared does not have any units right.

105
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,840
This means that the r squared doesn't scale with the data it's always between 0 and 1.

106
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:46,040
And in our table we can see that the simplified model with the log prices has a higher fit than our

107
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,980
full model with the normal prices.

108
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,890
Of course the model where we left out some variables.

109
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,760
This one in fact has the lowest fit of them all.

110
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,830
But what about the mean square error.

111
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,670
In contrast to r squared the main square error actually is an absolute measure of fit.

112
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,880
It's not a relative measure it's an absolute measure and it has units namely the units of the target.

113
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:22,070
Are Y variable that nineteen point nine that you see here for the full normal price model.

114
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,260
Yeah.

115
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:29,600
The second one is in the units of the target which in this case is thousands of dollars.

116
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,790
So this means quite error here is actually approximately twenty thousand dollars.

117
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,340
Is this third one better than the second one because it has a lower mean squat error.

118
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,830
And the answer is No.

119
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,140
Right.

120
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,980
Because you can't compare the two because they're in different units the model in the first row and

121
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,710
the model in the third row are using log prices right.

122
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,050
Log prices in thousands.

123
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,470
In other words the scale of the MSE is different depending on the data that you're using.

124
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:09,770
But of course lower values of MSE indicate a better fit and an MSE of 0 indicates a perfect fit.

125
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,850
So you have to remember that when you're comparing models Okay so now that we've calculated our mean

126
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:24,970
square error let's talk about how we would go about making a prediction for a house price.

127
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,590
Now I think that before we go ahead and do that we should actually check out how the pros predict house

128
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:40,830
prices to websites that are very good at this are Zoeller in the UK and Zillow in the US but of course

129
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,740
you can go and hunt around on the Internet to find a equivalent Web site.

130
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,150
That's a bit closer to home depending on where you live hand you can other maybe like paused the video

131
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,310
and try out one of these Web sites to get an estimate for a home.

132
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,840
Or you can watch me go through the process.

133
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,340
One word of warning though uh Zillow thinks they're being very cute or clever and calling their estimate

134
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,100
a XXX estimate.

135
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,840
Mm hmm.

136
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:08,910
Yeah.

137
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,600
So uh something that so how did that go.

138
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,040
Did you give it a shot.

139
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,850
So yesterday I actually tried using zipline to get a price estimate for Buckingham Palace or the pig

140
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,360
pen but I didn't have much luck providing the postcodes for these lap blocks.

141
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,870
But funny enough there were some properties listed in Windsor Castle of all places including like the

142
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,750
Windsor Castle library.

143
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,010
So yeah I'm really not sure why but.

144
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,030
But I tell you what I did dig around and I want to show you how to get a property price estimate for

145
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,350
this particular home.

146
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,600
Let me show you the brochure.

147
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,170
So this is an old brochure and it's for this house in Kenwood.

148
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,730
And as you can see it's a it's a very very nice house.

149
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:10,160
I think the agent Knight Frank was looking to sell it hand the story with this house is that it used

150
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,340
to belong to John Lennon from the Beatles.

151
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,920
That's right.

152
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,040
This John Lennon.

153
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:23,110
Contrary to popular belief he did not live on Abbey Road nor did he live in a yellow submarine.

154
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,510
OK.

155
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,330
So let me show you how to get an estimate for his previous Crip.

156
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:35,870
Now to get a valuation for this home on Zoom club what I have to do is I have to go to get your home

157
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:43,710
valued and then I think it's I come down here and I think I have to click on what's my home worth.

158
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,820
So I think the first place they send you is trying to get Agent valuations but I'm actually interested

159
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,880
in the zoo plot estimate so how much zoo hoopla thinks it's worth.

160
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,240
So when I click on this get a zoo play estimate and then I'm going to punch in the postcode.

161
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,440
So this was Katy 13 0 j you looked us up.

162
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:16,010
So John Lennon used to live on this postcode and hand from that property brochure we know that it's

163
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,910
Kenwood Wood Lane.

164
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,900
So let's click on get estimate now we can supply some additional information about this property the

165
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:39,400
property type is it's a detached house the property style is that it's a period home and it's a freehold.

166
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,310
I don't know how many floors it has but I did check the brochure and four bedrooms it was six bedrooms

167
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,300
six bathrooms and six receptions.

168
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,630
I think they also had like a big garden and a swimming pool and for the internal area according to the

169
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,440
brochure it's a thousand one hundred and ten square metres.

170
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:08,990
So absolutely enormous I can press continue and then I'm going to take swimming pool here and leave

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,810
these other ones alone.

172
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:19,200
I can't be bothered but what's very interesting is that Zeppelin knows how much this home sold for previously.

173
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,800
This is actually public knowledge right.

174
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,740
If you're wondering where they're getting this from they're getting it from the UK Government's land

175
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,780
registry.

176
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:37,740
So the government basically tracks all the property transactions in the UK and you can search for house

177
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,750
prices of the previous transactions.

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,520
And if I put in the postcode here.

179
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:56,130
So Katie 13 0 j you and then say show results then I can see here that for Kenwood Wood Lane in 2007

180
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,290
this home sold for five point eight million pounds.

181
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,620
Yeah.

182
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,990
So this is where Zappala is getting its price data from.

183
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,220
Yeah.

184
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,380
They're getting it directly from the government.

185
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,510
So that's one of the data sources not going to confirm the information above is accurate and I agree

186
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,480
to the terms of use MLC get estimate

187
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:29,440
and what we see is that Zappala estimates John Lennon's former home to be worth eight point seventy

188
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
five million pounds.

189
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
So it's sold for five point eight.

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,140
Back in 0 7 and today super reckons it's worth about eight point seventy five.

191
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,140
But here's the part I want to draw your attention to.

192
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,620
I want to draw your attention to this value range that they're providing him.

193
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,770
We don't just get a price.

194
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,520
Yeah.

195
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,420
So plays in telling us oh it's worth eight point seventy five million on the nose.

196
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,740
What we also get from them is a range around that price.

197
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:07,360
We see that super thinks the property is worth between eight point one six and nine point three four

198
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,330
million pounds.

199
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,560
What zoo plus actually telling us is that they are estimating this home to be worth eight point seven

200
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,360
five plus or minus five hundred and ninety thousand pounds.

201
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,690
They're giving us an upper and a lower bound to their estimate.

202
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,620
And this is a key component for making a good prediction.

203
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,330
Why well.

204
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,770
Because it tells us how confident Zoeller is in their estimate.

205
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,100
I mean they're giving us this little bar here confidence level high but we can also infer how confident

206
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,870
they are by how wide this range is in the woods.

207
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,010
If this hoopla says oh it's eight point seven million plus or minus six hundred thousand that's very

208
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,130
very different from saying it was worth eight point seven million plus or minus two million.

209
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,180
Right.

210
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:09,600
The point I'm trying to make is that when it comes to our predictions our forecasting that we're going

211
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,740
to be doing we're going to have to provide not just a house price but we're also going to have to provide

212
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,830
a range around that price.

213
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:27,810
And believe it or not this range actually has something to do with the residuals and the mean square

214
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,040
error hand.

215
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,710
That's what we're going to be looking at in the next lesson.

216
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,640
But before you head over there let me uh let me ask you a question.

217
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:44,080
Have you ever used the Web site like Zillow or Zillow to get an estimate for a property hand.

218
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:51,160
If so please post the link of the service that you used and the common section for this video.

219
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,900
Hyde actually be quite curious to know for which places on earth we can get estimates like this hand

220
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,870
for which ones we can't at the time of recording.

221
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,880
I tried finding the equivalent of Xu for Austria but no dice.

222
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,130
Yeah.

223
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,950
The property market in Austria is just not as transparent as in the UK.

224
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,820
And this property price transaction data that zoo plus piggy backing off of to make their estimates

225
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:25,130
you know that they're getting from the land registry is just not publicly available.

226
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,090
Anyhow I'll see you in the next video.

227
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,760
Take care.
