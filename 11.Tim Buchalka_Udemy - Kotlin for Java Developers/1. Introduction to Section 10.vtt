00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.920
Well here we are at the last section of the course.

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.520
You've learned quite a lot about Codlin if you've been dabbling in the language yourself.

3
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.210
You might have noticed that we didn't cover everything there is to know about Katlin discourses here

4
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.940
to get you up and running quickly by leveraging your Java knowledge.

5
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.550
So I've tried to relate new features and changes in Cartland back to Java as much as possible but of

6
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.630
course there's more to explore.

7
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.660
Now in this final section we're going to take another look at the text adventure code that I converted

8
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.770
at the top of the course.

9
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.670
Now I said when I did that that by the end of the course you'd be able to explain the code to me or

10
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.250
in fact to anybody else.

11
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.770
And if you've watched all the videos in the course then this code is now going to seem pretty simple

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.530
to you.

13
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.330
You are going to recognize everything that I used.

14
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.480
So we'll take another look at that code.

15
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.180
So let's get started.
