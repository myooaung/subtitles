00:00:04,190  -->  00:00:06,180
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06,180  -->  00:00:09,269
and download and install IntelliJ IDEA
3

3

00:00:09,269  -->  00:00:11,759
which is the editor slash IDE that we're
4

4

00:00:11,759  -->  00:00:13,950
going to be using in this course and
5

5

00:00:13,950  -->  00:00:15,120
we're going to be doing it for a Linux
6

6

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:17,190
platform, specifically a bunch of Linux
7

7

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:19,920
16.04. Now if you're running
8

8

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:22,529
Windows or a Mac, you'd want to check out
9

9

00:00:22,529  -->  00:00:24,269
the other videos or the videos that
10

10

00:00:24,269  -->  00:00:26,310
we've set up for both operating systems
11

11

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:28,590
in this section of the course and that's
12

12

00:00:28,590  -->  00:00:30,179
because the process of installation is
13

13

00:00:30,179  -->  00:00:32,040
slightly different, but if you run Linux
14

14

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:34,559
this is the correct video, so the first
15

15

00:00:34,559  -->  00:00:36,989
thing to do is open up Firefox or your
16

16

00:00:36,989  -->  00:00:39,480
browser of choice, we want to go to the
17

17

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:47,700
JetBrains website, jetbrains.com and
18

18

00:00:47,700  -->  00:00:50,670
once we get there we will need to go to
19

19

00:00:50,670  -->  00:00:53,989
the page where we can download IntelliJ.
20

20

00:00:53,989  -->  00:00:56,149
Usually you'll see that option
21

21

00:00:56,149  -->  00:00:58,340
here on the screen because it's one of
22

22

00:00:58,340  -->  00:01:00,230
their most popular products JetBrains is
23

23

00:01:00,230  -->  00:01:01,699
the company that have created this
24

24

00:01:01,699  -->  00:01:04,159
product, so either select it there or
25

25

00:01:04,159  -->  00:01:05,390
what they don't see that for some reason
26

26

00:01:05,390  -->  00:01:07,970
come up here into IDEs and IntelliJ
27

27

00:01:07,970  -->  00:01:09,440
will usually be the first option or very
28

28

00:01:09,440  -->  00:01:11,840
close to the first option, so go to that
29

29

00:01:11,840  -->  00:01:20,119
page then click on download and what I'm
30

30

00:01:20,119  -->  00:01:21,649
going to do is start the download for
31

31

00:01:21,649  -->  00:01:23,390
the Community Edition and while that's
32

32

00:01:23,390  -->  00:01:24,920
downloading, we'll come back to this page
33

33

00:01:24,920  -->  00:01:26,420
and just talk about the ultimate and
34

34

00:01:26,420  -->  00:01:28,429
community editions and what differences
35

35

00:01:28,429  -->  00:01:31,850
there are between the two, what I'm going
36

36

00:01:31,850  -->  00:01:33,500
to do first to save that though and
37

37

00:01:33,500  -->  00:01:35,479
we'll go into my downloads folder,
38

38

00:01:35,479  -->  00:01:37,550
you know I'll just go back here to mention
39

39

00:01:37,550  -->  00:01:39,770
so we can have a bit of a look at the
40

40

00:01:39,770  -->  00:01:41,450
two options, we've got the Ultimate
41

41

00:01:41,450  -->  00:01:43,670
Edition as well as the Community Edition.
42

42

00:01:43,670  -->  00:01:45,619
Now the Community Edition which I'm
43

43

00:01:45,619  -->  00:01:47,060
downloading is the free and open-source
44

44

00:01:47,060  -->  00:01:49,580
version and you never have to pay with
45

45

00:01:49,580  -->  00:01:50,990
that option, so if you want to go ahead
46

46

00:01:50,990  -->  00:01:53,240
and use that option, it's a good option
47

47

00:01:53,240  -->  00:01:54,710
and it will certainly work well in this
48

48

00:01:54,710  -->  00:01:57,229
course, the ultimate edition does come with
49

49

00:01:57,229  -->  00:01:59,750
a trial, however if after that trial
50

50

00:01:59,750  -->  00:02:01,250
period if you still want to use it you
51

51

00:02:01,250  -->  00:02:03,799
will need to pay for it and the
52

52

00:02:03,799  -->  00:02:05,060
difference between the two is that the
53

53

00:02:05,060  -->  00:02:07,520
Ultimate Edition has extra features it's
54

54

00:02:07,520  -->  00:02:09,679
really good for other things other than
55

55

00:02:09,679  -->  00:02:11,600
standard languages, so it's good for Java
56

56

00:02:11,600  -->  00:02:13,910
Enterprise Edition and you can see here
57

57

00:02:13,910  -->  00:02:15,680
are the frameworks and databases and so
58

58

00:02:15,680  -->  00:02:17,810
on and so forth, so what you can do is
59

59

00:02:17,810  -->  00:02:19,340
if you decide to try out the Ultimate
60

60

00:02:19,340  -->  00:02:21,650
Edition, you can try that out for 30 days,
61

61

00:02:21,650  -->  00:02:23,660
the JetBrains people give you a 30 day
62

62

00:02:23,660  -->  00:02:25,610
trial to try that out and you could
63

63

00:02:25,610  -->  00:02:26,600
always come back and download the
64

64

00:02:26,600  -->  00:02:28,579
community edition later but again either
65

65

00:02:28,579  -->  00:02:30,110
edition will work and if you want to
66

66

00:02:30,110  -->  00:02:32,720
try out the Ultimate Edition you can, but
67

67

00:02:32,720  -->  00:02:34,430
in my case, you saw me download the
68

68

00:02:34,430  -->  00:02:37,400
community edition. Alright, so let's go
69

69

00:02:37,400  -->  00:02:39,680
ahead now and install the version that
70

70

00:02:39,680  -->  00:02:41,810
we've downloaded and over here I can see
71

71

00:02:41,810  -->  00:02:44,000
now that my version is finished so I'm
72

72

00:02:44,000  -->  00:02:45,500
going to just open that and go into the
73

73

00:02:45,500  -->  00:02:47,200
folder where it was actually downloaded.
74

74

00:02:47,200  -->  00:02:49,310
Well actually what I'll do is I'll just
75

75

00:02:49,310  -->  00:02:52,340
come down here and close this browser
76

76

00:02:52,340  -->  00:02:54,650
down and we can see that it's in the
77

77

00:02:54,650  -->  00:02:56,810
downloads folder and I'm just going to
78

78

00:02:56,810  -->  00:02:59,390
put this software in a folder on my
79

79

00:02:59,390  -->  00:03:01,180
computer, so I'm going to first open it
80

80

00:03:01,180  -->  00:03:06,500
with archive manager and then what I'm
81

81

00:03:06,500  -->  00:03:07,849
going to do is come back to my home
82

82

00:03:07,849  -->  00:03:09,590
folder and I'm gonna create a folder for
83

83

00:03:09,590  -->  00:03:11,900
my apps, so I'm gonna click on new folder
84

84

00:03:11,900  -->  00:03:15,019
and I'm gonna call that dev and this
85

85

00:03:15,019  -->  00:03:16,129
is going to be the folder where I'm
86

86

00:03:16,129  -->  00:03:18,379
gonna put IntelliJ. Now, you are of course
87

87

00:03:18,379  -->  00:03:20,450
free to put this software or wherever
88

88

00:03:20,450  -->  00:03:22,459
you like but that's the location where
89

89

00:03:22,459  -->  00:03:24,319
I'm going to be running it from, once
90

90

00:03:24,319  -->  00:03:25,700
you've done that, you've selected the
91

91

00:03:25,700  -->  00:03:27,469
folder where you want it to go, you come
92

92

00:03:27,469  -->  00:03:28,670
back over here and then you can
93

93

00:03:28,670  -->  00:03:30,079
literally just click on that and drag it
94

94

00:03:30,079  -->  00:03:32,389
over and that will move the files into
95

95

00:03:32,389  -->  00:03:35,959
that location for us then once that's
96

96

00:03:35,959  -->  00:03:37,400
finished, we can close down both of these
97

97

00:03:37,400  -->  00:03:39,829
windows and we now want to go into
98

98

00:03:39,829  -->  00:03:41,269
terminal, so I'm going to click on
99

99

00:03:41,269  -->  00:03:43,129
terminal, so you go into terminal or
100

100

00:03:43,129  -->  00:03:44,569
command prompt whatever it's called on
101

101

00:03:44,569  -->  00:03:47,510
your installation of Linux, they want to
102

102

00:03:47,510  -->  00:03:50,060
navigate now to that folder, so I'm gonna
103

103

00:03:50,060  -->  00:03:53,090
go to CD in my case I have a look at the
104

104

00:03:53,090  -->  00:03:55,760
current folder I'm in my home folder I'm
105

105

00:03:55,760  -->  00:03:58,699
going to click on CD dev and if we have
106

106

00:03:58,699  -->  00:04:00,199
a look there by typing ls you can see
107

107

00:04:00,199  -->  00:04:02,449
that there's the installation of IDEA,
108

108

00:04:02,449  -->  00:04:04,549
so I'm just going to type in CD space and
109

109

00:04:04,549  -->  00:04:07,370
then the folder name and then I can go
110

110

00:04:07,370  -->  00:04:10,000
into the bin folder, so CD space bin,
111

111

00:04:10,000  -->  00:04:11,870
they have a look at that again and you
112

112

00:04:11,870  -->  00:04:13,430
can see that there's various files there,
113

113

00:04:13,430  -->  00:04:16,639
the one we want to start is idea dot sh,
114

114

00:04:16,639  -->  00:04:19,299
so I'm going to type dot forward slash
115

115

00:04:19,299  -->  00:04:26,810
IDEA to start up and the first time you
116

116

00:04:26,810  -->  00:04:29,930
load install you actually start IntelliJ IDEA,
117

117

00:04:29,930  -->  00:04:32,360
it's a gives you a prompt to sort in
118

118

00:04:32,360  -->  00:04:34,430
import settings, so if you've got an
119

119

00:04:34,430  -->  00:04:36,020
existing version of IntelliJ, you can
120

120

00:04:36,020  -->  00:04:38,270
import the settings and particularly if
121

121

00:04:38,270  -->  00:04:40,310
you've customized it and you changed
122

122

00:04:40,310  -->  00:04:41,810
maybe perhaps played around with fonts
123

123

00:04:41,810  -->  00:04:43,370
and other things can be a good way to
124

124

00:04:43,370  -->  00:04:45,409
stop your having to re set everything up
125

125

00:04:45,409  -->  00:04:47,630
again from scratch, in my case though
126

126

00:04:47,630  -->  00:04:49,370
I haven't got any settings to import so
127

127

00:04:49,370  -->  00:04:51,020
I'm going to select this option and
128

128

00:04:51,020  -->  00:04:52,310
that's probably the option you'll choose
129

129

00:04:52,310  -->  00:04:53,599
in most cases because you probably
130

130

00:04:53,599  -->  00:04:55,639
haven't had IntelliJ installed on your
131

131

00:04:55,639  -->  00:04:59,840
computer before, so click on ok and we
132

132

00:04:59,840  -->  00:05:01,580
need to accept the privacy policy by
133

133

00:05:01,580  -->  00:05:04,430
clicking on accept, you've got some
134

134

00:05:04,430  -->  00:05:06,530
options as to how you want the theme or
135

135

00:05:06,530  -->  00:05:08,900
what the theme is for IntelliJ and you
136

136

00:05:08,900  -->  00:05:11,000
can see if I select it, we see different
137

137

00:05:11,000  -->  00:05:13,490
options I'm going to choose IntelliJ
138

138

00:05:13,490  -->  00:05:14,900
that a standard option with the white
139

139

00:05:14,900  -->  00:05:16,610
background but you'll choose whichever
140

140

00:05:16,610  -->  00:05:18,919
one you feel is appropriate and keep in
141

141

00:05:18,919  -->  00:05:20,770
mind you can always come down here to
142

142

00:05:20,770  -->  00:05:23,470
to go back to settings within IntelliJ
143

143

00:05:23,470  -->  00:05:25,389
appearance and behavior appearance and
144

144

00:05:25,389  -->  00:05:27,129
change that at a later time if you feel
145

145

00:05:27,129  -->  00:05:29,319
you need to, once you've done that click
146

146

00:05:29,319  -->  00:05:32,409
on next. Now we want to automatically
147

147

00:05:32,409  -->  00:05:34,449
create a desktop entry for us, so that we
148

148

00:05:34,449  -->  00:05:36,220
don't have to go to terminal - command
149

149

00:05:36,220  -->  00:05:40,240
prompt to start IntelliJ each time so
150

150

00:05:40,240  -->  00:05:41,770
I'm going to leave that ticked and get
151

151

00:05:41,770  -->  00:05:44,229
it to do that and again in settings
152

152

00:05:44,229  -->  00:05:45,550
later on, you can come back to tools
153

153

00:05:45,550  -->  00:05:47,139
create desktop entry if you want to do
154

154

00:05:47,139  -->  00:05:48,280
that in the future and you don't want to
155

155

00:05:48,280  -->  00:05:50,500
do it now for some reason so I'm going
156

156

00:05:50,500  -->  00:05:52,240
to leave that option selected I'm not
157

157

00:05:52,240  -->  00:05:53,620
going to create it for all you users if
158

158

00:05:53,620  -->  00:05:55,000
you wanted to for some reason, you can
159

159

00:05:55,000  -->  00:05:57,780
click on that checkbox, click on next
160

160

00:05:57,780  -->  00:06:00,130
now you can't use IntelliJ from the
161

161

00:06:00,130  -->  00:06:02,319
command line if you want, you can invoke
162

162

00:06:02,319  -->  00:06:04,539
it and that's an option if you want to
163

163

00:06:04,539  -->  00:06:05,560
I'm going to click on that even
164

164

00:06:05,560  -->  00:06:06,520
though we probably won't be doing that
165

165

00:06:06,520  -->  00:06:07,870
in the course, it's actually there for
166

166

00:06:07,870  -->  00:06:10,720
you just to do if you want click on next.
167

167

00:06:10,720  -->  00:06:13,270
Now we've got a number of plugins that
168

168

00:06:13,270  -->  00:06:15,250
you can configure and some of these are
169

169

00:06:15,250  -->  00:06:17,020
actually configured already, so you can
170

170

00:06:17,020  -->  00:06:18,879
enable them or disable them or customize
171

171

00:06:18,879  -->  00:06:20,860
them, I'd suggest generally you leave
172

172

00:06:20,860  -->  00:06:22,479
everything else is because you can
173

173

00:06:22,479  -->  00:06:23,889
always go back in again later and
174

174

00:06:23,889  -->  00:06:26,020
configure what add plugins at any time.
175

175

00:06:26,020  -->  00:06:27,729
So I'm going to leave everything as is
176

176

00:06:27,729  -->  00:06:29,860
there just what other thing to keep in
177

177

00:06:29,860  -->  00:06:31,630
mind is if you're running the Ultimate
178

178

00:06:31,630  -->  00:06:33,520
Edition and not the Community Edition,
179

179

00:06:33,520  -->  00:06:35,469
then I'm installing you probably will
180

180

00:06:35,469  -->  00:06:37,479
have extra options there because of the
181

181

00:06:37,479  -->  00:06:39,069
extra functionality that's the
182

182

00:06:39,069  -->  00:06:40,930
ultimate edition of IntelliJ gives you.
183

183

00:06:40,930  -->  00:06:42,849
In my case, I'm not going to do anything
184

184

00:06:42,849  -->  00:06:44,400
I'm just going to click on next and
185

185

00:06:44,400  -->  00:06:46,690
we've got some other options to download
186

186

00:06:46,690  -->  00:06:48,699
some featured plugins, we're not going to
187

187

00:06:48,699  -->  00:06:50,169
be using those plugins in this course
188

188

00:06:50,169  -->  00:06:52,000
either, so I'm just going to click on
189

189

00:06:52,000  -->  00:06:55,990
start using IntelliJ IDEA. I need
190

190

00:06:55,990  -->  00:06:59,860
to enter my password now and that's to
191

191

00:06:59,860  -->  00:07:02,139
set up the launcher, installer click on
192

192

00:07:02,139  -->  00:07:03,880
authenticate and IntelliJ should
193

193

00:07:03,880  -->  00:07:06,449
start, as you can see it's starting.
194

194

00:07:06,449  -->  00:07:08,889
Okay, so now we've installed
195

195

00:07:08,889  -->  00:07:10,930
IntelliJ there's a few settings we need
196

196

00:07:10,930  -->  00:07:13,150
to configure, so to do that we're gonna
197

197

00:07:13,150  -->  00:07:14,849
come over here and click on configure
198

198

00:07:14,849  -->  00:07:17,759
come down here to project defaults and
199

199

00:07:17,759  -->  00:07:22,360
select project structure, what we need to
200

200

00:07:22,360  -->  00:07:25,509
do is configure a project SDK, if I click
201

201

00:07:25,509  -->  00:07:26,380
on that at the moment, you can see
202

202

00:07:26,380  -->  00:07:29,500
clearly there's no SDK defined, so what
203

203

00:07:29,500  -->  00:07:31,330
we need to do now is associate the java
204

204

00:07:31,330  -->  00:07:34,720
development kit that we installed in a
205

205

00:07:34,720  -->  00:07:37,420
previous video with IntelliJ, so to do that
206

206

00:07:37,420  -->  00:07:39,850
we're going to click on new and come
207

207

00:07:39,850  -->  00:07:43,930
over here and select JDK. Now what should
208

208

00:07:43,930  -->  00:07:48,340
happen is that IntelliJ will find the
209

209

00:07:48,340  -->  00:07:49,450
Java development kit for us
210

210

00:07:49,450  -->  00:07:50,590
automatically and you can see in this
211

211

00:07:50,590  -->  00:07:52,480
particular case it did, if for some
212

212

00:07:52,480  -->  00:07:54,070
reason that doesn't find that for you
213

213

00:07:54,070  -->  00:07:56,050
automatically, you may need to go ahead
214

214

00:07:56,050  -->  00:07:58,180
and manually choose the location and
215

215

00:07:58,180  -->  00:08:00,160
choose the home directory, but in my case
216

216

00:08:00,160  -->  00:08:02,110
again you can see that that's founded ok
217

217

00:08:02,110  -->  00:08:03,790
so I don't need to do anything else to
218

218

00:08:03,790  -->  00:08:07,060
do other than clicking on ok and you can
219

219

00:08:07,060  -->  00:08:08,140
see once I've done that this has now
220

220

00:08:08,140  -->  00:08:10,570
changed and we've got the Java version
221

221

00:08:10,570  -->  00:08:13,150
showing now and if for some reason it
222

222

00:08:13,150  -->  00:08:14,560
still wasn't selected make sure that you
223

223

00:08:14,560  -->  00:08:16,960
have got that selected up there the
224

224

00:08:16,960  -->  00:08:18,160
other thing here that we want to have
225

225

00:08:18,160  -->  00:08:20,740
selected is the SDK default that is
226

226

00:08:20,740  -->  00:08:22,000
selected to the latest source,
227

227

00:08:22,000  -->  00:08:24,280
it isn't using the latest version which
228

228

00:08:24,280  -->  00:08:26,110
is correct, so we don't need to make any
229

229

00:08:26,110  -->  00:08:28,390
changes to that and incidentally I
230

230

00:08:28,390  -->  00:08:29,740
didn't mention earlier but if by chance
231

231

00:08:29,740  -->  00:08:31,210
you got to the screen and you couldn't
232

232

00:08:31,210  -->  00:08:33,490
see the option that I could see, project
233

233

00:08:33,490  -->  00:08:35,560
is the option that you'd select to see
234

234

00:08:35,560  -->  00:08:37,450
those on the screen. Alright so I'm going
235

235

00:08:37,450  -->  00:08:40,479
to click on ok now and there's a few
236

236

00:08:40,479  -->  00:08:41,890
other little minor options we now need
237

237

00:08:41,890  -->  00:08:43,180
to configure, so let's go ahead and do
238

238

00:08:43,180  -->  00:08:46,030
those, if you can't configure and click
239

239

00:08:46,030  -->  00:08:49,450
on settings and what we want to do is
240

240

00:08:49,450  -->  00:08:51,460
open up here down under editor
241

241

00:08:51,460  -->  00:08:54,100
expand that list of options and then
242

242

00:08:54,100  -->  00:08:55,780
under general, do the same thing click on
243

243

00:08:55,780  -->  00:08:57,850
that firstly we wanna click on auto
244

244

00:08:57,850  -->  00:09:00,400
import we would have click on or add the
245

245

00:09:00,400  -->  00:09:02,170
check box click the check box for add
246

246

00:09:02,170  -->  00:09:04,000
an ambiguous imports on the fly and
247

247

00:09:04,000  -->  00:09:06,160
then the check box we should click for
248

248

00:09:06,160  -->  00:09:07,750
optimise imports on the fly.
249

249

00:09:07,750  -->  00:09:10,990
So click on apply to that and then come
250

250

00:09:10,990  -->  00:09:13,660
down here to appearance and we want to
251

251

00:09:13,660  -->  00:09:15,070
make sure that show line numbers is
252

252

00:09:15,070  -->  00:09:16,570
checked and you can see that by default
253

253

00:09:16,570  -->  00:09:18,550
it is checked but if for some reason
254

254

00:09:18,550  -->  00:09:20,530
it's not make sure you do check it there
255

255

00:09:20,530  -->  00:09:22,510
but you can see in my case it is,
256

256

00:09:22,510  -->  00:09:23,490
I'm going to click on ok,
257

257

00:09:23,490  -->  00:09:25,690
at that point we've now finished the
258

258

00:09:25,690  -->  00:09:29,050
configuration for IntelliJ IDEA, what I am
259

259

00:09:29,050  -->  00:09:31,750
going to do now is close this down and
260

260

00:09:31,750  -->  00:09:33,010
I'm going to close down in the command
261

261

00:09:33,010  -->  00:09:35,890
line the terminal and we should be able
262

262

00:09:35,890  -->  00:09:38,200
to come over here and if we have a look
263

263

00:09:38,200  -->  00:09:42,430
for IntelliJ, you can see that IntelliJ
264

264

00:09:42,430  -->  00:09:45,220
is now appearing there as a desktop
265

265

00:09:45,220  -->  00:09:47,230
shortcut, so I can click on that and
266

266

00:09:47,230  -->  00:09:48,320
that's how I can go ahead and
267

267

00:09:48,320  -->  00:09:52,840
install or run rather IntelliJ IDEA in the future
268

268

00:09:52,840  -->  00:09:55,120
and you can see that it started fine.
