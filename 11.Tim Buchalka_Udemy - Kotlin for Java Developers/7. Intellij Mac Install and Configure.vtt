00:00:04.220  -->  00:00:06.480
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06.480  -->  00:00:09.330
and download and install IntelliJ IDEA
3

3

00:00:09.330  -->  00:00:12.030
for a Mac computer. Now if you're running
4

4

00:00:12.030  -->  00:00:14.730
Windows or Linux, you want to check out
5

5

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:17.310
the videos that were put together for
6

6

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:19.199
each operating system in this section of
7

7

00:00:19.199  -->  00:00:21.060
the course and that's because the
8

8

00:00:21.060  -->  00:00:22.590
process is slightly different on those
9

9

00:00:22.590  -->  00:00:25.080
platforms, but if you're on a Mac
10

10

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:27.060
this is the video for you to watch.
11

11

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:29.570
So I'm going to start out by going to www
12

12

00:00:29.570  -->  00:00:37.530
dot brains dot com. And JetBrains is the company
13

13

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:39.390
that to actually create this IntelliJ
14

14

00:00:39.390  -->  00:00:41.399
IDEA product which we're going to be
15

15

00:00:41.399  -->  00:00:45.149
using in this course. Once you get there,
16

16

00:00:45.149  -->  00:00:47.190
if you see IntelliJ IDEA is showing on
17

17

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:48.469
the screen, you can click it there
18

18

00:00:48.469  -->  00:00:51.539
alternatively come over here to IDs and
19

19

00:00:51.539  -->  00:00:53.370
select IntelliJ IDEA,
20

20

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:56.120
either way will get you to the same page
21

21

00:00:56.120  -->  00:00:58.710
and next we're gonna click on download,
22

22

00:00:58.710  -->  00:00:59.969
because that's obviously what we want to,
23

23

00:00:59.969  -->  00:01:01.739
do download and then install this tool.
24

24

00:01:01.739  -->  00:01:05.369
Now there's two options here and what
25

25

00:01:05.369  -->  00:01:06.600
I'm going to do is I'm going to start
26

26

00:01:06.600  -->  00:01:08.070
the download for the Community Edition
27

27

00:01:08.070  -->  00:01:09.780
and then while that's downloading, we'll
28

28

00:01:09.780  -->  00:01:11.070
come back and have a chat about
29

29

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:12.450
other two options we've got here,
30

30

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:16.560
so I'll just wait for that to start and
31

31

00:01:16.560  -->  00:01:17.939
I'll just put that or have that
32

32

00:01:17.939  -->  00:01:20.909
downloading and we click on back and I
33

33

00:01:20.909  -->  00:01:22.890
want to go through a few options here
34

34

00:01:22.890  -->  00:01:24.330
because we've got an Ultimate Edition
35

35

00:01:24.330  -->  00:01:26.790
and a Community Edition and you saw me
36

36

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:28.590
download the Community Edition and
37

37

00:01:28.590  -->  00:01:30.210
that's actually the free version of this
38

38

00:01:30.210  -->  00:01:32.280
tool, if you download and use that
39

39

00:01:32.280  -->  00:01:33.420
version, you'll never need to pay
40

40

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:36.150
anything for it but Jetbrains, the makers
41

41

00:01:36.150  -->  00:01:38.490
of IntelliJ IDEA also have an Ultimate
42

42

00:01:38.490  -->  00:01:40.860
Edition with a free trial, which you can
43

43

00:01:40.860  -->  00:01:42.990
try it for 30 days and the only reason
44

44

00:01:42.990  -->  00:01:44.610
that you choose the Ultimate Edition is
45

45

00:01:44.610  -->  00:01:46.409
it's got a lot more power and it
46

46

00:01:46.409  -->  00:01:48.180
supports a lot more things, you can see
47

47

00:01:48.180  -->  00:01:49.979
that both versions do have a lot of
48

48

00:01:49.979  -->  00:01:52.020
things in common, but some of the
49

49

00:01:52.020  -->  00:01:54.090
advanced things can only work with the
50

50

00:01:54.090  -->  00:01:56.939
ultimate product so it's up to you, the
51

51

00:01:56.939  -->  00:01:58.439
Community Edition will certainly work
52

52

00:01:58.439  -->  00:02:00.420
fine if you want to take advantage of a
53

53

00:02:00.420  -->  00:02:01.320
30 day trial
54

54

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:03.869
click on download here so choose
55

55

00:02:03.869  -->  00:02:05.399
whichever version you want to choose and
56

56

00:02:05.399  -->  00:02:07.229
then download it, you can see in my case
57

57

00:02:07.229  -->  00:02:08.819
that I've downloaded the Community
58

58

00:02:08.819  -->  00:02:11.370
Edition and it's actually now finished
59

59

00:02:11.370  -->  00:02:13.170
in the bottom left hand corner, so I'm going
60

60

00:02:13.170  -->  00:02:15.110
to go and click on that to open it
61

61

00:02:15.110  -->  00:02:16.890
depending on your browser, you may need
62

62

00:02:16.890  -->  00:02:18.090
to navigate to the folder
63

63

00:02:18.090  -->  00:02:19.620
it was downloaded and then open that
64

64

00:02:19.620  -->  00:02:23.360
file to start the installation process.
65

65

00:02:23.360  -->  00:02:25.890
Okay and you can see that it's pretty
66

66

00:02:25.890  -->  00:02:28.459
simple I just need to drag this over
67

67

00:02:28.459  -->  00:02:31.200
into the Applications folder and give
68

68

00:02:31.200  -->  00:02:32.610
them a moment to start, you can see that
69

69

00:02:32.610  -->  00:02:36.209
it's installing there that's actually
70

70

00:02:36.209  -->  00:02:37.349
installed, so I'm going to close that
71

71

00:02:37.349  -->  00:02:39.060
down I'm also going to close the other
72

72

00:02:39.060  -->  00:02:40.379
browser now because we're finished with
73

73

00:02:40.379  -->  00:02:42.629
that and what I'm going to do then is
74

74

00:02:42.629  -->  00:02:44.069
open that product, so I'm going to go to
75

75

00:02:44.069  -->  00:02:47.430
my finder, open a new window go in to
76

76

00:02:47.430  -->  00:02:50.130
applications and actually want to close
77

77

00:02:50.130  -->  00:02:51.420
down this as well because we've actually
78

78

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:53.010
finished with the installation
79

79

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:56.730
process and go back to applications,
80

80

00:02:56.730  -->  00:02:59.010
so we downloaded the most recent
81

81

00:02:59.010  -->  00:03:01.349
version was the IntelliJ IDEA CE
82

82

00:03:01.349  -->  00:03:03.360
which is Community Edition, so I'm going to
83

83

00:03:03.360  -->  00:03:04.739
double click that because that's the one
84

84

00:03:04.739  -->  00:03:07.650
I've just downloaded, in any event you'll
85

85

00:03:07.650  -->  00:03:08.700
click on the relevant one that you
86

86

00:03:08.700  -->  00:03:10.079
downloaded which will probably only have
87

87

00:03:10.079  -->  00:03:12.209
the one on your computer and then it
88

88

00:03:12.209  -->  00:03:14.040
gets verified and then we just need to
89

89

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:15.629
go through a few configuration options
90

90

00:03:15.629  -->  00:03:17.489
before we're able to take advantage and
91

91

00:03:17.489  -->  00:03:19.980
use IntelliJ IDEA, I'm gonna close down
92

92

00:03:19.980  -->  00:03:24.170
the finder window for now.
93

93

00:03:24.170  -->  00:03:26.720
Eventually you get this message, do we
94

94

00:03:26.720  -->  00:03:28.430
want to open it? We can see that it's
95

95

00:03:28.430  -->  00:03:32.450
been downloaded from www.jetbrains.com, so we can click on
96

96

00:03:32.450  -->  00:03:36.230
okay. Now, depending on your installation
97

97

00:03:36.230  -->  00:03:38.510
you may or may not see this, this is an
98

98

00:03:38.510  -->  00:03:41.120
option now for you to select whether you
99

99

00:03:41.120  -->  00:03:43.070
want to install the or import rather the
100

100

00:03:43.070  -->  00:03:45.290
settings from another installation
101

101

00:03:45.290  -->  00:03:47.780
of IntelliJ IDEA or most likely you
102

102

00:03:47.780  -->  00:03:49.100
haven't used this tool before in which
103

103

00:03:49.100  -->  00:03:50.630
case the default option here do not
104

104

00:03:50.630  -->  00:03:53.060
import settings will be correct but if
105

105

00:03:53.060  -->  00:03:54.260
you do see another option there and you
106

106

00:03:54.260  -->  00:03:56.180
do want to, you can select that and that
107

107

00:03:56.180  -->  00:03:58.310
will basically import the settings from
108

108

00:03:58.310  -->  00:04:00.200
another installation, so that you don't
109

109

00:04:00.200  -->  00:04:02.030
have to enter them all again. In my case,
110

110

00:04:02.030  -->  00:04:04.459
I was just going to click on or have
111

111

00:04:04.459  -->  00:04:05.990
selected which is the default option do
112

112

00:04:05.990  -->  00:04:09.860
not import settings and click ok. Now we
113

113

00:04:09.860  -->  00:04:11.750
get through a process a wizard process
114

114

00:04:11.750  -->  00:04:13.209
now we need to go through and just
115

115

00:04:13.209  -->  00:04:16.160
select a few things now the first thing
116

116

00:04:16.160  -->  00:04:18.769
is the UI theme, so we can choose whether
117

117

00:04:18.769  -->  00:04:21.140
we want to white background or a dark
118

118

00:04:21.140  -->  00:04:23.390
background or a sort of a dark theme,
119

119

00:04:23.390  -->  00:04:25.100
I'm going to leave the white theme, the white
120

120

00:04:25.100  -->  00:04:26.630
background selected but you choose
121

121

00:04:26.630  -->  00:04:29.090
whichever one appeals to you, noting that
122

122

00:04:29.090  -->  00:04:30.169
you can always change this down the
123

123

00:04:30.169  -->  00:04:31.790
bottom it says preferences,
124

124

00:04:31.790  -->  00:04:34.100
appearance and behavior, appearance so
125

125

00:04:34.100  -->  00:04:35.210
you can go back and do that at a later
126

126

00:04:35.210  -->  00:04:37.010
time if you want to change it, we click
127

127

00:04:37.010  -->  00:04:40.100
on next. Now you get this option before
128

128

00:04:40.100  -->  00:04:42.140
and usually the option you want to
129

129

00:04:42.140  -->  00:04:43.669
select is this one on the left hand side
130

130

00:04:43.669  -->  00:04:45.980
here, I've never used IDE and that's
131

131

00:04:45.980  -->  00:04:48.380
just kind of set up the Mac OSX Mac
132

132

00:04:48.380  -->  00:04:50.360
keymaps which is probably correct for
133

133

00:04:50.360  -->  00:04:53.500
most people, so when they click on next
134

134

00:04:53.500  -->  00:04:55.640
we've got an option here to create a
135

135

00:04:55.640  -->  00:04:57.620
launcher script, now this is if you ever
136

136

00:04:57.620  -->  00:05:00.040
wanted to use IntelliJ from the command line,
137

137

00:05:00.040  -->  00:05:02.060
probably it's not something you do
138

138

00:05:02.060  -->  00:05:03.680
very often, but things how we're going
139

139

00:05:03.680  -->  00:05:05.450
through the installation process let's
140

140

00:05:05.450  -->  00:05:06.919
click that anyway and if we want to use
141

141

00:05:06.919  -->  00:05:09.680
that in the future, we can do that click
142

142

00:05:09.680  -->  00:05:12.650
on next if you know where I've got a
143

143

00:05:12.650  -->  00:05:14.990
list here or presented with various
144

144

00:05:14.990  -->  00:05:17.660
options for various extra plugins that
145

145

00:05:17.660  -->  00:05:20.270
we can install for IntelliJ IDEA.
146

146

00:05:20.270  -->  00:05:21.560
The thing is you can come back and do these
147

147

00:05:21.560  -->  00:05:23.870
at any time, so I'm not going to select
148

148

00:05:23.870  -->  00:05:25.970
any at this point but if there's
149

149

00:05:25.970  -->  00:05:27.290
something there that appeals to you and
150

150

00:05:27.290  -->  00:05:28.850
that you want to install this is the
151

151

00:05:28.850  -->  00:05:29.930
place where you can actually go ahead
152

152

00:05:29.930  -->  00:05:32.450
and do that and you can also disable
153

153

00:05:32.450  -->  00:05:34.010
some tools as well that they are
154

154

00:05:34.010  -->  00:05:35.660
installed, but I would generally
155

155

00:05:35.660  -->  00:05:37.820
recommend you just leave everything as is,
156

156

00:05:37.820  -->  00:05:39.080
noting that you can come back and
157

157

00:05:39.080  -->  00:05:41.660
changes later if you do decide to and
158

158

00:05:41.660  -->  00:05:43.250
one other thing to keep in mind is if
159

159

00:05:43.250  -->  00:05:45.080
you're running the or I've selected the
160

160

00:05:45.080  -->  00:05:47.330
ultimate edition, its probably going to be
161

161

00:05:47.330  -->  00:05:49.160
more options here different plugins so
162

162

00:05:49.160  -->  00:05:50.150
the screen might look a little bit
163

163

00:05:50.150  -->  00:05:51.740
different and that's because of the
164

164

00:05:51.740  -->  00:05:53.960
extra functionality that the Ultimate
165

165

00:05:53.960  -->  00:05:55.760
Edition gives you, in my case I'm gonna
166

166

00:05:55.760  -->  00:05:57.190
click on next without changing anything
167

167

00:05:57.190  -->  00:05:59.090
and we've got a couple of other options
168

168

00:05:59.090  -->  00:06:01.850
there to download some other featured
169

169

00:06:01.850  -->  00:06:03.350
plugins, we don't need them in this
170

170

00:06:03.350  -->  00:06:04.730
course so I'm just going to click on
171

171

00:06:04.730  -->  00:06:08.210
start using IntelliJ IDEA it'll ask you
172

172

00:06:08.210  -->  00:06:09.950
for password so just type in your
173

173

00:06:09.950  -->  00:06:13.700
password and that will now start
174

174

00:06:13.700  -->  00:06:16.190
IntelliJ IDEA. Alright, so this point
175

175

00:06:16.190  -->  00:06:18.470
we've started IntelliJ but we've got a
176

176

00:06:18.470  -->  00:06:20.120
couple of other configuration options we
177

177

00:06:20.120  -->  00:06:22.610
need to do and the first one is we need
178

178

00:06:22.610  -->  00:06:24.410
to define the Java development kit or
179

179

00:06:24.410  -->  00:06:26.510
configure that, we can click on that or
180

180

00:06:26.510  -->  00:06:28.780
select that by clicking on configure,
181

181

00:06:28.780  -->  00:06:31.580
clicking on project defaults and then
182

182

00:06:31.580  -->  00:06:35.030
choosing project structure, once we do
183

183

00:06:35.030  -->  00:06:37.430
that we get this screen and if you don't
184

184

00:06:37.430  -->  00:06:39.560
see project SDKs selected you might need
185

185

00:06:39.560  -->  00:06:41.690
to make sure that you've actually down
186

186

00:06:41.690  -->  00:06:43.940
here you've clicked on project because
187

187

00:06:43.940  -->  00:06:45.140
if you clicked on another option in the
188

188

00:06:45.140  -->  00:06:46.730
past or something you may not see it but
189

189

00:06:46.730  -->  00:06:47.960
clicking your project will show that
190

190

00:06:47.960  -->  00:06:50.060
again you can see at the moment it's
191

191

00:06:50.060  -->  00:06:53.000
showing that project SDK, in fact there
192

192

00:06:53.000  -->  00:06:55.400
isn't an SDK so what we need to do is
193

193

00:06:55.400  -->  00:06:58.160
associate the Java development kit that
194

194

00:06:58.160  -->  00:07:00.050
we've installed in a previous video
195

195

00:07:00.050  -->  00:07:02.900
with IntelliJ so that IntelliJ can use
196

196

00:07:02.900  -->  00:07:05.270
that from programming, so to do that we
197

197

00:07:05.270  -->  00:07:10.669
just click on new and select JDK
198

198

00:07:10.669  -->  00:07:12.800
now generally speaking when we do that,
199

199

00:07:12.800  -->  00:07:15.289
it will automatically find the Java
200

200

00:07:15.289  -->  00:07:17.360
development kit that has been downloaded,
201

201

00:07:17.360  -->  00:07:19.189
that we downloaded previously and if you
202

202

00:07:19.189  -->  00:07:20.449
have a look there in the path, you can
203

203

00:07:20.449  -->  00:07:22.310
see that there's the Java development
204

204

00:07:22.310  -->  00:07:24.259
kit data that we downloaded in a
205

205

00:07:24.259  -->  00:07:26.060
previous video downloaded and installed
206

206

00:07:26.060  -->  00:07:28.849
I didn't need to do anything, then some
207

207

00:07:28.849  -->  00:07:30.110
macs you might find that it won't
208

208

00:07:30.110  -->  00:07:31.939
automatically find that for some reason,
209

209

00:07:31.939  -->  00:07:33.889
if that's the case that's actually the path
210

210

00:07:33.889  -->  00:07:35.060
there, you can see on the screen there
211

211

00:07:35.060  -->  00:07:36.770
that would be where you'd go, you never
212

212

00:07:36.770  -->  00:07:39.229
get to library Java, Java virtual
213

213

00:07:39.229  -->  00:07:41.360
machines and you'd make sure the Java
214

214

00:07:41.360  -->  00:07:43.659
development kit was selected the JDK,
215

215

00:07:43.659  -->  00:07:46.039
making sure you haven't selected a JRE
216

216

00:07:46.039  -->  00:07:48.529
which is also an option then you go to
217

217

00:07:48.529  -->  00:07:51.139
the content the home folder, once you do
218

218

00:07:51.139  -->  00:07:52.729
that, that's all you need to do and IntelliJ
219

219

00:07:52.729  -->  00:07:54.800
can do the rest, but in my case as you
220

220

00:07:54.800  -->  00:07:56.360
saw it automatically found it so
221

221

00:07:56.360  -->  00:07:57.620
chances are good that it will do the
222

222

00:07:57.620  -->  00:08:00.020
same for you and your Mac, click on open
223

223

00:08:00.020  -->  00:08:02.479
and you can see now we have got an SDK
224

224

00:08:02.479  -->  00:08:06.080
configured and if it's not selected for
225

225

00:08:06.080  -->  00:08:07.279
some reason, make sure that it is
226

226

00:08:07.279  -->  00:08:09.110
selected there, the other thing to do
227

227

00:08:09.110  -->  00:08:11.509
here is to make sure that SDK default is
228

228

00:08:11.509  -->  00:08:13.370
selected it is by default and that's
229

229

00:08:13.370  -->  00:08:15.110
version 8, you can see that's selected
230

230

00:08:15.110  -->  00:08:16.879
there we don't need to do anything
231

231

00:08:16.879  -->  00:08:18.589
because that's the correct option,
232

232

00:08:18.589  -->  00:08:20.810
so once we've done that we can click on ok,
233

233

00:08:20.810  -->  00:08:22.580
we've now configured our Java
234

234

00:08:22.580  -->  00:08:24.589
development kit then there's just a few
235

235

00:08:24.589  -->  00:08:27.349
other settings that I recommend you go
236

236

00:08:27.349  -->  00:08:29.089
ahead and configure before we finish the
237

237

00:08:29.089  -->  00:08:31.219
video, so to do that click on configure
238

238

00:08:31.219  -->  00:08:34.669
and click on preferences, the next thing
239

239

00:08:34.669  -->  00:08:35.630
we want to do is come down here to
240

240

00:08:35.630  -->  00:08:38.750
editor, expand their option and then come
241

241

00:08:38.750  -->  00:08:40.010
down here to general and expand an
242

242

00:08:40.010  -->  00:08:43.099
option as well, try auto import first
243

243

00:08:43.099  -->  00:08:45.230
select that option we want to go ahead
244

244

00:08:45.230  -->  00:08:46.820
and click on the check box for add
245

245

00:08:46.820  -->  00:08:48.560
ambiguous imports on the fly and
246

246

00:08:48.560  -->  00:08:51.320
optimize imports on the fly, select both
247

247

00:08:51.320  -->  00:08:53.269
of those and then let's make the coding
248

248

00:08:53.269  -->  00:08:54.620
a little bit easier and you'll see that
249

249

00:08:54.620  -->  00:08:56.000
in action as we go through the course
250

250

00:08:56.000  -->  00:08:57.589
click on ok.
251

251

00:08:57.589  -->  00:08:59.899
actually I'll click on apply, because
252

252

00:08:59.899  -->  00:09:00.910
I need to go back and go to appearance
253

253

00:09:00.910  -->  00:09:03.529
click on that the other thing is to
254

254

00:09:03.529  -->  00:09:05.449
check to make sure he's activated always
255

255

00:09:05.449  -->  00:09:07.790
enabled its shown line numbers, so you
256

256

00:09:07.790  -->  00:09:10.100
can see in my case that show line
257

257

00:09:10.100  -->  00:09:12.500
numbers is checked and we want to do
258

258

00:09:12.500  -->  00:09:13.490
that because that makes it a little
259

259

00:09:13.490  -->  00:09:15.410
bit easier when you're programming to
260

260

00:09:15.410  -->  00:09:17.959
see which line number you're on, so that's selected
261

261

00:09:17.959  -->  00:09:20.810
click on ok. Alright, so at this point
262

262

00:09:20.810  -->  00:09:22.970
we've now finished with the installation
263

263

00:09:22.970  -->  00:09:24.990
and configuration of IntelliJ IDEA.
264

264

00:09:24.990  -->  00:09:28.660
Let's move on to the next video.
