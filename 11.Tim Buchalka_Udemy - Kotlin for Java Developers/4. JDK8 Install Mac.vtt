00:00:04.730  -->  00:00:06.410
In this video, we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06.410  -->  00:00:08.389
and download the Java development kit
3

3

00:00:08.389  -->  00:00:10.940
also known as the JDK, we're going to do
4

4

00:00:10.940  -->  00:00:12.889
that on a Mac computer. Now if you're
5

5

00:00:12.889  -->  00:00:14.330
running Windows or a Linux machine,
6

6

00:00:14.330  -->  00:00:16.640
you'll want to check out the separate
7

7

00:00:16.640  -->  00:00:18.259
video that I've created for each of
8

8

00:00:18.259  -->  00:00:19.970
those operating systems and that's
9

9

00:00:19.970  -->  00:00:21.140
because the process is slightly
10

10

00:00:21.140  -->  00:00:23.149
different for each operating system so
11

11

00:00:23.149  -->  00:00:24.919
this is the Mac video, so if you're in it
12

12

00:00:24.919  -->  00:00:26.599
if you're actually on a Mac you're in
13

13

00:00:26.599  -->  00:00:28.489
the right place, so I'm going to start
14

14

00:00:28.489  -->  00:00:30.079
off here by opening a browser and we're
15

15

00:00:30.079  -->  00:00:33.500
going to go to Java.oracle.com
16

16

00:00:33.500  -->  00:00:35.930
and Oracle is the name of the
17

17

00:00:35.930  -->  00:00:38.300
company that owned the Java product, once
18

18

00:00:38.300  -->  00:00:39.560
you get to that page, you can come down
19

19

00:00:39.560  -->  00:00:42.560
here to technologies click on java SE
20

20

00:00:42.560  -->  00:00:45.530
which stands for standard edition with
21

21

00:00:45.530  -->  00:00:49.910
that page loads click on downloads so
22

22

00:00:49.910  -->  00:00:51.560
it'll bring you to this page, we're going
23

23

00:00:51.560  -->  00:00:54.020
to click on this little image here to
24

24

00:00:54.020  -->  00:00:57.470
download the JDK, now you'll get a page
25

25

00:00:57.470  -->  00:00:59.660
it opens up and it will say Java SE
26

26

00:00:59.660  -->  00:01:01.340
development kit as you can see here and
27

27

00:01:01.340  -->  00:01:04.489
you'll choose the version that's showing,
28

28

00:01:04.489  -->  00:01:06.290
so at the moment it says Java is the
29

29

00:01:06.290  -->  00:01:10.189
development kit 8u144, 144 is the
30

30

00:01:10.189  -->  00:01:12.439
release number, the Oracle actually
31

31

00:01:12.439  -->  00:01:15.109
update this on a regular basis, so this
32

32

00:01:15.109  -->  00:01:17.090
number will change over time, it will
33

33

00:01:17.090  -->  00:01:18.469
certainly change from the date that I've
34

34

00:01:18.469  -->  00:01:20.359
recorded this video, so I'm going to run
35

35

00:01:20.359  -->  00:01:21.829
this page so you can just grab whatever
36

36

00:01:21.829  -->  00:01:24.619
version that is currently available,
37

37

00:01:24.619  -->  00:01:25.759
the other thing we need to do is look over
38

38

00:01:25.759  -->  00:01:27.950
here to the right of where it says Mac
39

39

00:01:27.950  -->  00:01:31.850
OSX and click on this thing here and it
40

40

00:01:31.850  -->  00:01:33.049
lets you come up if you haven't clicked
41

41

00:01:33.049  -->  00:01:34.369
on already this accept License Agreement
42

42

00:01:34.369  -->  00:01:36.409
it will remind you you need to do that
43

43

00:01:36.409  -->  00:01:38.689
so I pick that radio button and then
44

44

00:01:38.689  -->  00:01:40.819
come over here again click it and this
45

45

00:01:40.819  -->  00:01:43.579
time which should download. Now I'm going
46

46

00:01:43.579  -->  00:01:45.319
to actually download this on my computer
47

47

00:01:45.319  -->  00:01:46.609
and you can see that I've already done
48

48

00:01:46.609  -->  00:01:48.139
this in the past but just for the
49

49

00:01:48.139  -->  00:01:49.909
purposes of doing it again, I'm going to
50

50

00:01:49.909  -->  00:01:52.240
do the same thing and just save it again
51

51

00:01:52.240  -->  00:01:54.319
and you can see it downloading in the
52

52

00:01:54.319  -->  00:01:56.450
left hand bottom corner, I'm going to
53

53

00:01:56.450  -->  00:01:59.569
pause the video to that's finished and
54

54

00:01:59.569  -->  00:02:01.060
see it's finished there I just need to
55

55

00:02:01.060  -->  00:02:03.829
click on here and click on open or
56

56

00:02:03.829  -->  00:02:05.119
depending on the browser you're using
57

57

00:02:05.119  -->  00:02:07.219
you might need to navigate to the folder
58

58

00:02:07.219  -->  00:02:09.619
where you downloaded the product, you'll
59

59

00:02:09.619  -->  00:02:12.319
get this little pop-up double click this
60

60

00:02:12.319  -->  00:02:16.920
now, start installation and click on continue
61

61

00:02:16.920  -->  00:02:19.290
in front install, will come up and ask
62

62

00:02:19.290  -->  00:02:20.610
you for your password so enter your
63

63

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:24.900
details, it'll go ahead and actually do
64

64

00:02:24.900  -->  00:02:28.110
the installation for us.
65

65

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:31.260
Close and we have that option
66

66

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:32.760
click on move to trash because we're
67

67

00:02:32.760  -->  00:02:34.200
finished with that now. We'll close that
68

68

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:37.410
down so I can close the browser down and
69

69

00:02:37.410  -->  00:02:38.580
so that's it we've now installed with
70

70

00:02:38.580  -->  00:02:40.830
the Java development kit on a Mac and see
71

71

00:02:40.830  -->  00:02:43.550
you in the next video.
