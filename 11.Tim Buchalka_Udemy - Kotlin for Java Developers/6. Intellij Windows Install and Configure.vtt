00:00:04.759  -->  00:00:06.620
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06.620  -->  00:00:09.799
and download and install IntelliJ IDEA,
3

3

00:00:09.799  -->  00:00:12.830
which is the editor or the IDE that
4

4

00:00:12.830  -->  00:00:14.330
we're going to be using in this course
5

5

00:00:14.330  -->  00:00:17.419
for our programs. Now this particular
6

6

00:00:17.419  -->  00:00:20.180
video is for Windows platform. Now if
7

7

00:00:20.180  -->  00:00:21.860
you're running a Mac or you're running
8

8

00:00:21.860  -->  00:00:24.200
on Linux, there are separate videos for
9

9

00:00:24.200  -->  00:00:25.790
both those operating systems in this
10

10

00:00:25.790  -->  00:00:27.619
section of the course, so I refer to
11

11

00:00:27.619  -->  00:00:29.599
those videos as appropriate or if you're
12

12

00:00:29.599  -->  00:00:31.270
on Windows you're in the right place.
13

13

00:00:31.270  -->  00:00:34.100
So the first thing to do is to go to the
14

14

00:00:34.100  -->  00:00:39.800
website jetbrains.com, that's the site
15

15

00:00:39.800  -->  00:00:42.950
all the creators of this IntelliJ IDEA
16

16

00:00:42.950  -->  00:00:44.750
product that we going to be using,
17

17

00:00:44.750  -->  00:00:46.280
one you get there and come down here and
18

18

00:00:46.280  -->  00:00:48.170
click on IntelliJ, if it's showing if by
19

19

00:00:48.170  -->  00:00:49.670
chance it's not showing for some reason,
20

20

00:00:49.670  -->  00:00:53.090
go to IDE or IDEs and click on IntelliJ
21

21

00:00:53.090  -->  00:00:55.400
IDEA, either way click on that link to go
22

22

00:00:55.400  -->  00:00:58.640
to that page, next option is to click on
23

23

00:00:58.640  -->  00:01:01.820
download, you're then presented with two
24

24

00:01:01.820  -->  00:01:03.829
options to download either the Ultimate
25

25

00:01:03.829  -->  00:01:06.710
Edition or the Community Edition. Now I'm
26

26

00:01:06.710  -->  00:01:08.000
going to go ahead and download the
27

27

00:01:08.000  -->  00:01:09.770
Community Edition, then we're going to
28

28

00:01:09.770  -->  00:01:11.630
talk a little bit about it once it's
29

29

00:01:11.630  -->  00:01:13.479
downloading just to save a bit of time,
30

30

00:01:13.479  -->  00:01:16.729
so I clicked on download as you saw
31

31

00:01:16.729  -->  00:01:17.719
it should pop up you can see down the
32

32

00:01:17.719  -->  00:01:19.219
bottom, I'm going to click on save to
33

33

00:01:19.219  -->  00:01:21.530
save that, I'm just going to go back just
34

34

00:01:21.530  -->  00:01:23.990
to show you the page with the Ultimate
35

35

00:01:23.990  -->  00:01:25.899
Edition and the Community Edition and
36

36

00:01:25.899  -->  00:01:28.219
just talk about they're both there on
37

37

00:01:28.219  -->  00:01:30.499
both versions there. Now the Ultimate
38

38

00:01:30.499  -->  00:01:33.079
Edition is the commercial product, so if
39

39

00:01:33.079  -->  00:01:34.939
you want to use that past a trial period
40

40

00:01:34.939  -->  00:01:36.469
you will need to pay money for it and
41

41

00:01:36.469  -->  00:01:38.029
you'll need to pay JetBrains for that.
42

42

00:01:38.029  -->  00:01:40.369
The Community Edition on the other hand
43

43

00:01:40.369  -->  00:01:43.100
is completely free and you'll never have
44

44

00:01:43.100  -->  00:01:44.450
to pay anything for it, so it can be a
45

45

00:01:44.450  -->  00:01:46.549
good choice in many cases to take the
46

46

00:01:46.549  -->  00:01:48.770
free and open-source version, but if you
47

47

00:01:48.770  -->  00:01:51.049
do want to have access to other
48

48

00:01:51.049  -->  00:01:53.359
commercial features for example Java
49

49

00:01:53.359  -->  00:01:54.950
Enterprise Edition and using other
50

50

00:01:54.950  -->  00:01:57.349
frameworks that aren't compatible or
51

51

00:01:57.349  -->  00:01:59.599
aren't available in the free version,
52

52

00:01:59.599  -->  00:02:01.700
the Community Edition you can take this
53

53

00:02:01.700  -->  00:02:04.009
option here and with the Ultimate
54

54

00:02:04.009  -->  00:02:06.649
Edition there's a 30-day trial option so
55

55

00:02:06.649  -->  00:02:08.300
you can try it out for free for 30 days
56

56

00:02:08.300  -->  00:02:10.130
and then after that ordinarily you
57

57

00:02:10.130  -->  00:02:12.230
would have to pay for it, so refer to
58

58

00:02:12.230  -->  00:02:13.670
that if you decide to download the
59

59

00:02:13.670  -->  00:02:16.310
Ultimate Edition, otherwise as you saw me
60

60

00:02:16.310  -->  00:02:18.710
doing this video I've downloaded to the community edition
61

61

00:02:18.710  -->  00:02:20.210
and that will certainly work okay in
62

62

00:02:20.210  -->  00:02:23.030
this course. Alright so now that that's
63

63

00:02:23.030  -->  00:02:24.770
downloaded, I'm gonna click on run so
64

64

00:02:24.770  -->  00:02:26.990
depending on your browser, you may need
65

65

00:02:26.990  -->  00:02:28.400
to navigate to the folder where you've
66

66

00:02:28.400  -->  00:02:30.650
downloaded it in any event to start up
67

67

00:02:30.650  -->  00:02:32.510
the installer, in this case I've clicked
68

68

00:02:32.510  -->  00:02:34.430
run and it's going to give us the option
69

69

00:02:34.430  -->  00:02:36.290
to start installing, you're going to
70

70

00:02:36.290  -->  00:02:39.080
close the browser down now and they're
71

71

00:02:39.080  -->  00:02:40.220
gonna go through and follow the setup
72

72

00:02:40.220  -->  00:02:42.590
process I'm gonna click on next I'm
73

73

00:02:42.590  -->  00:02:45.410
going to just assume or select or use
74

74

00:02:45.410  -->  00:02:47.660
the default location, the destination
75

75

00:02:47.660  -->  00:02:50.870
folder, don't need to change that.
76

76

00:02:50.870  -->  00:02:52.340
Now the other option you'll need to know is
77

77

00:02:52.340  -->  00:02:54.050
whether you're running a 32-bit or a
78

78

00:02:54.050  -->  00:02:57.320
64-bit version of Windows. Now in the
79

79

00:02:57.320  -->  00:02:58.940
previous video, I've shown you how to do
80

80

00:02:58.940  -->  00:03:01.960
that in the JDK the Java development kit
81

81

00:03:01.960  -->  00:03:04.100
video I showed you how to determine
82

82

00:03:04.100  -->  00:03:05.600
whether you're running a 32-bit or
83

83

00:03:05.600  -->  00:03:09.050
64-bit so depending on what you found
84

84

00:03:09.050  -->  00:03:10.220
when you're downloading that video,
85

85

00:03:10.220  -->  00:03:12.650
select the relevant option in my case
86

86

00:03:12.650  -->  00:03:14.300
I was running a 64-bit edition so I'm
87

87

00:03:14.300  -->  00:03:15.890
going to select that obviously you'd
88

88

00:03:15.890  -->  00:03:17.780
select a 32-bit if that's what you're
89

89

00:03:17.780  -->  00:03:19.550
running on your windows is
90

90

00:03:19.550  -->  00:03:21.740
running under 32-bit version and I
91

91

00:03:21.740  -->  00:03:22.790
suggest you click these three
92

92

00:03:22.790  -->  00:03:25.010
associations, there's check boxes and
93

93

00:03:25.010  -->  00:03:27.320
that just enables those particular
94

94

00:03:27.320  -->  00:03:29.090
languages, those files they've got that
95

95

00:03:29.090  -->  00:03:31.160
file extension to be opened up in
96

96

00:03:31.160  -->  00:03:32.540
IntelliJ and that's usually what you
97

97

00:03:32.540  -->  00:03:36.890
want to do and click on next, click on
98

98

00:03:36.890  -->  00:03:39.170
install and that's now going ahead and
99

99

00:03:39.170  -->  00:03:41.540
installing IntelliJ IDEA, so I'm just
100

100

00:03:41.540  -->  00:03:43.010
going to fast forward this video now to
101

101

00:03:43.010  -->  00:03:44.270
save a bit of time and we come back
102

102

00:03:44.270  -->  00:03:49.420
after it's finished installing.
103

103

00:03:49.420  -->  00:03:51.410
Alright, so you can say it's just about
104

104

00:03:51.410  -->  00:03:55.269
finished now we'll just let that finish off.
105

105

00:03:55.269  -->  00:03:57.469
Alright so it's now actually finished
106

106

00:03:57.469  -->  00:03:58.969
the next option is just to click on the
107

107

00:03:58.969  -->  00:04:01.400
check box, so we can run IntelliJ and
108

108

00:04:01.400  -->  00:04:03.170
that's an irrespective of whether you've
109

109

00:04:03.170  -->  00:04:04.790
downloaded the ultimate or in this case
110

110

00:04:04.790  -->  00:04:07.250
the Community Edition, so click on that
111

111

00:04:07.250  -->  00:04:09.439
and click on finish and it's going to
112

112

00:04:09.439  -->  00:04:12.109
start up IntelliJ for us. Now usually
113

113

00:04:12.109  -->  00:04:14.359
you'll see this option and it's coming
114

114

00:04:14.359  -->  00:04:16.009
up telling us that we've got an option
115

115

00:04:16.009  -->  00:04:18.289
to try and import some settings. Now this
116

116

00:04:18.289  -->  00:04:19.579
would be useful if you're running
117

117

00:04:19.579  -->  00:04:21.620
IntelliJ or you have installed a
118

118

00:04:21.620  -->  00:04:23.120
previous version and you want to retain
119

119

00:04:23.120  -->  00:04:25.039
the settings that you've configured in
120

120

00:04:25.039  -->  00:04:26.630
this case I haven't actually installed
121

121

00:04:26.630  -->  00:04:28.550
IntelliJ on this computer and this is
122

122

00:04:28.550  -->  00:04:30.650
most likely the option you'll see, so you
123

123

00:04:30.650  -->  00:04:32.139
can click on do not import settings
124

124

00:04:32.139  -->  00:04:34.940
otherwise there's a location usually
125

125

00:04:34.940  -->  00:04:37.430
selected or found by IntelliJ and you
126

126

00:04:37.430  -->  00:04:39.440
could select that and get IntelliJ to
127

127

00:04:39.440  -->  00:04:41.570
import those settings and use them in
128

128

00:04:41.570  -->  00:04:43.729
your installation of IntelliJ, but in my
129

129

00:04:43.729  -->  00:04:45.289
case I'm going to leave the default do
130

130

00:04:45.289  -->  00:04:48.820
not import settings and click ok.
131

131

00:04:48.820  -->  00:04:50.930
Alright next we need to go through a
132

132

00:04:50.930  -->  00:04:53.780
configuration section to just set up
133

133

00:04:53.780  -->  00:04:55.580
some settings and to tell IntelliJ what
134

134

00:04:55.580  -->  00:04:58.009
options we want, now this is the theme
135

135

00:04:58.009  -->  00:04:59.539
and you can see the one on the left has
136

136

00:04:59.539  -->  00:05:01.280
got a white background the one on the
137

137

00:05:01.280  -->  00:05:02.870
right has got a darker background, we can
138

138

00:05:02.870  -->  00:05:04.849
choose either so select which one you
139

139

00:05:04.849  -->  00:05:07.430
would like prefer to work with knowing
140

140

00:05:07.430  -->  00:05:09.229
that you can always change it later I'm
141

141

00:05:09.229  -->  00:05:10.639
going to select the one with the white
142

142

00:05:10.639  -->  00:05:13.729
background and click on next. Now there's
143

143

00:05:13.729  -->  00:05:16.370
a series of plugins on this screen and
144

144

00:05:16.370  -->  00:05:18.470
you can choose all sorts of things and
145

145

00:05:18.470  -->  00:05:20.630
what I suggest you do generally is leave
146

146

00:05:20.630  -->  00:05:23.120
this as it is now and come back later if
147

147

00:05:23.120  -->  00:05:24.710
you decide you want to install plug-ins
148

148

00:05:24.710  -->  00:05:26.960
and just the other thing to note is if
149

149

00:05:26.960  -->  00:05:29.180
you're running the ultimate version of
150

150

00:05:29.180  -->  00:05:30.889
IntelliJ you'll actually have more
151

151

00:05:30.889  -->  00:05:33.050
options to install plug-ins about I'm
152

152

00:05:33.050  -->  00:05:34.690
just going to click on next,
153

153

00:05:34.690  -->  00:05:37.970
same deal here if we want to change or
154

154

00:05:37.970  -->  00:05:40.010
install these two things which we aren't
155

155

00:05:40.010  -->  00:05:42.169
going to use in this particular course,
156

156

00:05:42.169  -->  00:05:43.130
you can do that now
157

157

00:05:43.130  -->  00:05:44.630
but I'm going to skip both of those and
158

158

00:05:44.630  -->  00:05:48.889
click on start using IntelliJ IDEA and
159

159

00:05:48.889  -->  00:05:50.300
you can see that that's now loaded up
160

160

00:05:50.300  -->  00:05:53.180
IntelliJ. Now the next step we need to do
161

161

00:05:53.180  -->  00:05:54.919
is actually configure the Java
162

162

00:05:54.919  -->  00:05:57.409
development kit and we need to do that
163

163

00:05:57.409  -->  00:05:59.030
so that we can actually program in this
164

164

00:05:59.030  -->  00:06:01.430
course, so the way to do that is to click
165

165

00:06:01.430  -->  00:06:04.130
on configure and click on project
166

166

00:06:04.130  -->  00:06:08.730
defaults and then select project structure
167

167

00:06:08.730  -->  00:06:10.740
and that'll bring us to the screen and
168

168

00:06:10.740  -->  00:06:12.750
if you're not seeing project SDK,
169

169

00:06:12.750  -->  00:06:14.340
showing there, you might have been
170

170

00:06:14.340  -->  00:06:15.960
clicked in another area so just make
171

171

00:06:15.960  -->  00:06:17.400
sure you clicked a project and that will
172

172

00:06:17.400  -->  00:06:19.710
show that and you click on the drop down
173

173

00:06:19.710  -->  00:06:21.030
just to see whether there's been one
174

174

00:06:21.030  -->  00:06:22.620
configured but in my case you can see it
175

175

00:06:22.620  -->  00:06:25.890
says no SDK, SDK meaning software
176

176

00:06:25.890  -->  00:06:28.020
development kit, so what we need to do is
177

177

00:06:28.020  -->  00:06:30.180
create one so that so we can actually
178

178

00:06:30.180  -->  00:06:33.180
program within IntelliJ, so what
179

179

00:06:33.180  -->  00:06:35.220
we need to do is basically associate the
180

180

00:06:35.220  -->  00:06:37.170
Java development kit that we've
181

181

00:06:37.170  -->  00:06:40.290
installed previously with IntelliJ, so to
182

182

00:06:40.290  -->  00:06:42.750
do that I'm going to click on new and
183

183

00:06:42.750  -->  00:06:46.230
I'm going to select JDK. Now what we need
184

184

00:06:46.230  -->  00:06:48.450
to do is navigate to the folder where we
185

185

00:06:48.450  -->  00:06:50.550
installed the Java development kit and I
186

186

00:06:50.550  -->  00:06:52.110
did talk about that in the Java
187

187

00:06:52.110  -->  00:06:54.870
development kit installation video,
188

188

00:06:54.870  -->  00:06:56.490
the need to know where that was installed
189

189

00:06:56.490  -->  00:06:58.560
and if you recall that on my machine in
190

190

00:06:58.560  -->  00:07:00.330
that video it was installed in the
191

191

00:07:00.330  -->  00:07:02.700
Program Files folder, so navigate to that
192

192

00:07:02.700  -->  00:07:05.490
folder and go into the Java subfolder
193

193

00:07:05.490  -->  00:07:06.960
and you'll see that there's these two
194

194

00:07:06.960  -->  00:07:10.920
folder locations - JDK and the JRE and
195

195

00:07:10.920  -->  00:07:13.380
this number may change depending on when
196

196

00:07:13.380  -->  00:07:15.180
you're watching this video but the one
197

197

00:07:15.180  -->  00:07:17.520
you want to select is the JDK then go
198

198

00:07:17.520  -->  00:07:20.130
ahead and click on JDK and click on ok
199

199

00:07:20.130  -->  00:07:22.200
and just before I click on ok,
200

200

00:07:22.200  -->  00:07:24.000
it is important to have a look and make
201

201

00:07:24.000  -->  00:07:25.590
sure that you've selected program files
202

202

00:07:25.590  -->  00:07:28.740
and not program files x86 because
203

203

00:07:28.740  -->  00:07:29.940
there's two directories in there that
204

204

00:07:29.940  -->  00:07:31.890
are very similar and you can see there's
205

205

00:07:31.890  -->  00:07:33.510
this program files x86,
206

206

00:07:33.510  -->  00:07:36.450
if I open that up and have a look you'll
207

207

00:07:36.450  -->  00:07:38.010
see that there's no Java folder there,
208

208

00:07:38.010  -->  00:07:40.530
so a common question will come up far
209

209

00:07:40.530  -->  00:07:42.630
from students not being able to follow
210

210

00:07:42.630  -->  00:07:44.220
the Java folder and that's because
211

211

00:07:44.220  -->  00:07:45.840
they're looking in the Program Files x86
212

212

00:07:45.840  -->  00:07:48.900
but in my case close it back up again
213

213

00:07:48.900  -->  00:07:51.240
we're in the right place here we're in
214

214

00:07:51.240  -->  00:07:53.160
the Program Files Java and I've clicked
215

215

00:07:53.160  -->  00:07:55.620
on the JDK and make sure you don't click
216

216

00:07:55.620  -->  00:07:57.990
on the JRE because we need the JDK
217

217

00:07:57.990  -->  00:08:00.870
because that's the development kit which
218

218

00:08:00.870  -->  00:08:02.670
includes the extra tools that we need to
219

219

00:08:02.670  -->  00:08:04.020
be able to program ,so I'm going to click
220

220

00:08:04.020  -->  00:08:06.750
on ok with that selected and you can see
221

221

00:08:06.750  -->  00:08:09.000
any other project SDK has been changed
222

222

00:08:09.000  -->  00:08:10.950
here in the past that was known as SDK
223

223

00:08:10.950  -->  00:08:12.540
right now I've got an option there so
224

224

00:08:12.540  -->  00:08:14.010
that's not selected automatically make
225

225

00:08:14.010  -->  00:08:16.110
sure that is selected and the next thing
226

226

00:08:16.110  -->  00:08:17.280
you want to do here is make sure that
227

227

00:08:17.280  -->  00:08:20.340
project language level we can actually
228

228

00:08:20.340  -->  00:08:22.590
see that it says SDK default eight
229

229

00:08:22.590  -->  00:08:24.570
so it is possible to choose other
230

230

00:08:24.570  -->  00:08:25.800
versions, but you won't need to do that
231

231

00:08:25.800  -->  00:08:27.300
at this time so I'll leave that
232

232

00:08:27.300  -->  00:08:29.550
particular version selected, so we don't
233

233

00:08:29.550  -->  00:08:30.870
need to change anything else on this
234

234

00:08:30.870  -->  00:08:34.530
page, I'm going to click on ok we've got
235

235

00:08:34.530  -->  00:08:35.760
a few other settings that we need to
236

236

00:08:35.760  -->  00:08:37.890
configure and then we can actually move
237

237

00:08:37.890  -->  00:08:39.870
on to start our working with program
238

238

00:08:39.870  -->  00:08:41.789
code, so we come back here and click on
239

239

00:08:41.789  -->  00:08:45.470
configure I'm going to click on settings.
240

240

00:08:45.470  -->  00:08:47.700
Once we've done that what do I actually
241

241

00:08:47.700  -->  00:08:51.030
come over here down into editor, we'll
242

242

00:08:51.030  -->  00:08:54.300
expand that out and I click on an expand
243

243

00:08:54.300  -->  00:08:56.160
general and want to do two things
244

244

00:08:56.160  -->  00:08:58.250
firstly, I want to click on auto import
245

245

00:08:58.250  -->  00:09:00.690
you want to make sure that to both add
246

246

00:09:00.690  -->  00:09:02.460
an ambiguous inputs on the fly is
247

247

00:09:02.460  -->  00:09:04.890
clicked and optimized imports on the fly
248

248

00:09:04.890  -->  00:09:06.780
and then I'll just make your coding a
249

249

00:09:06.780  -->  00:09:08.700
little bit easier as we go through the
250

250

00:09:08.700  -->  00:09:10.460
course, so I'm going to apply that change
251

251

00:09:10.460  -->  00:09:14.430
then next to click on is appearance and
252

252

00:09:14.430  -->  00:09:16.140
make sure that show line numbers is
253

253

00:09:16.140  -->  00:09:18.240
selected, now it is actually showing
254

254

00:09:18.240  -->  00:09:19.650
us a default for me but it's for
255

255

00:09:19.650  -->  00:09:21.690
summaries and it wasn't checked make
256

256

00:09:21.690  -->  00:09:22.950
sure you do check that shown line
257

257

00:09:22.950  -->  00:09:25.380
numbers and once you've done that,
258

258

00:09:25.380  -->  00:09:27.810
you can click on ok and we're actually done
259

259

00:09:27.810  -->  00:09:29.550
at this point, so I'm going to end the
260

260

00:09:29.550  -->  00:09:31.080
video here now and we can move on to the
261

261

00:09:31.080  -->  00:09:36.230
next video and start making use of IntelliJ IDEA.
