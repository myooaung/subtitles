00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.050
Well that's it we're done.

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.640
I'm going to quickly recap what we covered.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.210
Quick differences between Cartland and Java data types.

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.010
All the good object oriented stuff like classes and interfaces and inheritance generics collections

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.320
lambda expressions file IO and Java interoperability.

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.420
And there were a few other topics thrown in for good measure.

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.870
I hope you found the Course helpful and feel that you can now get started with Katlin And keep in mind

8
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.730
that it's not all or nothing because cotland is interoperable with Java.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.930
You can ease yourself in rather than having to use only Cartland from this point forward.

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.660
And best of all you can leverage all your Java knowledge because everything in the JDK is still there

11
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.920
for you to use.

12
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.650
If you think this course would be useful for other Java developers who want to learn Katlin consider

13
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.480
leaving a review to let other students know that the Course would be a good investment for them and

14
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.030
let me know in the Q&amp;A section for this video.

15
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.660
What you think about CANTLIN do you think it's an improvement over Java.

16
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.810
Are there things you really like about it or something you don't like about it.

17
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.590
Do you think you'll start using it.

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.640
Let us know in the Q&amp;A section.

19
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.450
Now for more tech courses check out learn programming academies courses learn programming daughter Academy.

20
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.010
There are courses on Java Python Java certification and even an android lib GDX course for game developers

21
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.940
and there's a ton of new courses on the way as well including C-Sharp javascript ph P Ruby and a lot

22
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.940
more now probably the most relevant course for you will be Tim Machakos Android app development with

23
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.650
Koplin.

24
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.120
If it's not already released by the time you're watching this video it won't be too far off.

25
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.190
When the course will be released because he's working on the course at the same time I'm working on

26
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.810
this one.

27
00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.670
So if you're interested in writing Android apps in cotland that's the course to check out the latest

28
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.480
courses will always be listed in the last lecture of this course.

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.510
And of course there will be coupon codes there for the courses as well.

30
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.820

OK that's it.

33
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.470
So now it's time for you to go forth and code great Koplin apps.
