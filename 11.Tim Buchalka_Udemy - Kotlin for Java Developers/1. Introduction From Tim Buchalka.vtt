00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.130
Hello and welcome to the Kotlin for Java
Developers course. My name is Tim Buchalka

2

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:09.929
and I'm your instructor in this course.
Now, you might be surprised as you go

3

00:00:09.929  -->  00:00:13.259
through the course to find that the
videos have been recorded by another

4

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:17.460
co-instructor. Her name is Sarah Ettritch
and she originally published this

5

00:00:17.460  -->  00:00:21.810
course on my learn programming academy
udemy channel. That's another channel

6

00:00:21.810  -->  00:00:25.840
that I've got or I work with
co-instructors creating more computer

7

00:00:25.859  -->  00:00:30.539
programming courses. Now, Sarah is now
unavailable to update and enhance this

8

00:00:30.539  -->  00:00:34.530
course and add new content so what I've
done is rather than let the course lapse

9

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:39.570
and get any more outdated, I'll get me
more outdated. I've taken it over with

10

00:00:39.570  -->  00:00:42.989
the goal of making it now a more
up-to-date course and adding new content

11

00:00:42.989  -->  00:00:46.890
to it. So I just wanted to make it clear
that if you're looking at the videos and

12

00:00:46.890  -->  00:00:49.860
wondering well this is a Tim Buchalka
course but why isn't Tim doing the

13

00:00:49.860  -->  00:00:53.789
videos, that's going to happen now over
the coming months. Today in Australia

14

00:00:53.789  -->  00:00:58.410
it's the 1st of February 2019 and it's the day that I've taken over this channel or

15

00:00:58.410  -->  00:01:02.550
taken over this course, I
should say, and I'm here to update it so

16

00:01:02.550  -->  00:01:05.939
if you've been through the course
already and now looking at this video

17

00:01:05.939  -->  00:01:08.700
I would suggest you actually go through to
the end of the course

18

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:12.299
and there's a link there to a survey
where you actually leave some

19

00:01:12.299  -->  00:01:16.110
feedback on what you like to disliked
about the course things you'd like

20

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:20.640
updated added and so on and so forth and
that would be very valuable if you could

21

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:23.850
take a few moments to fill that out
because that will give me the feedback

22

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:28.020
that I need to update the course because
I know that now that we've moved forward

23

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:32.430
the course was great when Kotlin came
out a few years ago when the course was

24

00:01:32.430  -->  00:01:36.360
released a few years ago but Kotlin has
matured as a programming language and

25

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:39.900
there's more features that we need to
add to this course, of course to make it a

26

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:45.600
really effective course, so to that,
feel free to supply some feedback by

27

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:48.659
going to the last section of the course
and you see that there's a lecture there

28

00:01:48.660  -->  00:01:52.200
with details on how to fill out that
survey. That would be much appreciated

29

00:01:52.200  -->  00:01:56.130
The other thing I wanted to let you know
is that Goran, this guy, he's going to be

30

00:01:56.130  -->  00:02:00.509
also an instructor in the course and
he's going to be helping me with the QA,

31

00:02:00.509  -->  00:02:05.280
answering your questions in the Q&amp;A
section of the course. So look out for

32

00:02:05.280  -->  00:02:10.379
Goran as well he's an expert Java and
Kotlin developer perfectly positioned to

33

00:02:10.379  -->  00:02:13.840
provide that support so between the two
of us were here to make this

34

00:02:13.840  -->  00:02:18.610
a great Kotlin course and to give you
the information skills about Kotlin that

35

00:02:18.610  -->  00:02:22.300
you can take on your Kotlin journey to
become a better programmer

36

00:02:22.300  -->  00:02:26.650
So with that in mind I'm
going to say goodbye and I'll see you in

37

00:02:26.650  -->  00:02:30.549
the video and you'll see me popping up
in videos in the future over the coming

38

00:02:30.549  -->  00:02:34.299
months as I start updating the course
and releasing new content. Any questions

39

00:02:34.299  -->  00:02:38.769
feel free to contact us and just one
last thing in the resources section of

40

00:02:38.769  -->  00:02:41.680
this video I think I mentioned that
there's a link and you can find the

41

00:02:41.680  -->  00:02:45.010
resources section in the left hand
corner of this video you'll see that

42

00:02:45.010  -->  00:02:49.120
there's a link to an announcement that I
made in the course related to this

43

00:02:49.120  -->  00:02:52.840
situation with myself, and Sarah and
who's taking over the course so feel

44

00:02:52.840  -->  00:02:56.290
free to check that out and comment on
that etc as needed as well

45

00:02:56.290  -->  00:03:00.160
Let's end the video
here and you can get started now with the

46

00:03:00.160  -->  00:03:03.690
course in the next video cheers for now
