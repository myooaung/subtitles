00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:06,839
In this section, we're going to cover
2

2

00:00:06,839  -->  00:00:08,969
data types. Now you've already seen
3

3

00:00:08,969  -->  00:00:11,250
variable declarations but we glossed
4

4

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:13,980
over the data type part we'll also take
5

5

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:16,800
a brief look at arrays and we'll discuss
6

6

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:19,320
how Kotlin handles null references,
7

7

00:00:19,320  -->  00:00:22,410
this is a huge part of Kotlin, one of the
8

8

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:25,140
guiding principles of Kotlin as we saw
9

9

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:27,900
up at the top of the course is safety
10

10

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:30,930
and so Kotlin does a lot of work to
11

11

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:32,969
protect against null pointer exceptions.
12

12

00:00:32,969  -->  00:00:35,010
Now you might have heard that there are
13

13

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:37,200
no null pointer exceptions in Kotlin but
14

14

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:39,570
that isn't quite true, however you do
15

15

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:42,120
have to go out of your way to get one.
16

16

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:44,960
So let's get started.
