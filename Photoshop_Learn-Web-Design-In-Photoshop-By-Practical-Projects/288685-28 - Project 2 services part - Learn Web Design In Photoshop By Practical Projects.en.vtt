00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
Let's go to the right side.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.350
I'm working on services for this website,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.850
So I khaliq on text room and then tap to activate and you take Slayer and I type our

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.660
services in these parts so you can customize this title by changing the thickness to boned

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.660
.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:44.310
And then you can a line your titles by using align vertical centers for these titles,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:55.560
I mean our skills and our services underneath our services create a rectangle like this and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.250
matching with the bottom off the left parte elements.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:12.710
Then said the Colin Toe white and zooming by Holy and Control or Command Plus and then

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.150
select combined shapes from the options bar.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.220
Then go back to rectangle tool again.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.050
Select combines shapes.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.490
After that,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.650
create this shape here.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.210
It's not finished.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.820
I will like to add on.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.750
Are there other man's bought before that?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:06.850
Select textile and type a subject or time time here radios the phone size too 14 points and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.950
place in here.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.850
Then,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.420
for align these text on,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.420
you need to create another shape,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.850
same as the same Juan,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.200
and then I use a long vertical and horizontal centers.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.150
You can see that I have created this box.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.980
I would like to add another boxes next to the white collar rectangle,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.490
so I position it here.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.450
You can hide guidelines to see this part clearly.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.750
Then got to this shape that we have combined.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.220
Go to layer Stein and apply a district for that again.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.400
Go back to layer Stein so you can change the corner.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.320
Select this great collar rectangle and go to layer star.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.430
Apply the same.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.350
A struck for that.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.250
Be careful about the position.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.990
Look at this one.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.410
We should expand the height.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:51.110
Teoh have unequal height for both shapes.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:04.460
I mean the white collar rectangle and the gray one at a text into this gray color rectangle

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.250
and tied design.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.450
Then select rectangle Garrity design and use alignments.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.200
Then apply the selection by Holy in Control or command V.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.450
Make a copy off this rectangle by holding on ski,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:33.350
drag it to the right and place in here,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.790
then expanded horizontally.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:46.810
You can use transform tool in this case and type a tiny town here,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.830
for example,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.480
online support.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:03.680
Then go to move toe Celinda rectangle by holding control or command key and use alignment

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.950
tools from the options bar.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:14.350
Let's do another part.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:28.950
Make another copy off the straight Tangail and match it with the white collar rectangle.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.610
And after that pressing,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:41.550
ter got to tax tool type and on their title As you want,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.220
I will like to type development in this case.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:59.750
Select the rectangle from layers panel and position it to the center off this shape.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.650
So zoom out by holding control or command minus.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.800
This is what I need it you have designed when you want to court.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.530
When you click on design,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:23.910
you will have a different description and for development or other bottoms is like this.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:32.250
So here I would like to add a description to each bottom.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.150
I resize it to 16 points.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.510
This is the result,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.280
but ah,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.950
you shoot.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.650
Make some changes like vertical distance between each line.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.150
Now it's looks better.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.380
Got to call her p care.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.250
Change the collar for there's text.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:14.160
It is something that I don't like,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.850
so I go back to call her p care and set a darker color for it.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:32.750
Let's do it again because we have some problems and changes are not a plight.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:40.400
Double click on text layers icon go to call R P care and apply.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.490
And you,

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.600
Connor,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.650
for this text.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.330
As I told you,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.520
when you click on marketing,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.050
you will see this description.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.950
If you want to collect on design,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.350
you can see another.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.750
The screenshot.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.670
This is a Java script,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.190
Kurt,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.750
when you want to design a website.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:21.050
But we need to I can see that all of these options when we design a template in 40 show

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:28.200
after on these works Mackett group for all these elements rename me too,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.850
for example,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.110
skill services for something like this.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.490
And this part yes,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.230
completes.
