00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
in this part,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.280
I would like to create pricing options,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.750
so I'm going to create pricing tables,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.350
come over to rectangle tool and create a new rectangle with this numeric values.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.750
Press OK,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.450
go to feel and select a dark color to see this rectangle better.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.410
Then position it here on their names,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:41.950
the slider to part and drag it to the top by holding arrow key on your keyboard and do it

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.610
again.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.350
You can disappear guidelines to see this project,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.950
then go to feel and feel the rectangle with no color.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.400
Use a horizontal guideline for this wreck tango,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.180
then zooming by,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750
holding control or command loss.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.400
After that,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.350
come over rectangle tool and creates a new rectangle.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.050
He was exactly this wits and height for this part.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.450
Apply it.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.970
Go to feel,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.890
and there's a long go to search,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.250
and from this part,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.450
set a new a stroke for this shape so you can customize it as you want.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.260
Then select it and move it here exactly.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.750
Left on the edge off the guidelines.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.350
Then go to a clips tool,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.250
make sure that you're creating and Neil Layer and create a sujal,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.950
then set a green collar for that,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.550
then you can use alignments.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.930
After that,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.550
drag it to the top,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:39.570
so make a copy off this circle and set new collar for that.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.260
Just use some a stroke for the shape.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.550
We have two different circles here,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:59.700
the 1st 1 we have field with collar and the 2nd 1 we field with no collar.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:15.930
Zoom in because I want to type something in this sou chio set the phone size and tie,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.950
for example.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950
$99 here.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:30.050
Then you can use a line hards and call centers for this text.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.680
After that,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.050
go to the line tool and create a line on their knees.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.850
The text.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.880
As you can see again,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.060
go back to text,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.020
tool and type.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.950
Pair Mom's Year.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.720
Go to the options bar and read.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.250
Use the phone size to 14 points.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.550
Do this same that's you did before four.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.150
All the elements and align it horizontally to the center.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:20.280
You can get help from a smart guys off for the shop to have an equal distance between each

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.950
element.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.150
As you can see,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.950
just press control key to see numeric values as where to call this stance.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.630
All right,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.080
here we go find it's elements Position in Layers panel.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.710
There.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.350
Select is tree layers and make group for them.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.630
Then you can use alignments for this group after that younger players,

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.650
because this group is unnecessary here,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.970
come over the tax stool and tap to activate a new text layer.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:18.940
Set a dark blue collar for these layer and type.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.850
Basic.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.850
Here.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.190
Change the phone size.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.140
Go back to the rectangle because I want to use a line.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:47.650
Hard dental centers for the text then creates a copy off this rectangle that's you can see

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.650
.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.320
Select it and drag.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.550
It's to the down.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:02.350
You can use shift key to drag it a straight to the down like this.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:12.050
Placing here underneath the first rectangle you need Teoh.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.300
Move it to the top by holding arrow key,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.730
then read.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:35.230
Use the rectangles size where to Cali by using transform tool again.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.960
Go back to take stool.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:45.350
I'm going to type a title inside these shape,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:54.180
so I set the phone size to something that I need,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.650
and after that,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:03.590
I change the color to a gray one so I can use a line man's.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.760
After that,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:21.700
I need to duplicate these two layers so I can select these two layers and drag them to the

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.850
down by holding all and shift key.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:35.250
I can do it just there is a difference that you should select,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.210
Toolbox says,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.050
and do it for another time.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.850
Place in here.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:52.850
You can't see all the D stances by holding control Key.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:08.250
Do it for the last one because I want to have four different block says here.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:14.500
So we did it.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.330
Just Something is remaining.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:25.050
I should go back to each layer and make some changes.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.210
For example,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.230
for the first Ray tango,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.550
I can chance the collar to gray.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.700
As you can see again,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:49.550
I I can go to feel and sit a softer collar for this one.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.850
All right,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:09:04.950
I'm going to do it for the 3rd 1 I go toe feel and pig this great color by using.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.750
I drop there.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:15.850
I'm going for the fifth break Tango and seventh grade tango.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.420
I do it on.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.850
You can see the difference.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.130
Go to move,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.590
tool.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.150
And after that,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.890
select this rectangle.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:42.100
Copy that on position it on their knees.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.930
The seventh wreck.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:56.710
Tango Go to feel and feel it with no color selected by holy in control or command t and

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.950
expand the height off this shape,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:14.950
Go back to rectangle tool and create a new rectangle inside the last rectangle.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.110
It is a call to action,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:30.050
so double click on this layer and goto layers time and apply s rook for the S J so you can

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:42.380
use both align vertical and horizontal centers for the shape type something inside thesis

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.520
rectangle that is a call to action and tie by Now,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.350
for example,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:11:00.080
this is a bunch that you have created I would like to change the time towns because all of

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:09.190
them are same and they are one hosting I go to the second box,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:24.750
change it to to a main marketing and I go to the 3rd 1 I type five databases for the 4th 1

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:40.450
I type to a design pack on next tree website layouts.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.560
My gain.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:12:07.950
Do it here five header styles got to the last one and change it to online his tour.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.450
This is what we have made.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:18.350
Just some few details are remaining.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.120
I should check alignments.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.690
After I did it,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:37.300
I go to layers panel and I select on these layers that are related to this box and make a

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.300
group for it.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:48.750
Rename its a pricing table one.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.030
After that,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.140
select this rectangle and use align.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:02.550
Vertical centers for these groups duplicate this group,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:16.070
then drag it to the right by holding shift key and press enter toe.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:27.390
Apply that so you can make any changes that you need just selected again by holding control

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:34.450
or command T and very position this group.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:46.050
Go to the right and first the wall green Andy's group to pricing Table two and create

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:52.450
another copy off this group.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:14:05.060
Drag it to the right and position it next through the 2nd 1 I mean the sick end pricing

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.650
table.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:19.750
Do it again and creates another pricing table position in here right on the edge off

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.710
guidelines.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:30.820
So rename the groups to a pricing chairman tree and pricing table,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:42.200
for I'm going to change some text here.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.490
I change the price,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:44.950
too.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:15:03.450
$199 for the second prize seeing table and for the 3rd 1 $299 on the last one $399.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:20.430
Change this second box title to stand there and make sure that's you're aligning it's to

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.950
the center horizontally.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.910
Do this,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.050
saying for the third title.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.410
Before that collapse,

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:43.670
these groups select this title going Khaliq on takes layers icon,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:16:02.050
Then change into ultimate a gang do alignments in this case and go for the last title.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.050
Select it!

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.680
Change it,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.150
Teoh Diamont.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:19.250
After that's I'm going to cost demise the third banks.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:26.800
So I select the circle and change the collar.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.950
Teoh.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.640
A dark blue collar,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.750
as you can see.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:38.750
Do it for both,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.830
sir,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.590
Chills here.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:51.060
Select this shape on again.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:17:03.470
Do it and use this collar so you can see the difference for the third pricing table from

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.050
the left.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.820
Do this same four.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.050
Call to action and set a new collar for that.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:20.550
Just you need to chance the text collar as I did it here.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.640
After that collapse,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.050
the groups like this.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:37.760
You can zoom out by holding control command minus to see this part on your chan.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:49.790
These appear guidelines by holding control or command etch after that's so lack all these

00:17:49.790 --> 00:18:00.450
layers and make a new group for them and rename it surprising and set a collar for this

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.950
grew up and it is done
