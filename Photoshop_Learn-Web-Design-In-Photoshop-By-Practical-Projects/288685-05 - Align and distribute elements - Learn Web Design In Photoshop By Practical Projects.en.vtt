00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.630
This is a common question that how we can position new elements in a document.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.450
Let's check the answer,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:23.550
create new rectangles and set a new collar for one off these shapes from feel you can do it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.550
,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
then go to move to and from layers panel.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.420
Select both shapes and from the Options bar.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:41.480
Select align vertical centers or a line top edges or align bottom edges and a lying

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.900
horizontal centers.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.480
You can see just one shape.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.450
Let's move this shape to the top and again do it.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.010
Align horizontal centers.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.920
Align,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.840
laughed,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.920
edges and align right Ege is,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250
and you can see the result.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.120
If I select a long vertical and horizontal centers,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.880
I have positioned the smaller shape through the center.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.050
Off the bigger shape.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.300
Let's check another option,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.420
so I go to rectangle tool and create a rectangle.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.340
Then I make some copies by holding all key.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.620
Then I select these three shapes and select distribute horizontal centers.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:42.510
That's means I have created three elements that have equal this dance.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.490
It's being each other.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.610
Let's go ahead and create some vertical shapes,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.770
and I used distribute vertical centers icon.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.640
In this case,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.150
it means that I have you call these stands beats being my elements Vertical e.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.950
So you can use distribute stoppages,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.140
bought images or other options such as distribute laughter,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.890
jizz and right.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.750
Just like this,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.500
I'm going to show you another option.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.550
Let's remove the shapes and layers panel and create a new rectangle here.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.340
Let's do it together and create an uric tang.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.830
Yell like this,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.750
then go to rectangular marquee tool option and create a new rectangular marquee tool like

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.200
this.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.250
Feel the document and select align vertical and horizontal centers,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.020
so you have positioned this shape to the center off your document.
