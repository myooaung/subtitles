00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's go to design contact part.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:17.720
Come over two rectangle tool and set and new writs and height for this shape and go to move

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.150
tool.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.850
Position it on their knees.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.300
The online is sore part again.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.650
Screw up,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:42.650
then go to caller picture and set a great color for this rectangle.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:52.490
After that Gertie collapse tool and creates and make leaps or Cyrk,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.910
you'll hear you.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:03.240
Chen create sujal by holding shift key after data will click on the layer ghetto layers

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.950
time and apply some drop shadow for these shape.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.790
You can't see the de France when you chance huge para meter.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.250
Here.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.550
When I change capacity size or the S stands,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.450
it will be appeared around the circle.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:45.490
So let's make sure that the drop shadow is good for this shape.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.750
And after that appliance,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
by pressing on okay,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.140
create another suit.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.730
You'll hear.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:03.890
It should be a smaller down the 1st 1 Then scroll up and go to feel and pick this green

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.550
collar.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.850
Go back so the collar is changed.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.970
Then select the circle.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.840
Go to this smaller one and position it horizontally and vertically to the center off the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.480
bigger circle,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.750
then select both vehicles,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.810
create a group and rename me too location one,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.650
for example,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:47.190
and duplicated by holy in control or command J rene me to a location to and position it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.730
here,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.450
drag it to the top like this do the same,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:01.450
creates another duplication rene me to a location three.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.650
Then drag it to here that you can't see,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.780
and I need more off this location signs,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:27.350
so I duplicate this one again and position it here.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.350
Then I press enter to apply it and do the same for the last one.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.750
Renaming to Location five.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.650
Position needs here.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.050
Drag its to the down,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.490
then zooming by,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.150
holing control or command minus go to feel.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.150
Four.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.850
Theis Shape and change this smaller suit jewel's color to white.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.780
After that,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:15.360
come over the rectangle tool and create a rectangle above the circle that you can't see so

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.650
you can resize it as you want.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.050
After that's Goto color picker and sit.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.910
It's to a gray color like this.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.660
Then double click on the layer to open layer.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.790
Aslahn go to stroke and set a stroke.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.450
For this shape,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.450
you can change any perimeter here.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:59.050
Then I press okay and apply it Dan.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.650
I come over rectangle tool again and create a tiny rectangle on their knees.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.450
The bigger rectangle like this.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.250
For these purposes,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:24.150
I should zoom in more because it's Nance more at your racing here.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.150
Then I am going to position its on their knees.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.690
Direct tangle.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.950
Just I rotated like this and position it here.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:52.150
Then I'm going to rotated more to make sure that I have rotated it to 90 degrees.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:06:02.950
Then I drag it to the top like this and combine it.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.950
We had direct tangle so I can drag it to the left or to the right.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:20.450
This is a design that I needed for this part.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:31.750
I'm going to select both off the shapes and creates a group for them.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.910
I can't rename eat,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.350
so it's up to you.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.650
If you want to organize your layers panel,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:53.850
you need to rename all the layers to remember damn in future.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:11.350
Let's work on this group and drag it to position it and the best place in this part.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.730
After that,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.400
come over,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.240
take stool and tap to create,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.650
and you text layer.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:31.550
Set a gray color for the text and type a title here inside the sports.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.750
I tight your office location,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:50.980
then go to textile and tap to activate another text layer type street address and create

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.180
another taste.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.150
For example,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.550
type city.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.210
On this one,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:10.350
I'm going to type a phone number so you can type any phone number that you need.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:23.550
Then select these four layers and go to options bore and align it horizontally to the left

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.550
.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:30.350
So I need Teoh.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.150
Make some changes here,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:42.350
and I would like to work on this box and read the use the size.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:52.950
Go to this group and collapse it before that.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.750
Change the rectangles collar.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.460
So if you zoom in,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.650
you can see some problems here.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.050
Drag the big a rectangle to the top.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.910
After that,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:24.950
go to the tiny rate Tangail and set this collar same as the bigger rectangle.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.870
So we did it.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.250
Now,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.550
if you press enter,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:37.450
you think that these two shapes are combined.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:51.370
I select these layers from layers panel and rename eats,

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.150
too.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.350
Not this is the first part off.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.450
Contact the formation.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:11.030
Let's go for the second part on create another rectangle on their knees.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.950
The map.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:27.950
I renamed it to map because you can police any maps by using JavaScript or Jake or plug ins

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.750
inside the sparks.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:37.250
So I have placed this part.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:47.450
Then let's go for completing the second part.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:54.250
Create a new shape here.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:05.830
Go to feel before that's go to a stroke by double clicking on the layer and chance the

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:13.150
position outside play with the size.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.250
So this is what we need.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:39.970
Then make a copy obvious by holding all key year and at two other rectangles here they have

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.410
unequal size.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:49.180
After that go today.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:59.950
First rectangle from the left Type something inside it.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.750
I typed name in this case.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:13.150
Then select a rectangle and use a long vertical centers for the text.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:29.750
Go for the 2nd 1 and feel this box type e mail here.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:44.150
So this is what we need and go for alignments from the options bar.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.250
Go ahead,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.650
Do the same for the last one.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.350
Press enter to activate.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:13:05.200
It takes layer on type subject here so you can reposition it if you want.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:21.250
Let's go to align it and I select align vertical centers for Theis text and on their knees

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.250
,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.950
these three rectangles.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.750
I'm going to create a big rectangle like these.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.350
I freely with no collar.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:56.540
I'm go to struck and apply his struck for theis shape so I can select these layers and drag

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:06.650
them to the top Because I have faced with a lack off a space here.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.400
So I changed the heart.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:18.250
Isn't all guidelines position to solve this problem after that?

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.950
On their knees,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:28.260
the big rectangle I'm going to create another rectangle.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:37.150
I make a copy from other shapes and place it here.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.010
This is the contact for that.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:59.380
I need I go to feel and set a dark blue collar four this shape and I need to type something

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.340
inside this shape.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:11.850
So I select text tool and type attacks here.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.890
Set the color toe white.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.740
I typed.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:23.250
Submit now select the rectangle by holding control or command key.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.400
Then activate that takes layer and select a line.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:38.250
Vertical and horizontal centers go to layers and make it group for damn.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:52.250
Rename me to contact for again create a new group for both Contact Form and Matt Group set

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.350
a collar for the group.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.350
Use green in this case.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.550
So zoom out.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.910
This is what we asked on in these parts
