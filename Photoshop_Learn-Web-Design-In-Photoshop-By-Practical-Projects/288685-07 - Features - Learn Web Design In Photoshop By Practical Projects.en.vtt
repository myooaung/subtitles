I'm going to use a gray color press enter to apply it.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:56.710

It's high toe.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.950
So I tapped to activate text layer and I type make a pack.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.550
Change the caller as you want,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.430
so use move.

Use a regular later funt with this size and paste it double click on I context.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.850
Go to text options.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:09.590
Change the vertical distance between lines like this.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:18.820
You can use 18 points or 24 points in this case,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:29.650
expand the text box to remove extra lines like this.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.950
We have some other extras here.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:46.850
I'm going to remove them because it is too much for a description.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:55.600
Drag this text box to a top and clothes takes options.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.450
Here you can change its collar to gray.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:13.110
So we have one feature in this case.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:22.980
We need to add some new details to this box.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:36.150
I'm going to add a call to action so I select rectangle and creates a new shape here.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.630
Just go to feel from collar.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:52.950
Pick your set This gray color you can select this great color using I drop her.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:04.250
Let's go back to layers panel and do the same task as we did before it is alignments.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:16.240
So select the second white rectangle and activate this smaller rectangle that has great

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.350
collar use.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.680
A line hard isn't all centres Icon like this.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:32.570
This is on empty rectangle,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:40.750
so we need to add the text into it.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:51.010
So I'm going to at a text layer here and I type lair more.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.970
For example,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.090
you can't align it easily.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:03.020
Using options bar,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:14.890
I want to reduce the rectangles size so I selected by control or command T Then I use shift

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.630
key to Radio City,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.450
Kali from the bottom and the top.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:29.450
Here is the first feature box Dan.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.710
Go to the right a little bit.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:49.050
Select all of these elements except the first rectangle that has great color before DATs.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:57.650
Let's do some changes for this description.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:07.550
We can at Mawr vertical the's stands between lines,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:13.140
so it is complete.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.950
Now a gang.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:34.030
Select these elements by holding shift key created group Rename me to Box one duplicate

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:49.620
this group by control or command J drag it to the rights use shift key to have more secure

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.250
a C.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:56.350
Then you are dragging it to the right.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.900
Zoom out,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.090
Teoh.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.950
See,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.360
Theis Box says again,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.970
Do you replicate it?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:12.380
Drag it to the right using shift key.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:19.000
So here is the third features box.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.760
You can get help from guidelines like this again.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:46.880
Go to the right and make another copy off this group and position it here.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.750
Right on the edge.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:12:07.610
So we have four different boxes I want to do Is something especial for the third box.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:22.060
And I'm going to set a new collar for call to action and exact journal island.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.650

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.840
this exact journal.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.430
We have another one that seems like a s truck.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:54.700
So I select it and go to feel and set a new color for that.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:06.150
You can These appear guidelines using control or command edge to see this document better

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.890
go to the second box,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:18.990
change the Tyto to something that you want.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:25.350

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:30.550
Dan.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:36.800
I'm going to aligning its again.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.360
After that,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:50.530
I really chance the third box title too fast.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:14:02.290
Delay Vitti Let me type it and alignments again.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:14.650
Go to the last one type and new title 48 for example.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:22.200
Full support and it is complete.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.850
It's now,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:28.250
but we have on unfinished task here.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:34.680
Exact journals are empty and we should I feel.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.450
Damn,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:46.150
I want to put some icons into these eggs are gunnels,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.960
so I opened up flat.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.090

go to PNG and select free download option.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:10.550
Then I drank the's icon into my project.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:19.600
Position it here where the first box is placed.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:27.450
It is necessary to reduce the icons size.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:33.050
I goto layers slide and change the color toe white.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:46.250
I can easily align it to the center of the exact journal,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.550
and I really collapse the first group.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.450
Then go back to the website type.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.650
Roll it.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:15.940
You can select each one deal like I select this icon and again download it in part.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:26.810
It into my project reviews the elements size,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:36.650
so we should Where the US more again,

Do that,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:05.390
and the second box is complete.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.050
Now collapse this group.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.450
Go to the website type.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.560
For example,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.070
Deli.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:17.450
Very.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:23.310
In this collection,

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:37.450
I select Theis icon or this one is better.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.350
Change it to PNG.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.480
Download it again,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.660
drag it to your project.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:56.530
Read us the size using transform,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:09.320
tool and shift key to reduce the size he Cauley for horizontal and vertical aspects.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.910
Double click on the layer.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:29.050
Set a wide collar for that again aligning it and go for the last one type support.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:36.990
We have some good icons for support.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.990
These can be good.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:46.790
I select it and dalati.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:56.110
It's imported into my project again.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:01.830
We need Teoh reduce the size,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.700
but it is in the third box,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.950
so we don't want to place it there.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.260
All right,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:22.930
go back and drag it into the last group so it is visible.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:28.790
Now set a new collar.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.870
Four.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:46.550
The support icon here is that just a little reduction is remaining here.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:58.760
We can make sure that it is aligned in the middle using options bar.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:07.670
So we have four different features.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:12.060
Box here at the end.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.660
Select the biggest rectangle in this part.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:29.270
Chance the collar to white or a gray color,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:36.350
then put all of them into a group.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:45.350
Rename me too features and use and red collar
