00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
in this video,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.760
I'm going to talk about layers science,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.840
which is really important in any design.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.860
First of all,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.860
I create a new document,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.420
and then I'll come over the rectangle tool and create in your rectangle because I would

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.550
like to explain layers times for thes shape.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.560
First,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.060
I am go to rectangle of Marquee tool and select this part.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.070
Then I go to move Tool and from the Options bar I select allowing vertical and horizontal

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.650
centers.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.860
Then I double click on the layer to upon layers tiles.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.400
So here you can find many options,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.750
such as a stroke.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.180
Struck has some options like size,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.960
position,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.070
blinding moods,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.950
capacity.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.270
You can adjust the position to outside insight and center for DS rook,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:14.160
and you can change the size from thes slider like this and even you can adjust a new

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.250
blending mode.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:25.250
Some of this blending modes are not useful here on they are not effective in this case,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.850
as you can see.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.850
Then I set it back to normal from a positive e.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.850
You can change the opacity and from this option,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.270
you 10 change the stroke to,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.950
for example,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.650
gradient.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.150
If you want to have a gradient around the shape so you can see the difference.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.360
When you select gradient,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.750
you have new options that you can see on their names.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:17.250
The gradient born Let's go ahead and test something in graduations so you can see that's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700
how I changed the color.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.950
Or you can change the angle to something that you need or that you want.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.630
We have some options,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.050
such as diamond and linear,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:44.750
and you can work with this scale for the gradient like this,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.010
and there is another option that can be useful,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.110
and it is patter around the shape as a stroke from this panel,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.850
you can change this stroke,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.450
do something that you need,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:16.150
and from this tool icon you can upload or load and new patter.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.090
Then you can change the scale off this pattern.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.950
You can read the use it or increase it as you need.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.550
Let's go back to collar mode in this case,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.500
as you can see,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.150
I have added a new a stroke boy dip loss icon next to this truck.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.030
So from this option,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.850
we can have two different strokes around the shape.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:03.350
Let's see on other options such as drop shadow because It's really important for this

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.850
course,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.750
so you can set this values on.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.450
Change it,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.080
you can see the result and even you can change it.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.930
Straightly boy.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:33.350
Moving it like this on you can set a new rapacity as you could do in a stroke option.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.250
And from this part,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:49.950
you chan sit and new moat for this drop shadow option.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.310
You can play with all of these options if you need.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.950
I said it back to a linear.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.670
Also,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.250
you can have it costs them effect for thes drop shadow.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.750
Let's play with this values Life teas.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.550
I can hold this arrows.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.970
And from this collar picture,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.350
you can change the color off this drop shadow.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.940
Let's test another perimeter here,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.450
like in her shadow.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.650
You can test any parameter here,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.950
and you can see the preview in your document.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.250
Let's go ahead and change the blinding modes to multi play,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.950
or you can change it to another one.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.150
Then take a look at color overlay option.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.750
Let's go to pattern overlay in this case,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.750
and if you apply it,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:20.050
you can see the result here and you have some patterns in your shape.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.050
Let's go ahead.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.950
I really activate bevel and MBAs in this case,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.370
some off.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:39.450
This options are not useful in this course bought.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:46.550
They can be useful in Are there parts off 40 shop?
