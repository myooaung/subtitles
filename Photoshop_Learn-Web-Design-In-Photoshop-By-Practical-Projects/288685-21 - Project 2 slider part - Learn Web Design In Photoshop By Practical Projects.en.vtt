X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
in this part.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.160
I'm going to add a slider toe,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.430
my template.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.150
So I come over the rectangle tool and create a new one with this numeric values.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.500
Then I go to feel set a new collar for that.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.200
Then go to move tool and position it here underneath the menu.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.650
I have an empty slider.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.050
I should feel it with elements.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:44.230
So I go to this fire and drag this mock up to my project year press.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.850
Yes,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:55.850
it is large because the resolution off this muck up is different from my project.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.350
So I should resize it by using auld and shift key.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:18.400
So zoom in to see this my car better Then go to view new guide and create a new vertical

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.580
guide with 50% for value.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.260
Then I need Teoh Rotate thesis markup.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.120
So I select this group and rotated like this.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.550
I can resize it and expand it if I need here.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.650
I need more rotation here.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.970
I'm going to a place it left on the edge.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.050
As you can see.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:08.350
After that press inter toe a ploy or return collapsed the group go to the rectangle and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.150
come over the eclipse Tool Create a circle here by holding shift key.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.050
Make sure that you are creating this shape in a new layer.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:34.250
So I have created and new Sergio just I need to feel it with a solid color,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.710
for example,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.750
white.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.640
Then I am going to make a copy off it and resize it and expand it.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.320
Fill it with no color.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.550
Just use stroke.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.470
Use this slider to it,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.150
just the's shape struck.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.250
So here we have two shapes.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.420
After that,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.600
go to line tool.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.550
Set a new weight and after that,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:26.390
create a line exactly like this by holding shift key so you can create a straight line.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.850
Here,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.050
select the Sergio.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.110
Then you can a line.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.740
He's lying vertically to the center.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.950
Off the serial.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.770
We have this design here.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.620
After that,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.750
go to text tool.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.350
Set the fund to later increase the phone size.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.790
Then it start to type a title.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.250
Here.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.150
I'm going to type best apus slider.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.850
I go to move Tool.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:22.840
Then I go back to the text and reduce the phone size again.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.250
I come over move tool.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.470
After that,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.650
I'm going to use alignments in this case,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.800
so I should select the line by holding control or command key.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:50.850
Then I go to the text layer and use align vertical sinners icon In this case again,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.470
I should go back to text tool to its hide.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.950
Another part here.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.500
I'm going to type.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.950
You can customize everything in this case.

then resize it to 18 points.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.110
It is a small so I changed it back to 24 points.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.650
Double click on text layers icon,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.650

I'm going to set a new collar for that.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.720

and I can go back to layers panel and select all the layers and groups.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.810
And then I make it grew for them and rename it to Slider.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.250
Then I can't set a color for the group,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.550
and these parties finished now.
