00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.590
In the last video we discussed about how to create featured works in these documents.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:17.250
I go ahead and come over the rectangle tool and create a new rectangle in this project.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.710
Then I go to move,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.850
tool and drag the's rectangle and place it here.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:34.150
Then I can place a horizontal guideline at the bottom off the rectangle,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.010
and I select a new collar.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.630
For that,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.490
I prefer to set it to white collar.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.710
Then I come over to attack stool.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.640
Before that,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.750
I go to view and create a new guy line 50% where to call.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.150
After that,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.850
I tap to activate text layer.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.650
It's thought to time something here,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.260
for example,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.550
what others say about us.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.310
Then you can get help from alignments.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.530
Teoh aligning in the best position after death,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.350
go to the previous part and copy this description.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:36.150
Move it from the group to this part,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.950
as you can see,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.060
then collapse the previous group so we can continue the game.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.750
Here.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.460
Alignments is my favorite tool and treek in the 40 shop.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.550
So I repaired.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.700
It's many times.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:10.250
Go back to rectangle tool and create these box here.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:24.900
It should be exactly this one and be careful about the edges and double click on each to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.630
upon layers.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.150
Time.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.550
Go to struck.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.600
Apply in use roach for district tangle.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:44.320
So we have applied this and you can see this better by hiding guidelines another time.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.920
Go to shape tool.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.850
Select a clips here,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:03:06.180
create circle using Eclipse Tool and for the color we can use this gray seem for this one

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.650
again.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.920
We can use a different struck,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:21.450
and we have applied a outside scrunch for this rectangle applied at by clicking on OK,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.450
and here we have these elements.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.800
Com Aware Move tool.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.950
Reposition the souk Ill as you can see,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:43.250
then we need some titles and description beside the serial,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.250
so choose textile tap on the screen to activate and new text layer.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.250
It's start to type.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.760
For example,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.710
John Doe radius the phone size,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.660
Reposition it,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.050
drag it to the right on their knees,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.750
the name we need to another text.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.550
It is job Tyto,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.970
and I'm going to type who had designer,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.950
for example,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:32.150
and for the next text layer I create.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.810
It takes box.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.750
Then I go to the top select thes paragraph,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:50.150
for we can select a different paragraph thesis one East better four.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
Us.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.600
I screwed down activates the last text layer.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.050
Paste the paragraph So we have a good description here.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.450
You can reposition it by dragging it to the left,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:22.650
and we're going to change something here,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.850
and I'm going to play with Web Designer.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.820
There is a simple way to drag all the elements,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.930
select them from layers panel by holding shifty,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.280
then dragged them to the right or the left.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.490
It's up to you.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.750
This is time to organize our layers.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.250
We should place them in a group because if we don't do that,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.150
we real have some problems in future.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.050
So let's find lay years.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.650
Dad's their day are placed in the project.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:22.350
Just drag some of them to the top or to the down,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.250
Then create a group four.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.650
They're related layers.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.850
I'm going to do this year and creates a new group,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.630
then duplicate this group and drag it to the down.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.750
So we have and all their box here.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:58.850
This is another testimonial that we have positioned here this time Select both off them and

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.290
boy holding off key.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.600
Drag them to the right.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:19.410
This is where we have created for different to stay Magnon boxes rename down to for example

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.410
,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.650
123 or four.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:29.250
We want to make some differences here.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.150
For example,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:37.410
go to the 2nd 1 and change the job title too.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:47.580
Graphic designer position Here you can drag it using move tool,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.890
Go to the fair Guan,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:08:09.140
do this same that you did before my type here for the graph for and for the last one We

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.000
don't nothing.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.150
Just zoom out to see the whole project.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:28.110
You can collapse that groups and create a new group for these elements.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:37.250
I'm going to type testi mony ALS and place a new caller for this group.
