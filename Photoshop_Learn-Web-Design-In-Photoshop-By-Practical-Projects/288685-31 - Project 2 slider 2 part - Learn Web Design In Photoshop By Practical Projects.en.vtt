00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
in this video,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.770
I'm going to create a slider,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.150
but it's really different.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.150
So let's go to create this awesome part.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.890
First of all,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:26.180
create a rectangle like this and position it here underneath the black part and scroll up.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:39.950
Go to feel and so like this color for direct tangle and go back so we can set this

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.010
rectangle better and you can use arrow keys in this case.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.870
Next,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:01.710
zoom in because we need more accuracy in this part and position this horizontal guideline

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.250
at the bottom of the rectangle.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:17.150
Then come over the rectangle tool and create a rectangle here inside the first rectangle.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.690
I need to set a new collar for this one.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:35.150
Then I can press enter to apply its and I go to move tool so I can move it if I want.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:47.150
Then come over text tool and create a title here on top off this part.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:57.730
So let's reduce or increase the phone size.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.950
It depends on you.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.220
I would like to increase it and time,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.190
but I don't hear.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.350
For example,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:24.160
are you ready to explore one there fool things and the question mark at the end so I can

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.780
use alignments in this case again,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.660
a scroll up and select Theis paragraph or description and to make a copy of its then

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.840
release it from the group again,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.740
a school down and here I can easily align it horizontal and vertical lead to the center,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.550
but I don't need a line vertical centers,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.850
but I need a lying horizontal centers in this case.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:13.150
So I'm going to dilate some parts off this paragraph or description.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.540
After DATs,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.030
I can move.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.840
It's to the top,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.410
just I need to select it from Layers panel and move it to the top by holding shift key so I

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.250
can drag it to the top straightly.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.020
So I they're late.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:47.810
Some parts a game on here is the sick end text layer that I have added to these part and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.420
again.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.750
I would like to use a line hard dental centers for the Slayer.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.200
I'm going to make some changes here for the rectangle and read.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.180
Use the height After DATs,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.650
I'm going to create a duplicate off this layer and expand it horizontal like this.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:31.900
So be careful about the edge as I mean where the guidelines are and you can use transform

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.410
tool for Theis Pair Press,

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:48.160
then selected and reduced the height again by using transform tool So you can see this

00:04:48.160 --> 00:05:00.430
design here gets a rectangle tool and from feel change the collar after that drag de slayer

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.150
to top.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:14.040
Now you can understand why I told you that I am creating and the friends slider years a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.730
drop shadow for this rectangle,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.660
and you can change angle and everything.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.250
He is changeable.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.940
For example,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:40.040
you can chance capacity of landing moment size or Danny Parameter that you need to change a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.580
plight by pressing on.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.150
Okay,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:50.750
this is where I want to showcase some slides or pictures here,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.290
and I need some bottoms.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.050
That's when I click on them.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.140
It goes to next,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.250
or the previous a slight or image.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:20.850
So I would like to create this by them above the rectangles so zoo mean or you can zoom out

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.850
,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:31.150
then come to tax tool and tap to create a new text layer.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:39.550
Double click on text layers icon and go to call our pick your set a new color for the text

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.550
.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:51.150
Then select theist rectangle and use a line horizontal and vertical centers for the text.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:07:05.710
Then select Theis rectangle and manky copy of it and recited like this.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.350
Position it here,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.570
then select rectangle tool go to feel and from color picker.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.350
Set a wide color for that,

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:24.660
and I'm going to position an angle insight thes rectangle.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:32.850
So I screw up and select this anger right icon and duplicated.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.350
Then release it from the group and drag it to top.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.990
And I can use alignments.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.400
Two.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.350
Position this I can easily inside the rectangle.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.880
Also,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.550
I need to change the color like thes to a dark color.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.850
And after that I'm going to read.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.250
Use the phone size.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.890
As you can see again.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:09.050
I need to that line this icon.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.430
All right,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.280
here we go.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:25.910
I make a copy off this gray rectangle by holding on ski and dragging next to the first

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:33.350
rectangle so I can pick a new caller.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.550
Four.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.640
This one.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:49.950
You can hide guidelines to see this sport mawr clear and type and all their title here.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:09:01.550
Just go to front from the options bar and set it to later and type previous here.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.210
Just remember,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.880
you're working with capital letters,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.990
so turn on caps,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.950
lock and type Previous here,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:27.550
let's check the phone size for next and do the same for previous as it takes layer here.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.800
After Dad,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.950
he was alignments,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.480
so you can see the difference.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.120
I'm going to read.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:48.580
Use the phone size for next text layer and do the same for previous like this.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:59.250
So we have done this part and I'm going to add more details.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:10.680
So I make a copy off this white rectangle and drag it to the right who,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:19.050
where previous text layer is and I duplicate and you'll right,

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:25.380
and I use fleet horizontal from transform tool.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:39.020
You can go to transform to a boy holding control or command T and then use a line hard

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.050
dental centers.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.350
In this case,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.950
that's what we bonds for thesis part.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.250
So if you click on next,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.190
this slider will be changed and another a slight.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.450
We'll be up here,

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:02.250
creates a group for these elements.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:11.790
You can't renaming to Slider to and said the caller for DATs then collapsed the group and

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.850
zoom in on this part is stone
