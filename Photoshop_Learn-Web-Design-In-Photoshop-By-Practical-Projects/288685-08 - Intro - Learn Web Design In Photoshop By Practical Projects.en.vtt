00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
in this video,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.980
I'm going to add an introduction to the website.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:15.920
So I select rectangle tap to create and new rectangle with this size and press.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.450
OK,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.800
go to feel so the color for that you can use our dropper in this case.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.850
Position it here.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:37.050
Use a guideline and position it at the bottom off the rectangle.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
Then go to tax tool.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.480
Select the color for you.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.650
It's start to type here.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.060
I'm going to type.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.050
What's our Misha?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.850
Did I drag it to the top a little.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.950
And I come over to rectangle tool.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:18.370
Create another rectangle with five centimeter and height again.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.550
Five centimeter.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:30.450
I'm going to change the color in this case and position it year left on the edge.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:45.160
Then I'm going to create a text box next to the shape Exactly like these.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.650
Aunt,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.180
Copy that paragraph from Laurie Medicine Thought I,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.570
uh,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.550
and change something here by using text options.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.560
Good to color picker.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.060
And choose a color from thes part.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.710
Copy that again.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.550
Go to these text layer,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.350
double click on it.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.550
Go to caller and paste the collar using control or command V.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:39.200
So we have a better phones here all right,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.050
go ahead and beginning to create a new element here.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.800
So I go to foment and increase the phone size.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.680
So I'm going to type.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.650
Our survey says here,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.860
Try to what we?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.180
Its guidelines carefully because they are exactly the Buddha strapped template you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.950
photoshopped.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.250
So you should pay attention to them on their knees,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.050
our services.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:36.000
I really ad a guideline to have more accu racy.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.110
Then I draw a rectangle like this.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:04:00.550
It should feel exactly these its pace and beat Wien These guidelines so noticed Adi's point

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:12.810
Zo mean and move r seven set and it'll be too the laughed.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:26.100
Go back to the rectangle select text tool and type it text here on the rectangle,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.350
So change the color too.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:41.630
See it You can ready use the phone size from the options bar and were able to align

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.250
vertical centers for Web design and a rectangle.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.250
Go back to tax stool,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.350
create a text box like this.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.930
It is not good in my idea.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.750
So I will try again.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:19.350
I'm going to create another text box and from Lauren Ipsa you can generate another

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:30.580
paragraph on pasted here so I will get help from other elements here,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.450
too.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.650
Select a good color.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.210
This one is good.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.320
I double click.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.850
I need to go to collar and copy that color.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:53.640
Then I go back to this part selected and from color picker.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:00.560
You can paste the caller we're going to ready.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.640
Use the phone size even you can read.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.910
Use the text mark size.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.500
We have three lines,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:24.700
year as a description and khaliq on the rectangle.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.120
Then draw a Syria kill.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.750
Here,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.950
fill it with no collar.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.870
Before that,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.470
let's create that bets are serial here.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.450
Then we can fill it with no collar and have some struck for it.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.240
Get help from this.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.250
A slider to adjust a good struck for the shape.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:02.170
Go to the move tool and drag this shape.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:09.850
Select rectangle Boy Control key and go to search ill and align vertical centers.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:16.390
Go to phone out some dot com and open it in your browser.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:24.370
Look for angle and I'm going to use on guild down,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.880
so I append this page and copied belief icon.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:45.320
Then I select text tool and I go to phones on the options bar and look for phones are some

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:59.750
free solid so I increased the phone size and after that paste it using control or command V

00:07:59.750 --> 00:07:59.750
.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.950
So I put it here.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.650
I can a line.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.250
It's as I need.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:22.030
Something here is wrong and you can see that it's not in a good position and it is not for

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.190
the shops problem.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.750
Maybe there front icon has some problems,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:39.250
so you can change the position by dragging so like these layers and drag them to the right

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.050
after DATs.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:51.050
So leg these tree layers and make it group for them.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.350
Rename it as you want.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:12.250
Then I will go two layers panel and created duplicate from this group.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.380
Select it,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.050
Andi.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:36.610
Drag it to the down like this so you can hold shift key to have more accu racy Here you can

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:42.350
zoom in to see the whole part that you're working on.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:49.650
I'm going to change collar off the second box to gray.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:56.940
This color is good for this purpose again,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.950
Zo mean because we're working on these special area,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:14.550
go to the top layer and create a new text layer.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:22.050
Choose later for the phones and type for the graph e here,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:36.150
so you can again linings and you can get help from the options bar.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:44.550
We need another box like we have created before,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:51.250
so I duplicate this second barks for good,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:11:05.050
using control or command J then drag it to the down Khaliq on Photograph E and Change the

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.530
Tyto 2 40 shop,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:08.250
for example.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:14.750
Year is the box that we have created.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.920
Just go to the sentence,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.750
make a copy off DAT by holding Ault Key,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.650
then drag it to the left.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.790
After that,

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.050
select the third box and drag it to the down.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.760
Do this,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:49.950
saying for the 2nd 1 press eater to apply any changes.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:12:05.550
So we have done two parts of the's section ready for another part.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:18.350
Just I'm going to organize my layers by creating and new group.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:24.910
It is really important to organize layers in the layers panel.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:33.580
Then you want to create a website in 40 shop because you're working with lots of layers and

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.740
if you don't do that,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.350
you will face lots of problems in future.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:48.550
So let's have a pause and goto layers panel and group related layers together,

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.080
for example,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.050
for our services,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:08.650
we can group these four layers by holding control key or command key plus G.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:15.850
Then you can Ray name needs as you want.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:24.690
Complete this part by organizing layers in layers panel,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.700
and you can't renaming it as you want.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:39.150
Go to a bank loan layer select text tool and gets ready for the third part.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.010
Tap toe.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.650
Activate a new text layer year.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:55.960
Set a new color for that and type a tight ill here,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.130
for example,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:08.950
our capabilities so you can apply or return by tapping on the text layer.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.270
After that,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.680
I need to hurry.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.960
Position these layer so I get help from Move,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.740
tool and do.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:29.350
It's I can make some changes for and other titles.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:39.660
I can use alignments and distributions from the options bar collapse.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:51.240
The groups go to this text layer and come over the rectangle tool and select around it

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.550
rectangle tool.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.280
Feel this.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.650
Banks and the radios with this number,

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.350
then creates.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.040
They're surrounded.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.750
Wreck tango here,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:13.870
Press center to apply that or re terror,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.410
for example,

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.750
if you want to apply it.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.350
But before that,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:30.960
so linked the's great color duplicated,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.150
resize it and read.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:41.950
Use the's shapes size to this one.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:49.950
You can work more for having more accuracy in this case,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.270
Go back to this layer,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:16:00.550
selected and again select the 2nd 1 and use alignments,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:11.050
then a school up to find a good color for this second around the rectangle.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:23.550
So I'm going to use Theis green collar scroll down again so you can see that the caller is

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.150
changed.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:37.750
You're going to create some progress bars here as capabilities elements.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:53.220
I can't work more on these progress bar because I want to have some other copies off the's

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.060
shape.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:06.670
So let's focus on it and make some changes for these rounded rectangle.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.300
For example,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.260
you can set a new collar for the fares.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:17.050
Rounded rectangle go to the 2nd 1 resize it.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.050
It's optional,

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.950
and you can do whatever you want.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:28.090
Go back to the 1st 1 selected by holding control or command key.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:33.550
Go to the 2nd 1 and a line needs.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.390
They're selected and read.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.000
Use this size horizontally.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:54.450
Now you can see a good progress bar here underneath this Progress bar,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:01.000
come over tax tool and tied,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:14.850
for example for the shop 70% then resize it so you can zoom out to see any changes.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:27.550
Let's do it again and re size these Tyto so drag it to the top a little bit.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:33.440
Use move Tool for these purpose again.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.050
So mean,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:44.540
select all these three layers Rename eats to,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.200
for example,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.620
a cap.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.090
Juan.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:57.760
Make it duplication off this group by holding control or command J then selected group.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.550
Drag it to the down,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.800
as you can see again.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:18.800
Do it renaming to cap Cherie and do it for the last time Renay me to chop for So we have

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.850
tree progress bars here.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.660
Let's position damn in the right place.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.950
I have place that said one.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:38.250
I don't go for the last one and movie.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.260
It's on their knees.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:50.660
The 3rd 1 We have some issues year and we shoot change.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.760
Uh,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.350
Capri position.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:03.160
This is time to get her from distributions from the options bar.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.440
And absolutely,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.260
I'm going to use distribution.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.160
Verity Cali to the center.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.100
Go to cap Juan,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.450
and you can see the details here.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:36.850
So go to Camp two and chance the Progress bar selected by Holy and Control or command t and

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.160
expand it horizontally.
