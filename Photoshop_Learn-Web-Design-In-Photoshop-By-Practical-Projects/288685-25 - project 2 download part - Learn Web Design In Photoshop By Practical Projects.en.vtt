00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.560
I'm going to create testimonials for the website,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.440
so come over there were tangling tool and activate it top on the screen to create a new

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.280

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.710
The future part.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.150
Drag it to the top after dance.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.990
Press enter to apply it,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.820
zoom in again and position the horizontal guideline at the bottom of the rectangle.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.890
Then feel the rectangle with no color.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.550
After dance,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:58.440
go to the eclipse tool and trying to create as Syria Jill.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.050
Here,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.650
just make sure that you're creating the Sujal in a new layer.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.690
So let's do it again.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:21.050
Go to the Eclipse tool and create and new Surge ill here,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.750
then feel it with a great color.

Zoom in and screw off,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.300
then make a copy event.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.780
After that,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.330
expand the copy,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.140
then fear it with no color.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.580
Just use a great struck for dance,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.650
so we have these shapes here.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:00.350
Select both off the shapes and try Teoh.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.350
Move them.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.330
All right.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.280
I'm going to position these two shapes to the sensor off the rectangle,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480
so I'm going to use options.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.840
Bar Icahn's especially a line horizontal centers.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.950
In this case,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.670
we have another choice.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.180
Make it group for the circles on then use options,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.110

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.280
After that,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.900
you can on group layers and go to flat icon.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.650
That's call and search for a man icon,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.750
so there is not soft.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.760
Icahn's Let's find a good one.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.350
Then go to the icon and use alignments.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.010

After that,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.480
I'm going to reposition it,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.250
and I'm going to drag it to the down.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.890
Then select the rectangle and use a line.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.550

Then come over the line tool selected and create a line here underneath the takes box here

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.830
from the Options bar,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.500
we can customize it and change the thickness off the line.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.250
Using this slider again,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.280
I would like to use alignments.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.050
We have some elements year.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.650
Let's make sure that they are in a good position.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.650

Come over the text tool tap to activate a new text layer and type and name.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.580
For example,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.050
John Doe year in this case,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.200
then set a collar for dance.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.350
I set it to a dark blue collar,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.110
so I would like to hurry.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.150
Position eats.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.690
As you can see,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.390
you can do that.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.170
Why?

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:03.510
Selecting the rectangle and activating the text layer and using alignments.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.450
After that,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.110
we need another text.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.250
So I added to my project.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.200
It is a job post,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.130
for example,

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:24.350
who have designer do the same and reposition needs as you want.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:30.150
Then select these layers and make it grew up for them,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.950
so you can align all the group as you can see.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.820
Then,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.610
on group light years,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.750
go to the top layer,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.450
and after that,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.850
go to tools panel.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:55.500
Select rectangle Tool and here,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.520
above this part,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.250
create tiny a squares.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:14.950
Make a copy off the first square by holding on key and dragging it to the rights.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.490
Then use.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:23.150
Distribute horizontal and vertical sinners.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:37.050
Select the stared one from the Rights Select Rectangle tool and set the caller to green.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.450
Now you can see it is changed.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:55.620
Then select all these rectangles and aligned them horizontally to the center off the rate

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.820
tango that has no collar.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:08.150
And it's the first rectangle that we have created in these project.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.710
After making some changes,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.550
for example,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:21.130
adding more details to these paragraph,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.750
such as italic effect,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.450

Let's do it again.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:09.350
Go back to a Tangail and create and you rectangle.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.450

00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:03.210
So our import this mark up to my project and I resize it because it's too large for my dark

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.890
humans.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:16.920
I can resize it by holding old shift key again,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.250

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:29.940
I'm going to position this Michael out off my rectangle.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.650
Alito,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.790
As you can see at the bottom,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:39.270
go to the rectangle tool,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:51.050
