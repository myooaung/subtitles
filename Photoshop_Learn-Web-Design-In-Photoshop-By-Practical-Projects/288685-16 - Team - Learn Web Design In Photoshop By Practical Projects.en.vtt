00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
underneath breaking news.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.150
I'm going to introduce the team.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.560
I need four different boxes for this purpose.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.580
First of all,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.150
I'm going to create a rectangle with this numeric values here.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.220
Then I'm going to set a color for that and employ.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.870
That's why pressing on.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.450
Okay,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.980
So go to move toe,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:42.110
select it and drag it here and position at year after.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.970
That's we need a horizontal guideline.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.310
So drag a guard line and position it at the bottom off the rectangle on.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.150
Go ahead and I type a title here.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.860
First.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.950
I set a new collar for that.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.570
Then I type I'm going to type,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.600
meet our team,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.660
then increase the phone size on drag it here.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.990
Using move tool,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.050
Go back to rectangle use alignments to align text layer.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.830
So,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.250
ladies,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450
thanks to make a copy of it by holding all key.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.160
Then release it from breaking years.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.650
Group like this collapse this group Dan,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.850
go to the current layer and do some alignments in this case.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.150
All right,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:19.840
go ahead and select ik ellipse tool Dan Screw laugh to find a good color for the suit.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.750
Tell that we are creating here First of all,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.450
create this circle.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.170
After that,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.020
press enter.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.670
To apply,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:43.560
it activates it could live stool and pique and new caller.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.420
For that double,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.650
click on the layer,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.050
go to layer style and apply.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.250
These effects struck,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.590
for example,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.850
changed its size.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:08.950
Then you can appliance go to move tool drag aids a little bit to the top.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:23.210
You can expand it like holding shift key again so mean you can't disappear.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.950
Guidelines to see this project better by holding control or command edge,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.700
and you can activate it again.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.050
So we have the first Syria kill on the left side.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.050
Just some details are remaining.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:54.350
We should drag it two down a little bit or plaids.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:02.850
Then on their knees the Sujal Wien into a title.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.550
So type a title and peek a collar.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.250
We have a name here,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.050
but it's not in a good position.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.350
So make a selection for the shape,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.750
then go to this text and a line.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.440
It's horizontally to the center,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.050
off this shape on their knees.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:47.550
The nay and the job posed for this person do the same for this text,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:57.050
and it is aligned like the all there text.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.670
So,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.650
like this three layers put them in a group,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.550
rename it to member,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.850
then make a duplication off this group.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.450
You can do it by holding all key.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:33.050
Or you can make a duplication by holding control or command J.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:43.850
So I'm going to test the second way,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.250
duplicated by holding control or command J.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.850
Then by whole link shifty.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.050
Drag it to the right,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.550
position it exactly in here,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.390
then make some changes.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.050
After that,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.450
you already to create another duplication,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:30.440
do the same as you did before and place this group here so you can get help from smart guys

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:42.450
off for the shop that has red collar and it is visible and it's clear.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:50.150
Make another copy off the group position is right on the edge where the guideline is.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.000
Try to place it east side.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.050
The guidelines.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.650
Then I am going to customize the fair group that has place here,

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.050
so double click on layer and up in layers time.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:15.840
Then I'm going to change the collar off this rectangle.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.850
Before that,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.550
scroll up and peak this green color.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.650
Go back a gang of cleats on the layer,

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.060
two upon layer.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.650
It's time.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:33.250
Go to stroke and add this second struck.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.450
Why,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:48.550
plus icon Change the size and press OK to apply that so you can see a green struck around

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:57.690
the shape collapse these groups to organize this part,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:08.940
select all these layers and make it group renaming to team Set a color for the group for

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.750
example Blue,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:26.950
let's drag this group upper down team group So here we have this grew up done,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:36.570
but we're going to add another item on their knees the team group So I come over the

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.550
rectangle tool.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.250
Then I create this shape.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.950
I got to the top and picked this color.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:52.350
Then I go to the current active layer,

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.650
Then position it in the right place.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:11.670
This Jake goes for Parallax Effect that has a job script and Jake Worry coat But we should

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.650
consider it in photo shop.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:29.350
So I renaming toe Parallax Dan drag the team group upper than per Lex and set a color for

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.650
this group.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.570
Andi,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.850
it is done
