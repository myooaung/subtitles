Syria kills icons and takes layers in this case,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.580

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.860
Then drag.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.850

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.950
.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:45.150
Then come over the EC ellipse tool.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.350
Create a circle by using shift key.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.690
Such a great color for that duplicates the layer,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.250
then resize it and expand it.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.530
Go to feel and fill it with no color.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.150

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.450
then on group layers.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.250

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:01.320
Then resize it and expand it and use alignments.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.950
Place it in the middle off the seer Joe.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.250
Data rectangle start to type.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.270
For example.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.350
Latest tweets on.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.360
Then select a gang,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.750
the big a rectangle.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:47.280
And here you get a line elements such as the text layer or the icon so you can't drug it to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.150
the top later bits.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.720
So create a text box on their knees,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.850
the latest to its text layer and resize it.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.400
Then go to move toe.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.950
And from this part,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.780
copy this paragraph by using control or command.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:21.550
See and again go to the current layer and paste these paragraph.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.800
So from color picker changed the color and align it to this center.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.450
And from the Options bar,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:44.210
you can adjust a new vertical this stance between the lines so you can customize it by

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.350
changing these parts.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.750
Caller.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.620
It seems not good,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.810
so I'm going to change it on.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.050
I'm going to use their stock blue color.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.400
After that,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.150
I close text options.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.660
Andi,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.050
Go back to the rectangle Andi selected and go to the active layer and aligning its

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.750
horizontally to the sensor off rectangle.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.790
Start to type something on their knees.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.450
The paragraph.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:39.150
It's a name for these comments or the Steam o Neill.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:55.940
Then go toe line tool and creates a line underneath the name so it can separate the name

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.050
and all the elements.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.250
Then tap on the screen to activate and new text layer,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:19.390
then at a date to this position so you can do this same and a line needs presents all way

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.450
to the sensor using the options bar.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.310
So this part is done.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.210
I'm going to add a new element in this case.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.350
First of all,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:44.550
creates a group for all these elements and aligned vertically to the center.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.640
Then,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.050
on groove layers,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.850
go to there.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.150
Last layer,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.150
come over the rectangle tool and create a rectangle here,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.190
right on the edge off the stock.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:13.250
Humans her to feel and take this collar so zooming in to have more accuracy.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:29.010
Then you can make sure that it is fit with the bigger Rick tango by expanding or reducing

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.850
the size.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.330
So here is the retainer.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.550
We need another action,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.130
so go to phone.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.150
Awesome but calm and type angle.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.960
So here is lots of options for us.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.850
Select and Jill rights.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.750
Then scroll down and copy goalies.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:08.550
Go back to the dock Humans and so mean come over the text tool and tap toe activates and

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.750

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.650
line eat very to Cali,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.910
the center off rectangle.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.950
So here we have thes part.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.550
You can't zoom out to see the whole part that we are working on.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.630
Go to this rectangle.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:09.250
I'm going to add a drop shadow for these rectangle so you can adjusted here by changing

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.220
some values such as capacity,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.650
size or other elements,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:24.750
Or you can change the angle to whatever you want.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.900
Year.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.980
I want to show a shadow beside the rectangle,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:43.220
and I did it select on the layers by holding shift G manky group for them by holding

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.950
control or command G.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:51.450
You can't renaming Teoh to eat and set a new color for that,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.950
