00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
right so that we've seen him to use genuine it.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.640
We've seen how to use Mosquito to write tests with mark objects to more counter

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.520
collaborators that we've done that.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.040
We're going to take a look at hammock Rest,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.120
which is the powerful assertions FBI we mentioned at the start of the course.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.180
Now,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.520
in keeping with the spirit of the course where we show you just what you need to know when

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820
you need to know it's you'll find some units in here,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.530
which we've done together is where we need to get to so we'll see how to re factor on

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.820
involved.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670
The production code is a bonus to now.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.500
Feel free to skip these if you want to get straight to the ham crest stuff,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
but I think it's nice to see it as we cover a typical coding session that developer will go

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.550
through and talk about some of the decisions to develop will make along the way.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.850
Don't forget,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.630
you can use tests to guide the evolution of your production code to something is useful to

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.370
see this for you.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.270
We also take a peek at how to configure mosquito test,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.220
using its annotations to which is simply than setting test pictures of by handcart in them

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.230
as we saw before.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.180
So this section is really about amping up our testing on taking things to the next level.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.480
So which dumping now to continue our testing journey and Europe to look at home quest

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.890
together?
