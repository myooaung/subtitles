00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
in this video,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.860
we're going to explore coating of a repository in the data there.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.910
So you saw previously the logging controller doesn't actually know how to do authentication

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.910
.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.370
Instead,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.620
it has a reference to authentication service at run time it delegates of the authentication

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.270
service to get the job of authentication done and similarly as well.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.050
If one intern authentication service,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.050
you could also imagine here,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.430
that would be a similar thing as well.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:45.450
So you can imagine to be a private say I use a repository on the authentication service

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.950
might also use that use a repository to validate that the use of them is valid and to look

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.830
at the actual password after user sick.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.180
Imagine,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.950
for example,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.300
something like this.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.390
Use a repository,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.980
find boy using them,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960
asking using them that might return a user,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.850
for example,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.950
like so.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.290
And then here,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.940
instead of it being the hard coded password,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.150
it could be used.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.820
I don't get password,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.550
that kind of thing.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:36.640
So I could plug goes into create class user by using them crystal meth to and forget

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.100
password.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.350
We could imagine having a a user which has using him.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.170
I have a strain.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.050
The past would were the constructor off of that.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.750
A couple of get is as well,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.560
and we're just hard.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.950
Cut these in here for now.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.750
Just credit quick map map string.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:36.230
That's to use a name Teoh user call that you use up using a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.350
month password.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.180
Let me in,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.950
Frank.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:04.250
It's in my password.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.800
Whatever we just both got to uses,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.550
which we can look things up before.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.250
So then just return.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.170
Uses don't camp of the use and impressed him.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.160
And by the way,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.790
since we're putting things into a hash map,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.780
these users,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.150
we also need to make sure we've got a hash Gordon equals method.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.950
So it's just generators now,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.250
except in the D vaults,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.720
there's been no,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.480
there we go.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.750
Let's just do the job of seven now as well,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:50.720
so that we can use objects that hash.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.550
So there it is where they could state.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.560
Now we've coated a power controller.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.650
I was service,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.470
and now our repository on.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.370
We've defined a demand object that's the user object,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.550
but you can use on past back to authentication service in the business layer so well on the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.700
way.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.920
Now,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.600
with this code,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.450
there's just one more thing we need to do before we could get to unit testing it.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.160
That's to make things a little bit Tidier,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.450
which will do in the next video.
