00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
right.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.440
So let's get back on point to curbing the tests.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.450
So if I look at the service class,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.790
you can see that it uses this user repository.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:21.770
So this means that I need to include this in the test fixture private user repository just

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.150
here.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.090
So I just use a little trick if use a different test for now,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.550
with Run with This enables you to pass a different test rendering to J unit and use the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.690
Mosquito J and IT Runner.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
Then we can actually annotate this with that mark,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.110
and this means we'll actually have a mock to work with.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.900
So if we're going to hear by the way tomato work with for each individual test,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.940
so we'll still see the same behavior where every time a test method is invoked.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.970
Prior to that it creates a new instance off the test class.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.190
And then the Marquis told your unit running behind the scenes will create a new instance of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.390
this mock use repository,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.840
which we convince it up in the tests,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.080
which will do in the next video.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.010
When we look at the at inject marks,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.610
annotation
