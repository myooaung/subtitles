00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
it's in the last video we saw how to set up our arrange section.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.710
This means now,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.230
of course,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.750
that we can actually do the act,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.180
which is what we're invoking.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.270
The method we're testing on the test method here is gonna be get regular users,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.370
you can see so we're gonna call,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.310
get regularly uses.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.900
But of course,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.110
we need to call that on the system on the test of the class were testing.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.060
So it's equipment that was well used.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.970
Look up service.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.910
He was a look up service.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:37.010
And another thing we're doing is we're gonna use inject marks on what this will do is this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.760
is another annotation which works with Marquitos,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.390
your unit runner.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.520
When the test classes instance created prior to each testament had being invoked,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.250
it's gonna first off quit the mock of user repository.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
Then it's gonna set that mark onto the user Look up service.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.550
So now when we act,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.480
everything should be set up.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.940
We should have a nominal reference to use a look up service.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.910
We can call the method we're testing,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.100
which is get regular uses.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.680
And then if we press command on hover over that method,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.420
we can see that returns a set of user.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:21.500
So then we're gonna capture those uses important sense such that in this block here,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.370
we can do some asserts about the actual users.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.990
Now,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.990
for the asserts section,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.280
we've got two options we can out of the EU's Julian.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.320
Its assertions opioid.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.180
Or we can use hammock rest assertions,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.800
and we get to see these in the next videos.
