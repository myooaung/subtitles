00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
it's not to go back to a user look up service test will still keep those commented.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.370
This is the reference,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.860
but now we could convert the 1st 1 for example,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.400
to this former so assert that actual uses they were given the collection to the assertion

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.180
statement itself,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.440
as opposed to an individual.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.900
Elements of the collections were given the full collection here actual uses Is it terrible

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.820
containing in any order which is in this package here.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.640
So I put an explicit package women in there and then contains in any order you can see it

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.470
takes it sort of matches where each match of represents an element of the collection that

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.350
you're matching to be in that collection.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.520
So the first thing we expect is equal to which is a matchup.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.450
And we can just use thes create function for now because actually give us a new instance,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.150
which we contested quality for,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.490
and then cook it out and give the other instance.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.000
Which is Donald BBC 321 It's a knife I've run with control.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.200
Our you can see that that works just fix.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.950
I ended up here,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.640
and that works because it's got both on Donald in there now.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.530
If we didn't have both of those things in,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.250
that should be followed.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.850
But if I keep running this,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
we'll see that no matter how many times that run this,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.110
I'm keeping running it now with some talking about how many times I've run it.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.750
It's always consistently passing,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.320
and that's because even though control uses is a set,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.330
this doesn't take any order into account.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.300
It's just saying it needs to have these two elements here in whatever order that come back

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.300
,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.530
which is great for testing.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.450
Sets could make this nicer again by the static import trick,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.700
and it makes it much more readable.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.010
So serve the actual users,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.020
consented any order and then these two things here.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.340
So that looks good to me.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.360
It's not as our boss,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.320
at least as a genius oceans version,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.610
but we can still improve it,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.340
and we'll see how in the next videos
