00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
in this video,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.690
we're going to see how we can fail tests explicitly using June.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.330
It's assert dot fail mechanism.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.950
So let's pick up now where we left off.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.700
So if I remove those and we'll just tell you about another way or being able to fail tests

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.050
as well and that's with the assert don't fail method.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.460
So if you purposefully want to fail a test,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.570
then you could use this method to do it as well.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.070
And you'd usually give a message as well.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.590
So again,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.790
right,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.420
click run and that we can see.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150
We get this assertion era here.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.870
So there it is.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.500
That's so you can explicitly fail a test in jail in it.
