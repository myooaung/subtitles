00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
So in order to use this particular matchup,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.690
which I want to use that of Hank Wrist to do assertions on the collection.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.830
I need to install the full version of Hank Wrist now.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.000
J.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.560
And it doesn't come with the full version comes with a subset of ham Crest called core.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.930
And so what we're gonna do now is configured.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.520
The dependence is in the pond XML file to pull down and use the full version of how Crest.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.750
Let's take a look.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.790
So let's jump over to the Pond XML file now.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.850
The reason we're jumping over here is because Jay Unit doesn't give us everything in Ham

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.210
Crest.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.200
It only gives us a subset of Hank Rascal hand Crest call,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.400
which is bundled with Jane itself.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.750
Remember,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.340
we spoke early,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.550
wrong about different dependencies we had and how things were brought in Transitive Lee in

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.090
the words J.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.350
And it depends on Hank rest.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.410
So if we're looking external libraries,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.500
we'll see him without the Janet library,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.600
and we'll also see we got the Ham Crest Library.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.390
So what we want to do is we actually want to you have him,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.050
Chris Cole,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.040
which is the most basic subset off the Ham Crest library that's available instead,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.910
we wanna have ham quest,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.440
all which will give us these extra things in there.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.380
These extra matches,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.900
such as the one we want to use now,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.200
which is,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.270
is it terrible containing so to do this?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.230
It's a little bit fiddly,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.820
to be honest,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.450
but to do it,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.440
we're gonna basically out of dependency directly on Ham Crest itself at the version which

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.950
the version of Julian is already bringing him,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.350
which is 1.3.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.860
But instead of doing this core,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.550
we're gonna have home quest.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.310
All we double click that we'll see what go all conquest,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.230
conquest all started this up a little bit.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.810
However,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.350
if we see in here now,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.940
we don't just have ham Kristall with also which were directly imported in through this

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.830
dependency here.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.700
We also have ham quest core,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.450
and we have him quest call because Jay and it's brought with him.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920
So what we want to do now is to exclude Congress call in other words,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.840
make sure that the jail independency that we've added doesn't bring in ham.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.230
Chris Carr transitive Lee as a dependency it requires because we've chosen to bring in a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.280
more functional version a richer version which is still compatible with this dependency

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.960
we've added here.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.850
So to do this,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.630
we need to add and exclude close.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.550
So just on the scope inside the Jamie dependency itself,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.290
we're gonna have an exclusions close on.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.510
This takes an exclusion,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.210
and we can exclude by giving a group I D and artifact I d.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.670
It's good practise not to give the version because diversion might change.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.480
We wouldn't in this case because the version of Jane it would,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.760
including as a fixed version.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.640
But for example,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.850
if it was a snapshot version,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.160
diversion might change.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.720
But also we don't really want to hard code the version in here because it's kind of like

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.110
the dependency and J Minutes off its internal implementation details leaking out into the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.750
project.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.850
We don't want a hard card that version here,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.270
but nevertheless we just put in here or hem Christ because that's where the ham crest Libra

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.580
lives on the artifact I d.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.090
Is.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.650
I'm Crest Coal.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.380
When we do this,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.580
we'll see that we only have home crystal now and I'm Chris cause gum.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.330
Great.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.220
That's exactly what we want.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.900
We've now created our project to use the full version of ham Chris core so we can crack on
