00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
in this section,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.410
we're going to get up and running by creating ourselves a Java project which uses Jamion it

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.410
.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.190
Now I'm gonna show a couple of ways of doing this,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.200
either through the i d.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.940
By using Apache maven or the command line with Grader.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.630
We're also going to take a moment to explore the generated project structure and get a few

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.630
key guidelines to stick to when writing on test could that will touch upon dependence.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.960
It's curbs on Curtin conventions briefly with all this,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.390
then in this way will be in a good position to start learning about and using the J unit

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.280
framework and FBI itself in the following section.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.030
But first,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.000
let's look together now how we can get started with genetic and create our project.
