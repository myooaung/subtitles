00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
this point was a general point.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.450
It kind of feels a bit dirty that we just copied and pasted that method.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.850
So don't do that.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.020
Instead,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.730
what I would do is that basically,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.340
take this quite another method and say,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.060
Call this,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.690
get uses,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.590
use its hype,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.450
Use it so it probably make this private.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.680
I had passing a user type in,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.950
Um,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.000
Justin pulled that,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.850
and then I would use that here,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.240
and in doing so,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.080
we can replace them.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.040
These implementations replace these.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.990
Now we return.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.650
It's more generic method.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.300
Get uses by using time,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.180
time,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.980
time in user.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.060
And similarly,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.250
I could do the same thing here.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.190
I'm not drinking the user.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.110
That's good.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.030
I don't feel is dirty.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.620
Now everything is drawing to don't repeat yourself principle to know.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.150
Have you perfect girl blocks cause that's much nicer,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.240
that control our to tidy up any imports if we need to,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.780
which we don't.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.830
But it's a nice thing to just get into the habit of doing it.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.420
Makes things needs to interview as we go along.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.200
But anyway,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.680
now I've kept things nice and dry.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.100
That's that.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.480
Don't repeat yourself principle,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.500
but we're not repeating code or just mindlessly copy and paste in code.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700
And we've made it now such that we have a parameter driven method,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.630
which is much nicer,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.650
so let's move on.
