00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.490
one last point to bury mind if I just said a break point here on they de book test again.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.550
When it's running the first test method,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.710
you can see where this calculator 816 which is the reference to the instance he has put a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.350
break point here and here.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.550
So if I just play now,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.340
then we'll see that test positive numbers is going to be executing against instance 816 we

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.050
can see here.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.050
So it is plain that that's fine On the second test being executed,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.260
We could see now that talc is now a different instances.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.150
A different object calculator 8 to 8,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.500
which means that when I end up in the second method,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.060
test that zero to positive This test method is running against a different instance.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.780
Let's play that off SE completes.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.340
So this is a good thing,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.140
to point out,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.420
is the fact that the test fixture would you have on which you set up in the method,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.950
which is annotated without before that set up fresh each time.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270
Not only is the Senate method called fresh each time,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.250
which creates a new instance off whatever object your test picture is composed off.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.620
Not only that,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.450
but also the test itself.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.110
That s class itself is also recreated each time on additions that before there's also at

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.880
after which is almost never used in jail it at least in junior unit tests.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.840
But that would enable you to tear down any state from the fixture which you wanted to do,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.550
but other safer unit test.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.100
In general,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.950
these are in memory,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.480
so we don't tend to use its head on with its for those.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.570
And finally,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.380
if you needed to do any set up,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.520
which applies to all of the test methods.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.150
So you really talking about my doing test set up at a class level?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.290
Then there's also the app before class annotation you can use on their A game is a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.640
corresponding at after class annotation as well,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.710
which is the opposite from a tear down perspective.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.990
Anyway,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.720
I should give you some nice insight on how to use Jane it as a test framework on.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.900
Now we're in a great position,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.670
but we can start to actually be prepared to use it to right our unit tests,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.690
which in turn used the mosquito mocking library on.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.200
We'll see how to do this as we progress through the course
