00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
Now let's just see what happens.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.060
If we don't have both of those things in,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.160
we'll see that hand.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.160
Crist gives you a really nice every message running.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.390
Now we get this nice error message here,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.560
so this means it's expecting it.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.200
Trouble over,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.370
which basically just means a collection off is expecting a collection off on here.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.900
It specifies the collection itself,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.510
and it uses this notation Where the square brackets here,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.670
you could see a square bracket.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.850
Here's going bracket here.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.300
Anything inside that is the actual elements of a collection.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.020
In other words,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.770
the square brackets means a collection.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.950
So is expecting a collection off on the inside,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.650
we can see between these angle brackets.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.130
This is where it's specifying on object,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.890
actual object expecting inside that collection.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.580
So the collection has square brackets,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.780
and then within that you'll have objects that it's expecting which elements of the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.370
collection and those are in angle brackets.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.210
So here is it saying it's expecting a collection which just contends one thing,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.250
and that one thing is an but you can see here.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
But it's saying it's got something extra.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.540
What's go extra is another object.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.690
We could see it just angle brackets.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.750
That's Rivington object,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.300
which is Donald this thing.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.970
I'm not expecting Donald.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.050
You just told me to expect an A collection just containing an instead of a an and Donald.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.960
That's what that means that So we just put that back in here to fix it up everyone.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.510
And that's fine.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.050
No,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.450
if it turns out we had a different press would,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.740
for example,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.640
and then we won.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.360
Then again,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730
we get another nice error message,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.750
which is very readable.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.640
So this is a really good thing with ham crest over and above the genius oceans FBI.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.040
And that's the fact that the error messages you get back when you get assertion failures

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.120
there very readable.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.100
And they really tell you exactly what the issue is.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.150
You hear it saying Okay,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.050
we expect a collection off,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.200
and now we're saying,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:09.580
We've got two things were expecting in there and and Donald with that specific password.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.550
But instead it's saying I had a problem because Donald about Donald here,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.800
which has a different press,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.650
would No,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.770
it doesn't tell you the past was different explicitly.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.090
So you have to kind of eyeball distance.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.680
See that this password but here is different to this password.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.150
But here,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.500
But you get the idea.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.480
It's still very readable.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.410
It's much better from unit on its existing assertions.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.810
FBI.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.150
So it's fixed that up again by reverting that we run.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.640
Everything's fine.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.540
But now you know how to interpret ham.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.200
Crist assertion,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.680
failures.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.660
Let's move on.
