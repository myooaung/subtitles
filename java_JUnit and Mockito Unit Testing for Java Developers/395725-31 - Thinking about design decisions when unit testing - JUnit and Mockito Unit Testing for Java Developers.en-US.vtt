00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
At this point,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.320
we could literate and feed that back into our design.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.530
Maybe evolved this a little bit more to make it a more robust but in a try catchall,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.650
catching specific exceptions or working out basically how wants to propagate the exception

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.650
?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.440
Should this method here have a throws clothes,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.120
for example,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.620
which draws a checked exception which would cause any color of it here to have to surround

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.310
it in a try catch?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.590
Block those kinds of things,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.210
but that's going off into a P I design,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.650
which is outside the scope of this course.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.750
But you get the idea.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.630
But the really cool thing about Mark each other is the fact that it enables you to test

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.940
different scenarios and really put your production,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.260
can it through its paces in really intuitive and easy to use FBI
