00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,490
In order to get a better understanding of how Cloud9 came into existence,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,040
let's take a quick look at the evolution of cloud computing.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,810
Back before companies like Amazon had shared cloud

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,340
services readily available for the public,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,550
companies often had to host and maintain their own physical

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,500
infrastructure with their own on‑premise servers.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,480
For engineers,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
this meant that you would install an IDE directly on your local

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,640
machine that you used to write your code.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,740
Then, you would push your code changes to a code repository that

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,040
was hosted on your company's local data center.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,340
This data center often would also be used to run end hosts or

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,640
applications so that they could be accessed and used externally.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,830
Obviously, this creates a lot of overhead for most companies,

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,210
since they actually have to run,

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,540
host, and maintain their own physical infrastructure.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,870
So unless you're Google,

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,520
Amazon, or Microsoft, and your infrastructure is so

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,320
sophisticated that it could actually bring you revenue,

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,640
it's often a huge burden to have to host your own infrastructure.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,960
So, as computing matured, on‑premise applications

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,200
often started to show common patterns.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,990
Many applications leveraged common computing services and solutions,

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:17,640
such as databases, security procedures, object storage, user administration,

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,910
logging, and queues, just to name a few.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,360
Since most companies have their own data centers,

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,230
they would be responsible for running,

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,380
hosting, and maintaining these types of services within

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,050
their own data center. Even if they leveraged open source

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,170
or purchased external solutions,

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,510
it added another layer of overhead on top of purchasing and

32
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,680
maintaining physical servers. Then, came in the cloud.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,720
Companies such as Amazon decided to solve this problem by

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,230
providing cloud services that host, maintain, and run physical servers.

35
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,540
And on top of that, they also provided solutions for common application needs.

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,880
This concept of centralized infrastructure revolutionized the industry

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,510
and fueled the startup culture we often see today. By leveraging the

38
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,600
power of AWS, startup companies such as Airbnb and Lyft were able to

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,070
build world‑changing solutions without significant overhead, and now

40
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,590
they're household names.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,920
In today's day and age, cloud computing is widely available,

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,100
so let's take a look about what modern application

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,140
development in the cloud looks like.

44
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,370
Engineers will often download the latest IDE on their local machine to write,

45
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,680
run, and debug their code. They leverage cloud services for common

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,520
architecture needs they have and to host and run their applications so

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,540
that they can be accessed across the world.

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,520
Software engineers often have very high‑powered personal computers so

49
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,960
they can write and run their code locally without any performance issues

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,180
that would result in loss of productivity.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,930
Let's think about some cons of this setup. Foremost, having

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,890
high‑powered personal computers for every engineer in a large

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,740
organization can become quite expensive.

54
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,410
But what if the engineers actually needed to write

55
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,680
applications that require more processing power than even

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,740
the best personal computers can have?

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,160
Would it not make more sense to leverage the cloud,

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,380
since it's a centralized infrastructure with significantly more

59
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,540
resources than any individual could feasibly obtain.

60
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,970
If we mature our cloud setup a little bit more so that our code and IDE also

61
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,370
exists in the cloud, our computer then just becomes a conduit for us to

62
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,250
access the cloud where we actually do our writing,

63
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,220
developing, and debugging of our code, and our hosting of our applications.

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,150
Cloud9 is leading the way in cloud IDEs,

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,290
and we can easily access it via a browser through a URL. This means

66
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,700
that with a cheap Chromebook or an inexpensive laptop,

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,320
a developer could leverage the compute power of the cloud and

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,070
write and debug code with access to more processing power

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,840
than any personal computer has.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,490
One of my favorite analogies for defining the cloud is the cloud

71
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,820
actually doesn't exist, it's just someone else's computer. Using this

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,690
rationale, you can have access to Amazon,

73
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,500
Microsoft, or Google's computer for an overall

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,000
cheaper price than buying your own. So since that's the case, why shouldn't we leverage it?
