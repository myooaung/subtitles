Hi,

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.640
everyone, my name is Jordan Yankovich, and welcome to my

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.320
course, Coding in AWS Cloud9 IDE. I'm an IT consultant and

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.710
software engineer based in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.350
Cloud9 is a cloud‑based integrated development

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.010
environment native to the AWS ecosystem.

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.710
In this course, we're going to learn how to leverage Cloud9 to read,

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.610
write, and debug code with cutting edge functionality directly in a browser.

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.650
Some of the major topics we will cover include creating

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.050
Cloud9 environments in AWS, how to read,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.360
write, and debug application code directly in Cloud9, providing Cloud9

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.690
access and collaborating with other team members in real time, and

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.130
Cloud9 integrations with other AWS services.

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.530
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.310
you'll know how to use Cloud9 for cloud‑based software development

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.320
and how to use Cloud9 features to optimize software development

17
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.000
processes. Before beginning in this course,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.790
you should have some general programming and cloud knowledge to

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.470
fully understand and grasp the concepts covered.

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:27.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Cloud9 with the Coding in Cloud9 IDE course here at Pluralsight.
