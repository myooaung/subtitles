00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.620
Every service in AWS has built‑in monitoring.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.070
If you're new to this concept, basically,

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.440
monitoring is just understanding what is going on in your environment.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.730
Monitoring services in AWS make it easy to view how your applications

5
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.050
and your entire cloud environment is performing and being used. In AWS,

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.800
there are the big two monitoring services,

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470
which are CloudWatch and CloudTrail. CloudWatch, just as the name indicates,

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.640
is used to watch how your applications and services are running in AWS.

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.230
CloudWatch is used to aggregate system logs from all

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.540
AWS resources into a single location.

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.130
CloudWatch has a user interface that makes it easy

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.140
to query logs and set up alarms.

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.520
An example alarm would be an alarm that notifies a system

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.590
administrator when applications report error logs.

15
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.220
CloudTrail is a service that provides an exhaustive audit

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.840
of all API calls within the AWS account.

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.440
Just as the name indicates,

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.780
CloudTrail has a logging trail of all changes made within an AWS

19
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.810
account. Adding new users, creating new servers, or really just about

20
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.720
any action that you do directly in the AWS console is automatically

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.150
logged to CloudTrail within your account. With Cloud9, creation of new

22
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.500
Cloud9 environments or updates to Cloud9 environments will be logged

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.690
into CloudTrail.

24
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.840
With CloudTrail, you can monitor usage of Cloud9 within your account.

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.990
All actions taken by users in Cloud9 are logged within CloudTrail

26
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.830
automatically so that the system admins can monitor how the service

27
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.640
is being used within their AWS account.

28
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.840
CloudTrail logs include timestamps, users,

29
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.530
source IP addresses, and additional request details,

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.290
which make it really easy for admins to view exactly the events that have

31
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.540
occurred within that account over given periods of time.

32
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.650
Within CloudTrail,

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.120
you can configure it so that Cloud9‑related logs are placed into an S3

34
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.140
bucket and are consolidated into a single place.

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.270
Also, CloudTrail has a concept called event history,

36
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.490
which shows a history of all events in AWS that have

37
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.940
occurred over a specified time period.

38
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.880
The event history will store Cloud9 in all other AWS service

39
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.330
logs by default within a given time period.

40
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.990
We've covered a lot of content in a very short time, and I'm confident that

41
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.150
you now have enough knowledge to get started using Cloud9.

42
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.390
By taking this course, you've learned many concepts in Cloud9,

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390
including how to read,

44
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.860
write, and debug code, how to leverage Cloud9 features, such as debugging,

45
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.990
Immediate windows, environment variables,

46
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.540
run configurations, and many more to help optimize development in the

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.450
cloud. You've learned how to enable teams to access and collaborate using

48
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.740
Cloud9 using identity and access management.

49
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.720
And lastly,

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.020
you learned key services in AWS that can be used with Cloud9 to optimize

51
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.440
the development of solutions in the native AWS cloud.

52
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.840
I want to personally thank you for joining me on this journey to learn Cloud9.

53
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.820
I really hope you found the content useful and that it

54
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.000
helps you in your future endeavors. I wish you the best of luck and happy coding. Cheers!
