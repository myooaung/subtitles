00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.780
All right,

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.430
now that we have a solid understanding of what Cloud9 is at a high level,

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.100
let's get some hands‑on experience in using it in AWS.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.830
To get it up and running,

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.840
we're going to create a Cloud9 environment in AWS so that we can run,

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.870
debug, and execute code in the cloud.

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.560
Then,

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.980
once our instance is up, I'm going to provide a quick

9
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.260
orientation of Cloud9 so that you're familiar with the IDE

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.240
environment and the tools it provides for you.

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.940
Let's get to it.

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.530
Once we log in with an AWS user to the AWS console,

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.640
we can navigate to the Cloud9 service offering.

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.970
Since this is our first time using Cloud9,

15
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.740
we will be provided with the description of the service and how to get started.

16
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.460
Since we already covered what Cloud9 is at a high level,

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.640
let's just go ahead and select the Create environment button to get started.

18
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.040
Every Cloud9 environment has a name that is used to

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.740
classify what the environment is used for.

20
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.530
For this demo,

21
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm going to type HelloCloud9 and select Next to keep

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600
going. On the Environment settings screen,

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.440
we can customize our environments to meet our needs.

24
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.840
However, I want to note that for most Cloud9 environments,

25
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.710
users typically just use the default environment settings.

26
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.960
The environment type section allows us to specify if we want to use

27
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.440
an EC2 or SSH connection for our Cloud9 instance.

28
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.640
Essentially, this is asking if we want to use AWS or host Cloud9 somewhere else.

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.820
You can provide an SSH connection to an external

30
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.840
instance and configure Cloud9 to run there.

31
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.400
However, for this course,

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.520
we're going to use Amazon's cloud infrastructure by leaving the

33
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.120
default value of running Cloud9 on an EC2 instance.

34
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.560
Next,

35
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.650
we can specify an instance type to provide

36
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.140
additional resources to the environment.

37
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.380
For this tutorial, we're going to use the t2.micro size instance, as

38
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.880
it meets all the requirements we will need and typically fits within

39
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.850
the AWS free tier to avoid charges.

40
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.290
AWS has the cost savings setting enabled by default,

41
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.730
which means that after a specified time period of inactivity,

42
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.540
AWS terminates your Cloud9 instance.

43
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.860
This is a great cost‑saving benefit because then you only pay

44
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.090
for Cloud9 while you're actually using it.

45
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.640
We're going to leave all of the other values as defaults on this screen,

46
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.020
which will automatically provision an IAM role for us

47
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.520
and use default works‑based settings.

48
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.950
Select next, and and then move forward.

49
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.520
Now we are ready to create our Cloud9 instance, and provided a

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.900
few reminders for Cloud9 best practices.

51
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.560
Our environment is ready to go,

52
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.580
so let's select Create environment to get it all started. We

53
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.530
are then taken to the Cloud9 user interface.

54
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.130
Typically,

55
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.870
it takes a few minutes for AWS to provision the EC2 instance

56
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.000
and install Cloud9 onto it, so let's take a second to wait

57
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.510
for our environment to spin up.

58
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.040
Perfect.

59
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.460
Now our environment is loaded and ready to go! Before we start writing code,

60
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.060
let's take a second to familiarize ourselves with the Cloud9 console. In the

61
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.910
middle of Cloud9, we have our Editor Window.

62
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.620
The editor window is a primary focused area of the IDE and

63
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.140
is where you can create and edit code.

64
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.040
The menu bar at the top of Cloud9 can be used for multiple commands,

65
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.750
such as creating new files,

66
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.230
updating Cloud9 configurations, and customizing the view of the IDE

67
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.420
to meet your needs. At the bottom of your screen,

68
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.140
you have a terminal and a Immediate window.

69
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.770
Cloud9 has a fully integrated terminal that allows you to execute

70
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.540
standard Linux terminal commands and use the AWS CLI.

71
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.190
The Immediate window tab can be used to run and test small

72
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.050
snippets of code within your environment during debugging

73
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.080
sessions. On the far left,

74
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.410
we have an Environments tab that contains a File Explorer for

75
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.340
all of the files within the Cloud9 instance.

76
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.120
As we create new files and our application grows, here we will have

77
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.940
additional files show up for easy navigation.

78
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.080
On the right‑hand side, we have our debugger windows.

79
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.870
These are currently collapsed since we aren't

80
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.840
running an active debugging session.

81
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.580
However,

82
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.530
while we're debugging, these tabs will expand and be able to provide

83
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.540
useful information to us about the active session.

84
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.330
Now that's a pretty good orientation on the primary features

85
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.640
and focus areas of the Cloud9 IDE dashboard,

86
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.160
But let me go ahead and review that one more time. In

87
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.970
the middle we have our Editor Window.

88
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.740
This is the primary focus of the IDE where we create and edit code.

89
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.140
On the right‑hand side, we have our debugger,

90
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.840
which will expand during debugging sessions and provide

91
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.040
information related to our running program.

92
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.900
And on the left,

93
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.340
we have our File Explorer. Down towards the bottom, we have

94
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.500
our terminal and Immediate window. And, of course,

95
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.380
on the top, we have our menu bar.

96
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.600
Since this is a new Cloud9 instance, our editor window has some quick links

97
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.370
and features that can be useful when setting up Cloud9 for the first time. We

98
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.280
have quick integration options for AWS Lambda and options to clone code bases

99
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.460
from GitHub. If we scroll down a bit,

100
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.050
we can find some visual preferences we can update for our Cloud9

101
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.380
instance to modify the aesthetics of our IDE.

102
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.460
Main themes, editor themes, and keyboard modes are just a

103
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.000
few of the options available for us to personalize our Cloud9 experience to meet our needs.
