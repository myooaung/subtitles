1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,610
Since Cloud9 is entirely cloud‑based,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,340
AWS has incorporated a concept called shared environments,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,400
which allows multiple users to actively code and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
collaborate in a single Cloud9 session online.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,290
If you're familiar with Google Docs,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,220
this is a similar concept, but for an integrated development

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,250
environment. Shared environments allow users to view and update the

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
same code in a single Cloud9 session and collaborate in real time

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,240
with built‑in chat functionality.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,420
Paired programming,

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,650
which is a popular coding technique that involves two programmers

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,620
actively programming and debugging together,

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,340
is easily facilitated with Cloud9.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,740
A good benefit here is that both developers do not need to be in the

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,900
same location or even have the same operating system,

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,590
since Cloud9 is entirely cloud‑based.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,290
Shared environments are also beneficial when teaching

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,740
or providing live code reviews.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,130
Teachers can allow students to view active coding sessions to provide real

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,140
time hands‑on experience with programming. And code reviews,

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,910
which are a concept where teams of developers actively review one another's

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,710
code, can also be facilitated easily with Cloud9 in this manner.

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,530
Lastly,

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,070
general group collaboration is a concept that shared environments can

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,380
facilitate, as you can have entire meetings of large groups of individuals

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,910
viewing the same code on their desktop in real time using a shared environment.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,960
Using shared environments with Cloud9 is wicked easy.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,220
So let's go ahead and take a look at how you can leverage

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,560
shared environments to collaborate in live coding sessions

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,700
with other programmers using Cloud9.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,320
If we bring up our Cloud9 project from earlier,

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,390
we can see a Share button on the top right of the IDE.

33
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,850
Selecting this button, we can then control who has access to our Cloud9

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,320
environment. In the bottom of the popup screen, we can type users' IAM names

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,680
to invite them to collaborate in our environment.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,650
There's a simple button toggle we can use to either give

37
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,170
the users read or read and write access.

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,650
I'm going to select the RW button to provide both read and write permissions to

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,120
our user from the last demo named Luka Doncic. We are then prompted with a

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,050
notification letting us know that the user we are adding has full access to our

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,530
environment. We will select OK and move on.

42
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,000
Great.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,870
Now we have a confirmation that our user was

44
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,460
successfully added to the shared environment.

45
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,740
Now that our user is added,

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,880
we will see a popup that indicates when they have come online,

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,410
which means they're viewing the same Cloud9 IDE session as us.

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,220
If we select the Collaborate tab,

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,780
we can view the other users that are online within

50
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,600
this current Cloud9 environment.

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,900
The pane shows us the users in the current session and

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,640
also has built‑in chat functionality.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,840
Since we have another user online, we can collaborate with them on the chat here.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,430
Let's go ahead and send a message to ask them to extend our

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,540
application to add another sports team.

56
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Now we can see that Luka, our shared environment IAM

57
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,650
user, is actively updating the code, and we can see his updates in real time.

58
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,130
This example shows how shared environments can be used to collaborate in

59
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,540
real time with other users remotely in the same cloud IDE.

60
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,410
It's often useful to leverage shared environments with video calls so

61
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,380
that you can collaborate with other developers on the same IDE as if you

62
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,860
were in person when you're both actually working remotely. It's more

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,240
common in the modern environment for software engineers to work remotely,

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,640
so leveraging tools like Cloud9 that can facilitate online real time

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,940
collaboration with IDEs is essential for providing cutting edge software

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,040
solutions and collaborating with coworkers to build resilient products.

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,740
We've covered a lot so far in our adventure with Cloud9. Let's

68
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,350
take a quick second to review and recap what we've learned thus

69
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,940
far. You've learned how to read,

70
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,660
write, and debug code using Cloud9, and an overview of some of the more

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,640
important features that can provide a better developer experience.

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,500
You learned how to provide users access to Cloud9 for team

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,390
environments using identity and access management with user groups

74
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,550
and IAM roles. Next, you learned how you can create an environment

75
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,820
setup that has environment variables in Cloud9 to have dynamic

76
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,390
runtime of Cloud9 applications.

77
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,140
And lastly,

78
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,290
we showed how using shared environments can allow you to use the

79
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,410
IDE collaboratively in real time using Cloud9.

80
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,220
Stay tuned.

81
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,580
Next,

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,050
we're going to cover how Cloud9 can integrate with other AWS

83
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,000
services and some of the advantages it has when developing applications within the AWS ecosystem.
