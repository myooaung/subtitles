1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,270
If you found yourself here, you're probably already

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,740
well aware of what the cloud is, at least at a high level.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,480
As the concept of shared infrastructure matures,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,840
it rapidly takes over common tasks that previously were handled by

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,120
on‑premise servers, or even personal computers.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,380
A relatively new concept that has become widely adopted is leveraging the

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,540
power of the cloud for actually writing and debugging code.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,630
With this new wave,

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,390
Amazon Web Services, Cloud9, is leading the way in regards

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,590
to adoption and cutting edge technology.

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,500
Integrated development environments,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,830
commonly referred to simply as IDEs, are software applications that

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,440
provide tools for better enabling software development.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,350
IDEs have been around for quite some time and can vary in regards to

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,340
the features and visual displays that they include.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,880
Some popular IDEs right now include Visual Studio,

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:01,290
WebStorm, Xcode, Atom, and PyCharm, just to name a few. With most IDEs,

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,540
developers download and run the IDE software on their local machine.

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,740
They use the IDE to locally write, debug, and run code.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,710
Cloud9 is a pioneer in the IDE world because it actually enables developers to

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,740
write the code, run, and debug all within their browser.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,430
So what does this mean exactly?

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,040
Well, in short, you can access Cloud9 from a URL, and then from your web browser,

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,590
perform any functionality that an IDE would typically provide.

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,660
Straight from your browser, you could write, run, and debug code

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,640
with the suite of cutting edge features.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,540
Let me say that one more time.

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,290
Cloud9 is a cloud‑based integrated development

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:51,000
environment, or IDE, that allows users to write, run, and debug code directly from their browser.
