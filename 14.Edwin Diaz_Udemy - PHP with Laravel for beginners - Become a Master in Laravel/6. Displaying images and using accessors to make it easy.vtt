00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.600
All right.

2

00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:02.240
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.240  -->  00:00:08.020
So now that we have the image here it will be nice to display this image right.

4

00:00:08.100  -->  00:00:13.260
We were able to move it to images folder we were able to put in a database but there comes a time when

5

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:14.150
we have to display.

6

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:17.010
Right so it would be nice to do that.

7

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:19.020
So let's go ahead and do that.

8

00:00:19.140  -->  00:00:20.060
All right.

9

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:30.720
So let's say for example we go to what can we show this is going HTP now actually let's go to resources

10

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:38.490
and then views and polls and let's see if we can actually display it right here along with the post

11

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:38.940
.

12

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:39.510
All right.

13

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:46.740
So let's create a little deaf right here with a class of I don't know if Manch container or something

14

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:48.010
like that.

15

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:59.580
And then here we'll put an image here and we'll we'll put images and use blade and we'll see image path

16

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:00.880
or something like that.

17

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:02.790
All right.

18

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:05.010
This is a way we can display the image.

19

00:01:05.010  -->  00:01:12.730
So let's go and go to pause for a quick and as you can see the image is there is huge.

20

00:01:12.730  -->  00:01:18.200
But is there we were able to display it so we can give it a size so it doesn't bother us much.

21

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:24.140
Right of a hundred pixels and now the image should be smaller.

22

00:01:24.170  -->  00:01:25.670
So you can see right here.

23

00:01:26.330  -->  00:01:27.290
OK.

24

00:01:28.170  -->  00:01:30.810
So what is the issue here.

25

00:01:30.820  -->  00:01:37.000
Well the issues that we have to type in this static folder all the time.

26

00:01:37.180  -->  00:01:38.810
All right everywhere.

27

00:01:38.850  -->  00:01:41.250
So this is not very dynamic.

28

00:01:41.350  -->  00:01:48.930
What we can do is we could go and use an accessor to access manipulated data before it comes here and

29

00:01:48.930  -->  00:01:51.590
you add this directory you're ready.

30

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:52.030
All right.

31

00:01:52.050  -->  00:01:59.550
We can do that or we can even do it as it will it mutated meaning that we can go ahead and manipulate

32

00:01:59.550  -->  00:02:01.060
the data inside already.

33

00:02:01.070  -->  00:02:07.230
I actually set this value inside the path column in the database before we get out.

34

00:02:07.230  -->  00:02:13.620
So I think that sensor will be better because that way we don't have to be inputting these images name

35

00:02:13.680  -->  00:02:15.510
in the column.

36

00:02:15.540  -->  00:02:18.150
So let's go and use an accessory to do that.

37

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:23.210
So let's go to our post and we already have an accessory year right.

38

00:02:23.460  -->  00:02:25.220
Actually we don't do it.

39

00:02:25.230  -->  00:02:31.190
We don't have a here in these polls.

40

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:31.800
That's fine.

41

00:02:31.840  -->  00:02:35.730
That's Let's create a sensor here.

42

00:02:35.740  -->  00:02:36.200
All right.

43

00:02:36.240  -->  00:02:38.240
It's a public function.

44

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:41.790
And we're going to do get the right path.

45

00:02:41.790  -->  00:02:42.510
All right guys.

46

00:02:42.510  -->  00:02:47.550
They call them names Remember we asked to use get Desta a mandatory keyword.

47

00:02:47.610  -->  00:02:49.870
Then the column name own camel case.

48

00:02:49.890  -->  00:02:52.950
OK guys starting with a lower case here.

49

00:02:53.370  -->  00:03:00.960
So get path actually view Tootsie's has to be read in writing exactly like this to work.

50

00:03:00.960  -->  00:03:04.040
Of course you need the value right here.

51

00:03:04.890  -->  00:03:06.190
OK.

52

00:03:07.020  -->  00:03:09.130
All right cool.

53

00:03:09.240  -->  00:03:14.980
So once we have this or we have two those returned the data manipulated already right.

54

00:03:15.420  -->  00:03:20.070
So now how can we manipulate this data.

55

00:03:21.000  -->  00:03:25.020
Let's go and create a directory here.

56

00:03:25.110  -->  00:03:38.480
A lot of directory a property so we say the rectory calls right now is just not in there.

57

00:03:38.570  -->  00:03:41.600
OK but let's make sure there is public.

58

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:43.610
All right like this.

59

00:03:44.220  -->  00:03:44.990
OK.

60

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:50.100
Direction or direction that wreck story.

61

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:51.300
There we go.

62

00:03:51.360  -->  00:03:52.170
We're not going to sign it.

63

00:03:52.260  -->  00:03:55.060
As a matter of fact let's assign it a value right away actually.

64

00:03:55.370  -->  00:03:57.770
And that's just the images.

65

00:03:57.780  -->  00:04:00.770
That's it.

66

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:02.170
All right.

67

00:04:02.910  -->  00:04:03.960
So we could do that.

68

00:04:03.990  -->  00:04:07.040
All we can even set it to pass.

69

00:04:07.510  -->  00:04:09.910
Make a path whatever you want.

70

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:14.860
So I'm you say that right three years to make it more meaningful for you.

71

00:04:15.090  -->  00:04:19.830
So we're going to do this return directory.

72

00:04:20.490  -->  00:04:31.420
Actually let's do this this directory plus the value.

73

00:04:31.430  -->  00:04:32.100
All right.

74

00:04:32.490  -->  00:04:40.560
So now if I go to the polls to the end it's instead of doing these images here.

75

00:04:40.560  -->  00:04:40.890
All right.

76

00:04:40.890  -->  00:04:45.160
Now let me just show you that it doesn't work like this.

77

00:04:45.630  -->  00:04:46.980
OK that's the image there.

78

00:04:46.980  -->  00:04:54.360
And if I do refresh it's making me look really bad right now.

79

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:59.160
All because we have an access already so that where we can do it like this.

80

00:04:59.160  -->  00:05:06.240
But if we didn't have the access or this is actually we have it right here right here.

81

00:05:06.240  -->  00:05:07.010
Sorry guys.

82

00:05:07.110  -->  00:05:09.150
So we don't have this.

83

00:05:09.150  -->  00:05:11.750
I forgot to come in this out to show you.

84

00:05:12.560  -->  00:05:18.140
We refresh it doesn't work well because we use this accessor.

85

00:05:18.450  -->  00:05:21.560
Now we are able to do this.

86

00:05:21.750  -->  00:05:22.220
All right.

87

00:05:22.320  -->  00:05:27.240
And the good thing is that you can call or you can go in changes directory property anytime you want

88

00:05:27.240  -->  00:05:28.220
now.

89

00:05:28.830  -->  00:05:34.950
So for example in the future if you want to use a different directory for that you can do the you can

90

00:05:34.950  -->  00:05:35.240
do that.

91

00:05:35.250  -->  00:05:40.340
You can say directory one directory to whatever is more dynamic guys.

92

00:05:40.350  -->  00:05:48.810
And now we just access this as properties instead of you know put in the hd a male name here or the

93

00:05:48.810  -->  00:05:49.960
name of the folder right.

94

00:05:50.190  -->  00:05:54.240
So I hope this lecture was very useful for you and you learn a lot.

95

00:05:54.450  -->  00:05:55.740
Thank you so much guys.

96

00:05:55.740  -->  00:05:57.280
You guys are a blessing for me.

97

00:05:57.450  -->  00:05:59.640
And I'll see you in the next lecture
