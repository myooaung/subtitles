1

00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:01.500
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:02.000
My just did.

3

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:05.870
And so hopefully you got your.

4

00:00:06.150  -->  00:00:15.630
No Jason stoled and hopefully you were able to set up the global command to install it anywhere in your

5

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:16.230
computer.

6

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:16.660
All right.

7

00:00:16.710  -->  00:00:22.610
So you have to do is go to your terminal is open my terminal right here and type in NPM.

8

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:29.860
Install right in that should actually start installing all the no package manager dependencies just

9

00:00:29.870  -->  00:00:33.330
start installing a whole bunch of things you're going to see a lot of words here.

10

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:36.710
The reason why I don't do that is because I already did it right.

11

00:00:37.020  -->  00:00:39.470
But this is super easy stuff.

12

00:00:39.490  -->  00:00:44.110
All right you're going to see a lot of words here and should take around 1 minute to install them.

13

00:00:44.160  -->  00:00:49.920
All right depending on your system if you have a fast internet connection going is going to take maybe

14

00:00:49.980  -->  00:00:51.120
30 seconds.

15

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:52.530
All right.

16

00:00:52.530  -->  00:00:55.850
And if it doesn't do anything you have any type of issue here remember.

17

00:00:55.860  -->  00:00:57.830
And I've got an article here for you.

18

00:00:58.230  -->  00:00:59.100
All right.

19

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:06.120
And how I found that when I went online and type this is one of the popular errors that you will find

20

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:07.670
gold now found.

21

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:14.400
And I went and did that and I went here and you can see that you need to make sure that it is global

22

00:01:14.400  -->  00:01:16.890
this high fringy senseful global.

23

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:17.750
OK.

24

00:01:18.190  -->  00:01:27.120
So make sure that it is available in the command line in a global way and then you can go here to your

25

00:01:27.130  -->  00:01:28.100
terminal install.

26

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:34.620
If you don't work again restart your terminal restart your editor and try again.

27

00:01:34.620  -->  00:01:40.370
All right there is a lot of the Clemente's shown how to install this out there any errors you have you

28

00:01:40.370  -->  00:01:43.340
start putting Google guys and you should find the answer.

29

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:43.730
Right.

30

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:48.280
But once you have it installed and you know all the dependencies are installed go to your gold file

31

00:01:48.320  -->  00:01:48.550
.

32

00:01:48.750  -->  00:01:51.270
Yes right now.

33

00:01:51.750  -->  00:01:56.760
First of all the reason why we doing this is because we're going to be compiling a lot of files.

34

00:01:56.920  -->  00:02:01.800
I'm going to show you right now you should have these files see SS funds.

35

00:02:01.820  -->  00:02:03.030
NJ is right.

36

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:05.960
You download it either on the last lecture or the lecture before that.

37

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:09.030
If you haven't asked for your for these files.

38

00:02:09.210  -->  00:02:13.320
Or go to the selection download the more I make sure that you have them all right this is what we're

39

00:02:13.320  -->  00:02:14.060
going to do.

40

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:18.120
Let's go to the dogs and let's include these files in our project.

41

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:21.500
Let's go to our call hacking project.

42

00:02:21.510  -->  00:02:28.410
Let's go to resources assets and this is where we are going to be dropping your dad J.S. and the C Ss

43

00:02:29.150  -->  00:02:30.790
hoops.

44

00:02:30.980  -->  00:02:34.360
All right so they're going to be outside resources assets there.

45

00:02:34.410  -->  00:02:36.480
Now what the public.

46

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:40.380
And here you're going to be dropping funds.

47

00:02:40.410  -->  00:02:40.740
All right.

48

00:02:40.740  -->  00:02:41.730
That's it.

49

00:02:41.970  -->  00:02:45.390
Now what we're going to be doing is we're going to be compiling all those files.

50

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:50.610
We're going to be making all the files into one file so that way our application doesn't keep asking

51

00:02:50.610  -->  00:02:54.840
a lot of requests when when he's asking for those styles or scripts.

52

00:02:54.840  -->  00:02:55.430
Right.

53

00:02:55.500  -->  00:02:56.810
Hopefully you get the point.

54

00:02:57.060  -->  00:02:59.500
It just makes our application a lot faster.

55

00:02:59.520  -->  00:03:05.060
So let's face synchronizes you're going to see that being assets.

56

00:03:05.370  -->  00:03:06.030
There we go.

57

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:11.880
We have these files here and the reason why they read right now is because my idea of a BHB storm is

58

00:03:11.880  -->  00:03:15.590
detecting that is not at its worst in control.

59

00:03:15.600  -->  00:03:22.050
So once we finish doing this we're going to have to add OK that way we save our project.

60

00:03:22.050  -->  00:03:25.660
So as you can see the CSSA is there the J S files are here.

61

00:03:25.710  -->  00:03:34.050
So we're going to grab all of these files here all of it and we're got to create a folder here and make

62

00:03:34.380  -->  00:03:36.720
compile this into one file.

63

00:03:37.060  -->  00:03:39.020
Right now we're not going to do this manually guys.

64

00:03:39.030  -->  00:03:42.190
That's why we have golpe or elixir.

65

00:03:42.300  -->  00:03:42.860
Right.

66

00:03:43.290  -->  00:03:49.020
If you want more information about them make sure that at the end of this section actually you can go

67

00:03:49.020  -->  00:03:52.870
right now on Google and type Claribel later and you can find out some more information.

68

00:03:52.870  -->  00:03:53.640
All right.

69

00:03:53.640  -->  00:03:54.490
All right.

70

00:03:54.990  -->  00:03:56.250
So this is what we're going to do.

71

00:03:56.250  -->  00:04:02.750
We're going to use two methods all right to compile or styles styles is one method.

72

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:11.310
And we're going to take an array of paths and files and then we're going to go and cottony that with

73

00:04:11.310  -->  00:04:13.910
another Manticore's scripts.

74

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:21.790
I'm not making this up I'm not making this up guys use me these mentors are already there.

75

00:04:21.810  -->  00:04:29.930
All right let me just make sure that they are in a straight line or something there that's fine.

76

00:04:30.510  -->  00:04:31.410
Ok cool.

77

00:04:31.710  -->  00:04:34.510
So now I'm not going to type all these guys.

78

00:04:34.640  -->  00:04:35.440
Well I am.

79

00:04:35.450  -->  00:04:37.710
But you're not going to see me I'm going to pause a video.

80

00:04:38.070  -->  00:04:44.070
Well we're going to do is we're going to say listen style method you're going to go to the live folder

81

00:04:44.610  -->  00:04:52.620
and then you're going to file a file called blog post C Ss.

82

00:04:52.740  -->  00:04:54.770
Garcia says actually.

83

00:04:54.780  -->  00:04:55.610
All right.

84

00:04:55.830  -->  00:04:57.740
And they don't want you to find another file.

85

00:04:57.760  -->  00:05:02.070
Actually we should put this here.

86

00:05:06.390  -->  00:05:11.510
You're going to find other file in the list for there again and this one is going to be called Bootstrap

87

00:05:12.820  -->  00:05:21.840
C Ss and you keep doing that for all of them marae and dishtowels med is going to be looking inside

88

00:05:21.840  -->  00:05:25.190
their assets folder in looking for sucessful.

89

00:05:25.230  -->  00:05:27.280
Aides say there is going to be looking for this for that.

90

00:05:27.280  -->  00:05:29.540
Where do you find the right here.

91

00:05:29.570  -->  00:05:30.220
All right.

92

00:05:30.510  -->  00:05:32.440
And then of course with the file name.

93

00:05:32.430  -->  00:05:37.110
So what I want you to do is I want you to actually finishes up and write all these files down.

94

00:05:37.140  -->  00:05:38.120
And I want you to type.

95

00:05:38.170  -->  00:05:44.800
OK I want you to get a practice and I want you also do this for the scripts right here.

96

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:48.300
Very similar to that but remember that he has an extension dodger.

97

00:05:48.360  -->  00:05:49.590
Yes.

98

00:05:49.630  -->  00:05:50.140
All right.

99

00:05:50.150  -->  00:05:53.210
And he has a folder for folder name.

100

00:05:53.220  -->  00:05:55.180
Well actually you don't have to worry about that.

101

00:05:55.190  -->  00:05:59.400
It's you know the Scripps method is going to be looking for this folder.

102

00:05:59.530  -->  00:06:00.420
Right finished.

103

00:06:00.550  -->  00:06:03.900
I got a puzzle video finished that in one second.

104

00:06:04.860  -->  00:06:07.850
So I just finished you saw that I was fast right.

105

00:06:07.860  -->  00:06:08.320
All right.

106

00:06:08.490  -->  00:06:17.900
So I go oh these files include a year in my array inside this method and I'm going to use a second parameter

107

00:06:17.910  -->  00:06:21.830
here to tell it where I want these files to be compiled to.

108

00:06:22.080  -->  00:06:24.550
And I want them in the public directory.

109

00:06:25.410  -->  00:06:27.180
Public.

110

00:06:28.060  -->  00:06:34.410
And Jay if I find the J is Forder if you don't find it created that's what this function is going to

111

00:06:34.410  -->  00:06:42.780
do or this method should I say let's create that one too if you don't have it actually make the file

112

00:06:42.810  -->  00:06:43.200
.

113

00:06:43.230  -->  00:06:44.510
We're going to make that a file.

114

00:06:44.520  -->  00:06:45.080
All right.

115

00:06:45.180  -->  00:06:56.160
And we're going to do something very similar to this one second parameter that and Pawlick Yes and lives

116

00:06:56.190  -->  00:06:56.600
.

117

00:06:57.090  -->  00:06:57.980
Yes.

118

00:06:58.230  -->  00:07:00.890
Actually this is a CSSA guys sorry about that.

119

00:07:01.080  -->  00:07:01.590
All right.

120

00:07:01.740  -->  00:07:08.330
So as you can see all these files are going to be compiled to be lefse that see assess and know there's

121

00:07:08.350  -->  00:07:11.190
going to be compiled to be lives that yes.

122

00:07:11.390  -->  00:07:17.880
All right and all you have to do is come back here and I got my alarm telling me that I've been on this

123

00:07:17.970  -->  00:07:19.470
lecture for too long guys.

124

00:07:19.470  -->  00:07:20.140
All right.

125

00:07:20.430  -->  00:07:22.710
Anyway are you going to do down here.

126

00:07:22.730  -->  00:07:25.170
Come and say golpe.

127

00:07:25.170  -->  00:07:26.470
All right.

128

00:07:27.360  -->  00:07:34.200
And this douses now the find will we have some type of error here and we're going to find it actually

129

00:07:34.200  -->  00:07:38.880
reference styles and other fine applications.

130

00:07:38.940  -->  00:07:41.060
Right live to our humans.

131

00:07:41.550  -->  00:07:43.830
Let's find out if it did it already.

132

00:07:43.830  -->  00:07:47.650
Sometimes they get this type of errors and they actually worked.

133

00:07:48.120  -->  00:07:50.570
So I'm going to synchronize everything.

134

00:07:51.530  -->  00:07:53.540
And I go to public folder right here

135

00:07:56.100  -->  00:07:58.560
and something went wrong.

136

00:08:00.180  -->  00:08:06.230
Maybe some syntax error or something.

137

00:08:06.480  -->  00:08:09.360
This doesn't look right right here.

138

00:08:09.700  -->  00:08:13.080
OK let's try it again.

139

00:08:13.100  -->  00:08:15.290
Had a little space.

140

00:08:16.160  -->  00:08:19.900
There we go.

141

00:08:19.950  -->  00:08:23.370
Styles right.

142

00:08:24.470  -->  00:08:25.740
All all OK.

143

00:08:25.740  -->  00:08:26.860
I see.

144

00:08:27.000  -->  00:08:27.880
This is CSSA.

145

00:08:27.880  -->  00:08:35.850
Guys I don't know where I have my head so the ice is not G C Ss will go up.

146

00:08:36.280  -->  00:08:43.200
Still another error here somewhere.

147

00:08:43.400  -->  00:08:45.540
All right scripts.

148

00:08:45.700  -->  00:08:54.420
Correctly public is lips.

149

00:08:57.800  -->  00:08:59.710
Synchronizes and then again

150

00:09:05.950  -->  00:09:15.000
let's look at there a reference styluses Now the fine is having an issue with my with my style's

151

00:09:17.820  -->  00:09:22.370
function here is saying that it's not defined.

152

00:09:22.470  -->  00:09:26.450
And the reason why is because I'm forgetting these little dot right here.

153

00:09:26.460  -->  00:09:26.970
There we go.

154

00:09:26.970  -->  00:09:33.390
I'm going to leave this lecture guys so I will you guys can see the issues and how do we solve them

155

00:09:33.390  -->  00:09:33.800
.

156

00:09:33.900  -->  00:09:35.670
Golpe All right.

157

00:09:35.760  -->  00:09:43.600
So he's doing that and you're going to get these NADJI as little pop up right here on the screen.

158

00:09:44.040  -->  00:09:45.710
Really cool stuff.

159

00:09:45.720  -->  00:09:47.530
Lot of elixir.

160

00:09:48.120  -->  00:09:50.390
And let's go and check it out.

161

00:09:50.550  -->  00:09:56.100
So let's do synchronize.

162

00:09:56.110  -->  00:09:56.810
Here we go.

163

00:09:56.820  -->  00:10:00.290
As you can see it created the CSSA for their eyes.

164

00:10:00.840  -->  00:10:09.670
