00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:05.430
All right welcome back my students I hope you are excited and I hope you are motivated not.

2

00:00:05.520  -->  00:00:06.900
I want you to get very motivated.

3

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:08.830
You're learning really cool stuff here.

4

00:00:08.970  -->  00:00:12.890
And the more you know the better you will get and the closer you are to your goal.

5

00:00:12.960  -->  00:00:13.290
OK.

6

00:00:13.290  -->  00:00:14.520
So pay very close attention.

7

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:15.460
Wake up OK.

8

00:00:15.660  -->  00:00:16.230
All right.

9

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:21.000
So we're going to be talking about configuration files and the environment variables or environment

10

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:21.510
file.

11

00:00:21.520  -->  00:00:22.060
Right.

12

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:26.340
Right now I am in the environment File when we have two of them.

13

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:31.080
We have the DA EMV that example and that dot EMV.

14

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:37.440
Now when you use a composer you are going the composer is going to create this this to automatically

15

00:00:37.710  -->  00:00:42.270
if you're not using composer you're doing this manually so how you're going to get that dot the EMV

16

00:00:42.270  -->  00:00:43.660
that example file.

17

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:44.940
Why.

18

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:53.520
Well because this is the thing you never want to push this project to production where your personal

19

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:54.600
information.

20

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:56.280
Remember this is a very sensitive data.

21

00:00:56.280  -->  00:01:02.450
We got a API KEESING here we got a database connection driver information.

22

00:01:02.490  -->  00:01:05.730
All right we got mail information read is information.

23

00:01:05.740  -->  00:01:10.540
There are a lot of things here that are personal right to your application.

24

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:19.910
So what you do is you put all the necessary information in the EMV file that EMV that example file right

25

00:01:20.020  -->  00:01:20.220
.

26

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:25.210
Everything that makes application work and everything else you just leave it as default.

27

00:01:25.260  -->  00:01:29.970
Now when the developer gets it over there and there's Silex so that you ship your application and you

28

00:01:29.970  -->  00:01:31.750
tell your team listen I'm done with it.

29

00:01:31.950  -->  00:01:35.160
Now's your chance to to keep developing.

30

00:01:35.190  -->  00:01:40.710
You're going to send it with this daddy example and they're going to have to rename it to that EMV to

31

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:42.140
make it work.

32

00:01:42.140  -->  00:01:43.110
All right.

33

00:01:43.270  -->  00:01:45.430
So that's why you have this now.

34

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:53.130
If you see if you hear me saying constants or keys and values or whatever the thing that I use know

35

00:01:53.130  -->  00:01:55.460
that these are actually called environment variables.

36

00:01:55.470  -->  00:01:57.780
This is an environment file.

37

00:01:57.780  -->  00:01:58.430
Right.

38

00:01:58.800  -->  00:02:01.680
And this is kept for those of you that know about get help.

39

00:02:01.830  -->  00:02:08.370
This is kept out of version control right because it has a bunch of sensitive information.

40

00:02:08.370  -->  00:02:13.680
And basically for those of you that don't know how to get copies of a repository a place where you can

41

00:02:13.680  -->  00:02:15.090
put your project in order.

42

00:02:15.130  -->  00:02:19.350
Other people can collaborate with other developers can go in look at your pride and say oh that's a

43

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:22.550
cool pro-EU let me help them out and they can contribute to your projects.

44

00:02:22.560  -->  00:02:24.130
Pretty pretty cool place.

45

00:02:24.240  -->  00:02:27.680
But anyway you never want to send it to get help right.

46

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:29.420
Where all your sensitive information.

47

00:02:29.420  -->  00:02:29.920
Right.

48

00:02:29.940  -->  00:02:35.460
So this files guess guessing nor am guessing nor right here let me just double clicked that and you

49

00:02:35.460  -->  00:02:42.980
can see this get in more file has this file that it wants to that he is ignoring you in your applications

50

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:49.280
ignoring all the vendors the modules even the this is for homestead.

51

00:02:49.560  -->  00:02:59.280
All right that's virtual box that you can hook up to all your projects and you can make for your BHP

52

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:01.350
development which is pretty cool.

53

00:03:01.440  -->  00:03:06.240
And this is part of that homestead that JSM file we have all of this right here.

54

00:03:06.720  -->  00:03:10.320
And also that that Envy's ignore it.

55

00:03:10.470  -->  00:03:10.980
All right.

56

00:03:10.980  -->  00:03:18.790
So when you you know push this to get hop using get this get more all your personal information so no

57

00:03:18.810  -->  00:03:20.460
other developers can see that.

58

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:25.200
So make sure you never put sensitive information here you put your sensitive information right here

59

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:25.340
.

60

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:28.220
And of course don't copy and paste this stuff.

61

00:03:28.330  -->  00:03:30.780
Make sure that you take this often when you send it in.

62

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:31.130
All right.

63

00:03:31.130  -->  00:03:34.740
If you push it to get help is going to get ignored so you're going to be good.

64

00:03:34.740  -->  00:03:35.600
All right.

65

00:03:35.790  -->  00:03:41.640
So anyway now now that we know about the environment variables remember.

66

00:03:42.060  -->  00:03:44.640
Let me show you exactly how they're used.

67

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:50.220
So now let's go to database and actually going to configuration.

68

00:03:50.280  -->  00:03:52.840
Let's go to database that BHB and show you.

69

00:03:52.890  -->  00:03:57.160
So this file that database up ph is returning an array if you look at it.

70

00:03:57.270  -->  00:04:01.620
That's always doing an array with a lot of keys and values right.

71

00:04:01.680  -->  00:04:07.770
But not only keys and values when using helper functions there to define path we use in their environment

72

00:04:08.080  -->  00:04:17.210
functions here to pull out the key to set the key and the value right.

73

00:04:17.310  -->  00:04:23.430
And you can you know you can come here and you don't have to use this for each is the same thing as

74

00:04:23.430  -->  00:04:28.310
going to the daddy EMV right here and pulling this information from here.

75

00:04:28.320  -->  00:04:29.920
That's what he's doing.

76

00:04:30.600  -->  00:04:31.450
All right.

77

00:04:32.010  -->  00:04:37.830
As you can see they all these keys right here this environment variables they all the same in this guy

78

00:04:39.030  -->  00:04:40.350
right here.

79

00:04:40.350  -->  00:04:41.580
They don't change they're all the same.

80

00:04:41.580  -->  00:04:44.100
What changes is the information right here.

81

00:04:44.100  -->  00:04:47.420
So when you setting this up you don't have to come here and do it manually.

82

00:04:47.420  -->  00:04:53.580
You can if you want to but what's the point of using that EMV if you if you're not going to use it right

83

00:04:53.590  -->  00:04:53.750
.

84

00:04:53.910  -->  00:04:59.310
You come here and you set your values here and this is what we're going to be sending our information

85

00:04:59.340  -->  00:05:01.840
for a database connection or mailing or that.

86

00:05:01.860  -->  00:05:02.460
Right.

87

00:05:02.760  -->  00:05:08.820
So if you see this are basically called connections but as drivers.

88

00:05:08.940  -->  00:05:16.260
So we have NSU like Driver my well-posed gresse sequel server and all that good stuff.

89

00:05:16.260  -->  00:05:22.260
Now for those of you that don't know ask you like Eski lies a file base a database meaning that we don't

90

00:05:22.260  -->  00:05:25.950
have to use some type of special program or anything like that.

91

00:05:25.950  -->  00:05:30.900
These are information data saved in files.

92

00:05:30.960  -->  00:05:38.560
So if we have a small application we don't want to deal with my skew Well we could deal with as few

93

00:05:38.610  -->  00:05:44.340
light and every information every data that we have is going to be saved in files.

94

00:05:44.400  -->  00:05:52.500
So we're going to have a database that is skewed like file with all of the information about all everything

95

00:05:52.770  -->  00:05:58.410
that we need for users or for polls for categories or information is going to be saved in files.

96

00:05:58.410  -->  00:06:02.790
So that's why I ask you like really is and of course some of you already know my ask Well we're going

97

00:06:02.790  -->  00:06:04.700
to jump into that later.

98

00:06:04.830  -->  00:06:08.990
You're right because I'm going to I'd like to use my askew l a lot.

99

00:06:08.990  -->  00:06:09.740
All right.

100

00:06:09.810  -->  00:06:14.270
For bigger applications this is for small very small applications I can also show you how to use this

101

00:06:14.270  -->  00:06:18.540
is super simple and we probably jump into that later on in the course.

102

00:06:18.540  -->  00:06:19.110
All right.

103

00:06:19.350  -->  00:06:22.110
So anyway these are configuration files for our application.

104

00:06:22.110  -->  00:06:26.290
All right here and the importance sensitive information.

105

00:06:26.310  -->  00:06:29.600
It's right here I want you to get familiar with it.

106

00:06:29.730  -->  00:06:35.930
Now if you want to jump into this environment variable file you can go to get help.

107

00:06:35.940  -->  00:06:41.650
I'll show you right now let me look at it right here let me show you this window.

108

00:06:42.480  -->  00:06:47.270
All right if you go to this this was created by Vance Lucas array.

109

00:06:47.520  -->  00:06:56.100
So right here you can get more information and then we'll tell you why they are doing it like this.

110

00:06:56.220  -->  00:07:00.750
And they even tell you where it comes from from the Ruby on Rails.

111

00:07:00.810  -->  00:07:02.100
All right.

112

00:07:03.030  -->  00:07:04.450
So pretty cool stuff.

113

00:07:04.680  -->  00:07:09.250
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you got a lot of knowledge out of it.

114

00:07:09.420  -->  00:07:16.170
And I just hope that I answer some of your doubts about this file and the configuration files we're

115

00:07:16.170  -->  00:07:19.480
going to be using them them later on in the course so don't worry about it.

116

00:07:19.530  -->  00:07:20.140
All right.

117

00:07:20.280  -->  00:07:22.230
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
