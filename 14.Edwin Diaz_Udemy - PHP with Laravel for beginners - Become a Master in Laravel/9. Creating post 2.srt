00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:06,690
All right welcome back my students so let's finish this let's see if we can finish it without any hiccups

2

00:00:06,700  -->  00:00:06,780
.

3

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:10,670
But if we have any hiccups don't worry about it let's just fix them right.

4

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:12,070
Let's we just fix them.

5

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:15,270
All right so we're going to grab here the use of spools.

6

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:16,720
All right.

7

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:21,220
We've got to use the method in this case because we are using another book chaining stuff right.

8

00:00:21,230  -->  00:00:27,630
We're going to change another method you want to change the chain the create method and then return

9

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:29,770
the redirect.

10

00:00:30,200  -->  00:00:31,330
Right.

11

00:00:31,760  -->  00:00:37,370
And we're going to redirect back to admin folks.

12

00:00:37,430  -->  00:00:39,490
All right let's check this a little bit here.

13

00:00:39,490  -->  00:00:41,760
Just make sure that we are good.

14

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:46,700
Let's go to our requests.

15

00:00:46,740  -->  00:00:55,700
All right category has to be there list shows for now let's just do this right because we don't have

16

00:00:55,710  -->  00:00:57,060
category right now.

17

00:00:57,060  -->  00:01:05,790
We have a like a static thing going static value here.

18

00:01:05,820  -->  00:01:08,890
We just want to create a pulse to see if it works OK.

19

00:01:08,970  -->  00:01:13,530
All right let's go try this and see if it works.

20

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:15,290
If not we'll fix it.

21

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:22,800
My second post and let's put an image here.

22

00:01:22,930  -->  00:01:27,890
Let's just call this placeholder.

23

00:01:27,990  -->  00:01:32,360
I don't know Clarabelle pictures are going to get a Larabee pictures for you guys.

24

00:01:32,370  -->  00:01:33,280
All right.

25

00:01:33,690  -->  00:01:35,590
So placeholder there.

26

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:40,990
I love this stuff man Loughran though.

27

00:01:41,010  -->  00:01:44,110
This of the chain.

28

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:45,980
Something like that.

29

00:01:46,650  -->  00:01:48,080
Cool.

30

00:01:48,090  -->  00:01:49,050
There we go.

31

00:01:49,050  -->  00:01:51,050
So we were able to create a post.

32

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:53,780
The owner is Edwin D.S.O. of pulling out the owner.

33

00:01:53,790  -->  00:02:05,940
Now if you go back to that end it's let's use bring all these down real quick resources.

34

00:02:06,150  -->  00:02:11,680
Let's go back to polls and it's Remember that we're pulling out the owner.

35

00:02:12,570  -->  00:02:12,950
All right.

36

00:02:12,950  -->  00:02:14,830
We're pulling out the owner right here.

37

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:16,460
OK.

38

00:02:16,620  -->  00:02:16,920
All right.

39

00:02:16,920  -->  00:02:25,620
Let's go to the database real quick let's refresh and see that we have the user ID.

40

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:28,590
I mean the idea of the force and then we have the user id right here.

41

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:35,280
So we were able to relate those to the polls and the users table by doing their relationship right here

42

00:02:35,300  -->  00:02:35,810
.

43

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:41,040
Well by using that relationship because we already did the relationship.

44

00:02:41,060  -->  00:02:42,010
All right cool.

45

00:02:42,030  -->  00:02:44,760
So now what we got to work on next.

46

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:46,620
And we also have the photo I.D. guys.

47

00:02:46,630  -->  00:02:47,170
All right.

48

00:02:47,370  -->  00:02:50,370
And let's check on the photo real quick.

49

00:02:50,370  -->  00:02:50,700
All right.

50

00:02:50,710  -->  00:02:56,320
And looks like we do have a photo right here right here.

51

00:02:56,370  -->  00:02:56,970
All right.

52

00:02:57,120  -->  00:03:07,100
This image Let's double check our public images to synchronize.

53

00:03:07,110  -->  00:03:09,260
It's a little bit but I think he's this one here.

54

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:11,420
Yep place holder.

55

00:03:11,420  -->  00:03:12,110
All right.

56

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:13,520
So we're getting everything there.

57

00:03:13,560  -->  00:03:14,210
Beautiful.

58

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:17,640
So now the next step for us is to work on the

59

00:03:21,330  -->  00:03:23,420
work on the categories right.

60

00:03:24,090  -->  00:03:30,750
We've got to work on the categories and so we can give each post a category that would be really cool

61

00:03:30,750  -->  00:03:30,990
.

62

00:03:30,990  -->  00:03:31,250
All right.

63

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:37,140
So less on the next video we're going to start working more on the posts to make sure that they have

64

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:41,680
a category to make sure that we display stuff in the correct order.

65

00:03:41,820  -->  00:03:47,220
So you know let's do that after we create a category because right now we don't have category but we

66

00:03:47,220  -->  00:03:50,100
do have a picture so we can work on that.

67

00:03:50,100  -->  00:03:55,480
Also in the next lecture Lexie we have some time OK too so we don't make the video too long.

68

00:03:55,500  -->  00:03:58,660
What if we don't we just split the videos right with the lectures.

69

00:03:58,800  -->  00:04:00,420
Anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

70

00:04:00,420  -->  00:04:01,040
It was a pleasure.

71

00:04:01,050  -->  00:04:03,030
And I'll see you in the next lecture
