1

00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:00,950
All right.

2

00:00:00,960  -->  00:00:07,500
Welcome back my students on the last lecture we learn how to create sessions how to read them right

3

00:00:07,510  -->  00:00:07,910
.

4

00:00:08,280  -->  00:00:14,900
So we learn also that we have a function here a global function call session.

5

00:00:15,220  -->  00:00:18,560
Now we can basically do the same thing we were doing with our requests.

6

00:00:18,660  -->  00:00:20,220
We can do it in this function here.

7

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:24,630
So when we can say something like

8

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:33,960
I don't know it could be something else I should add this goes like that

9

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:38,790
Master.

10

00:00:39,150  -->  00:00:43,230
Or it could be Ed when you're your teacher.

11

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:45,520
All right ladies.

12

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:50,160
So we do this we can return that data.

13

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:52,200
Let's actually return it.

14

00:00:52,680  -->  00:00:55,790
Let's call it out in another session.

15

00:00:55,800  -->  00:01:02,280
LOL with a key one here like this.

16

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:05,640
And let's just return it

17

00:01:12,340  -->  00:01:14,140
doing two.

18

00:01:14,940  -->  00:01:20,600
OK let's give it a different key answer.

19

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:22,770
As you can see your teacher.

20

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:23,400
All right.

21

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:28,040
So we can we are looking at is this using our global functions as well.

22

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:34,120
All right now so we learn how to create how to even update because we can what we do is when we are

23

00:01:34,120  -->  00:01:42,110
updating we we said that information we grab the same same session and we overwrite it right.

24

00:01:42,750  -->  00:01:47,760
But we also have mentors like let's learn this Actually let's

25

00:01:50,940  -->  00:01:52,280
show everything real quick.

26

00:01:52,290  -->  00:01:58,630
So that way you can see when we delete it that it really does need it.

27

00:01:58,830  -->  00:02:02,390
All right so again a show or Sessions right here.

28

00:02:02,730  -->  00:02:06,510
OK as you can see this is a new session that we have created.

29

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:11,460
What I'm going to do is I'm going to need this specific Session right here as we enter with a key number

30

00:02:11,460  -->  00:02:12,580
two.

31

00:02:12,580  -->  00:02:13,130
All right.

32

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:15,070
With a key one two.

33

00:02:15,360  -->  00:02:21,000
So what I'm going to do is to say requests session

34

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:27,520
and then we're going to use a mentor call forget.

35

00:02:28,520  -->  00:02:31,060
And we're going to give you the key name.

36

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:32,440
Right.

37

00:02:32,570  -->  00:02:38,110
And now when you go back and does the end should be out of there.

38

00:02:38,460  -->  00:02:40,530
You see that.

39

00:02:41,130  -->  00:02:43,850
Now if you wanted to read everything and that's cool too.

40

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:44,500
We could

41

00:02:47,160  -->  00:02:51,370
and we got it and just use the flush method.

42

00:02:52,400  -->  00:02:53,180
All right.

43

00:02:53,480  -->  00:03:01,110
I like this nut flush enough flash but flush would go

44

00:03:04,240  -->  00:03:05,070
done.

45

00:03:05,490  -->  00:03:10,030
You see the that's beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful.

46

00:03:10,200  -->  00:03:14,430
All right there are there are a couple other mentors that you can find into the committee and if you

47

00:03:14,430  -->  00:03:20,130
want to dig really deep into sessions there but for the moment this is all we need.

48

00:03:20,130  -->  00:03:26,550
We're not going to be using da da da many sessions here in our course but this should give you a pretty

49

00:03:26,550  -->  00:03:28,060
good idea how to do it right.

50

00:03:28,200  -->  00:03:31,180
And the documentation should fill you in on the rest.

51

00:03:31,320  -->  00:03:36,200
But anyway thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
