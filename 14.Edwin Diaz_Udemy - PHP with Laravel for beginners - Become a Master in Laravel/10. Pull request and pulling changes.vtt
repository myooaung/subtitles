00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:00.480
All right.

2

00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:02.340
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.340  -->  00:00:10.210
So on this lecture I'm going to show you how to actually pool information data that has being of data

4

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:13.470
from the repository into your computer.

5

00:00:13.470  -->  00:00:18.750
Because let's say for example somebody comes somebody's country to see your project and you accept a

6

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:20.100
contribution.

7

00:00:20.130  -->  00:00:23.060
And those files go into the main project.

8

00:00:23.160  -->  00:00:24.660
How are you going to have it in your computer.

9

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:27.170
You don't have it automatically sinked.

10

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:28.240
So you need to pull it.

11

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:32.990
But I'm also going to show you in this lecture how to contribute to somebody else's project.

12

00:00:33.010  -->  00:00:36.020
Right and we do that by by putting a request.

13

00:00:36.030  -->  00:00:41.500
But anyway let me show you how to pool the files first so let's say for example I want to end the day

14

00:00:41.730  -->  00:00:44.520
the e-mail and I edit this file.

15

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:47.730
Let's go ahead and edit it.

16

00:00:48.570  -->  00:01:00.840
And just going to add something like I say one and say hello page one there.

17

00:01:00.900  -->  00:01:03.750
All right cool.

18

00:01:03.870  -->  00:01:15.340
Now I'm going to write what I did of in and staged the mail with Hello.

19

00:01:17.390  -->  00:01:18.580
All right.

20

00:01:19.260  -->  00:01:20.930
And that's it.

21

00:01:20.980  -->  00:01:23.130
We're going to commit the changes.

22

00:01:23.150  -->  00:01:23.550
All right.

23

00:01:23.550  -->  00:01:28.740
And if you go to comments if you go to your call right now and you click on comments you can see that

24

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:29.920
I just committed there.

25

00:01:30.090  -->  00:01:30.880
Right.

26

00:01:31.030  -->  00:01:31.650
Cool.

27

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:38.970
But now if you go back to your project Let's go to to our Get cores folder.

28

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:40.080
Rectory.

29

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:46.800
We can see the file if we go and study this file now knowing that stage the amount we don't have anything

30

00:01:46.800  -->  00:01:47.640
here.

31

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:49.410
So let's control at home.

32

00:01:49.800  -->  00:01:56.010
Get out of there and what we're going to do is going if they we're going to say good pool enter and

33

00:01:56.070  -->  00:02:03.360
now you can see now if we go to in it's not in that stage the amount that that change has been pulled

34

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:04.790
from there.

35

00:02:04.800  -->  00:02:10.470
All right control again if you can get log ops.

36

00:02:10.490  -->  00:02:11.190
All right.

37

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:18.590
You can see that even the commed has been pulled as well of data and it's actually a male with Hello

38

00:02:18.590  -->  00:02:18.810
.

39

00:02:18.900  -->  00:02:21.750
And he scans from the.

40

00:02:21.840  -->  00:02:26.010
That's a user that's they alter and the repository online.

41

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:31.020
All right so we have this information already pooled and we're Should we see that we can pull information

42

00:02:31.020  -->  00:02:33.550
from the repository to our local computer right.

43

00:02:33.690  -->  00:02:34.560
That's OK.

44

00:02:34.570  -->  00:02:41.990
But now let's say for example we want somebody else to we want to make a.

45

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:48.670
Let's imagine for a moment there that we want to make a we want to contribute to a project or I.

46

00:02:48.870  -->  00:02:55.620
So I'm going to log in as another user from another browser is super important that you know another

47

00:02:55.620  -->  00:02:56.550
browser sense.

48

00:02:56.550  -->  00:03:00.510
Again with the tech if you have another user and we try to link their accounts.

49

00:03:00.510  -->  00:03:02.070
So right now we have this user DL.

50

00:03:02.070  -->  00:03:06.370
Edwin right now and we have this repository with in the mail.

51

00:03:06.390  -->  00:03:11.810
So now let's imagine that another user wants to contribute here to this project what can they do.

52

00:03:11.820  -->  00:03:12.740
All right cool.

53

00:03:12.990  -->  00:03:19.200
So I'm going to get my browser I have the other project right here.

54

00:03:19.830  -->  00:03:20.740
The other user.

55

00:03:20.760  -->  00:03:24.390
So we have these are these are called the coding faculty.

56

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:31.560
So now I'm going to grab the name of this project right here.

57

00:03:32.430  -->  00:03:35.840
I'm sitting here and look for it.

58

00:03:35.960  -->  00:03:36.960
I can't find it.

59

00:03:36.960  -->  00:03:39.820
For some reason.

60

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:40.520
All right.

61

00:03:40.710  -->  00:03:47.320
So what I'm going to do is I don't into a van search and I look for the owners of it.

62

00:03:47.410  -->  00:03:50.570
Yes there we go search for it.

63

00:03:50.790  -->  00:03:55.230
Let's take this out and do it like this.

64

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:56.680
There we go.

65

00:03:56.880  -->  00:04:00.740
We find this there and now we are using the other account remember that.

66

00:04:00.750  -->  00:04:01.300
OK.

67

00:04:01.440  -->  00:04:07.770
We're using the other account the recording faculty and we're going to make a new pool requests.

68

00:04:07.770  -->  00:04:08.510
All right.

69

00:04:08.850  -->  00:04:12.920
So we see this project here and we say listen I want to contribute to this.

70

00:04:12.930  -->  00:04:16.020
How can I contribute to this right.

71

00:04:16.320  -->  00:04:25.930
Well the first the first step to contribute to any project is by making a poor request.

72

00:04:25.950  -->  00:04:31.300
All right but let's forget about making a poor request.

73

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:39.800
Let's say you want to have this project in your computer and then you want to do changes there.

74

00:04:39.840  -->  00:04:43.500
You don't want to just come here and edit files from here because we can do that.

75

00:04:43.500  -->  00:04:44.640
Anybody could do that.

76

00:04:44.840  -->  00:04:54.950
But let's go ahead and fork this awry and it's asking me where should you see is already the testing

77

00:04:54.960  -->  00:04:56.670
that these accounts are linked.

78

00:04:56.680  -->  00:05:00.780
So I'm going to fork it to this user.

79

00:05:00.790  -->  00:05:03.280
All right and you're going to see this in a minute here.

80

00:05:03.610  -->  00:05:06.840
So is forking this.

81

00:05:06.850  -->  00:05:14.430
And now if I go to this user we have these new repository created for us there.

82

00:05:14.500  -->  00:05:20.460
So now I've got to do is come back to my local computer and let's say forget about this learning good

83

00:05:20.470  -->  00:05:23.850
this is the other did as users folder.

84

00:05:23.880  -->  00:05:27.210
Let's create another for the for the coding faculty.

85

00:05:27.220  -->  00:05:31.790
So I'm to courting faculty.

86

00:05:32.080  -->  00:05:32.920
All right.

87

00:05:33.310  -->  00:05:44.680
And now I'm going to go to the terminal and I clear all this out and go into the desktop and I'm going

88

00:05:44.680  -->  00:05:46.250
to go to this folder.

89

00:05:46.260  -->  00:05:55.490
And here is what I'm going to say get clone loops and paste that you are all in there answer.

90

00:05:55.650  -->  00:05:56.070
All right.

91

00:05:56.070  -->  00:05:57.810
And now if I do.

92

00:05:57.840  -->  00:06:04.610
Unless you can see the good course in there and I can go and see the two that I would go.

93

00:06:04.890  -->  00:06:06.480
Now we have that in the demo.

94

00:06:06.490  -->  00:06:11.640
Now here you can start doing basically the same thing we have been doing all this time.

95

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:12.570
All right.

96

00:06:12.900  -->  00:06:19.950
Now all we have to do is let's say for example we create a new file.

97

00:06:19.950  -->  00:06:27.470
Remember that when you for a kid what you do is when you fork it you create a new copy in your own account

98

00:06:27.490  -->  00:06:27.690
.

99

00:06:28.060  -->  00:06:33.890
And then you are cloning that same copy your copy into your local computer.

100

00:06:34.380  -->  00:06:34.970
All right.

101

00:06:35.070  -->  00:06:37.290
So here you walk onto the whatever you want.

102

00:06:37.300  -->  00:06:39.980
This is your own copy of the project.

103

00:06:39.990  -->  00:06:40.960
All right.

104

00:06:41.110  -->  00:06:49.720
You're not making changes in the other repository which is which belongs to this guy right here.

105

00:06:49.720  -->  00:06:51.240
You're not making changes there.

106

00:06:51.430  -->  00:06:54.730
I'll show you right now that we are not so let's say good.

107

00:06:54.750  -->  00:06:57.990
And we're going to add everything in their.

108

00:06:58.720  -->  00:07:03.490
And then we're going to say good comment with a message.

109

00:07:03.490  -->  00:07:07.890
And mine you committed or something like that.

110

00:07:07.960  -->  00:07:11.810
There we go get status.

111

00:07:11.850  -->  00:07:14.790
Let's get started here.

112

00:07:14.800  -->  00:07:15.360
All right.

113

00:07:15.490  -->  00:07:16.300
That's it.

114

00:07:16.300  -->  00:07:18.210
All right so now let's push this up.

115

00:07:18.220  -->  00:07:21.640
Let's say good push origin.

116

00:07:22.140  -->  00:07:22.780
Right.

117

00:07:23.050  -->  00:07:28.980
And Master answer is going ask is for the name.

118

00:07:29.050  -->  00:07:33.010
This has a different user name according.

119

00:07:33.090  -->  00:07:38.380
For the password.

120

00:07:38.620  -->  00:07:39.190
There we go.

121

00:07:39.220  -->  00:07:46.190
And now if we come back here and refresh this other account you can see that has posed at BHB.

122

00:07:46.300  -->  00:07:51.690
And if you go to the other I counted as and when I count your refresh and that one does not have those

123

00:07:51.690  -->  00:07:53.610
changes.

124

00:07:53.620  -->  00:07:54.600
All right.

125

00:07:55.460  -->  00:08:02.980
So you're working entirely on a different dot contribute contributor is working entirely on a different

126

00:08:03.150  -->  00:08:03.760
project.

127

00:08:03.750  -->  00:08:04.320
Right.

128

00:08:04.500  -->  00:08:06.870
They clone your project they're working on it.

129

00:08:07.060  -->  00:08:10.740
They can do a new pool requests.

130

00:08:10.740  -->  00:08:12.190
All right.

131

00:08:13.060  -->  00:08:17.070
And create a pool request my new commed.

132

00:08:17.120  -->  00:08:17.980
All right.

133

00:08:18.120  -->  00:08:25.210
Now they created up all requests and when you go to your project here refresh you gonna to see that

134

00:08:25.210  -->  00:08:26.910
this person has a new command.

135

00:08:26.910  -->  00:08:28.790
If you want accepter or not.

136

00:08:29.210  -->  00:08:29.870
All right.

137

00:08:30.000  -->  00:08:37.690
You click on it and you say listen wow that new command looks exciting.

138

00:08:37.680  -->  00:08:38.600
What did he do.

139

00:08:38.710  -->  00:08:39.300
All right.

140

00:08:39.490  -->  00:08:41.780
So you first check of what that person did.

141

00:08:41.780  -->  00:08:44.280
They committed it they create it right here.

142

00:08:44.430  -->  00:08:48.040
You check on it you see that they created this new file.

143

00:08:48.030  -->  00:08:53.790
You check you make sure that is good and then you you can go back and you say you know what I like it

144

00:08:53.910  -->  00:08:55.060
and you merge it.

145

00:08:55.090  -->  00:08:58.200
Cf. March done.

146

00:08:58.210  -->  00:09:02.460
Now you go back to your code and now the new file is there.

147

00:09:02.500  -->  00:09:06.210
All right I hope you see the concept on how easy it is to country view.

148

00:09:06.270  -->  00:09:09.990
Now don't confuse your contributors with collaborators.

149

00:09:10.000  -->  00:09:12.380
All right there are two different things I'm going to show you right now.

150

00:09:12.490  -->  00:09:17.970
If I go to settings real quick and I got a collaborator when you want to collaborate are they have the

151

00:09:18.150  -->  00:09:21.960
they have a lot more information than contribute a contributor.

152

00:09:22.000  -->  00:09:27.490
So when you had a collaborator make sure that you know the person that you trust the person because

153

00:09:27.620  -->  00:09:31.190
what they can do is that can push changes into your main project.

154

00:09:31.240  -->  00:09:32.280
Right.

155

00:09:32.380  -->  00:09:36.460
You can look for the the name of that contributor here.

156

00:09:37.210  -->  00:09:38.090
OK.

157

00:09:38.430  -->  00:09:42.470
The coding faculty for example.

158

00:09:42.610  -->  00:09:49.470
Well I mean according faculty right there you can find that Contributor and you King Adam and then they

159

00:09:49.480  -->  00:09:54.470
can do more things that contribute our contributor is anybody that find your project on line.

160

00:09:54.490  -->  00:09:59.110
Because remember that your projects Pawlick arrive by default.

161

00:09:59.430  -->  00:10:03.060
And if anybody finds it online they can become a country contributor.

162

00:10:03.150  -->  00:10:06.240
They can create a pool request if you like their requests.

163

00:10:06.400  -->  00:10:09.180
Then you can merge it to your project and create a better project.

164

00:10:09.180  -->  00:10:11.190
All right so hopefully you got the idea.

165

00:10:11.400  -->  00:10:15.990
But anyway if you don't don't worry we're going to keep playing around with this.

166

00:10:16.200  -->  00:10:22.450
We're going to go and create the our project and we're going to upload it to hop and make sure that

167

00:10:22.440  -->  00:10:23.250
it's there.

168

00:10:23.290  -->  00:10:29.580
And and I'd suggest that you do it right that you upload anything not overload everything but make sure

169

00:10:29.590  -->  00:10:34.870
that you have version control on your important files or you have version control in your project or

170

00:10:34.870  -->  00:10:39.210
right every time you're creating a real project online that you care about.

171

00:10:39.550  -->  00:10:41.480
Use version control use good.

172

00:10:41.670  -->  00:10:42.030
All right.

173

00:10:42.040  -->  00:10:47.030
But anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next hour lectures.
