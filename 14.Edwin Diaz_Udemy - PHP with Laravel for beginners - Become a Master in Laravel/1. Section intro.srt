00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:05,700
Write welcome back my students on this lecture we're going to learn about made awareness and awareness

2

00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:12,510
is like a filtering mechanism for H.E. or our HTP requies are coming in in the application.

3

00:00:12,510  -->  00:00:19,100
So if you have a request to go to the let's say they create a functionality or create view then we can

4

00:00:19,100  -->  00:00:24,390
have a middleware saying OK listen do not allow anybody that's not authenticated to go to that create

5

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:24,900
.

6

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:25,650
All right.

7

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:31,830
So that's what we can do we're made a wish is super super cool is next layer of protection for application

8

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:37,020
and it's very useful and you're going to use them throughout your whole application process.

9

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:38,110
I'm pretty sure.

10

00:00:38,170  -->  00:00:43,100
All right so if you're not going to use middleware you're not building a really cool application midways

11

00:00:43,140  -->  00:00:46,840
or one of the keys in protecting certain aspects of your application.

12

00:00:46,840  -->  00:00:52,930
So for that we're going to build a new We're going to create a new installation of Clarabell.

13

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:54,160
Yes that's right.

14

00:00:54,270  -->  00:00:54,870
All right.

15

00:00:54,960  -->  00:00:58,860
You're going to create one and I'm not going to even do it in this lecture and I'm not going to do it

16

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:01,460
on the next lecture or I already created one.

17

00:01:01,460  -->  00:01:07,020
So I want you to go to the next lecture with that installation of Laro create it.

18

00:01:07,140  -->  00:01:10,760
And it needs to be called made aware right.

19

00:01:10,830  -->  00:01:13,230
So go ahead and create your database.

20

00:01:13,280  -->  00:01:15,870
Go go ahead and create your migrations.

21

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:18,510
Go ahead and create even your logon system.

22

00:01:18,840  -->  00:01:22,050
And on the next lecture I expect you to have all that ready.

23

00:01:22,050  -->  00:01:24,000
This is an assignment for you.

24

00:01:24,000  -->  00:01:25,480
So how old are ready.

25

00:01:25,590  -->  00:01:28,950
And then we're going to go and learn about middleware.

26

00:01:29,060  -->  00:01:29,650
All right.

27

00:01:29,850  -->  00:01:31,830
So I see you in the next lecture.

28

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:34,890
And if you have any questions please post them in the discussion.

29

00:01:35,430  -->  00:01:37,680
But I expect you to do that remember.

30

00:01:37,780  -->  00:01:41,360
You build a whole application from scratch.

31

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:46,020
Meaning that you're going to have what you're logging system you're going to have your database connection

32

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:47,160
your migrations.

33

00:01:47,170  -->  00:01:52,420
Now just want the deadly migration doesn't have to be any other migration just the full migrations with

34

00:01:52,420  -->  00:01:53,680
the logging system.

35

00:01:53,980  -->  00:01:54,580
Right.

36

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:58,120
And the application needs to be named made aware.

37

00:01:58,140  -->  00:01:58,670
All right.

38

00:01:58,860  -->  00:02:00,410
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

39

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:01,920
I hope you're ready.
