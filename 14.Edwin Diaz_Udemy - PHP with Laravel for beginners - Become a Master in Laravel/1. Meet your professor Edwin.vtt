00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:02.520
I welcome my name is Edwin D.S..

2

00:00:02.520  -->  00:00:06.600
Now I'm going to be the instructor for this course and I want to give you a couple of tips and I want

3

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:12.150
to you know to introduce myself and so we can get to know each other a little bit before we get a little

4

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:13.620
deeper into the course.

5

00:00:13.710  -->  00:00:20.340
Now I welcome everybody from anywhere in the country anywhere in this country anywhere in any other

6

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:21.090
country.

7

00:00:21.300  -->  00:00:23.740
I don't care about your color I don't care about your age.

8

00:00:23.790  -->  00:00:26.300
Anybody can learn programming who matter who you are.

9

00:00:26.370  -->  00:00:26.960
All right.

10

00:00:27.090  -->  00:00:31.250
So I just wrote down a couple of notes here that I want to actually get down to you.

11

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:36.150
First of all make sure that you're writing you're taking notes when you're actually taking this course

12

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.080
you invest your time and your money for this course take advantage over every single moment there.

13

00:00:41.090  -->  00:00:41.430
Right.

14

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:42.880
Don't write those notes.

15

00:00:42.990  -->  00:00:49.200
We watch the videos make sure that you know the subject in that lecture before you go to the next one

16

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:49.460
.

17

00:00:49.550  -->  00:00:52.360
And it only makes sense right now.

18

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:57.720
Another thing that I wrote here my little piece of paper which is an envelope Actually I don't I don't

19

00:00:57.780  -->  00:01:02.760
use scripts on my courses I like to be natural because I believe that teaching is something that you

20

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:08.340
have to love doing and I love teaching but I also know that transmitting what I got here to my students

21

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:08.520
.

22

00:01:08.520  -->  00:01:10.520
For me it's teaching.

23

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:11.160
All right.

24

00:01:11.340  -->  00:01:16.360
I don't consider you know reading a script in a second monitor on a monitor.

25

00:01:16.530  -->  00:01:21.290
And you know making my students fall asleep I don't consider that teaching so I'm all natural.

26

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:22.710
And I'd like to stay that way.

27

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:26.310
And if you have a problem well that's just the way I am I'm letting you know.

28

00:01:26.310  -->  00:01:26.800
All right.

29

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:30.990
So you first of all I wrote down this little piece of paper here.

30

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:35.490
You have to like what you're doing because if you came into this course thinking that you're just going

31

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:41.460
to get that knowledge and leave without liking programming you're probably going to fail you probably

32

00:01:41.460  -->  00:01:46.300
not going to finish his course discourse is going to be a really complete course.

33

00:01:46.300  -->  00:01:48.360
All right we're going to have a lot of stuff going here.

34

00:01:48.370  -->  00:01:53.670
I'm going I always keep adding lectures but you have to like this stuff if you don't like programming

35

00:01:54.140  -->  00:01:55.260
you're not going to finish it.

36

00:01:55.290  -->  00:02:00.450
And if you finish it by the time you finish it you won't want to write another piece of cold again.

37

00:02:00.480  -->  00:02:02.850
So make sure that you like what you're doing right.

38

00:02:02.880  -->  00:02:06.120
And that's that's for everything for your career goals.

39

00:02:06.120  -->  00:02:07.100
All right.

40

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:11.670
Get into something that you like and your time will be you know we'll fly away when you're doing it

41

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:11.790
.

42

00:02:11.810  -->  00:02:12.210
All right.

43

00:02:12.210  -->  00:02:13.460
Just keep that in mind.

44

00:02:13.740  -->  00:02:19.470
So another time another thing that I put here my little piece of paper is you need to put in the time

45

00:02:19.470  -->  00:02:19.620
.

46

00:02:19.620  -->  00:02:25.860
I know some of you are super busy but if you go from work and you have your kids or your girlfriend

47

00:02:25.860  -->  00:02:31.460
whoever is you know doing stuff just tell them Listen I need some time to study.

48

00:02:31.470  -->  00:02:37.230
Take 30 minutes will take one hour a day or whatever time you have and just focus on that thing only

49

00:02:37.230  -->  00:02:41.820
so if you are going to take to lectures they make sure that you take those two lectures but you really

50

00:02:41.820  -->  00:02:43.290
take advantage of that time.

51

00:02:43.290  -->  00:02:43.970
OK.

52

00:02:44.160  -->  00:02:45.360
That's very important.

53

00:02:45.360  -->  00:02:47.100
Just focus on one thing at a time.

54

00:02:47.100  -->  00:02:52.680
Don't go and do many different things at the same time because I know that happens to me all that happened

55

00:02:52.680  -->  00:02:55.860
to me many times before and you know and you don't you don't keep.

56

00:02:55.860  -->  00:02:57.350
You don't actually learn much from it.

57

00:02:57.360  -->  00:02:59.410
So make sure you focus on one thing.

58

00:02:59.430  -->  00:03:03.840
So now I know that no one else will and I'm going to keep reminding you in the course because I know

59

00:03:03.840  -->  00:03:07.630
some of us get really tired by the time we finish when we finish the course.

60

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:10.530
Well by the time we were halfway done.

61

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:12.260
Finish what you start.

62

00:03:12.750  -->  00:03:16.920
You know even if you get all the all that you want it by the by the middle of this course and you say

63

00:03:17.100  -->  00:03:17.800
I'm done.

64

00:03:17.890  -->  00:03:22.350
I'm I just I can build an application now because that would just teach me it taught me how to do it

65

00:03:22.360  -->  00:03:22.660
.

66

00:03:22.950  -->  00:03:23.750
OK that's fine.

67

00:03:23.760  -->  00:03:25.090
Will finish the course.

68

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:25.890
You started it.

69

00:03:25.890  -->  00:03:30.900
Make sure you finish you build the habit of finishing what you start that way everything you do in life

70

00:03:30.930  -->  00:03:33.570
you can finish it and be successful at it.

71

00:03:33.660  -->  00:03:34.440
All right.

72

00:03:34.440  -->  00:03:40.800
So make sure that you remember why you hear all the time when you're tired and you frustrated and you

73

00:03:40.800  -->  00:03:43.210
can't find an issue to a problem.

74

00:03:43.230  -->  00:03:45.660
Make sure that you remember why you hear OK.

75

00:03:45.690  -->  00:03:49.200
Always write it down a piece of paper put it on the wall.

76

00:03:49.200  -->  00:03:54.060
Remember this is why I'm taking this course and I'm going to finish a successful and do everything you

77

00:03:54.060  -->  00:04:01.380
can every single day to finish a course if you have any questions I expect you to post on the discussion

78

00:04:01.380  -->  00:04:01.680
.

79

00:04:01.680  -->  00:04:08.010
I expect you go look for a solution before you do that though if you encounter a problem I don't expect

80

00:04:08.010  -->  00:04:14.970
you after one minute of debugging or after two hours or three hours to go impostor in in the in the

81

00:04:14.970  -->  00:04:15.750
class.

82

00:04:15.750  -->  00:04:18.200
I don't want you to do that I want you to try your best.

83

00:04:18.240  -->  00:04:19.300
I'm talking about.

84

00:04:19.680  -->  00:04:20.870
Even if you can't sleep.

85

00:04:20.880  -->  00:04:27.360
Try your best to fix it this way you can learn a lot more and I'm really a believer that happened to

86

00:04:27.360  -->  00:04:30.810
me and it happened to a lot of my students in other courses.

87

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:35.240
If you keep trying trying and trying to figure it out yourself you've got to.

88

00:04:35.280  -->  00:04:38.270
You're going to be more successful you going to learn a lot of new ways of doing it.

89

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:43.650
Well right now I don't want you to get stuck three weeks on on a piece of coal that is very simple that

90

00:04:43.650  -->  00:04:46.260
you can't see because you caught you've been coding too much.

91

00:04:46.290  -->  00:04:47.370
Don't get stuck for.

92

00:04:47.550  -->  00:04:54.900
You know I think a rule of thumb is at least you can get stuck on an on an issue two or three days after

93

00:04:54.900  -->  00:04:55.540
that.

94

00:04:55.680  -->  00:05:02.940
Ask for help if you are still stuck take some time and sleep and rest and and then come fresh and try

95

00:05:02.940  -->  00:05:05.760
to look out if you can figure it out after two or three days.

96

00:05:05.790  -->  00:05:11.070
They asked me and you know my information is all over the place you can google me google my name with

97

00:05:11.070  -->  00:05:16.650
the platform that you're watching right now if it's anywhere online just google my name with a class

98

00:05:16.740  -->  00:05:21.540
name or the title of the course you're going to find me all over the place you're going to find my my

99

00:05:21.550  -->  00:05:26.860
e-mail addresses my web sites everything I'm here for you I'm here to help you.

100

00:05:27.210  -->  00:05:29.150
My goal here is for you to be successful.

101

00:05:29.150  -->  00:05:35.520
That is the only way that I'm a successful instructor a successful teacher is by making you a successful

102

00:05:35.520  -->  00:05:36.200
student.

And I love what I do and I love people and you're my student and I want to thank you for being here

104

105

00:05:46.530  -->  00:05:47.150
to that.

106

00:05:47.220  -->  00:05:50.480
If he if he helps you if he doesn't help you don't worry about it.

107

00:05:50.560  -->  00:05:53.370
You can still pull your questions here in the discussions.

We'll get it done.

110

00:05:55.560  -->  00:05:55.920
All right.

111

00:05:55.920  -->  00:05:59.460
So anyway again thank you so much for watching.

112

00:05:59.460  -->  00:06:01.290
This is a blessing that you're here.

Take care.

115

00:06:03.690  -->  00:06:04.730
Bye bye.
