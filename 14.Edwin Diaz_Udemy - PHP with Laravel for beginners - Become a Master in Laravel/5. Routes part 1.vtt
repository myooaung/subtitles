1

00:00:00.680  -->  00:00:01.950
All right cool.

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:07.760
So now that we are here let's open Lavell project and let's start exploring.

3

00:00:07.860  -->  00:00:13.220
Right now it doesn't matter if you're in a windows or in a Mac computer everything should be the same

4

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:15.160
for now on a right if it's different.

5

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:18.090
I would let you know so Windows and Mac users.

6

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:18.920
Let's do it.

7

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:19.540
All right.

8

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:25.830
So let's open our BHB store and whatever idea you are using your editor if you use and sublime that's

9

00:00:25.830  -->  00:00:26.970
OK.

10

00:00:26.990  -->  00:00:35.400
Or I know that I will be using the HP story just because it just provides a very user friendly environment

11

00:00:35.400  -->  00:00:37.650
for HP and Meribel together.

12

00:00:37.650  -->  00:00:38.210
All right.

13

00:00:38.340  -->  00:00:44.730
So I'm going to open up my HD docs project so if you can click here and then just look for your project

14

00:00:44.970  -->  00:00:47.710
users.

15

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:52.390
Just type in the address where your project is or you look for it.

16

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:54.660
It would give you a big for that like this.

17

00:00:54.990  -->  00:01:02.990
And if you own a Windows machine you should be going to see zap in the docs and all that.

18

00:01:02.990  -->  00:01:03.540
Or.

19

00:01:03.810  -->  00:01:12.420
Just because I'm in a Mac computer right now I'm going to go to where that is so applications for me

20

00:01:12.420  -->  00:01:13.140
.

21

00:01:13.690  -->  00:01:15.490
And you can type it in here as well.

22

00:01:15.510  -->  00:01:16.070
Right.

23

00:01:16.280  -->  00:01:18.500
I'm just going taking the long way to do it.

24

00:01:19.020  -->  00:01:22.380
And there we go.

25

00:01:22.410  -->  00:01:23.950
All right.

26

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:29.400
I'm just going to close so this one thing that I want to do before I start guys is just change his white

27

00:01:29.400  -->  00:01:32.140
background on now used to coding in this.

28

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:38.430
I don't know about you but oh my courses I do it and I'm like background so I'm pretty sure that you're

29

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:40.120
also used to it by now.

30

00:01:40.290  -->  00:01:51.420
So let's do preferences and let's go to parents theme dark law and apply.

31

00:01:51.990  -->  00:02:03.760
Right then I'm going to go to Ed. general whoops and it's see colors and funds.

32

00:02:03.780  -->  00:02:04.830
Genera actually.

33

00:02:04.830  -->  00:02:11.880
And then here and then I look for mono or chi or not chi whatever however you pronounce it apply.

34

00:02:12.170  -->  00:02:12.880
OK.

35

00:02:13.170  -->  00:02:16.680
Just going to give is a very similar look to what we had in sublime.

36

00:02:16.680  -->  00:02:17.410
All right.

37

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:18.450
Pretty cool.

38

00:02:18.450  -->  00:02:23.790
So now the first thing that you are going to be noticing here is that knowing you every time you you

39

00:02:23.870  -->  00:02:28.590
know you learn about framework you know it can be overwhelming for us because you see a lot of files

40

00:02:28.590  -->  00:02:30.400
that you don't understand.

41

00:02:30.420  -->  00:02:31.020
All right.

42

00:02:31.170  -->  00:02:36.840
So I'm not going to explain every little detail here because there are some advanced subjects that we

43

00:02:36.840  -->  00:02:40.550
are not going to go through but I'm going to give you the fundamentals of it.

44

00:02:40.680  -->  00:02:45.690
I on this chapter we are going to be learning about so I'm going to go right to that.

45

00:02:45.840  -->  00:02:49.790
But you can see here everything is going to be included most.

46

00:02:49.830  -->  00:02:54.930
Most of everything that we are going to be doing is going to be inside this app folder.

47

00:02:55.470  -->  00:02:56.160
Right.

48

00:02:56.550  -->  00:03:03.180
We're going to have controllers who are going to have models views et cetera are actually views are

49

00:03:03.180  -->  00:03:05.480
here resources.

50

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:06.180
All right.

51

00:03:06.420  -->  00:03:09.070
But anyway so route's Where are routes.

52

00:03:09.090  -->  00:03:12.630
Well route's is inside this HTP folder.

53

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:13.330
All right.

54

00:03:13.500  -->  00:03:16.260
And then you can see the routes file right here.

55

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:17.510
Just double click it.

56

00:03:17.790  -->  00:03:19.980
And now here it is.

57

00:03:20.040  -->  00:03:21.050
All right.

58

00:03:21.390  -->  00:03:26.460
So very simple.

59

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:32.850
This is called a group aroud group array and basically groups.

60

00:03:33.060  -->  00:03:35.160
Everything is secure.

61

00:03:35.160  -->  00:03:37.530
Everything in a kind of a container.

62

00:03:37.530  -->  00:03:38.630
All right.

63

00:03:39.330  -->  00:03:46.230
So this is a call they made aware and this is a security feature for Claribel.

64

00:03:46.230  -->  00:03:50.980
Every time you see middleware is because you are securing something there.

65

00:03:51.000  -->  00:03:58.620
So we're saying now that everything in this web in this rogue group is going to be available for the

66

00:03:58.620  -->  00:03:59.560
web.

67

00:04:00.120  -->  00:04:00.870
All right.

68

00:04:01.020  -->  00:04:06.630
That's what we are saying here now don't worry about too much of this we're going to cover this later

69

00:04:06.630  -->  00:04:07.630
on.

70

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:09.650
I just want you to know how this works.

71

00:04:09.660  -->  00:04:18.200
So routes the first thing that you are going to be noticing here is that we have this class here called

72

00:04:18.210  -->  00:04:19.310
route.

73

00:04:19.740  -->  00:04:27.510
As you can see is a static method that we have after that which is get see that.

74

00:04:27.570  -->  00:04:36.150
So we are using the route the class name plus it to call and see which means it's a static method and

75

00:04:36.150  -->  00:04:43.250
then we have a couple of parameters we first have a parameter here to actually let us know where.

76

00:04:43.290  -->  00:04:43.860
All right.

77

00:04:43.890  -->  00:04:46.920
Well we have to tap in that you are able to get somewhere.

78

00:04:47.160  -->  00:04:51.930
So right now we type when we go to the root directory of this application this is going to give us a

79

00:04:51.930  -->  00:04:58.590
view where I remember what I tell you about views views is the representation they H.T. a mail over

80

00:04:58.590  -->  00:05:04.020
application that's where our contact pages will be or in the case of BHP whatever.

81

00:05:04.020  -->  00:05:06.750
Everything that you see on the browser would be of view.

82

00:05:06.840  -->  00:05:14.700
So if I go to let's go to the beginning of this application to the publication that we created which

83

00:05:14.700  -->  00:05:18.120
is a CMS that dev.

84

00:05:18.150  -->  00:05:19.230
Right.

85

00:05:19.290  -->  00:05:25.210
So I hope you see this is a view right here this is a welcome view.

86

00:05:25.290  -->  00:05:30.510
So let's go back as you can see here says you know if you if you go to the root directory you're going

87

00:05:30.510  -->  00:05:32.420
to get a welcome view.

88

00:05:32.460  -->  00:05:39.650
Now let me show you something if I type in let's say example here.

89

00:05:39.700  -->  00:05:40.690
All right.

90

00:05:41.250  -->  00:05:48.960
Now if I go to the browser and do this for example I'm going to get a sense thing again too because

91

00:05:48.960  -->  00:05:56.310
I just told Gravelle that when the user types in that sample I want you to take him to the view welcome

92

00:05:56.310  -->  00:05:57.050
.

93

00:05:57.060  -->  00:05:58.310
All right.

94

00:05:58.980  -->  00:06:05.400
So let's try this again now if you notice I'm not saving anything in my editor in BHB so you don't have

95

00:06:05.400  -->  00:06:07.620
to say they will save it automatically for you.

96

00:06:07.620  -->  00:06:13.140
Now if I go and try this again after I take it off you're going to see that I get nofollow an exception

97

00:06:13.140  -->  00:06:13.990
.

98

00:06:13.990  -->  00:06:19.650
All right so first parameter is where you want to go.

99

00:06:19.650  -->  00:06:25.090
Second parameter could be many different things and even even even Hastur parameters.

100

00:06:25.230  -->  00:06:27.720
But we're going to look at that later.

101

00:06:27.750  -->  00:06:29.700
Right now he has a closure function.

102

00:06:29.700  -->  00:06:37.110
This is as a second parameter and this closure function right responsible to do other things in this

103

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:45.660
case is returning a view a welcome view but if we wanted to you can select that impressed good control

104

00:06:45.660  -->  00:06:50.830
forward slash and you were calm in that how you can return.

105

00:06:51.790  -->  00:06:53.190
You.

106

00:06:54.380  -->  00:06:54.960
OK.

107

00:06:54.960  -->  00:06:57.050
I didn't save anything just does it automatically.

108

00:06:57.040  -->  00:06:59.920
Amy Fyke go to the root directory Now.

109

00:07:00.750  -->  00:07:04.370
You can see this is how you this is super cool right.

110

00:07:04.560  -->  00:07:09.990
Remember that before for us to do something like that I have to create a folder called indexed up BHB

111

00:07:10.710  -->  00:07:16.360
and Puzo ph being there and Yankel high you for for us to do that.

112

00:07:16.770  -->  00:07:22.290
We don't have to create any Fouchier for us to do whatever we want in there.

113

00:07:22.320  -->  00:07:23.260
You are out.

114

00:07:23.530  -->  00:07:27.860
We can't even pass IDs and parameters see it through.

115

00:07:27.890  -->  00:07:33.990
Through this here and take it you know take it in here return it and if we want to and we're going to

116

00:07:33.990  -->  00:07:34.920
do that later.

117

00:07:35.100  -->  00:07:38.190
But as you can see we can write whatever we want and then we can do this too.

118

00:07:38.210  -->  00:07:39.050
Watch this.

119

00:07:39.090  -->  00:07:42.780
We can say admin polls.

120

00:07:43.260  -->  00:07:44.540
All right.

121

00:07:44.540  -->  00:07:47.070
When once we type this we are able to do this.

122

00:07:47.070  -->  00:07:50.220
Watch this admin is here.

123

00:07:50.220  -->  00:07:50.970
Or something like that.

124

00:07:50.970  -->  00:08:02.220
So if we go back and we do that and we say admin posts and other things here you see that and we can

125

00:08:02.220  -->  00:08:04.420
make this as long as we want to.

126

00:08:04.710  -->  00:08:07.740
All right so that's the first thing that you should know about routes.

127

00:08:07.740  -->  00:08:12.860
Now if I go back to the room there is nothing there.

128

00:08:12.870  -->  00:08:20.380
All right let's go and fix this again real quick and take that off.

129

00:08:20.460  -->  00:08:21.620
Take these off.

130

00:08:21.810  -->  00:08:25.800
Now we see that we are returning this view here.

131

00:08:25.800  -->  00:08:27.340
Right.

132

00:08:27.420  -->  00:08:32.420
We're going to explore this a little bit later where they are how we access them how we edit them but

133

00:08:32.430  -->  00:08:37.110
right now just focus on routes around the next election we're going to continue with routes because

134

00:08:37.110  -->  00:08:43.540
it's super exciting and super easy to do once you know how to do it right.

135

00:08:43.560  -->  00:08:46.050
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
