00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:06.810
All right welcome back my students so I hope you guys having a lot of fun seeing me and see my box and

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:07.990
seeing me fitting in.

3

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:10.010
Which is a great moment right.

4

00:00:10.110  -->  00:00:12.670
Well those of you that like it.

5

00:00:12.690  -->  00:00:13.470
Good job.

6

00:00:13.470  -->  00:00:14.520
I like it too.

7

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:15.340
All right.

8

00:00:15.450  -->  00:00:16.190
Let's get to it.

9

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:16.760
All right.

10

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:19.760
So now we are able to create replies right.

11

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:22.320
That's really cool for each call right.

12

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:28.410
We need to actually have some type of more information about this user right here right which is probably

13

00:00:28.410  -->  00:00:31.400
going to be the same guy as the one that made the comment.

14

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:37.950
So you know in the future you might want to prevent the guy that makes a comment to also reply to himself

15

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:39.010
.

16

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:39.550
All right.

17

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:42.690
So let's go real quick and

18

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:47.240
let's work on that.

19

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:49.720
Let's go to this.

20

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:55.110
We are in the polls and we just need to edit that image.

21

00:00:55.110  -->  00:00:56.600
All right.

22

00:00:57.510  -->  00:01:10.440
But we need to bring the whole reply down so let's grab a For Each loop here in the nested comment and

23

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:13.560
wrap it around.

24

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:23.750
This wrap around the I'm sure we wrap it around like and take the whole reply buntu.

25

00:01:24.240  -->  00:01:28.730
Or should we just wrap it around the.

26

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:33.190
Let's just look at it again shall we.

27

00:01:33.190  -->  00:01:34.740
Wrap it around here.

28

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:36.250
Or should we wrap the whole thing.

29

00:01:36.510  -->  00:01:37.820
Well we don't even want to see this fall.

30

00:01:37.830  -->  00:01:45.690
We don't have a reply right so let's wrap it around that.

31

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:49.090
So if we can paste

32

00:01:53.280  -->  00:02:00.000
replies a bigger than that we want to see them.

33

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:07.320
And if oops let's check it to see if it works.

34

00:02:07.320  -->  00:02:10.000
If we don't get any errors and yes we do.

35

00:02:11.070  -->  00:02:15.460
That's because we did not really this blame reply.

36

00:02:16.020  -->  00:02:17.410
Getting this variable here.

37

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:28.290
So let's go to our comments reply actually does seem polls that we have to go to are polls

38

00:02:33.140  -->  00:02:42.240
up to go to polls controller real quick and there's a function that is explain the polls somewhere right

39

00:02:42.240  -->  00:02:42.740
here.

40

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:44.330
This is the guy.

41

00:02:44.330  -->  00:02:44.580
All right.

42

00:02:44.580  -->  00:02:52.740
And we also have to bring down the replies.

43

00:02:53.220  -->  00:03:00.340
So this is a little different though because we need to bring the comments replies.

44

00:03:00.360  -->  00:03:01.420
All right.

45

00:03:01.830  -->  00:03:02.460
So

46

00:03:07.980  -->  00:03:14.030
once we find this comment we got to think about this a little bit.

47

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:14.630
All right.

48

00:03:14.880  -->  00:03:19.890
So once we find that comment how do we bring the reply.

49

00:03:19.890  -->  00:03:22.420
Well why don't we do this.

50

00:03:22.560  -->  00:03:29.040
Why don't we actually go to the page and from there we pull it out instead of pulling out from pulling

51

00:03:29.130  -->  00:03:30.830
their replies from here.

52

00:03:31.050  -->  00:03:32.490
Let's just do that.

53

00:03:33.150  -->  00:03:37.240
Let's go to post.

54

00:03:37.240  -->  00:03:45.630
All right and let's do it right here because we already have the object right here and it's inside a

55

00:03:45.630  -->  00:03:49.090
big we are still inside that loop see that.

56

00:03:49.800  -->  00:03:56.810
So all we have to do is loop through that collection of replies.

57

00:03:57.060  -->  00:04:06.660
So for each comment replies yes reply.

58

00:04:08.100  -->  00:04:11.820
All right.

59

00:04:15.170  -->  00:04:16.800
And for each right there

60

00:04:22.530  -->  00:04:27.690
let's see if we get any arrows here on the fine replies.

61

00:04:27.720  -->  00:04:33.850
That's because we need this guy here in front of it.

62

00:04:34.630  -->  00:04:40.640
Comment we go.

63

00:04:41.040  -->  00:04:44.520
All right.

64

00:04:47.370  -->  00:04:48.390
All right.

65

00:04:48.720  -->  00:04:49.620
And it's looking good.

66

00:04:49.620  -->  00:04:58.880
That means it works because if we for some reason change this like this should get nothing there.

67

00:04:58.890  -->  00:05:01.130
See that beautiful.

68

00:05:01.310  -->  00:05:03.440
That's just beautiful I love it.

69

00:05:04.080  -->  00:05:05.850
I love it.

70

00:05:05.850  -->  00:05:07.070
All right.

71

00:05:07.590  -->  00:05:11.770
Let's get the reply alter out.

72

00:05:12.190  -->  00:05:14.340
Let's see what he's saying.

73

00:05:14.340  -->  00:05:17.460
And let's also get these image if he if he has any

74

00:05:22.690  -->  00:05:25.230
reply photo

75

00:05:29.970  -->  00:05:37.580
see something here real quick that's kind of big man really big.

76

00:05:37.610  -->  00:05:42.400
What's going on with you.

77

00:05:43.440  -->  00:05:47.640
Let's go and make this 64 I believe that's the right size.

78

00:05:48.090  -->  00:05:53.440
And what else.

79

00:05:53.970  -->  00:05:56.350
Whoops.

80

00:05:56.380  -->  00:06:01.300
Make sure you don't make mistakes here.

81

00:06:04.280  -->  00:06:06.780
I keep creating the wrong

82

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:16.190
looks like a house and error there.

83

00:06:16.620  -->  00:06:22.590
No I don't dream about Edwin don't dream about it.

84

00:06:22.590  -->  00:06:25.490
All right create it.

85

00:06:26.820  -->  00:06:30.590
Let's use our diff for humans.

86

00:06:30.750  -->  00:06:35.700
It's a really cool name right.

87

00:06:38.040  -->  00:06:47.320
Let's take this off and put the body here put the body here.

88

00:06:47.960  -->  00:06:49.450
Reply.

89

00:06:49.930  -->  00:06:50.320
Body

90

00:06:55.570  -->  00:06:58.160
Moves.

91

00:06:58.260  -->  00:07:04.200
We don't have a Create day for this gentleman 380 at

92

00:07:07.410  -->  00:07:09.700
because we forgot to reply.

93

00:07:09.750  -->  00:07:16.500
I already forget I forgot the reply before.

94

00:07:17.070  -->  00:07:18.410
I think I did.

95

00:07:18.590  -->  00:07:21.020
All right so it's looking pretty good guys.

96

00:07:21.060  -->  00:07:22.420
Really good.

97

00:07:22.990  -->  00:07:26.530
All right better than this.

98

00:07:26.790  -->  00:07:31.500
And we're going to have to actually space is our little bed.

99

00:07:31.500  -->  00:07:33.410
And as a matter of fact we can do it right now.

100

00:07:33.690  -->  00:07:36.870
Let's just do it real quick so that we look good.

101

00:07:36.940  -->  00:07:40.780
We put some CSSA into it.

102

00:07:40.920  -->  00:07:47.000
I think this media guy right here and nested should be having some.

103

00:07:48.000  -->  00:07:49.040
Let's see.

104

00:07:49.270  -->  00:07:55.570
You know what margining I think it would do a good margin maybe 20 pixels

105

00:07:59.470  -->  00:08:02.000
60 pixels margin top.

106

00:08:02.040  -->  00:08:06.070
All right that media guy right there nested.

107

00:08:06.120  -->  00:08:08.580
So is this guy right here.

108

00:08:08.810  -->  00:08:11.020
What are we going to do is we're going to say nest that

109

00:08:13.650  -->  00:08:15.760
comment.

110

00:08:15.880  -->  00:08:18.370
There we go.

111

00:08:20.820  -->  00:08:26.300
And let's take this to assets size.

112

00:08:26.790  -->  00:08:28.420
How we doin any styling yet.

113

00:08:28.690  -->  00:08:30.120
I think we have right.

114

00:08:30.490  -->  00:08:32.960
Because we did this guy right here.

115

00:08:33.630  -->  00:08:43.260
So if we do morning top 60 pixels and we do golpe

116

00:08:51.070  -->  00:08:53.540
doo doo doo doo doo.

117

00:08:55.120  -->  00:08:55.970
All right.

118

00:08:56.220  -->  00:09:00.060
Well he's not applying it for some reason.

119

00:09:00.970  -->  00:09:03.570
I see.

120

00:09:03.630  -->  00:09:03.860
All right.

121

00:09:03.850  -->  00:09:11.830
When it doesn't do it you just check your stylus and see if you have you have that.

122

00:09:11.930  -->  00:09:14.150
It looks like it is applying it there.

123

00:09:14.750  -->  00:09:19.880
But Basrah classes over writing it I got a feeling that's what it is.

124

00:09:19.890  -->  00:09:30.390
So go back to it and instead of doing a class just create an idea for it which is stronger takes over

125

00:09:30.390  -->  00:09:33.010
the class.

126

00:09:33.100  -->  00:09:33.880
All right.

127

00:09:34.020  -->  00:09:38.280
And now if you go back to a let's go back to this one.

128

00:09:38.280  -->  00:09:43.900
Change this for an ID and to go up again actually

129

00:09:47.700  -->  00:09:51.830
let's check in now.

130

00:09:52.850  -->  00:09:55.370
That's making me look really bad guys.

131

00:09:55.750  -->  00:09:56.410
This thing here

132

00:10:00.470  -->  00:10:07.340
the idea there and it's getting overwritten right here you see that Maryan top

133

00:10:08.840  -->  00:10:11.500
.

134

00:10:12.780  -->  00:10:13.580
All right.

135

00:10:13.990  -->  00:10:20.720
You are playing with me that's not getting overbidding it's misspelled.

136

00:10:21.780  -->  00:10:30.680
You know me trying to do it fast and I end up with misspelled as grammar stuff.

137

00:10:30.680  -->  00:10:32.070
All right cool.

138

00:10:32.880  -->  00:10:33.900
I think we're good here.

139

00:10:33.900  -->  00:10:40.170
I think on the next lecture what I want to do actually as a matter of fact we're going to do that in

140

00:10:40.170  -->  00:10:44.030
a more of a cosmetic lectures.

141

00:10:44.050  -->  00:10:51.570
We want to add a link here when we click it goes down and it creates some type of slide down effect

142

00:10:51.580  -->  00:10:51.890
.

143

00:10:52.020  -->  00:10:54.540
We might do it in next lecture if he doesn't take too long.

144

00:10:54.550  -->  00:10:55.360
I've got to check.

145

00:10:55.570  -->  00:10:58.630
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
