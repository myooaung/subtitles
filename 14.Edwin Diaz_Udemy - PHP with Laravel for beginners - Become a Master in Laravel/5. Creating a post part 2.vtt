00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:02.080
All right welcome back my sister.

2

00:00:02.080  -->  00:00:08.430
And so if you test this out in the last lecture you know he works right so we can we can see right here

3

00:00:08.430  -->  00:00:09.750
that it does work.

4

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:10.230
All right

5

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:15.150
but we don't have a post do we.

6

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:22.160
So let's go in and create a pause for a quick impose.

7

00:00:23.020  -->  00:00:24.720
Let's create one.

8

00:00:25.350  -->  00:00:31.430
And my first post is a good name for it.

9

00:00:31.670  -->  00:00:33.220
You don't have a category for it.

10

00:00:33.240  -->  00:00:34.050
And

11

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:44.580
this created an image here and I love this post

12

00:00:44.580  -->  00:00:51.570
.

13

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:52.180
All right.

14

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:54.930
So there should be Post Number one right.

15

00:00:55.710  -->  00:00:59.100
Let's see if we can return some data from it.

16

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:10.450
Let's find the post post fine or fail read id number one.

17

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:14.740
And let's just return the polls and see where we

18

00:01:20.000  -->  00:01:22.760
post.

19

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:26.500
There we go see the post.

20

00:01:26.610  -->  00:01:27.240
Cool.

21

00:01:27.660  -->  00:01:33.350
So now all we gotta do is go on The View and start modifying it.

22

00:01:34.140  -->  00:01:36.170
So you're going to say

23

00:01:40.920  -->  00:01:44.740
let's go back here to the routes real quick.

24

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:53.460
Let's actually wrap this up and create a

25

00:01:57.360  -->  00:01:59.770
a nice neat named route.

26

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:03.360
Let's create a route actually for a name route.

27

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:12.930
So we're going to call this whole post and we're going to say uses this controller.

28

00:02:13.460  -->  00:02:14.080
OK.

29

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:27.000
So if we go to the HP is and route list we can see that our home pulse is right there is a good recourse

30

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:28.090
.

31

00:02:28.170  -->  00:02:29.710
All right and this is the you or I.

32

00:02:29.900  -->  00:02:31.400
Cool.

33

00:02:31.410  -->  00:02:31.840
All right.

34

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:38.570
So let's go back.

35

00:02:38.760  -->  00:02:39.350
That's not it.

36

00:02:39.360  -->  00:02:43.420
Sorry it was a controller.

37

00:02:44.610  -->  00:02:52.950
So we're going to return the view where there is a pause right here and then we're going to pass and

38

00:02:57.420  -->  00:02:58.670
post.

39

00:02:59.490  -->  00:03:00.240
OK.

40

00:03:01.020  -->  00:03:03.700
Let's go to that you real quick.

41

00:03:04.730  -->  00:03:07.550
That's not the view that's the.

42

00:03:07.910  -->  00:03:12.400
And we go.

43

00:03:12.660  -->  00:03:20.640
All right so now what we've got to do is go back to lay out and lay outs here and copy everything from

44

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:22.140
this column right here.

45

00:03:22.440  -->  00:03:23.540
This is the content.

46

00:03:23.540  -->  00:03:28.330
So let's find out where it ends.

47

00:03:28.910  -->  00:03:30.890
I think it's right here.

48

00:03:31.170  -->  00:03:35.530
And let's just get everything everything.

49

00:03:35.730  -->  00:03:38.320
I think I just sound like that's funny.

50

00:03:38.330  -->  00:03:39.320
All right.

51

00:03:39.390  -->  00:03:40.570
Right here.

52

00:03:41.060  -->  00:03:45.350
And I might just do that.

53

00:03:45.520  -->  00:03:47.330
Analysts feel that.

54

00:03:47.340  -->  00:03:50.820
Here we go.

55

00:03:50.820  -->  00:03:54.540
This will be the content.

56

00:03:54.540  -->  00:04:00.100
Let's go back to polls and less They saw that in there.

57

00:04:00.150  -->  00:04:02.270
All right let's go back here real quick.

58

00:04:02.380  -->  00:04:06.320
And I think so.

59

00:04:06.810  -->  00:04:12.620
Oh and fix this here make sure that you don't have that mistake there that could cause an issue.

60

00:04:12.630  -->  00:04:13.290
All right.

61

00:04:13.290  -->  00:04:15.410
So let's go back in here.

62

00:04:15.410  -->  00:04:19.640
As you can see this is what we got.

63

00:04:19.760  -->  00:04:20.070
All right.

64

00:04:20.070  -->  00:04:21.420
That's because we have no style.

65

00:04:21.430  -->  00:04:22.320
Sir I.

66

00:04:22.460  -->  00:04:29.950
So go back to admen Bley and copy this little guys right here.

67

00:04:30.240  -->  00:04:37.040
Go back to blog post and we're going to post them paste them right there.

68

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:41.390
Go back to me again real quick.

69

00:04:41.850  -->  00:04:44.430
Make sure you have your say.

70

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:47.340
Yes.

71

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:49.770
And back here

72

00:04:55.070  -->  00:04:58.100
we go.

73

00:04:58.110  -->  00:05:01.010
All right cool.

74

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:07.260
So now if you go back everything should start taking place.

75

00:05:07.420  -->  00:05:09.310
Everything is good.

76

00:05:09.840  -->  00:05:10.950
All right.

77

00:05:10.950  -->  00:05:13.360
So we have a post-Idol.

78

00:05:13.360  -->  00:05:15.090
They would be nice if we can

79

00:05:17.670  -->  00:05:18.360
retrieve it.

80

00:05:18.480  -->  00:05:26.670
So let's go back to and check it out real quick let's just go to impose controller and we're passing

81

00:05:26.670  -->  00:05:30.780
the object already so all we have to do here is

82

00:05:33.580  -->  00:05:40.570
use Bley equals title answer.

83

00:05:40.620  -->  00:05:42.650
And as you can see change.

84

00:05:42.810  -->  00:05:43.340
All right.

85

00:05:43.500  -->  00:05:49.130
So the next election want to continue with this when I keep actually making this more dynamic.

86

00:05:49.170  -->  00:05:55.580
We've got to take a lot of them out of here and replace them with BHB data from the database.

87

00:05:55.590  -->  00:05:59.050
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
