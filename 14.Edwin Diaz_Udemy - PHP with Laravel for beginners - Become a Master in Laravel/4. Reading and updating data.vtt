00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.000
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:04.850
It's time for us to start reading information from the database.

3

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:09.900
I'm going to try to see if I can do the update lecture on this lecture here so that we can kill two

4

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:11.430
birds with one shot.

5

00:00:11.430  -->  00:00:13.950
I'm not saying we're going to kill two birds guys.

6

00:00:13.950  -->  00:00:14.470
All right.

7

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:15.970
But you know what I'm saying.

8

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:18.210
We do two things in one shot.

9

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:20.920
All right so let's do the read We've done this before.

10

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:25.700
So that's why I want to do this here.

11

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:26.140
All right.

12

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:28.320
So what are we going to do.

13

00:00:28.320  -->  00:00:35.570
Well we if we want to pulao the relationships we have to get the parent right.

14

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:48.120
So we get the parent the scale and B portion number one or fail they we go and let's pull out its relationship

15

00:00:48.120  -->  00:00:53.250
but we do this enough for each and we done this many times.

16

00:00:53.260  -->  00:00:54.040
Right.

17

00:00:54.060  -->  00:00:58.890
Rose What is the relationship for the most tax.

18

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:07.170
Of course we do this as tag as we go and we can go there out.

19

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:09.150
Let's check it out real quick

20

00:01:11.450  -->  00:01:12.780
.

21

00:01:13.510  -->  00:01:14.500
All right.

22

00:01:14.610  -->  00:01:17.710
Read Hala.

23

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:19.230
All right.

24

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:20.910
Beautiful.

25

00:01:20.910  -->  00:01:21.260
All right.

26

00:01:21.280  -->  00:01:32.790
Let's do the update method real quick and just get a copy of this an update.

27

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:39.210
So how do we update this data here here now I'm going to do the update and this is going to be a little

28

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:39.930
different guys.

29

00:01:39.930  -->  00:01:40.690
OK.

30

00:01:40.770  -->  00:01:41.220
So

31

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:46.650
she gets here left written the same there.

32

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:50.670
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the tag and then I do this.

33

00:01:50.670  -->  00:01:53.380
Where.

34

00:01:53.630  -->  00:01:57.260
And let's see what we got as tags.

35

00:01:57.690  -->  00:02:00.810
Ray BHP feel cap at all right.

36

00:02:00.810  -->  00:02:06.350
So where and name equals ph.

37

00:02:06.350  -->  00:02:07.460
B.

38

00:02:07.820  -->  00:02:13.450
I want to update that tag.

39

00:02:14.340  -->  00:02:15.520
OK.

40

00:02:16.320  -->  00:02:20.420
And now one of the tag to something else.

41

00:02:21.810  -->  00:02:27.110
I don't know that it should be something like that.

42

00:02:27.240  -->  00:02:29.850
Ok cool let's try it

43

00:02:31.780  -->  00:02:33.840
.

44

00:02:33.960  -->  00:02:39.390
Oh and by the way you could do this and watch this return

45

00:02:45.330  -->  00:02:50.680
Antar and you can see that one there you always get that one in return meaning that one was updated

46

00:02:50.760  -->  00:02:51.660
meaning true.

47

00:02:51.810  -->  00:02:52.240
OK.

48

00:02:52.260  -->  00:02:58.170
So you were able to update it refreshing you can see that as has been of the day and we've got the updated

49

00:02:59.070  -->  00:03:00.020
column right here.

50

00:03:00.210  -->  00:03:02.530
Ok cool.

51

00:03:02.840  -->  00:03:08.590
Of course you can pull this out an updated one by one and then do the tax safe.

52

00:03:08.700  -->  00:03:15.220
You can do it that way and I'm going to come in this hour real quick and when I'm going to do this I'm

53

00:03:15.220  -->  00:03:18.240
going to show you another way of doing this.

54

00:03:18.270  -->  00:03:31.650
Let's use our copy this right here and I'm going to copy this on to put it right here and I'll make

55

00:03:31.650  -->  00:03:32.770
it tag.

56

00:03:33.030  -->  00:03:39.250
And now on to show you that we could do a couple of things with this.

57

00:03:39.270  -->  00:03:40.300
All right.

58

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:44.360
Let me use organize a little bit.

59

00:03:44.370  -->  00:03:46.050
All right so once we find it.

60

00:03:46.110  -->  00:03:46.810
All right.

61

00:03:47.130  -->  00:04:00.070
We find this tag we could do this for us tag tags right safe and then we just pass in the tag to Paul's

62

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:01.360
number one.

63

00:04:01.740  -->  00:04:04.440
But let's go to Tiger Woods real quick.

64

00:04:04.470  -->  00:04:07.370
He's a Tiger Woods right here.

65

00:04:07.560  -->  00:04:10.010
He pulls number one and number one.

66

00:04:10.020  -->  00:04:15.480
So let's give it tag number two.

67

00:04:15.540  -->  00:04:16.830
All right.

68

00:04:17.300  -->  00:04:23.150
They refresh and you can see we've created another one.

69

00:04:23.610  -->  00:04:24.200
All right.

70

00:04:24.210  -->  00:04:25.630
We get now we didn't give it.

71

00:04:25.700  -->  00:04:33.210
No not just one but we gave the other tag to this day to this post topos number one you see that tag

72

00:04:33.210  -->  00:04:34.250
number two.

73

00:04:34.790  -->  00:04:35.870
OK.

74

00:04:35.880  -->  00:04:38.400
So that's one way of doing that.

75

00:04:38.460  -->  00:04:43.320
Now we can also do attach here.

76

00:04:43.440  -->  00:04:46.570
So if you remember you could do this.

77

00:04:46.620  -->  00:04:54.930
Those tags attach and you attach the instance there.

78

00:04:55.580  -->  00:04:57.290
OK.

79

00:04:58.320  -->  00:04:59.020
Let's do it.

80

00:04:59.100  -->  00:05:06.260
That's Thach tag number three to polls number one.

81

00:05:07.050  -->  00:05:09.370
So that way we can see the difference is the number three.

82

00:05:10.160  -->  00:05:10.400
Here

83

00:05:14.250  -->  00:05:16.260
we go you see Number three now.

84

00:05:16.680  -->  00:05:17.860
OK.

85

00:05:18.430  -->  00:05:30.530
So let's comment that out and let's do one more and you can also do this on your tax.

86

00:05:30.570  -->  00:05:32.120
You can sync.

87

00:05:32.360  -->  00:05:34.960
I remember housing works.

88

00:05:35.610  -->  00:05:38.760
And just to give you a little idea.

89

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:41.480
All right I want you to pay very close attention to everything here.

90

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:42.290
OK.

91

00:05:42.420  -->  00:05:44.450
If you want you can take a screenshot.

92

00:05:44.820  -->  00:05:48.280
Let's do a refresh and look at this.

93

00:05:48.450  -->  00:05:49.530
You see that.

94

00:05:50.290  -->  00:05:55.630
And let me remind you you will only assign ID number one.

95

00:05:55.650  -->  00:05:57.610
All right.

96

00:05:57.600  -->  00:06:02.230
Because And they will remove everything else from DA from this post.

97

00:06:02.520  -->  00:06:03.800
All right.

98

00:06:04.410  -->  00:06:14.910
So it's assigning ID number one let's assign the number to two in the majors to refresh and you can

99

00:06:14.910  -->  00:06:18.180
see now that he has at the number two.

100

00:06:18.960  -->  00:06:20.810
All right.

101

00:06:22.560  -->  00:06:25.410
Let's just do one and two

102

00:06:31.560  -->  00:06:32.610
for us.

103

00:06:33.390  -->  00:06:37.430
As you can see because he couldn't find it he added the one.

104

00:06:37.920  -->  00:06:38.470
All right.

105

00:06:38.820  -->  00:06:40.110
So that's what he does.

106

00:06:40.200  -->  00:06:43.830
Sync is pretty cool is useful and in some cases right.

107

00:06:43.980  -->  00:06:47.190
So I'm going to comment on that.

108

00:06:47.550  -->  00:06:56.640
And the last one that I'm going to do here and just because you know one of the last two for the last

109

00:06:56.640  -->  00:06:58.590
lecture of this section here.

110

00:06:58.770  -->  00:07:01.220
OK I think he has enough time for us.

111

00:07:01.260  -->  00:07:02.480
All right.

112

00:07:03.060  -->  00:07:11.990
Let's use comment or this owl or maybe comment that it in so that way you guys have all this information

113

00:07:12.770  -->  00:07:15.360
as a matter of fact let's just leave it like that.

114

00:07:15.390  -->  00:07:18.210
Different paths different game requests anyways.

115

00:07:18.450  -->  00:07:21.400
Thank you so much for watching guys is being a pleasure.

116

00:07:21.390  -->  00:07:25.370
I'm going to take a rest and a comeback teacher the next lectures.

117

00:07:25.440  -->  00:07:26.050
Thank you.

118

00:07:26.070  -->  00:07:27.230
Bye bye.
