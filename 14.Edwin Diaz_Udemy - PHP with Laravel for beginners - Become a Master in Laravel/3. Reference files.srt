1

00:00:00,200  -->  00:00:00,650
All right.

2

00:00:00,650  -->  00:00:06,270
Welcome back my dear student in this lecture here I'm going to explain to you a couple of things about

3

00:00:06,270  -->  00:00:07,640
the course before we go one.

4

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:08,400
All right.

5

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:16,740
So at the end though every section of the course the last lecture where we'll have a resource is a link

6

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:22,520
to our page in Larabee that come where you can reference what you just learned.

7

00:00:22,880  -->  00:00:23,380
All right.

8

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:27,230
Again at the end of every section the last lecture.

9

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:33,750
All right at the end of every section we're have a link that is going to take you to that documentation

10

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:41,120
page on Largo dot com where you are going to find out about that specific section.

11

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:46,680
Whatever you learn if you learn about routes you're going to have a link to routing the documentation

12

00:00:46,690  -->  00:00:48,690
on the end of every section.

13

00:00:48,690  -->  00:00:53,600
So make sure that you look for those links if you want more information after we after you learn everything

14

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:54,360
on that section.

15

00:00:54,360  -->  00:00:54,980
OK.

16

00:00:54,990  -->  00:01:00,990
Another thing that I wanted to tell you is that on this course we're not going to have many exercise

17

00:01:00,990  -->  00:01:04,930
files or we're not going to have many reference files.

18

00:01:04,950  -->  00:01:05,820
Right.

19

00:01:06,570  -->  00:01:11,460
And if we have any for this course they will be right here in the lecture that you are watching right

20

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:12,050
now.

21

00:01:12,210  -->  00:01:14,540
Just look for the link right here in this lecture.

22

00:01:14,580  -->  00:01:17,800
Download it and then that would be your reference for.

23

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:23,160
But I want you to write the code with me all the way and don't move from that lectern to you have it

24

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:26,460
in your brain trying to learn a really good.

25

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:32,100
I'm always going to keep you know giving you guys references to everything I do everything that we do

26

00:01:32,100  -->  00:01:32,780
in the course.

27

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:37,900
So I well you can go back to the recommendation and find out about that specific subject.

28

00:01:37,900  -->  00:01:38,350
All right.

29

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:40,990
If you have any questions I'm here for you.

30

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:46,930
You know we have a lot of people that are willing to help out in the in the in the discussion.

31

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:51,900
We're always going to have Facebook groups for you for the courses so if you have any questions and

32

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:55,470
you have a form and you're on Facebook you can join the group.

33

00:01:55,470  -->  00:01:55,920
All right.

34

00:01:55,920  -->  00:01:58,480
And that information will be in the announcement tab.

35

00:01:58,500  -->  00:02:02,910
In the meantime you can find the link for Facebook groups or anything like that where you can ask me

36

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:04,920

37

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:07,200
