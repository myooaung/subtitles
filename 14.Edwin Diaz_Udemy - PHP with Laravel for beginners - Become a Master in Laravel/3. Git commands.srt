1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,320
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,320  -->  00:00:04,380
My students always start for us to start using get.

3

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:09,810
Now now that we have installed it we can use get it anywhere in your computer.

4

00:00:09,810  -->  00:00:10,270
All right.

5

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:12,110
So let's just create a for them here.

6

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:17,380
Just for demonstration purposes I'm going to name this and I want you to do the same thing also.

7

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:18,780
All right.

8

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:20,160
Name it.

9

00:00:20,160  -->  00:00:20,590
Learning.

10

00:00:20,600  -->  00:00:22,660
Good.

11

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:23,320
All right cool.

12

00:00:23,320  -->  00:00:26,490
And once you get to your terminal open it up.

13

00:00:26,720  -->  00:00:29,150
Go to your desktop and go to that fire.

14

00:00:29,470  -->  00:00:35,420
So all travel to the file and staying inside for folder.

15

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:36,440
All right.

16

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:43,980
Now in order for us to initialize good for good to work you have to initialize it you have to say get

17

00:00:44,310  -->  00:00:46,170
in it.

18

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:47,580
Enter now you can use get.

19

00:00:47,580  -->  00:00:49,770
Now if you do there's good.

20

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:56,340
You can see that it's going to give you some suggested commands commonly use commands that you can use

21

00:00:56,340  -->  00:00:56,960
right away.

22

00:00:56,990  -->  00:01:03,870
And remember that you first have to use the word good and then whatever command after you read you can

23

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:09,340
see that we can add stuff we can do branches check our clone difference.

24

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:14,680
And it tells you the description of each file each command which is really cool right.

25

00:01:15,270  -->  00:01:15,800
All right.

26

00:01:15,860  -->  00:01:23,250
Your Don't go crazy thinking don't you know don't worry too much thinking that you have to learn all

27

00:01:23,370  -->  00:01:24,240
this commands.

28

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:25,600
You don't have to.

29

00:01:25,910  -->  00:01:26,380
All right.

30

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:33,310
You got to learn a couple of commands like and check out klong or they're for it.

31

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:38,460
You know some of these basic commands and once you learn like four or five commands you are ready to

32

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:40,580
go and then the rest is history.

33

00:01:40,770  -->  00:01:43,260
Is practice right on the next lecture.

34

00:01:43,260  -->  00:01:44,780
We're going to continue with this.

35

00:01:44,940  -->  00:01:48,870
And we are little by little we're going to be learning how to use is more and more and next thing you

36

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:53,340
know this is just going to do this is it going to be done automatically you're not going to even think

37

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:58,560
to write these commands is going to be so easy and you won't be able to live without using good for

38

00:01:58,560  -->  00:01:59,790
your projects.

39

00:01:59,790  -->  00:02:00,340
All right.

40

00:02:00,510  -->  00:02:03,980
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
