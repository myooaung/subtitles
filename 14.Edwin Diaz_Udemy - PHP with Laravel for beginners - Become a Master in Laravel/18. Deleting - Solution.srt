1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,010
All right welcome back my students I hope you guys do not cheat.

2

00:00:04,020  -->  00:00:04,630
All right.

3

00:00:04,650  -->  00:00:09,600
Because I'm counting on you to actually do that from scratch you guys or I and you I hope you're not

4

00:00:09,600  -->  00:00:12,090
laughing thinking.

5

00:00:12,600  -->  00:00:15,780
You know the one the guy who's laughing is the one that cheated.

6

00:00:15,790  -->  00:00:16,630
All right.

7

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:19,200
So anyway what am I talking about.

8

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:21,380
Well easily you could have gone to.

9

00:00:21,480  -->  00:00:26,160
Use controller right because we already did this and you could have use copy and paste of this stuff

10

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:27,270
here basically.

11

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:27,790
All right.

12

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:29,260
Hopefully you did not do that.

13

00:00:29,400  -->  00:00:30,900
I want you to learn OK.

14

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:31,270
All right.

15

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:36,600
But anyway so what we want to do we want to find a poll so we're going to say full post

16

00:00:39,600  -->  00:00:41,130
if we can get it correctly here.

17

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:44,340
Find for fail.

18

00:00:44,380  -->  00:00:48,170
Geez what's going on with me today.

19

00:00:49,060  -->  00:00:51,630
And this lecture actually because I was fine.

20

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:52,980
All right.

21

00:00:52,980  -->  00:00:54,120
So we find the polls.

22

00:00:54,240  -->  00:00:57,190
Let's just give it a variable here.

23

00:00:58,080  -->  00:01:00,580
We find it and we can delete it right away.

24

00:01:00,750  -->  00:01:02,430
So let's actually do that real quick.

25

00:01:02,430  -->  00:01:03,780
Let's see.

26

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:07,080
Let's just find it in the lead it.

27

00:01:08,310  -->  00:01:09,020
All right.

28

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:13,190
So once we delete it from the database I don't think we need that.

29

00:01:13,710  -->  00:01:16,360
We don't need this guy right here.

30

00:01:16,480  -->  00:01:17,850
What's with the data from the database.

31

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:21,140
We have to link the image or delete it.

32

00:01:21,250  -->  00:01:24,200
No I don't know why they gave it the name on the link.

33

00:01:24,200  -->  00:01:24,860
All right.

34

00:01:24,940  -->  00:01:32,010
We're going to use a function here called public path and we're going to concatenate that with the As

35

00:01:32,010  -->  00:01:32,730
a matter of fact.

36

00:01:32,730  -->  00:01:37,800
We do need that very well there.

37

00:01:37,870  -->  00:01:39,960
This is the reason why we need it right now.

38

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:53,040
So we're going to say post photo file right and beautiful and we can redirect

39

00:01:59,490  -->  00:02:05,270
to what womenfolks.

40

00:02:06,330  -->  00:02:06,780
Cool.

41

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:13,590
I think we're good here guys if you want to do the flashing you can all rise up to you.

42

00:02:13,690  -->  00:02:14,850
I'm going to live with the way it is.

43

00:02:14,860  -->  00:02:16,190
I don't leave that to you.

44

00:02:16,560  -->  00:02:17,910
All right.

45

00:02:17,910  -->  00:02:18,710
All right cool.

46

00:02:18,810  -->  00:02:20,800
So this is post number two.

47

00:02:21,140  -->  00:02:24,950
Leslie one of these lists this guy this on categorize.

48

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:28,280
So this is both number.

49

00:02:28,590  -->  00:02:29,630
Number two actually.

50

00:02:29,830  -->  00:02:33,210
That's the same one.

51

00:02:33,210  -->  00:02:34,330
All right.

52

00:02:35,100  -->  00:02:41,000
Delete her doing.

53

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:44,400
Oh polls OK was able to the.

54

00:02:44,430  -->  00:02:53,880
But we got a error there with property something there for some reason.

55

00:02:54,000  -->  00:02:55,210
Let's see something here.

56

00:02:55,230  -->  00:02:59,210
Let's go to public images.

57

00:02:59,970  -->  00:03:02,160
We get a bunch of placeholders.

58

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:05,380
Let's look at this guy javascript this.

59

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:09,450
Click on delete and online one eighty.

60

00:03:09,480  -->  00:03:14,980
Trying to get trying to get prompt in an object.

61

00:03:15,240  -->  00:03:23,270
And let's get the numbers here again.

62

00:03:24,340  -->  00:03:28,850
Post Oh I see what it is.

63

00:03:28,860  -->  00:03:34,920
We were the lead in the polls before and then we can find the relationship of course because of polls

64

00:03:34,920  -->  00:03:37,500
already deleted.

65

00:03:37,560  -->  00:03:38,280
All right.

66

00:03:38,370  -->  00:03:40,710
So once we all link it then we've got to delete it.

67

00:03:40,710  -->  00:03:43,300
All right that's cool that's fine.

68

00:03:44,280  -->  00:03:45,520
All right.

69

00:03:45,540  -->  00:03:46,640
All we can do it in one line.

70

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:51,520
But of course if you think about it if you delete the polls how you're going to find a picture for it

71

00:03:51,520  -->  00:03:52,040
right.

72

00:03:52,340  -->  00:03:53,150
OK.

73

00:03:53,520  -->  00:03:56,540
Let's go back in and try this again.

74

00:03:56,930  -->  00:03:58,530
Are we running out of polls guys.

75

00:03:58,560  -->  00:04:00,080
We are running out of polls.

76

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:04,760
Well I guess we'll know if he's the leader because we only got one left.

77

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:07,230
All right so he's working pretty cool.

78

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:07,910
All right.

79

00:04:08,250  -->  00:04:13,790
So anyway thank you so much guys for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
