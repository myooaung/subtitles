1

00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.440
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:05.850
So  we tsrtkk stood and so we have to still finish up our edit page right here.

3

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:09.110
Now we have two things here that we got to do in this lecture.

4

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:15.810
We're going to put an image on the left side of the user the Koreen user and we are also going to fix

5

00:00:15.810  -->  00:00:19.290
this status here and find out why it's not working.

6

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:20.000
All right.

7

00:00:20.250  -->  00:00:23.900
So let's go back to the cold real quick.

8

00:00:23.910  -->  00:00:30.270
And as you can see right here we are the fault for it if we try.

9

00:00:30.270  -->  00:00:31.060
No.

10

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:36.490
And I was thinking about this and I figure out the problem with typing no.

11

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:40.110
We let Laro bill actually input some information in our field.

12

00:00:40.110  -->  00:00:43.700
But if we set a default it would not allow us to do that.

13

00:00:43.750  -->  00:00:44.410
All right.

14

00:00:44.460  -->  00:00:46.080
It would not do it correctly.

15

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:52.190
So let's go to users and we see that these guys now act if Ray we look at it and they're active.

16

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:53.440
Let's go back.

17

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:58.020
We see that Peter he's active he's working now as long as you don't put a fault.

18

00:00:58.020  -->  00:00:59.020
You're good to go.

19

00:00:59.250  -->  00:01:01.260
All right so that was an answer fits right.

20

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:02.010
All right cool.

21

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:07.210
So now let's get this tech attack the image sigh here.

22

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:14.790
I'm going to create a off with a class of S M 9:4 bootstrap.

23

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:22.510
Remember we using Bush roughly the scores of course guys you guys already knew there less than this

24

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:25.070
a little bit.

25

00:01:25.120  -->  00:01:25.940
Here we go.

26

00:01:25.980  -->  00:01:27.630
And now I'm going to separate this.

27

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:32.100
I'm going to put the image right here and another def and this one is going to be.

28

00:01:32.400  -->  00:01:37.180
Whoops yeah it's OK right here.

29

00:01:37.230  -->  00:01:39.720
So Image let's actually put a class on this.

30

00:01:39.720  -->  00:01:44.800
And let's call it a I am g responsive.

31

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:47.160
And let's put another class in here.

32

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:53.840
I am g circle or round it will go.

33

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:54.800
Now this source.

34

00:01:54.800  -->  00:02:01.660
Super simple user for all file.

35

00:02:01.720  -->  00:02:03.290
Let's go back and check it out.

36

00:02:03.290  -->  00:02:07.480
Real quick Refresh will.

37

00:02:08.110  -->  00:02:09.330
It's working now guys.

38

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:09.990
All right.

39

00:02:09.990  -->  00:02:13.730
Now we don't have a photo for this guy so we're going to get an error.

40

00:02:14.000  -->  00:02:14.470
All right.

41

00:02:14.490  -->  00:02:19.450
You might want to go to your user model and create some type of placeholder there.

42

00:02:19.590  -->  00:02:27.540
If the photo is not there you know before it is not there you create some type of directory here.

43

00:02:27.540  -->  00:02:33.060
Would a placeholder information or static information you write your conditions here or something like

44

00:02:33.060  -->  00:02:33.270
that.

45

00:02:33.270  -->  00:02:34.100
All right.

46

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:39.440
For now what we're going to be doing here we're going to detect this right here actually.

47

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:45.610
So we're going to see if they use a photo is there.

48

00:02:45.660  -->  00:02:50.770
We want to display it so you can see a photo file.

49

00:02:51.120  -->  00:02:54.100
But if it's not then we do a placeholder.

50

00:02:54.120  -->  00:02:56.130
I'm going to use this Web site now.

51

00:02:56.610  -->  00:03:02.800
I suggest for you to use some type of image so you what you might want to do something like this.

52

00:03:02.910  -->  00:03:05.120
And then your image name.

53

00:03:05.900  -->  00:03:07.200
OK.

54

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:10.680
Something that would say probably a placeholder.

55

00:03:10.680  -->  00:03:15.170
Now the reason why I'm doing this is because right now I don't have no image.

56

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:19.920
And the reason why I recommend it for you to do that is because one day this Web site that I'm going

57

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:26.850
to use right now placeholder it might not be available and you don't want to have this in your server

58

00:03:26.910  -->  00:03:27.990
in your life server.

59

00:03:27.990  -->  00:03:29.310
All right.

60

00:03:29.310  -->  00:03:33.330
So let's check it out real quick answer.

61

00:03:33.330  -->  00:03:35.650
There we go see the placeholder.

62

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:36.980
That's beautiful.

63

00:03:36.980  -->  00:03:41.660
I think we're making a really good improvement here.

64

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:44.070
You can also do the same thing for this year.

65

00:03:44.580  -->  00:03:48.990
So let's go back to users and let's do that there as well.

66

00:03:49.020  -->  00:03:58.450
I'm going to copy that and let's go back to the in user then that's And let's do that there.

67

00:03:59.780  -->  00:04:08.630
All right instead of this playing Actually that's in the photo section I am g photo file.

68

00:04:09.050  -->  00:04:10.290
Me once again

69

00:04:18.660  -->  00:04:22.120
of course it's not going to display no user for all.

70

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:25.340
Let's do it in here.

71

00:04:26.370  -->  00:04:28.170
Let's try that now.

72

00:04:28.950  -->  00:04:29.220
OK.

73

00:04:29.220  -->  00:04:32.050
They are 400 so we don't want to make them 400.

74

00:04:32.080  -->  00:04:39.390
Right now we want to make them I believe is 50.

75

00:04:39.810  -->  00:04:45.430
So forget this class here.

76

00:04:47.640  -->  00:04:50.700
I like to do the cheerleaders right here in the beginning

77

00:04:50.700  -->  00:04:56.400
.

78

00:04:58.780  -->  00:04:59.420
Right.

79

00:04:59.430  -->  00:05:04.520
And make it 50.

80

00:05:04.710  -->  00:05:06.470
There we go.

81

00:05:06.570  -->  00:05:09.320
I don't know what size this one is.

82

00:05:10.610  -->  00:05:11.360
All right.

83

00:05:11.760  -->  00:05:12.720
Pretty cool stuff.

84

00:05:12.720  -->  00:05:13.080
All right.

85

00:05:13.110  -->  00:05:17.540
I think we're done for now for this if if want when add something else.

86

00:05:17.550  -->  00:05:18.950
I will let you guys know.

87

00:05:18.960  -->  00:05:20.580
But I think we're doing pretty good.

88

00:05:20.580  -->  00:05:22.950
What do you think.

89

00:05:23.070  -->  00:05:23.570
All right.

90

00:05:23.700  -->  00:05:29.640
So the next step would be to make sure that this update functionality is working.

91

00:05:29.640  -->  00:05:30.590
All right.

92

00:05:31.020  -->  00:05:31.690
All right.

93

00:05:31.830  -->  00:05:33.030
Thank you so much for watching.

94

00:05:33.030  -->  00:05:35.210
Let's attack it in the next lecture
