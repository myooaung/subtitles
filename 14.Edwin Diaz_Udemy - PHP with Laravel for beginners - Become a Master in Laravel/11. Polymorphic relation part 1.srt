00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:05,580
All right welcome back my student in this lecture here we are going to be learning how to create polymorphic

2

00:00:05,580  -->  00:00:06,590
relations.

3

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:10,610
Now that sounds super complicated and it's even spelled complicated.

4

00:00:10,640  -->  00:00:11,100
All right.

5

00:00:11,170  -->  00:00:11,720
It is.

6

00:00:11,740  -->  00:00:14,230
It's even programmed.

7

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:15,100
Complicated.

8

00:00:15,180  -->  00:00:15,660
All right.

9

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:21,060
But I'm going to show it to you in a very easy format and I'm hoping that you're writing as you go with

10

00:00:21,150  -->  00:00:22,710
as you go along in this lecture.

11

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:23,360
OK.

12

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:24,640
I want you to write the code.

13

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:25,510
I want you to do it.

14

00:00:25,530  -->  00:00:29,600
I don't want you to just watch me if you want you can just watch me the first time and they start writing

15

00:00:29,610  -->  00:00:31,430
the second time you watch the video.

16

00:00:31,440  -->  00:00:32,130
OK.

17

00:00:32,220  -->  00:00:37,890
Now once you know this is going to be a breeze and you are going to enjoy making this party more free

18

00:00:37,890  -->  00:00:39,020
relations are right.

19

00:00:39,210  -->  00:00:40,320
So why are they.

20

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:46,020
Well polymorphic relations allow a model to be loaned to more than one other maade on a single association

21

00:00:46,370  -->  00:00:51,240
meaning that for example we could have a users table.

22

00:00:51,240  -->  00:00:51,810
Right.

23

00:00:51,930  -->  00:00:58,110
And we have opposed table and they both can be related to one other table called photos.

24

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:03,840
So in the photos table will have some columns that we say that would specify the model in which they

25

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:09,150
belong to in the idea of our record so they could we have a photo table that would say something like

26

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:17,070
hey listen this belongs to the poles model with the ID of one and this belongs to the user model with

27

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:18,500
the ID of two.

28

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:22,840
You see what I mean in that same table where we just have to create this relationship.

29

00:01:22,870  -->  00:01:24,920
And of course create in-migration.

30

00:01:25,230  -->  00:01:33,360
But anyway even if you did not understand what in the word I just said I am going to do it now in code

31

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:35,470
and you are going to be able to understand it or right.

32

00:01:35,760  -->  00:01:39,930
So I'm going to come in this hour and remember one thing guys were going to be building an application

33

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:45,030
where I'm going to show you how to create some of these relationships there how to date them how to

34

00:01:45,210  -->  00:01:48,210
you know delete them and do all kinds of great stuff in there.

35

00:01:48,210  -->  00:01:48,810
All right.

36

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:54,630
I just want you to understand how to build relationships later on you're going to be able to update

37

00:01:54,630  -->  00:01:59,130
them in and they lead them as you want arise is going to be pretty easy.

38

00:01:59,130  -->  00:02:03,570
So anyway the first thing is creating a migration right.

39

00:02:03,990  -->  00:02:06,880
This is clear he was just experimenting there.

40

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:11,730
Sometimes you have to keep writing this over and over again to get it to through your head.

41

00:02:11,740  -->  00:02:12,350
Right.

42

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:13,350
Not perfect.

43

00:02:13,460  -->  00:02:13,960
Write it.

44

00:02:13,980  -->  00:02:20,140
I use a lot of frameworks out there and I build a lot of applications so sometimes I forget methods

45

00:02:20,150  -->  00:02:20,300
.

46

00:02:20,370  -->  00:02:31,290
But anyway so here let's do BHB already sent and let's do this make a model and this color photo which

47

00:02:31,290  -->  00:02:35,710
is going to create a table called photos all lowercase with a plural right list.

48

00:02:35,770  -->  00:02:39,990
Tag a would m to be a migration at the same time.

49

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:42,550
Burford going to synchronize mine.

50

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:46,280
You don't have to do that some of you are going to see it right away under your app.

51

00:02:46,290  -->  00:02:49,440
You're going to see your photo model there.

52

00:02:49,470  -->  00:02:53,670
Now before we mess around we're building the relationship here.

53

00:02:53,940  -->  00:03:01,650
Let's go ahead and go to migrations for a stable and let's build some columns here.

54

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:02,030
All right.

55

00:03:02,100  -->  00:03:10,250
Table and the first column that we need here is the string and one the path of the picture right at

56

00:03:10,250  -->  00:03:13,000
least there so we can display it right.

57

00:03:13,440  -->  00:03:15,020
Let's call it path.

58

00:03:15,120  -->  00:03:17,380
The second here.

59

00:03:18,900  -->  00:03:20,700
Let's make this an integer

60

00:03:23,310  -->  00:03:31,400
integer and remember correctly we get to follow this convention here image able ID.

61

00:03:31,440  -->  00:03:38,890
So this would be the ID of that Recker right if his a user would be the user ID in there.

62

00:03:39,060  -->  00:03:44,330
And this is a table and this would be a string.

63

00:03:44,340  -->  00:03:46,320
This is where the type would be.

64

00:03:46,320  -->  00:03:53,670
So this could be the user id and here would be the app the name namespace app user because that would

65

00:03:53,670  -->  00:03:57,480
be the type so it would be something like app in the in the database.

66

00:03:57,480  -->  00:03:59,210
I mean OK.

67

00:03:59,640  -->  00:04:03,070
And you're going to see in a minute a user like that anyway.

68

00:04:03,930  -->  00:04:07,850
So we've got a string here it's going to be called Image able type.

69

00:04:08,580  -->  00:04:09,960
All right.

70

00:04:09,970  -->  00:04:12,050
Just follow this convention and you should be good.

71

00:04:12,450  -->  00:04:14,630
All right once we have that all we got to do is migrate.

72

00:04:14,640  -->  00:04:19,000
So BHP areason I agree.

73

00:04:19,020  -->  00:04:24,000
All right so I'm going to leave it like this up to here and on this lecture and on the next lecture

74

00:04:24,000  -->  00:04:24,670
we'll continue.

75

00:04:24,670  -->  00:04:25,360
All right guys.

76

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:30,930
I want you to digest the information while on this video rewind that if you want up to this point a

77

00:04:30,930  -->  00:04:34,460
couple of times until you understand exactly what we're doing.

78

00:04:34,740  -->  00:04:37,130
If not no worries continue.

79

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:39,140
And I'll see you in the next lecture Okay.

80

00:04:39,150  -->  00:04:39,960
Thank you so much.

81

00:04:39,990  -->  00:04:41,340
And bye bye.
