00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.950
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:08.100
So it's time for us to start creating a really cool HD of male form using lour of them.

3

00:00:08.140  -->  00:00:14.070
OK the way we did it right here is basically without any functions we're going to be using functions

4

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:22.390
prevail functions to open up forms to create input fields in and do all kinds of crazy really cool advanced

5

00:00:22.390  -->  00:00:23.210
stuff we love.

6

00:00:23.270  -->  00:00:25.580
OK so let me show you how to do that first of all.

7

00:00:25.590  -->  00:00:28.050
Well we're going to do is we're going to be installing a package.

8

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:31.880
And once we install that package then we can use this functionality OK.

9

00:00:32.130  -->  00:00:36.130
So let's go and open up a browser and let's look for it in Chrome.

10

00:00:36.210  -->  00:00:40.800
OK and so low chrome or whatever you're using as a browser.

11

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:42.600
I recommend Krown all the time.

12

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:47.400
So I'm going to start typing in Claribel.

13

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:49.800
Eliminate the e-mail.

14

00:00:49.800  -->  00:00:51.340
This is where we got to go.

15

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:52.500
All right.

16

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:58.830
And we have a gate up there where we can go and find out more information about it.

17

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:08.460
We have it in package just and let me see if I can find the right type the right website for it.

18

00:01:08.460  -->  00:01:10.170
They just click here.

19

00:01:11.370  -->  00:01:15.470
And this is where this is the form itself.

20

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:21.620
We're going to be using service provider to all this but I want the Web site.

21

00:01:21.740  -->  00:01:32.200
So let's call back real quick and let's just write collective OK and we go on collective.

22

00:01:32.200  -->  00:01:32.590
There we go.

23

00:01:32.590  -->  00:01:34.670
This is it right here.

24

00:01:35.100  -->  00:01:35.830
OK.

25

00:01:36.270  -->  00:01:40.040
And here you have all the information you need about specific form OK.

26

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:47.010
Now I'm going to try to pull this link saying every section where you know every time I complete a section

27

00:01:47.370  -->  00:01:51.780
if you want more information should look all the way to the bottom of the section or the last lecture

28

00:01:51.780  -->  00:01:55.790
of the section where you would have a link there to resources.

29

00:01:55.800  -->  00:01:58.320
And you know more information into the command station.

30

00:01:58.440  -->  00:02:01.860
All right so if we wanna install this mail

31

00:02:04.470  -->  00:02:10.330
package try let's do require Now we can do this manually.

32

00:02:10.650  -->  00:02:11.850
OK.

33

00:02:12.750  -->  00:02:16.170
Like he's saying right here so I'll show you right now how to do this.

34

00:02:16.250  -->  00:02:19.120
Or you can do composite require which is a lot easier.

35

00:02:19.170  -->  00:02:19.820
OK.

36

00:02:19.890  -->  00:02:21.330
We're going to do it manually.

37

00:02:21.720  -->  00:02:24.290
And just to show you.

38

00:02:24.480  -->  00:02:28.790
So let's go to composer that Jason just in case in the future you have a problem.

39

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:30.340
You can do this manually.

40

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:32.070
So go to comport with that Jason.

41

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:32.780
All right.

42

00:02:33.120  -->  00:02:37.110
And you're going to answer this right here.

43

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:38.100
Copy it.

44

00:02:38.490  -->  00:02:43.330
And as you can see this line right here where this require That's where you're going to do it.

45

00:02:43.330  -->  00:02:44.020
All right.

46

00:02:44.370  -->  00:02:48.540
So make sure you put a coal mine here and then that's line you're going to place that information that

47

00:02:48.540  -->  00:02:50.360
you use copy it.

48

00:02:50.370  -->  00:02:51.710
All right cool.

49

00:02:51.720  -->  00:03:00.180
Now all you got to do is go come here and do composer require.

50

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:00.590
All right.

51

00:03:00.600  -->  00:03:02.940
Actually composer of the I'm sorry.

52

00:03:03.390  -->  00:03:05.300
Answer.

53

00:03:05.700  -->  00:03:06.880
There we go.

54

00:03:07.000  -->  00:03:10.260
So it's update now we've got to let this finish

55

00:03:12.730  -->  00:03:18.780
by computer it took like around 20 seconds or a little more to do all this.

56

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:27.340
They removed the early years and they removed this one installed the new version right here 5.2 to 9

57

00:03:27.900  -->  00:03:30.600
and they installed this guy right here.

58

00:03:30.720  -->  00:03:38.320
And as you can see right now watch now all we have to do is we have to go to come Feg is going to come

59

00:03:38.320  -->  00:03:42.120
config right here.

60

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:48.420
And then we have to go to app and then we've got to add the service provider right here anywhere.

61

00:03:48.420  -->  00:03:51.600
All right this other providers This is where you install your plug ins.

62

00:03:51.600  -->  00:03:58.200
So right here if you go back to that documentation is going to copy this

63

00:04:01.170  -->  00:04:03.310
and you add in this line right here.

64

00:04:03.630  -->  00:04:08.430
OK.

65

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:20.860
Now you can that also the aliases that come back here copy and you can see they says alias here.

66

00:04:20.880  -->  00:04:26.370
This is so that way you can use these classes with another name.

67

00:04:26.370  -->  00:04:31.400
All right so you're going to enter and paste it in here.

68

00:04:31.890  -->  00:04:38.180
And I it.

69

00:04:38.280  -->  00:04:39.260
All right cool.

70

00:04:39.300  -->  00:04:48.860
Let's go to composer Jason real quick and make sure our of collective is actually in place there.

71

00:04:48.870  -->  00:04:49.950
It looks like it is.

72

00:04:49.950  -->  00:04:50.570
OK.

73

00:04:50.700  -->  00:04:54.610
So now let's go back to for and make sure that it's actually working.

74

00:04:54.830  -->  00:04:57.030
And what I mean for I mean the creator.

75

00:04:57.120  -->  00:04:58.300
Let's go there.

76

00:04:58.650  -->  00:05:03.480
And what I'm going to do there is going to try to use it.

77

00:05:03.520  -->  00:05:04.990
OK.

78

00:05:05.320  -->  00:05:13.010
So an hour later and we open up then this is where we do this.

79

00:05:13.140  -->  00:05:20.870
We open up the first curly brackets and then a and then two exclamation on each side.

80

00:05:21.300  -->  00:05:24.010
All right to create the form.

81

00:05:24.750  -->  00:05:25.770
So we use this function.

82

00:05:25.800  -->  00:05:26.350
Right.

83

00:05:26.670  -->  00:05:32.430
Because remember when we are doing this to curly brackets while we're doing this we're doing some

84

00:05:35.910  -->  00:05:44.030
we are this we are filtering or I think we're doing the male var entities when we do this.

85

00:05:44.100  -->  00:05:46.080
And basically when you do exclamation.

86

00:05:46.080  -->  00:05:50.260
Here is that you are telling it to Nuffield or anything.

87

00:05:50.340  -->  00:05:51.120
OK.

88

00:05:51.420  -->  00:05:57.800
So we're going to open up the form and let's go to create and if it doesn't work.

89

00:05:57.830  -->  00:06:06.960
If for some reason you did not add it it means that our configuration composer that Jason this stuff

90

00:06:07.110  -->  00:06:09.360
that we just installed is now working.

91

00:06:09.480  -->  00:06:10.290
All right.

92

00:06:10.450  -->  00:06:11.830
It was failed.

93

00:06:12.210  -->  00:06:15.670
So let's go and open up a browser and we already have one open.

94

00:06:16.860  -->  00:06:18.480
And let's go to

95

00:06:21.870  -->  00:06:23.570
see a mess.

96

00:06:23.670  -->  00:06:29.490
The Poles create Antar.

97

00:06:30.000  -->  00:06:35.270
And as you can see it is working so I'm going to inspect it.

98

00:06:35.980  -->  00:06:37.160
Right.

99

00:06:38.610  -->  00:06:46.500
And let's look at a form real quick as you can see right now is producing the form for us metal poles

100

00:06:46.530  -->  00:06:53.120
by default is giving us the action to pulls forward slash create.

101

00:06:53.150  -->  00:06:53.690
All right.

102

00:06:53.700  -->  00:06:59.700
And he's even giving us a chart character set of UTF and.

103

00:06:59.760  -->  00:07:04.410
So it is working guys anywhere on the next lecture will continue with this and I'll show you how to

104

00:07:04.410  -->  00:07:07.410
create inputs and how to even pass parameters.

105

00:07:07.410  -->  00:07:09.720
So this really cool functions.

106

00:07:09.780  -->  00:07:11.160
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.

107

00:07:11.190  -->  00:07:11.490
Bye bye
