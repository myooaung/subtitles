00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:04.410
Write welcome back my students so it's time for us to start setting up the relationship and that's super

2

00:00:04.410  -->  00:00:05.420
easy right.

3

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:06.890
You to remember how to do that.

4

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:11.010
We go to app and then we go to user model.

5

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:16.330
In this case and we have a role for the user right so we're going to say all right.

6

00:00:16.530  -->  00:00:18.280
Pawlick function.

7

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:24.610
And we're going to call this role and I say this belongs to.

8

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:28.270
Whoops.

9

00:00:30.310  -->  00:00:33.100
App roll.

10

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:34.020
Whoops

11

00:00:37.400  -->  00:00:39.060
there we go.

12

00:00:39.060  -->  00:00:39.510
All right.

13

00:00:39.510  -->  00:00:41.240
Super easy stuff right.

14

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:47.850
So now if we want to test this to see if it's working and I suggest you do that we have to actually

15

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:50.490
put some data in the database right.

16

00:00:50.490  -->  00:00:50.980
All right cool.

17

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:53.870
Let's go to the beach be my ADD me real quick.

18

00:00:53.870  -->  00:00:55.840
Let's refresh this.

19

00:00:55.860  -->  00:01:15.210
We don't have the rules table so let's migrate it BHP or is migrate we go refresh scrolls and let's

20

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:16.800
insert something here.

21

00:01:17.050  -->  00:01:23.300
And the name is administrator is

22

00:01:26.550  -->  00:01:29.510
and that's one should be altered.

23

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:35.520
These users will be able to edit I mean to create posts

24

00:01:41.570  -->  00:01:45.250
.

25

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:52.080
And let's just create one for subscribers.

26

00:01:52.080  -->  00:01:57.130
These users will not be able to do anything else but they will be actually they will be able to comment

27

00:01:57.130  -->  00:02:00.690
on our application and see their profile.

28

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:02.270
So I think that's good.

29

00:02:02.670  -->  00:02:06.360
Let's do that now let's go to users.

30

00:02:06.360  -->  00:02:07.610
We don't have a user.

31

00:02:07.680  -->  00:02:09.440
That's OK.

32

00:02:09.450  -->  00:02:16.740
All right we'll go to our application because applications are already working so let's go to our application

33

00:02:16.740  -->  00:02:18.180
real quick.

34

00:02:18.180  -->  00:02:19.910
Let's register a user.

35

00:02:19.960  -->  00:02:28.590
I'm going to register myself and doing that courting faculty

36

00:02:31.100  -->  00:02:34.140
com my password.

37

00:02:34.390  -->  00:02:39.320
I mean you just put a fake bass were just in case.

38

00:02:39.360  -->  00:02:40.680
All right cool.

39

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:42.000
Oops.

40

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:44.340
Kimberly my password did not match.

41

00:02:44.450  -->  00:02:46.360
I think up with the fake password first.

42

00:02:46.380  -->  00:02:48.050
And the real one after.

43

00:02:48.150  -->  00:02:49.980
All right cool.

44

00:02:49.980  -->  00:03:01.350
So now if we go back and refresh we have that user now let's actually edit a user and am I seeing this

45

00:03:01.350  -->  00:03:02.720
correctly.

46

00:03:02.910  -->  00:03:04.050
We don't have that rule

47

00:03:06.370  -->  00:03:10.190
that rule ID.

48

00:03:10.450  -->  00:03:11.750
Hah.

49

00:03:12.210  -->  00:03:20.790
We need to actually do a migrate refresh guys arrive because we added some stuff in the database migration

50

00:03:20.790  -->  00:03:23.980
in the Users table will never migrate to this.

51

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:24.540
All right.

52

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:29.980
So THP Adisa migrate refresh.

53

00:03:29.980  -->  00:03:33.910
All right cool.

54

00:03:34.020  -->  00:03:39.810
And let's do this again real quick I'm going to pop a video because I don't want you to look at me writing

55

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:42.390
the video.

56

00:03:42.390  -->  00:03:49.890
I did a I said all the rules here and I haven't done the user this is easy and I don't mind you watching

57

00:03:49.890  -->  00:03:57.190
me actually writing this because as you can see it is easy.

58

00:03:57.900  -->  00:04:00.850
All right.

59

00:04:02.950  -->  00:04:05.400
Well I went blank there for a minute with my password.

60

00:04:05.400  -->  00:04:06.780
Can you believe it guys.

61

00:04:06.780  -->  00:04:07.730
All right.

62

00:04:08.790  -->  00:04:10.760
Let's go back to the users table now.

63

00:04:10.770  -->  00:04:14.880
And now we could see that rule I.D. and it's known right now.

64

00:04:15.000  -->  00:04:24.720
Let's actually make it one so these guys will be an administrator and active.

65

00:04:24.720  -->  00:04:25.410
That's OK.

66

00:04:25.410  -->  00:04:27.160
We're just going to leave it like that.

67

00:04:27.630  -->  00:04:28.630
All right cool.

68

00:04:28.920  -->  00:04:29.460
All right.

69

00:04:29.460  -->  00:04:32.760
So this lecture is getting kind of low on the next lecture.

70

00:04:32.800  -->  00:04:34.390
We to actually test this out.

71

00:04:34.500  -->  00:04:38.680
And then what I want you to do is I want you to try yourself and try to see how you can test it out

72

00:04:38.710  -->  00:04:38.860
.

73

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:42.260
And another thing is that you can use thinka remember that.

74

00:04:42.270  -->  00:04:48.150
All right super easy to use is very good that you get used to used in thinker because it saves you all

75

00:04:48.150  -->  00:04:49.500
a bunch of writing.

76

00:04:49.500  -->  00:04:50.000
All right.

77

00:04:50.070  -->  00:04:51.720
Take care.
