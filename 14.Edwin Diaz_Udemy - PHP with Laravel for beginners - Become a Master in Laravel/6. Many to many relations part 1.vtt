00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.740
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.740  -->  00:00:03.740
I'm so glad that you're here today.

3

00:00:03.930  -->  00:00:08.930
We're going to be learning something super cool in that relationship section here.

4

00:00:08.950  -->  00:00:15.500
We're going to be learning how to create a pivot table with the many many too many to many relationship

5

00:00:15.500  -->  00:00:15.610
.

6

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:16.560
Eloquent.

7

00:00:16.560  -->  00:00:18.150
Now what is a pivot table.

8

00:00:18.240  -->  00:00:24.030
Well a pivot table is a table is a lookup table is a table that we are going to be using to relate to

9

00:00:24.040  -->  00:00:24.960
other tables.

10

00:00:24.960  -->  00:00:25.730
All right.

11

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:32.640
So now Larabee has a very specific instructions on how to construct a pivot table and we're going to

12

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:35.850
follow that convention so that way our application works very good.

13

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:42.600
Claribel we don't have to do a lot of customisation here if we use right convention or right and I'm

14

00:00:42.600  -->  00:00:43.790
going to show you which one it is.

15

00:00:43.800  -->  00:00:47.640
But now let's say for example and we are going to do this.

16

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:52.110
We want to create a new rules for our users.

17

00:00:52.110  -->  00:00:52.470
Right.

18

00:00:52.470  -->  00:00:55.870
We want to have different rules depending on the user.

19

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:02.700
So for example for user it would ID number one which could be the admin which is Me of course we could

20

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:08.370
create a roll over minutes trader and then if you want to be a subscriber we can also create a role

21

00:01:08.370  -->  00:01:13.830
for subscriber for a different type of user for maybe somebody they just signed up for a web site or

22

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:14.990
something like that right.

23

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:19.660
That's going to be a pretty cool thing to learn and I tell you right now and many of you wish you learned

24

00:01:19.660  -->  00:01:23.000
this a long time ago but on show and to show it to you right now.

25

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:23.840
So.

26

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:26.490
So we have to create three tables.

27

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:28.680
We have the user say we're already here.

28

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:34.020
So we're going to use that then we need to create the rules table to keep the rules the name of the

29

00:01:34.020  -->  00:01:38.880
roles and then the third table is a pivot table which is the lookup table and that's going to have the

30

00:01:38.940  -->  00:01:42.280
user id and the role Id right to relay those too.

31

00:01:42.570  -->  00:01:49.410
So let's go to a terminal real quick and create those two migrations and model.

32

00:01:49.410  -->  00:01:57.970
So BHB areason and make model role.

33

00:01:58.020  -->  00:02:02.700
Remember this is going to make a plural version of this word.

34

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:06.100
All lowercase for the table.

35

00:02:06.750  -->  00:02:09.450
And we're going to do m for Migration.

36

00:02:09.450  -->  00:02:10.200
There we go.

37

00:02:10.520  -->  00:02:11.820
OK.

38

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:15.290
And the next one is the migration of the pivot table.

39

00:02:15.360  -->  00:02:18.120
So BHP Arty's sin.

40

00:02:18.330  -->  00:02:21.660
Now this is very interesting and we have to follow this convention.

41

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:24.350
Now what we need to do and where we are going to do.

42

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:31.400
And let's go to let's go to our migration real quick.

43

00:02:31.410  -->  00:02:40.240
So database migration and this synchronized as you guys probably don't have to do this.

44

00:02:40.380  -->  00:02:45.480
I have a lot of things running and my computers and I work around your percent right now but we can

45

00:02:45.480  -->  00:02:46.310
deal with it right.

46

00:02:46.530  -->  00:02:51.240
So we have this table the rules table right here.

47

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:54.440
And while we don't have a year what is the migration.

48

00:02:54.450  -->  00:02:55.400
That's what we're going to have.

49

00:02:55.410  -->  00:02:57.430
And we've got the user stable right.

50

00:02:57.670  -->  00:03:05.130
While Clarabell is asking us to do is to put this two together whatever tables we are relating together

51

00:03:05.520  -->  00:03:07.980
to make the name for the pivot table.

52

00:03:07.980  -->  00:03:12.690
So he's asking us to pull users and roles together.

53

00:03:12.690  -->  00:03:16.710
All right so we've got to create a table call user roles right that's where you think from the beginning

54

00:03:16.710  -->  00:03:20.520
right we're going to say a user's rules right.

55

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:28.500
Well they also want us to do it a little different while they want us to do a singular singular arises

56

00:03:28.820  -->  00:03:35.120
make it singular like this and not only that but order a in alphabetical order putting alphabetical

57

00:03:35.120  -->  00:03:35.370
order.

58

00:03:35.370  -->  00:03:43.210
So instead of being users roles we're going to call a roll user like this.

59

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:46.030
OK.

60

00:03:46.100  -->  00:03:51.500
And that's because Larabee is always looking for different columns.

61

00:03:51.640  -->  00:03:56.460
A few names like this with this conventual Arbor nose is a pivot table is going to treat it like a pivot

62

00:03:56.460  -->  00:04:00.680
table and we can do a lot more things with it because Larabee already knows about it.

63

00:04:00.690  -->  00:04:01.140
All right.

64

00:04:01.170  -->  00:04:02.970
If we if we follow this convention.

65

00:04:03.090  -->  00:04:12.720
So let's create this migration real quick BHB make artisan actually Orison make migration

66

00:04:15.190  -->  00:04:18.710
to to to to to him rule

67

00:04:22.890  -->  00:04:36.180
actually create users rule rules table something like that and then they flag it creepy and then we

68

00:04:36.180  -->  00:04:39.250
put the name here roll user.

69

00:04:39.780  -->  00:04:42.690
OK Antar that should be good.

70

00:04:42.690  -->  00:04:46.860
They're going to synchronize it in my and your own brawly don't have to do that.

71

00:04:46.890  -->  00:04:47.710
All right.

72

00:04:48.090  -->  00:04:55.350
So as you can see roll user and now what we need to do is start with the rules here and we are going

73

00:04:55.350  -->  00:05:04.290
to say table and this is going to be the name of the roll

74

00:05:07.280  -->  00:05:10.500
string and that's going to be the name.

75

00:05:10.710  -->  00:05:15.050
OK let's say that's all we're going to have on this table here.

76

00:05:15.300  -->  00:05:18.530
And then the rules.

77

00:05:19.230  -->  00:05:24.450
This one here is going to have the user id and there are all the ID.

78

00:05:24.450  -->  00:05:26.850
I hope you understand what we are doing.

79

00:05:27.450  -->  00:05:28.320
OK.

80

00:05:28.590  -->  00:05:32.260
So let's use two user ID first.

81

00:05:32.690  -->  00:05:37.920
And remember the Larabee when we create a relationship in the model Larabee already is knows to look

82

00:05:37.920  -->  00:05:40.940
for the user ID.

83

00:05:40.940  -->  00:05:41.840
All right.

84

00:05:41.890  -->  00:05:50.610
And all ID because we are following that convention of putting everything singular and in lowercase

85

00:05:50.610  -->  00:05:50.980
.

86

00:05:51.030  -->  00:05:55.720
So the role Id like this.

87

00:05:55.760  -->  00:06:00.100
OK beautiful.

88

00:06:00.110  -->  00:06:04.260
All right so I'm going to actually split this into two lectures.

89

00:06:04.290  -->  00:06:08.110
And we're going to do the next we're going to continue in the next lecture.

90

00:06:08.520  -->  00:06:12.010
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
