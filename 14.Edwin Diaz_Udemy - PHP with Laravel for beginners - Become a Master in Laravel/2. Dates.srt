1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,100
All right welcome back to the students.

2

00:00:02,240  -->  00:00:09,120
So it's tough for us to start getting acquainted with dead date functionality in Clarabelle or I or

3

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:11,660
have some fun with dates that's what we got to do list.

4

00:00:11,760  -->  00:00:13,510
Let's have some fun with dates right.

5

00:00:13,530  -->  00:00:21,780
So I got to tell you how it works really simple let's create around real quick and let's call it dates

6

00:00:21,790  -->  00:00:23,320
.

7

00:00:23,350  -->  00:00:25,360
Right.

8

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:32,640
And I am now going to go over every date minted out they are all functionality since there is a ton

9

00:00:32,670  -->  00:00:38,610
of date dates information and I'm going to give you a link at the end of the section so you can you

10

00:00:38,610  -->  00:00:40,160
know learn more about dates.

11

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:45,450
But I'm going to give you the general overview on how we create dates with Clarabell.

12

00:00:45,510  -->  00:00:48,460
You see Largo comes with this class called carbon.

13

00:00:48,740  -->  00:00:49,640
All right.

14

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:53,320
And Carlings including every Larabee installation.

15

00:00:53,400  -->  00:00:57,280
As of this version I don't know if maybe in the future they'll take it off.

16

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:05,700
But right now it is included and it's really great for playing around with dates for you know creating

17

00:01:05,960  -->  00:01:10,650
a lot of data functionality and we're going to do that in a mass when we get to it.

18

00:01:10,690  -->  00:01:13,320
Not in the same as I mean the application where we get to it.

19

00:01:13,650  -->  00:01:16,570
But right now I'm going to show you how he's done.

20

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:23,580
So let's say you know him in regular Ph.D. we create at the time right object we have a day telling

21

00:01:23,690  -->  00:01:31,680
you that we can at any time write so we will do this and we've got these daytime object writers on this

22

00:01:31,680  -->  00:01:35,070
subject that we can use and we can use it.

23

00:01:35,220  -->  00:01:44,550
Let's say for example we can say plus one week and we can echo this out when we can say let's grab the

24

00:01:44,550  -->  00:01:52,790
object and we can format the object and we can say I want to display the Monda day and the year.

25

00:01:53,180  -->  00:01:56,220
OK so now we go to our application

26

00:01:58,920  -->  00:01:59,580
right here.

27

00:01:59,590  -->  00:02:04,360
You can see that we have the month the day in the year right.

28

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:05,670
Cool.

29

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:06,150
All right.

30

00:02:06,420  -->  00:02:07,610
So we know we can do that.

31

00:02:07,620  -->  00:02:11,250
But now let me show you about Harben real quick.

32

00:02:11,250  -->  00:02:15,380
All right let's create a B or tag right here.

33

00:02:15,710  -->  00:02:18,800
So separate some other stuff.

34

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:19,540
All right.

35

00:02:19,650  -->  00:02:20,310
All right.

36

00:02:20,310  -->  00:02:23,450
So carbon is included in the allowable installation.

37

00:02:23,450  -->  00:02:27,120
All you have to do is go all the way to the top and import it.

38

00:02:27,240  -->  00:02:28,020
OK.

39

00:02:28,020  -->  00:02:31,970
So we're going to use carbon.

40

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:32,990
There we go.

41

00:02:33,090  -->  00:02:34,690
That's it.

42

00:02:34,680  -->  00:02:41,460
So now now if for those of you that want to include carbon in your proj all you have to do is go to

43

00:02:41,470  -->  00:02:42,870
composer.

44

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:44,420
All right.

45

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:55,970
And let me see if I can composer Serge CARVIN Right.

46

00:02:56,880  -->  00:02:57,360
There we go.

47

00:02:57,360  -->  00:03:03,170
And this is the package you have to require composer require your nest but carbon you can include during

48

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:04,300
any project you have.

49

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:05,100
OK.

50

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:09,440
But anyway Clarabelle already has it included.

51

00:03:09,870  -->  00:03:10,630
Cool.

52

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:17,310
Let's go all the way to the bottom and let's play around with carving a little bit.

53

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:17,840
All right.

54

00:03:18,030  -->  00:03:19,550
Let me show you some of the things that we can do.

55

00:03:19,560  -->  00:03:29,160
Let's go out carbon the best way here to for you to know is that we have the date the current day and

56

00:03:29,160  -->  00:03:33,890
carbon and enter as you can see that's the current date and time.

57

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:35,480
OK.

58

00:03:35,640  -->  00:03:36,770
Cool stuff right.

59

00:03:36,960  -->  00:03:39,050
But look what we can do with this.

60

00:03:39,390  -->  00:03:42,280
We can come here and we can say something like.

61

00:03:42,490  -->  00:03:52,230
And you see where my ph be stormed does automatically adds the med that we can use against me suggestions

62

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:52,490
.

63

00:03:52,530  -->  00:04:01,710
So let's say I want to use this guy right here Antar and now is going to tell me the cooking time in

64

00:04:01,710  -->  00:04:04,300
a readable and human readable way.

65

00:04:04,320  -->  00:04:06,850
One second ago one second ago.

66

00:04:06,930  -->  00:04:07,920
OK.

67

00:04:08,280  -->  00:04:13,860
Now what we can do is actually see this a little better is that we could add another method here and

68

00:04:14,040  -->  00:04:20,650
say we can add let's add some days to a list of four days.

69

00:04:20,740  -->  00:04:22,220
There's 10 days to it.

70

00:04:22,680  -->  00:04:25,410
And now let's go back and.

71

00:04:25,440  -->  00:04:27,910
And as you can see it says one week from now.

72

00:04:28,320  -->  00:04:28,830
All right.

73

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:29,850
Really cool stuff.

74

00:04:31,410  -->  00:04:33,050
Let's do a couple more.

75

00:04:33,180  -->  00:04:33,480
Let's

76

00:04:36,330  -->  00:04:44,690
do some more taxes here and let's do one more here.

77

00:04:45,000  -->  00:04:47,640
So let's say eco carbon.

78

00:04:47,790  -->  00:04:56,760
Now let's play around with this and let's say some months four months.

79

00:04:56,760  -->  00:04:59,620
And we want to see it in a human readable way right.

80

00:05:00,060  -->  00:05:07,220
So that way we can see this five months from now look at that beautiful guys.

81

00:05:07,230  -->  00:05:07,760
Right.

82

00:05:07,890  -->  00:05:09,760
And there are so many other methods.

83

00:05:09,780  -->  00:05:10,890
I'm going to give you a link.

84

00:05:10,890  -->  00:05:13,220
Anyway at the end of this section.

85

00:05:13,230  -->  00:05:18,520
Boy they are so many guys get it now.

86

00:05:18,540  -->  00:05:19,170
All right.

87

00:05:19,290  -->  00:05:21,230
I'm going to go down a little bit.

88

00:05:21,500  -->  00:05:27,360
And as you can see there are so many different mentors that we can use.

89

00:05:27,360  -->  00:05:28,510
All right.

90

00:05:29,160  -->  00:05:29,820
Watch this

91

00:05:33,840  -->  00:05:35,190
yesterday.

92

00:05:35,700  -->  00:05:41,670
Let's do it in the human readable way.

93

00:05:42,300  -->  00:05:42,810
One day.

94

00:05:42,820  -->  00:05:45,140
Go.

95

00:05:45,210  -->  00:05:48,400
Cool stuff right.

96

00:05:50,440  -->  00:05:55,160
If we do it like this we just get it and in a time stamp way.

97

00:05:55,170  -->  00:05:56,630
Right.

98

00:05:57,410  -->  00:05:57,750
All right.

99

00:05:57,780  -->  00:06:03,160
I mean I'm going to leave it up to you to actually you know play around with dates.

100

00:06:03,180  -->  00:06:05,580
But as you can see super easy to do.

101

00:06:05,760  -->  00:06:10,330
And if you want to do this in a preview that you already have already show you.

102

00:06:10,590  -->  00:06:15,470
All you have to do is do a composer with this package right here.

103

00:06:15,700  -->  00:06:23,160
Composer require this carbon is going to include that packaging your project and then all you have to

104

00:06:23,160  -->  00:06:26,010
do is do they require.

105

00:06:26,770  -->  00:06:27,360
OK.

106

00:06:27,510  -->  00:06:34,460
And then you include your order function and you can look it up in your composer in the composer website

107

00:06:34,510  -->  00:06:35,420
and in the.

108

00:06:35,490  -->  00:06:37,310
That's how you require

109

00:06:40,860  -->  00:06:42,900
you require composer projects.

110

00:06:42,900  -->  00:06:43,960
OK.

111

00:06:44,190  -->  00:06:45,050
All right.

112

00:06:45,540  -->  00:06:47,510
I think it's we will go with this.

113

00:06:47,520  -->  00:06:51,780
And if you again if you want to learn more go to the link at the end of the section and then I'll give

114

00:06:51,780  -->  00:06:52,860
it to you.

115

00:06:53,260  -->  00:06:56,820
And always look for links at the end of the sections OK.

116

00:06:57,330  -->  00:06:59,510
Or in the lectures.

117

00:07:00,210  -->  00:07:04,490
Thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
