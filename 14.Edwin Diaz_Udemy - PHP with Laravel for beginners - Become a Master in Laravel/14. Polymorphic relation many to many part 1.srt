00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:06,600
Welcome back the students I hope you guys are having a lot of fun if some of you are frustrated.

2

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:07,600
That's OK.

3

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:12,690
OK good frustration because that's going to help you become better.

4

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:17,160
You get frustrated you try to find a solution to a problem you find the solution to your problem.

5

00:00:17,250  -->  00:00:20,400
All of a sudden you are you become a better developer OK.

6

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:25,590
So don't worry about it's just a matter of time before you understand it or you have to do is just keep

7

00:00:25,590  -->  00:00:31,260
practicing keep making the same thing over and over again until you find the solution and once you do

8

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:36,460
go through that period of frustration then you want to pull your hair out even if you don't have much

9

00:00:36,470  -->  00:00:36,820
.

10

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:43,100
When you go through that and you finish going through that stage you're going to feel relieved because

11

00:00:43,100  -->  00:00:44,300
you don't know the information.

12

00:00:44,310  -->  00:00:45,950
OK so that's OK.

13

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:51,760
In this lecture here we're going to be learning about the many too many polymorphic relations.

14

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:52,420
All right.

15

00:00:52,530  -->  00:00:55,970
And I don't want you to be here if you didn't understand the last relations.

16

00:00:55,980  -->  00:00:56,940
Want you to go back.

17

00:00:56,960  -->  00:01:02,270
I understand him even if he has to make a separate Laro Bell application right.

18

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:10,050
Even if you have to install a separate Laro Bell installation go back and create that project.

19

00:01:10,150  -->  00:01:10,630
1.

20

00:01:10,630  -->  00:01:14,940
All right so for example what I mean is if you're having a problem with our relationship let's say you

21

00:01:14,950  -->  00:01:19,850
having a problem with polymorphic relations on the last lecture go back and create a new installation

22

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:23,880
of Clarabelle and just try that relationship until you understand it.

23

00:01:24,180  -->  00:01:29,660
If you got a problem with one to one or many to many going create a separate installation Clarabelle

24

00:01:29,960  -->  00:01:35,160
and practice that relationship until you get it down don't come here.

25

00:01:35,160  -->  00:01:40,080
If you don't understand them because they're going to be very important for us to build any application

26

00:01:40,080  -->  00:01:43,530
on line we're dealing with databases all the time.

27

00:01:43,560  -->  00:01:47,180
So you got to understand relationships in Claribel OK.

28

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:47,820
All right.

29

00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:52,250
So now we're going to be dealing with maybe too many polymorphic relations.

30

00:01:52,250  -->  00:01:52,850
All right.

31

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:58,140
And we're going to be following some conventions and we're going to be also following so many examples

32

00:01:58,140  -->  00:02:00,390
on the Larabee dot com Web site.

33

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:04,590
I'm going to give you some links here are the end of each section so you can refer back to that.

34

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:07,000
But anyway so we can to create.

35

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:09,760
We already have a pool stable so we're going to leave that on.

36

00:02:09,760  -->  00:02:15,990
We're going to create a migrations for videos and we're also going to create a tags in a tag Abeles

37

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:23,200
table and basically many to many relationship for polymorphic relations are they.

38

00:02:23,250  -->  00:02:27,760
They share a single list of unique records.

39

00:02:27,850  -->  00:02:33,630
OK those records are I'm on you know the rest of the other tables.

40

00:02:33,660  -->  00:02:36,750
So if we have a post in a videos

41

00:02:38,810  -->  00:02:46,570
of tables OK they're going to be sharing tags in our little program that we're going to create.

42

00:02:46,650  -->  00:02:46,920
Right.

43

00:02:46,920  -->  00:02:49,120
Well not a program but this.

44

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:52,230
You know all this code that I'm showing you.

45

00:02:52,260  -->  00:02:52,750
All right.

46

00:02:52,920  -->  00:02:56,230
So anyway let's go ahead and do that right now.

47

00:02:56,580  -->  00:03:02,270
So let's create a migration starting now let's clear our terminal.

48

00:03:02,650  -->  00:03:06,330
If you are using the terminal cleared it out and let's do this now.

49

00:03:06,330  -->  00:03:08,910
So we already have a post.

50

00:03:08,950  -->  00:03:18,060
Let's create a video table by doing a migration so let's do BHB artisan OK make migration.

51

00:03:18,690  -->  00:03:22,650
And as a matter of fact let's just create the model right away right.

52

00:03:22,950  -->  00:03:25,080
Just in case we need it.

53

00:03:25,150  -->  00:03:25,700
All right.

54

00:03:25,830  -->  00:03:28,020
So the model will be video.

55

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:29,450
OK.

56

00:03:29,720  -->  00:03:33,280
And hyphen M for Migration.

57

00:03:33,330  -->  00:03:34,480
OK create it.

58

00:03:34,560  -->  00:03:44,470
Now the next one would be tags so I'm going to press my up arrow key and I'm going to see a tag Antar

59

00:03:44,750  -->  00:03:45,110
.

60

00:03:45,150  -->  00:03:45,460
All right.

61

00:03:45,460  -->  00:03:48,890
So we have the model and the migration already together.

62

00:03:48,890  -->  00:03:50,700
All right so the next one after that.

63

00:03:50,700  -->  00:03:54,600
Believe it or not it's going to be the toggles.

64

00:03:54,640  -->  00:03:55,300
Right.

65

00:03:55,410  -->  00:04:01,560
And that's going to be another table and I'm just going to call it like this game.

66

00:04:01,620  -->  00:04:03,390
All right.

67

00:04:03,390  -->  00:04:08,900
I'm going to create a model and the migration even if we don't need it later that's OK.

68

00:04:08,910  -->  00:04:10,300
All right we have it there.

69

00:04:10,570  -->  00:04:11,020
Beautiful.

70

00:04:11,030  -->  00:04:17,620
So now let's go undefine those migrations and let me take this off.

71

00:04:17,780  -->  00:04:19,130
It's opened up a little bit.

72

00:04:19,200  -->  00:04:23,450
Let's go down to app City.

73

00:04:23,720  -->  00:04:24,750
Nice TTP.

74

00:04:24,780  -->  00:04:35,060
We need actually database migrations and let's start with the whoah.

75

00:04:35,160  -->  00:04:36,380
I don't even see them yet.

76

00:04:36,390  -->  00:04:38,670
So let's do synchronized real quick.

77

00:04:38,670  -->  00:04:38,930
All right.

78

00:04:38,940  -->  00:04:41,770
So let's start with a one on top first the videos.

79

00:04:41,800  -->  00:04:42,400
All right.

80

00:04:42,570  -->  00:04:51,330
So the video the only thing that we are going to be adding here is a name column OK for the video name

81

00:04:53,100  -->  00:05:08,080
and for the tax table we are going to be adding a name that's well bring me.

82

00:05:08,100  -->  00:05:09,190
There we go.

83

00:05:09,210  -->  00:05:11,820
Now the target was this is where the fun begins.

84

00:05:11,820  -->  00:05:12,930
All right.

85

00:05:13,150  -->  00:05:20,740
So where are we going to be relating the post and the videos with attacks is by creating this column

86

00:05:20,740  -->  00:05:22,190
C or in the target.

87

00:05:22,380  -->  00:05:23,380
Right.

88

00:05:24,000  -->  00:05:30,310
So we got the we don't even we don't even need this increment here.

89

00:05:30,360  -->  00:05:32,070
To be honest with you.

90

00:05:32,130  -->  00:05:33,710
OK.

91

00:05:34,370  -->  00:05:39,510
So all we need right here is table.

92

00:05:40,560  -->  00:05:48,370
We could however how the target will have an incremental ID as a matter of fact if we wanted to.

93

00:05:48,390  -->  00:05:50,360
But that's ok i don't we don't need it here.

94

00:05:50,580  -->  00:05:59,820
So this is going to be an integer and this is going to be called the tag ID with this

95

00:06:02,370  -->  00:06:03,570
array.

96

00:06:03,570  -->  00:06:08,070
Now then that's when the table is another all integers.

97

00:06:08,070  -->  00:06:08,610
All right.

98

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:13,080
And this one would be the target ID.

99

00:06:13,110  -->  00:06:17,130
Now explain to you in a minute.

100

00:06:17,140  -->  00:06:20,470
Boy you know I'm trying to spell it correctly guys.

101

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:25,410
And the next one is Tiger will type

102

00:06:28,120  -->  00:06:36,570
Tiger will two G's actually type and I hope you see

103

00:06:39,360  -->  00:06:42,140
right now and we don't even need a time stamp guys.

104

00:06:42,170  -->  00:06:45,650
I just leave that there all the time but we don't need that.

105

00:06:45,810  -->  00:06:47,750
And an extra feel for no reason.

106

00:06:48,150  -->  00:06:48,860
OK.

107

00:06:49,080  -->  00:06:53,320
So I hope you see how we can relate them now in a way here.

108

00:06:53,340  -->  00:06:58,920
We're going to have let's say the tag ID that's in the tax table here we're going to have the taxable

109

00:06:59,510  -->  00:07:00,680
ID dummies.

110

00:07:00,720  -->  00:07:03,290
Let's say we have a video with idea number one.

111

00:07:03,290  -->  00:07:06,720
That's where this is where we go OK in there.

112

00:07:06,720  -->  00:07:10,360
Here we're going to have the model right.

113

00:07:10,530  -->  00:07:11,590
The target will type.

114

00:07:11,640  -->  00:07:15,980
So he's going to be a nap backslash video.

115

00:07:16,020  -->  00:07:18,890
All right so we're going to put the model in our column here.

116

00:07:19,170  -->  00:07:20,240
OK.

117

00:07:20,310  -->  00:07:20,750
All right.

118

00:07:20,790  -->  00:07:21,450
Perfect.

119

00:07:21,450  -->  00:07:29,130
So the next step here is actually making linking everything with functions or methods right in the models

120

00:07:29,130  -->  00:07:29,180
.

121

00:07:29,190  -->  00:07:34,890
So we're going to do that in the next lecture just to keep things a little divided that way I don't

122

00:07:34,890  -->  00:07:36,610
overwhelm you with information.

123

00:07:36,810  -->  00:07:40,300
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one guys.

124

00:07:40,310  -->  00:07:41,160
Take care.
