1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:03,110
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:03,120  -->  00:00:09,390
It's time for us to start having some really cool fun or hey we have been having a lot of fun with commenting

3

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:14,160
having a lot of fun with this course but it's about time to hour some really cool features.

4

00:00:14,310  -->  00:00:18,510
I'm thinking right now that we should be adding features to the posts section.

5

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:18,990
All right.

6

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:25,980
So I already show you something like this in the demo video of discours song going to actually do it

7

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:27,120
with you.

8

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:29,660
We are going to be installing 3-D you or else.

9

00:00:29,660  -->  00:00:36,250
Well we're going to be creating free to you or else in our application we want your application.

10

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:43,380
You are able to look to have the name of the you are L instead of the ID.

11

00:00:43,380  -->  00:00:43,830
All right.

12

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:46,890
And that's why the pretty you are l feature is right.

13

00:00:47,040  -->  00:00:48,230
So that's what we're going to be doing.

14

00:00:48,360  -->  00:00:49,660
Alright cool.

15

00:00:49,930  -->  00:00:52,180
Right now I just created these polls a couple of minutes ago.

16

00:00:52,180  -->  00:00:58,650
So if you don't have no data in your application make sure that you have some data going to come here

17

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:03,480
and then to create a category here by awry.

18

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:05,610
Let's go to pose for a quick.

19

00:01:05,610  -->  00:01:06,450
We don't have to do this.

20

00:01:06,450  -->  00:01:10,550
I'm just doing this because I want to get an update this.

21

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:11,670
All right cool.

22

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:12,060
All right.

23

00:01:12,180  -->  00:01:25,860
So let's go to our one of my best friends here called Google and we are going to be looking for a package

24

00:01:25,880  -->  00:01:26,000
.

25

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:26,700
All right.

26

00:01:26,760  -->  00:01:31,170
And I'm sorry about my internet connection but I mean a hotspot.

27

00:01:31,790  -->  00:01:32,740
All right.

28

00:01:33,120  -->  00:01:35,540
And it's super slow.

29

00:01:35,540  -->  00:01:36,140
All right.

30

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:39,990
That's because I move to a new place.

31

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:51,710
And right now I don't not have my crazy Fahs 200 megabytes 200 down connection megabytes down connection

32

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:52,730
or high.

33

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:59,130
So I have a really really slow connection as you can see here but bear with me OK.

34

00:01:59,280  -->  00:02:05,970
So the package is going to be called Slogger bought by this gentleman right here as you can see him

35

00:02:05,970  -->  00:02:06,590
there.

36

00:02:06,870  -->  00:02:13,080
And let's go down and just follow the installation requirements so the first thing that we're going

37

00:02:13,080  -->  00:02:20,880
to be doing is we're going to be requiring a package price on his go to our terminal real quick and

38

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:22,540
we're going to place that in there.

39

00:02:22,560  -->  00:02:25,910
We got a click enter.

40

00:02:25,940  -->  00:02:29,880
I'm going to post the video because it's going to take a while and my side Bush should take one second

41

00:02:29,900  -->  00:02:30,350
.

42

00:02:30,750  -->  00:02:35,190
When you finished it when you see this finished for you.

43

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:35,880
All right.

44

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:38,330
For me it took a whole bunch of time.

45

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:40,000
Hopefully for you it can take that much.

46

00:02:40,030  -->  00:02:40,460
Right.

47

00:02:40,590  -->  00:02:42,070
So once the package is downloaded.

48

00:02:42,110  -->  00:02:48,890
All right you can verify this very simply by going to the post Jason.

49

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:56,760
So you come here and should be wearing here is making me look bad because I think I have to synchronize

50

00:02:56,780  -->  00:02:57,540
.

51

00:02:58,320  -->  00:02:59,700
All right.

52

00:03:00,600  -->  00:03:04,230
Well the package should be here somewhere.

53

00:03:04,800  -->  00:03:06,790
Do you have it has not synchronizing my side.

54

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:10,470
But but anyway should be required here in the second line.

55

00:03:10,470  -->  00:03:11,070
There you go.

56

00:03:11,100  -->  00:03:12,270
As you can see.

57

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:12,830
All right.

58

00:03:13,050  -->  00:03:14,640
So cool.

59

00:03:14,640  -->  00:03:17,210
So once we have that we have to go to config.

60

00:03:17,630  -->  00:03:19,450
So the config folder.

61

00:03:19,850  -->  00:03:28,190
It's come here actually and go to the app and we have to add that provider right here.

62

00:03:28,200  -->  00:03:32,660
So we go back to the page as you can see the providers right here.

63

00:03:32,860  -->  00:03:35,160
Now copy this.

64

00:03:35,160  -->  00:03:38,470
Come back here.

65

00:03:39,410  -->  00:03:42,280
For a dislike this page.

66

00:03:42,420  -->  00:03:42,960
There you go.

67

00:03:42,960  -->  00:03:45,810
And if you see that this is read somehow.

68

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:52,210
And as luggable key word or anything here it's because it has not been installed in the composer that

69

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:54,720
Jason should be all looking like this.

70

00:03:54,720  -->  00:03:57,060
That's if you're using of course BHB storm.

71

00:03:57,080  -->  00:03:59,170
Now we'll let you know.

72

00:03:59,240  -->  00:04:01,040
You know we'll let you know if it's installed or not.

73

00:04:01,080  -->  00:04:07,410
So this is a good sign because the you know it's not telling us that he's not installed he's telling

74

00:04:07,410  -->  00:04:09,310
us that something dire everything everything's good.

75

00:04:09,390  -->  00:04:10,480
All right cool.

76

00:04:10,650  -->  00:04:11,970
So what's the next step after this.

77

00:04:11,970  -->  00:04:20,360
Well we have to go to our polls and we are postmodern and we have to actually use this.

78

00:04:20,370  -->  00:04:21,090
All right.

79

00:04:21,360  -->  00:04:23,370
So let's go to our polls tomorrow.

80

00:04:23,370  -->  00:04:25,530
Let's minimize this.

81

00:04:26,370  -->  00:04:29,730
Let's go to our polls right here.

82

00:04:29,970  -->  00:04:38,180
Let's go all the way to the top and we have to use those classes so I'm going to paste them here.

83

00:04:38,610  -->  00:04:45,360
All right then we are going to be implementing this luggable interface.

84

00:04:45,360  -->  00:04:50,080
So we're going to implement that here.

85

00:04:50,120  -->  00:04:50,630
And

86

00:04:53,730  -->  00:04:55,980
basically copying what's on the page.

87

00:04:55,980  -->  00:04:58,800
All right guys like this.

88

00:04:58,830  -->  00:05:00,360
There we go.

89

00:05:00,360  -->  00:05:04,320
All right so we're using that tree right here.

90

00:05:04,320  -->  00:05:06,120
Basically that's class.

91

00:05:06,180  -->  00:05:06,690
All right.

92

00:05:06,690  -->  00:05:10,720
And then we have this property here with this array.

93

00:05:11,250  -->  00:05:17,250
And one thing that he's doing here basically saying I want you to grab the title every time you save

94

00:05:17,250  -->  00:05:21,240
it right and save it to the Slate column.

95

00:05:21,600  -->  00:05:22,100
All right.

96

00:05:22,260  -->  00:05:28,680
Now we're going to add another property here and this property if you will back here.

97

00:05:28,720  -->  00:05:36,060
This should be somewhere here right here so we can return some configuration and we are going to be

98

00:05:36,060  -->  00:05:38,610
returning an update.

99

00:05:38,610  -->  00:05:39,160
All right.

100

00:05:39,270  -->  00:05:45,610
Because right now if we do leave it the way it is every time we save a post.

101

00:05:45,780  -->  00:05:46,170
Yes.

102

00:05:46,180  -->  00:05:47,910
We're going to say this log.

103

00:05:48,540  -->  00:05:54,210
All right to the title to this blog column and we high fence.

104

00:05:54,210  -->  00:05:57,910
But the problem is that when you're doing update it won't do it.

105

00:05:57,990  -->  00:06:03,970
So if we got this update and we changed this to true.

106

00:06:04,140  -->  00:06:05,270
Now every time you update it.

107

00:06:05,280  -->  00:06:09,730
You also do the same thing as you're doing here when you're saving it.

108

00:06:09,810  -->  00:06:11,440
All right.

109

00:06:11,460  -->  00:06:14,750
That can trip people off a lot there.

110

00:06:14,790  -->  00:06:15,560
All right.

111

00:06:15,900  -->  00:06:16,130
All right.

112

00:06:16,140  -->  00:06:18,570
Let's see what else we've got to do here.

113

00:06:18,570  -->  00:06:20,820
All right.

114

00:06:21,060  -->  00:06:21,630
All right.

115

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:23,600
So.

116

00:06:25,230  -->  00:06:26,990
All right.

117

00:06:28,380  -->  00:06:28,680
All right.

118

00:06:28,680  -->  00:06:35,110
It doesn't say here wage actually does say here but we haven't done it.

119

00:06:35,160  -->  00:06:41,240
So we are going to be creating this slug column on migration.

120

00:06:41,250  -->  00:06:44,590
So let's go to database migrations.

121

00:06:44,910  -->  00:06:51,450
Let's go to our posts and here right below the title we can actually insert or we can actually create

122

00:06:51,450  -->  00:06:53,490
a new migration.

123

00:06:53,490  -->  00:06:59,400
So if you go back here and see if you already have data why you want to do is you want to use this command

124

00:06:59,390  -->  00:07:00,410
right here.

125

00:07:00,690  -->  00:07:04,250
Luggable semi-colon.

126

00:07:04,500  -->  00:07:11,340
Or call them table pulls the name of this SLOC column which is going to call a slog.

127

00:07:11,380  -->  00:07:12,050
All right.

128

00:07:12,240  -->  00:07:20,220
So let's go to a Ph.D. artisan artisan this use of Beechfield is in command instead of sort of that

129

00:07:20,220  -->  00:07:28,020
we're going to say is slog all right and then we're going to come here and we're going to do this to

130

00:07:28,020  -->  00:07:28,590
commence.

131

00:07:28,590  -->  00:07:32,800
Composer Don Portillo mph Fioricet and migrate.

132

00:07:32,820  -->  00:07:38,310
So that and then THP artists and I agree.

133

00:07:38,310  -->  00:07:40,000
I just wanted to show you.

134

00:07:40,080  -->  00:07:40,900
There we go.

135

00:07:40,920  -->  00:07:44,820
So we added that column there to our migration.

136

00:07:44,820  -->  00:07:49,750
So if you go to your BHB admin you should be able to see that.

137

00:07:49,770  -->  00:07:54,680
So let's go ahead and visit my ph be my admin and check it out.

138

00:07:54,820  -->  00:07:55,790
Right.

139

00:07:56,370  -->  00:07:57,420
So let's go.

140

00:07:57,430  -->  00:08:01,180
Called hacking our polls.

141

00:08:01,460  -->  00:08:03,420
And as you can see slugger's right here.

142

00:08:03,780  -->  00:08:04,440
All right.

143

00:08:04,440  -->  00:08:09,690
So once we have that configuration we should be ready to start creating pretty you or else.

144

00:08:09,680  -->  00:08:09,940
All right.

145

00:08:09,960  -->  00:08:12,830
So we're going to do that in the next lecture because these elections getting kind of along.

146

00:08:12,840  -->  00:08:13,350
All right.

147

00:08:13,350  -->  00:08:15,600
So let's have some more fun in the next lecture.

148

00:08:15,600  -->  00:08:18,610
Take care guys.
