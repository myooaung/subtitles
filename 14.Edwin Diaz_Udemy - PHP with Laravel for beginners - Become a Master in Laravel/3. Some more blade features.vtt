00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:02.090
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.100  -->  00:00:07.590
So let's keep having some more fun with blader I told you it was pretty fun to do this.

3

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:08.920
Lara Belstaff right.

4

00:00:08.920  -->  00:00:12.560
So you're seeing now the power of Lara.

5

00:00:12.580  -->  00:00:13.080
All right.

6

00:00:13.080  -->  00:00:13.940
Just a little bit.

7

00:00:13.950  -->  00:00:15.660
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

8

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:16.260
Right.

9

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:19.600
We haven't really encountered a really powerful features yet.

10

00:00:19.680  -->  00:00:22.950
You've got to fall in love with his framework and you're never going to leave it apart.

11

00:00:22.950  -->  00:00:28.230
Plus you got to learn so much here that you are going to be able to apply this knowledge in the real

12

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:30.740
world and make some serious cash.

13

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:33.690
And you know advancing your career so keep going.

14

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:37.410
Don't get discouraged and keep positive or right be happy.

15

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:37.870
All right.

16

00:00:38.070  -->  00:00:40.610
So let's go.

17

00:00:40.620  -->  00:00:46.950
And passing so mean some data to our views and process it.

18

00:00:46.980  -->  00:00:55.170
So let's say for example an impulse control here and let's create actually in contact.

19

00:00:55.500  -->  00:00:57.720
Let's just do something here.

20

00:00:57.720  -->  00:00:59.910
Let's just call this.

21

00:01:00.390  -->  00:01:02.890
I don't know people.

22

00:01:04.080  -->  00:01:04.940
All right.

23

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:08.270
And I'm going to pull myself in there of course.

24

00:01:08.640  -->  00:01:11.400
And Jose is always around.

25

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:15.390
And James and that guy is new.

26

00:01:15.720  -->  00:01:18.240
And Peter is always around in my courses.

27

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:20.130
What else is in my courses.

28

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:22.430
We go Metsi going here.

29

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:24.110
All right.

30

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:31.650
I'm not from Mexico guys but I love Mexico and I love every country out there that has beautiful people

31

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:32.830
like my students.

32

00:01:33.030  -->  00:01:33.690
But anyway.

33

00:01:33.780  -->  00:01:42.220
So let's pass in some information here let's do let's use our compact native ph function out function

34

00:01:42.780  -->  00:01:50.300
and let's pass and actually pass in people here.

35

00:01:50.490  -->  00:01:55.660
Very well people let's just do people like this.

36

00:01:55.700  -->  00:01:57.380
All right this is an array now right.

37

00:01:57.380  -->  00:01:59.240
We keep that in mind.

38

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:06.960
So this array is going to get passed on with all these values in here which is pretty cool.

39

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:10.270
You haven't seen that yet so I'm going to show you in a minute how that works.

40

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:13.220
So let's go to our post.

41

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:18.620
No actually our contact page and right on content.

42

00:02:18.700  -->  00:02:23.100
We're going to be doing here is explain all this information I know this contact page has nothing to

43

00:02:23.100  -->  00:02:25.310
do with what we're doing.

44

00:02:25.320  -->  00:02:28.070
But I just wanted to use as an example.

45

00:02:28.140  -->  00:02:34.050
So let's just use an if statement were blade at symbol.

46

00:02:34.050  -->  00:02:38.010
If so most of the stuff would blade is using our symbols.

47

00:02:38.220  -->  00:02:38.730
All right.

48

00:02:38.740  -->  00:02:44.520
This control structures or if statements or for loops.

49

00:02:44.580  -->  00:02:49.090
So if and then you ended up with another symbol.

50

00:02:49.140  -->  00:02:57.300
And if you can see MP HP storm there he gives you the rest of the functionalities or the functions are

51

00:02:57.300  -->  00:02:59.720
right which is pretty cool guys.

52

00:02:59.720  -->  00:03:00.350
All right.

53

00:03:00.450  -->  00:03:08.610
So and if so then I use the function count which is a native BHB function.

54

00:03:08.610  -->  00:03:11.100
I'm going to count the array.

55

00:03:11.280  -->  00:03:14.330
So if I have something in people.

56

00:03:14.450  -->  00:03:19.510
All right I'm going to use a for loop actually for each loop to loop through that.

57

00:03:19.530  -->  00:03:26.490
So I'm going to say for each I'm going to end this for each and for each You see how you just spell

58

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:29.420
things what you want to do.

59

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:30.750
All right.

60

00:03:30.810  -->  00:03:37.090
And I'm going to look through people as a person.

61

00:03:37.300  -->  00:03:38.460
All right.

62

00:03:38.940  -->  00:03:44.850
And I'm going to use the Allied tag and going do the curly brackets because that's how we echo things

63

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:56.100
out and going to see and I say person in here but let's make sure that we have the UL tag right here

64

00:03:56.100  -->  00:03:57.540
.

65

00:03:57.540  -->  00:03:58.190
All right.

66

00:03:58.500  -->  00:04:06.210
So right here and now if this variable has some type of data there we're going to display it right there

67

00:04:06.210  -->  00:04:06.230
.

68

00:04:06.230  -->  00:04:12.860
So that's going to be pretty fun right guys enter to get that.

69

00:04:12.990  -->  00:04:17.910
But we we still have this in the footer which is this script.

70

00:04:17.940  -->  00:04:19.690
So let's just comment that out.

71

00:04:19.980  -->  00:04:25.710
And I just selected everything and press command for SLAs or control for a slash and it would do that

72

00:04:25.710  -->  00:04:26.350
for me.

73

00:04:26.350  -->  00:04:30.010
As you can see we are echoing everything out.

74

00:04:30.040  -->  00:04:30.740
All right.

75

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:40.950
Now if I going into this now let's go to the post controller and just comment or this.

76

00:04:41.430  -->  00:04:47.220
And let's go back and click enter on the find very well people is looking for people but he doesn't

77

00:04:47.220  -->  00:04:51.340
find it all right in the US in the contact lead.

78

00:04:51.720  -->  00:04:52.050
All right.

79

00:04:52.100  -->  00:04:55.530
As you can see malicious.

80

00:04:55.560  -->  00:04:58.590
Well we're going to do is let's just leave it empty.

81

00:04:58.710  -->  00:04:59.510
All right.

82

00:04:59.580  -->  00:05:05.380
Like this or we don't get no errors now and enter not there.

83

00:05:05.940  -->  00:05:12.700
If we're put in anything here enter with this display some type of information.

84

00:05:12.750  -->  00:05:19.710
So I hope you see how useful our blade template template engine is which is pretty cool and we're going

85

00:05:19.710  -->  00:05:23.120
to be using this a lot when we are creating our application.

86

00:05:23.150  -->  00:05:23.960
Right.

87

00:05:24.000  -->  00:05:28.680
So make sure that you get this down.

88

00:05:29.060  -->  00:05:38.670
All right we also have include at include a right to include files in our application using this.

89

00:05:39.000  -->  00:05:40.940
Pretty cool stuff.

90

00:05:40.940  -->  00:05:44.640
All right there's a lot more information on the web about blate templating engine.

91

00:05:44.670  -->  00:05:48.720
If you want to look it up you're welcome to do it but you want to be learning a lot of stuff here in

92

00:05:48.720  -->  00:05:49.480
this course.

93

00:05:49.710  -->  00:05:52.230
Thank you again and I'll see you in the next lecture.

94

00:05:52.230  -->  00:05:54.500
Keep having fun guys keep coding.

95

00:05:54.510  -->  00:05:58.020
Doing some coffee and just have fun.

96

00:05:58.050  -->  00:05:58.440
