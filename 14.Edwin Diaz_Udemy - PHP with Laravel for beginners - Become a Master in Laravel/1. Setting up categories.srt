1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,680
All right.

2

00:00:00,680  -->  00:00:01,760
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,770  -->  00:00:06,540
This story is so sad for us to start creating some categories just to start getting things going right

4

00:00:06,550  -->  00:00:06,760
.

5

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:07,420
All right.

6

00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:15,090
Well actually we being having things going but we got to make them better now with categories.

7

00:00:15,090  -->  00:00:15,890
All right cool.

8

00:00:16,140  -->  00:00:18,810
Let's I actually create a category

9

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:25,020
controller so BHB Ortiz and make

10

00:00:27,450  -->  00:00:38,430
controller we give it a resource and we're going to say admen category

11

00:00:41,710  -->  00:00:43,020
controller.

12

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:45,080
That's a long name right.

13

00:00:45,480  -->  00:00:47,350
Ok cool.

14

00:00:48,210  -->  00:00:51,430
Let's go to route real quick and see with Guy anything there.

15

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:56,100
We don't.

16

00:00:56,460  -->  00:00:59,180
All right let's just copy one of these guys.

17

00:00:59,190  -->  00:01:01,800
Actually we don't have to call let's just write it down guys.

18

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:04,210
Stop being lazy.

19

00:01:04,760  -->  00:01:06,330
Right.

20

00:01:07,590  -->  00:01:20,890
So we're going to say when the user goes to admin categories they find all their stuff re admin Catholic

21

00:01:20,890  -->  00:01:24,070
horis controller.

22

00:01:25,150  -->  00:01:27,460
OK.

23

00:01:29,220  -->  00:01:34,950
Now let's go to the controller itself Ray.

24

00:01:35,920  -->  00:01:40,270
I mean synchronize my side here.

25

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:43,060
There we go.

26

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:49,360
And let's go to him that real quick return view

27

00:01:49,570  -->  00:01:57,600
.

28

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:05,880
Remember guys if you don't know the wrong name you can always look it up by doing BHB Ortiz en route

29

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:06,600
list.

30

00:02:06,600  -->  00:02:11,940
All right let's go to the resources

31

00:02:15,340  -->  00:02:16,760
main categories.

32

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:19,240
We already have an index there.

33

00:02:19,410  -->  00:02:22,080
Why don't we get something started here extends

34

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:30,070
and section

35

00:02:42,280  -->  00:02:48,490
let's just see categories here.

36

00:02:48,630  -->  00:02:49,820
All right.

37

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:51,750
Let's also

38

00:02:54,630  -->  00:03:00,480
fix this here.

39

00:03:05,580  -->  00:03:11,790
This is do admin this make it dynamic

40

00:03:17,610  -->  00:03:18,120
route

41

00:03:22,160  -->  00:03:22,880
men

42

00:03:26,000  -->  00:03:27,660
and it's

43

00:03:30,660  -->  00:03:32,670
in here would be they create one

44

00:03:35,460  -->  00:03:40,850
night on the right all that again.

45

00:03:40,850  -->  00:03:43,690
You right.

46

00:03:46,200  -->  00:03:49,190
All right cool.

47

00:03:51,540  -->  00:03:55,000
All right.

48

00:03:55,400  -->  00:03:56,230
All right.

49

00:03:56,370  -->  00:03:58,290
I think we're set up here.

50

00:03:58,500  -->  00:04:01,500
All right on the next lecture we're going to start working on the controller.

51

00:04:01,950  -->  00:04:05,750
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
