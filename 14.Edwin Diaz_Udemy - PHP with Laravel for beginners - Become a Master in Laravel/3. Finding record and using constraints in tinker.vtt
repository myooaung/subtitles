00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.490
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.490  -->  00:00:08.110
A student is forced to start reading information using thinker from the database right.

3

00:00:08.160  -->  00:00:10.160
So now make sure I'm going to get out of here.

4

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:14.820
But make sure that you are inside a folder called see a mass for this to work if not it's not going

5

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:15.600
to work.

6

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:18.290
BHB artist and thinker.

7

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:18.840
There we go.

8

00:00:18.840  -->  00:00:23.490
Now we are inside think we can clear these out and when we got to see this all we're going to see these

9

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:24.490
little arrows here.

10

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:25.740
All right.

11

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:32.650
So how do we first let's find a post actually.

12

00:00:32.650  -->  00:00:37.490
We're going to be reading information so let's find the post and hold that in this variable.

13

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:38.280
Right.

14

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:41.530
So pause like this.

15

00:00:41.730  -->  00:00:48.930
And a fine number 6 answer as you can see this is post number cits.

16

00:00:48.960  -->  00:00:50.250
That's it.

17

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:52.350
That's how we can read the information from the database.

18

00:00:52.350  -->  00:00:52.950
OK.

19

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:56.740
Now you can also do constraints here.

20

00:00:56.850  -->  00:00:57.590
All right.

21

00:00:57.930  -->  00:01:06.720
So you can do this find sets OK and or you can say where

22

00:01:10.060  -->  00:01:12.160
can you use the word statement.

23

00:01:12.480  -->  00:01:14.340
And you can say where.

24

00:01:14.340  -->  00:01:21.580
I don't know where Id sits.

25

00:01:21.690  -->  00:01:27.840
And then what you've got to do here is to first enter and then you can pull that object and do all the

26

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:28.550
things with it.

27

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:30.200
All right.

28

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:32.770
Pretty cool stuff right.

29

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:34.650
You can also do.

30

00:01:34.860  -->  00:01:37.720
I'll show you right now and you can do this thing route's aswell.

31

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:46.050
So instead of doing the second argument you can say where ID equals cits

32

00:01:48.530  -->  00:01:53.180
answer and you can see we got the same article again.

33

00:01:54.420  -->  00:01:55.000
All right.

34

00:01:55.230  -->  00:01:59.880
So there are many different ways of pulling this object here and it's just not think or this is Eloqua

35

00:01:59.910  -->  00:02:02.460
helping us pull the information out.

36

00:02:02.730  -->  00:02:04.600
And that way we can do all the things with it.

37

00:02:04.610  -->  00:02:05.130
All right.

38

00:02:05.260  -->  00:02:08.610
But anyway thank you so much for watching the selection the next lecture I'm going to show you how to

39

00:02:08.610  -->  00:02:11.810
update and how to delete data.

40

00:02:11.820  -->  00:02:12.600
Thanks
