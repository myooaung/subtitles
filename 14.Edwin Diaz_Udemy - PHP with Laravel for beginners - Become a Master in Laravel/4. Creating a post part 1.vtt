00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.750
All right.

2

00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:03.400
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:03.660  -->  00:00:08.700
So we have this base set up here and we're going to be setting up their replies in a minute.

4

00:00:08.700  -->  00:00:12.880
Well maybe in a couple of lectures but I just wanted to set this up really quick.

5

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:18.450
Now one thing to keep in mind is that we don't even have a pulse yet to see.

6

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:19.190
All right.

7

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:23.020
So let's set that up so that we can start tweeting comments right.

8

00:00:23.070  -->  00:00:27.260
I got a special file I want you to download.

9

00:00:27.630  -->  00:00:34.270
It's going to be called and that is if I remember it's block files that zipped.

10

00:00:34.460  -->  00:00:36.880
Make sure that you download in this lecture.

11

00:00:36.880  -->  00:00:37.200
All right.

12

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:42.090
Is going to have 2000 PSI or we could have more but it's on you're watching this.

13

00:00:42.410  -->  00:00:50.010
But it's going to have a file called See block home and blog post.

14

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:50.480
All right.

15

00:00:50.520  -->  00:00:54.600
That's what we're going to have inside and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be copying

16

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:54.690
.

17

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:57.440
We're going to create massive pages for this.

18

00:00:57.810  -->  00:01:01.760
And as a matter of fact we don't have to create a massive page but it would be nice.

19

00:01:01.800  -->  00:01:04.740
So that way we can keep that clean we keep the views clean.

20

00:01:04.740  -->  00:01:05.510
Right.

21

00:01:05.520  -->  00:01:10.620
So let's do that let's create some massive pages for blog at home and blog post the blog home is where

22

00:01:10.620  -->  00:01:16.390
we're going to have your posts and the blog post is the single post page.

23

00:01:16.440  -->  00:01:26.430
So let's do this real quick views layouts and right here we're going to create a new file and this is

24

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:29.920
going to be called the blog home.

25

00:01:30.300  -->  00:01:31.200
All right.

26

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:33.990
And the other one is blog post

27

00:01:37.430  -->  00:01:40.680
you like this.

28

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:41.620
All right cool.

29

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:48.690
And let's do the blog one first.

30

00:01:48.900  -->  00:01:51.570
And just when I up in here guys right there.

31

00:01:51.900  -->  00:02:02.130
And a copy of that and pasted it in blog home OK and a blog post that they sent in them.

32

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:02.970
Take that off

33

00:02:05.920  -->  00:02:10.970
a copy of that and now pasted in there.

34

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:16.370
That said only that we're going to start replacing a lot of this stuff here too.

35

00:02:16.680  -->  00:02:20.110
So keep that in mind.

36

00:02:20.160  -->  00:02:22.240
Another thing that we have to create we have to create.

37

00:02:22.260  -->  00:02:24.070
Like I said the polls right.

38

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:29.680
So let me just take this out of here.

39

00:02:29.790  -->  00:02:30.280
All right.

40

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:37.920
So let's create that view real quick because we don't even have a post for this application resources

41

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:39.050
view.

42

00:02:39.640  -->  00:02:41.690
We will have a post.

43

00:02:41.850  -->  00:02:48.710
So lead post.

44

00:02:48.780  -->  00:02:51.030
All right.

45

00:02:51.030  -->  00:03:03.390
So this is going to extend the layouts that blog post.

46

00:03:03.390  -->  00:03:04.660
All right.

47

00:03:05.850  -->  00:03:11.470
And we should create a blog a blog page here if you wanted to.

48

00:03:11.530  -->  00:03:13.070
We're going to deal with that later.

49

00:03:13.080  -->  00:03:18.720
The probably could be like next for features on thing and that's pretty easy to do as a matter of fact

50

00:03:19.050  -->  00:03:20.280
.

51

00:03:20.390  -->  00:03:24.100
How you guys know that will create a leader that's fine let's just leave it that way.

52

00:03:24.150  -->  00:03:31.620
Let's just finish this commenting stuff first section and content

53

00:03:35.070  -->  00:03:37.130
and stop

54

00:03:41.760  -->  00:03:51.810
just for now post because right now we have to create some type of route and the controller for this

55

00:03:51.810  -->  00:03:52.350
right.

56

00:03:52.590  -->  00:03:58.200
Well not a controller we can use this in polls but we need within a row in the polls control that we

57

00:03:58.200  -->  00:03:59.050
can use that.

58

00:03:59.490  -->  00:04:08.220
Let's create a roll real quick so as we go and our role should be public.

59

00:04:08.220  -->  00:04:13.500
All right so we have a bunch of letters out here.

60

00:04:13.540  -->  00:04:17.290
We have admin that we need to take here.

61

00:04:19.210  -->  00:04:27.930
So let's hope this year we'll fix this later.

62

00:04:27.950  -->  00:04:36.690
But right now we need a post so let's create a right here so route get

63

00:04:40.260  -->  00:04:44.090
post and we're going to pass an I.D. right.

64

00:04:45.120  -->  00:04:48.260
That's what we're going to do.

65

00:04:48.670  -->  00:04:50.380
Function.

66

00:04:51.480  -->  00:04:53.010
And then we can pass in the

67

00:04:56.170  -->  00:05:02.460
Nepos view we could do it here or we could take it to the controller.

68

00:05:02.460  -->  00:05:03.390
It's up to you.

69

00:05:03.690  -->  00:05:07.540
Let's do a here now and then later on we can change it.

70

00:05:08.160  -->  00:05:17.460
As a matter of fact let's take it to the view let's take it to the view because if we do it here then

71

00:05:17.460  -->  00:05:20.880
we have to passing a lot of data here and I don't want to do that.

72

00:05:21.210  -->  00:05:32.080
So controller so we're going to save posts for let's check the controller name real quick.

73

00:05:32.520  -->  00:05:35.190
Admen pulse controller

74

00:05:35.600  -->  00:05:41.640
.

75

00:05:43.910  -->  00:05:47.110
We go that we got to give it a minute.

76

00:05:47.730  -->  00:05:51.270
So we're going to say we're going to be at post.

77

00:05:51.300  -->  00:05:52.230
All right.

78

00:05:52.230  -->  00:05:57.920
So let's go to the admin here.

79

00:06:00.090  -->  00:06:01.830
Public Function post

80

00:06:10.100  -->  00:06:10.560
it

81

00:06:15.550  -->  00:06:19.810
works.

82

00:06:20.000  -->  00:06:23.210
All right so we're going to continue this a little bit more on the next lecture.

83

00:06:23.220  -->  00:06:23.800
OK.

84

00:06:23.850  -->  00:06:24.390
All right.

85

00:06:24.480  -->  00:06:25.000
Perfect.

86

00:06:25.140  -->  00:06:26.450
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.

87

00:06:26.460  -->  00:06:27.590
Bye bye.
