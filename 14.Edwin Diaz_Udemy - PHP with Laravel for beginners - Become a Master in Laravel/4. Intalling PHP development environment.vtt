00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:03.160
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:03.170  -->  00:00:11.370
So it's time for all to install Zahm on the Macintosh arrived the steps to install Zahm in a Macintosh

3

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:16.540
are very very similar to a Windows computer as a matter of fact almost identical.

4

00:00:16.560  -->  00:00:17.080
All right.

5

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:23.790
So all you have to do is go to Apache Franks Dagworthy I believe that's the day you Arel that you French

6

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:24.180
.

7

00:00:24.510  -->  00:00:25.250
Let's go.

8

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:25.780
Zap.

9

00:00:25.790  -->  00:00:32.350
And again if you have map lamp or whatever or their local environment BHB you're welcome to use.

10

00:00:32.350  -->  00:00:34.320
I'm just going to use them up on this course.

11

00:00:34.320  -->  00:00:34.830
All right.

12

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:36.180
I find it very useful.

13

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:38.730
Some of you may have issues with it that's fine.

14

00:00:38.730  -->  00:00:39.880
You can install something else.

15

00:00:39.880  -->  00:00:40.350
All right.

16

00:00:40.500  -->  00:00:49.380
So we're going to download BHB 7 for OS X right here.

17

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:51.620
Just download it just like you did.

18

00:00:51.840  -->  00:00:54.170
Some of you did for Windows.

19

00:00:54.180  -->  00:00:55.140
All right.

20

00:00:55.460  -->  00:01:00.040
And and then install it very simple just follow everything by default.

21

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:06.990
And if you want to check that Nazmi option you can so I'm just going to click on it real quick here

22

00:01:07.560  -->  00:01:14.430
and then double click it then open and type in whatever password i have for this user.

23

00:01:14.430  -->  00:01:14.970
All right.

24

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:18.630
And then he's going to install I started the wizard.

25

00:01:18.840  -->  00:01:20.330
Or I just get away a little bit.

26

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:22.930
It's going to show something about it enemy.

27

00:01:23.100  -->  00:01:23.850
There we go.

28

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:24.730
Developer files.

29

00:01:24.730  -->  00:01:25.730
That's OK.

30

00:01:25.770  -->  00:01:27.330
Now it's on.

31

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:34.140
Check this nadis and you can even check if you want to find out more about big Nazmi.

32

00:01:34.140  -->  00:01:34.470
All right.

33

00:01:34.470  -->  00:01:35.760
But I don't.

34

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:44.130
So once it installs then you're going to have zap available around just kind of cancel it out because

35

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:45.910
I already have it.

36

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:49.420
All right but just follow everything by default and you should be OK.

37

00:01:49.420  -->  00:01:53.910
All right then when once you finished to know that it is working all you have to do is go to your local

38

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:57.480
host local host enter.

39

00:01:57.620  -->  00:01:59.100
Whoops.

40

00:01:59.910  -->  00:02:05.490
All right before we do that let's make sure once you install a launch control panel it gives you the

41

00:02:05.490  -->  00:02:09.100
option to launch if it doesn't give you the option to launch a control panel.

42

00:02:09.120  -->  00:02:10.840
You can find it decem control panel.

43

00:02:10.830  -->  00:02:13.200
Let's go to other.

44

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:19.260
And you're going to see this manager or assets here or you might have to type in your password.

45

00:02:19.260  -->  00:02:21.660
Some of you I don't need to do that.

46

00:02:21.960  -->  00:02:28.290
And then you can go here to manage servers and then you can go start and start and that's going to start

47

00:02:28.770  -->  00:02:36.600
your Zahm installation now you can also find there by going to applications and then you go to Zahm

48

00:02:36.600  -->  00:02:40.520
here and you can find that manager right here you see that.

49

00:02:40.560  -->  00:02:42.280
All right super simple to do.

50

00:02:42.390  -->  00:02:46.950
So now right here this is your local Horsa if you type in localhost you've got to get this dashboard

51

00:02:46.950  -->  00:02:54.580
here if you have this or your screen looks similar to this and you have a Welkom zap window here.

52

00:02:54.810  -->  00:02:57.530
Then everything went OK.

53

00:02:57.640  -->  00:03:00.350
All right everything is working now right.

54

00:03:00.630  -->  00:03:04.900
Your zombie solution might be different from mine I already had zap installed.

55

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:10.920
If you go back you can see that your zem installation my look will be different than mine.

56

00:03:10.920  -->  00:03:16.840
This is a five point six nineteen point six 12.

57

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:17.700
All right.

58

00:03:18.180  -->  00:03:21.530
So this is for Windows.

59

00:03:21.540  -->  00:03:23.130
This is the as.

60

00:03:23.160  -->  00:03:24.930
Let's check it out right here.

61

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:26.480
All right.

62

00:03:27.120  -->  00:03:28.300
So different versions there.

63

00:03:28.330  -->  00:03:28.850
Right.

64

00:03:28.860  -->  00:03:32.040
But anyway already has them installed and that's what I got.

65

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:35.010
But your version might be a little different than mine.

66

00:03:35.010  -->  00:03:40.170
I'm going to include with all these versions there but I'm going to make sure that I have the latest

67

00:03:40.210  -->  00:03:41.060
BHB right.

68

00:03:41.070  -->  00:03:45.590
So I'm going to click on this right here and you can see that he says that I have zero zap.

69

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:48.490
Seven point zero point four.

70

00:03:48.510  -->  00:03:55.890
So if you go back here you can see that I have the latest version of Zap just my index that BHP says

71

00:03:55.980  -->  00:03:57.630
something else.

72

00:03:57.630  -->  00:03:58.170
All right.

73

00:03:58.170  -->  00:04:00.790
So don't worry about this I have to update my index.

74

00:04:00.820  -->  00:04:03.720
BHB that's because I've been messing around with it files.

75

00:04:03.930  -->  00:04:07.720
But I I have the latest zapping store as you can see right here.

76

00:04:07.740  -->  00:04:10.210
All right I just have to change my end that's for some reason.

77

00:04:10.290  -->  00:04:18.270
But you should have Zahm seven point something there or whatever version of BHB is the latest.

78

00:04:18.270  -->  00:04:18.590
All right.

79

00:04:18.590  -->  00:04:24.470
I'm going to include in this camp seven 7.0 zero point four in the exercise file.

80

00:04:24.480  -->  00:04:27.690
So that way you can also do everything exactly like me.

81

00:04:27.690  -->  00:04:28.400
All right.

82

00:04:28.560  -->  00:04:30.440
If you want to if you decide to.

83

00:04:30.510  -->  00:04:34.110
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

84

00:04:34.110  -->  00:04:35.020
Take care.
