00:00:00,130  -->  00:00:02,730
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,760  -->  00:00:08,730
So it's tough for us to start creating some routes just to make our application a little bit just to

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:10,670
have something more right to it.

4

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:11,210
All right.

5

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:15,720
But anyway let's go to our HTP routes.

6

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:20,950
And here we have some default routes already with home controller and all this.

7

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:24,910
You probably have one or two there but that's OK.

8

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:25,620
All right.

9

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:26,630
We don't have a group.

10

00:00:26,640  -->  00:00:34,110
We can't create a route group to actually group our controllers here are our routes and we're going

11

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:35,250
to do that as a matter of fact.

12

00:00:35,250  -->  00:00:40,890
But I want you to actually get an idea of what we're going to be doing so we're going to create instead

13

00:00:40,890  -->  00:00:47,640
of doing a GET requests and then doing a poultry ques you know and it's just a waste of time.

14

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:52,070
Let's do a resource that creates all of our routes for us.

15

00:00:52,070  -->  00:00:52,780
All right.

16

00:00:53,040  -->  00:00:56,070
So we got to think about it about a little bit.

17

00:00:56,070  -->  00:01:01,580
How can we or what kind of routes do we want for admin.

18

00:01:01,880  -->  00:01:02,550
All right.

19

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:06,430
Do we want to have something like admin users.

20

00:01:06,690  -->  00:01:08,520
Does that look good to you.

21

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:14,070
We could if we wanted to create a role for admin like this users.

22

00:01:14,070  -->  00:01:15,000
All right.

23

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:20,840
And then for others we could actually do this author so that we know these are not there right.

24

00:01:21,030  -->  00:01:28,340
And then we can say users or other polls because the author is now going to have users.

25

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:29,940
All right so I think this looks good.

26

00:01:29,930  -->  00:01:33,900
Right so that was the script there from where that user is at that time.

27

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:35,670
All right let's do it like that we could.

28

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:38,020
I really like this approach.

29

00:01:38,480  -->  00:01:39,160
Right.

30

00:01:39,480  -->  00:01:44,700
Because we really don't need to add meaning here and let people know that it is an admin but just for

31

00:01:44,700  -->  00:01:47,270
demonstration purposes only We're going to do very.

32

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:56,300
We're going to do a very simple simply like this or I admin and we're going to create the users for

33

00:01:56,300  -->  00:01:57,800
us.

34

00:01:57,870  -->  00:01:58,230
All right.

35

00:01:58,230  -->  00:02:02,220
And this is going to a controller which we don't have and we're going to create right now.

36

00:02:02,400  -->  00:02:06,110
So this is going to users controller

37

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:15,450
and we could actually make it more that it makes more sense and then admin users controllers.

38

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:16,590
All right.

39

00:02:16,590  -->  00:02:23,040
So let's go ahead and create this control let's take thinker out of here.

40

00:02:23,040  -->  00:02:25,530
All right let's just do it like this.

41

00:02:25,630  -->  00:02:27,920
All right.

42

00:02:28,020  -->  00:02:34,320
So BHB areason and we're going to do this make controller

43

00:02:37,080  -->  00:02:42,930
we're going to say let's make sure that he has a resource that means the crowd read.

44

00:02:42,950  -->  00:02:53,640
They read all the methods and it's called the admin user's controller.

45

00:02:53,870  -->  00:02:54,180
All right.

46

00:02:54,190  -->  00:02:54,750
That is good.

47

00:02:54,750  -->  00:03:01,860
Let's check it out real quick to see if.

48

00:03:01,910  -->  00:03:02,270
All right.

49

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:06,130
So we have everything here that we need.

50

00:03:06,170  -->  00:03:07,160
All right.

51

00:03:07,470  -->  00:03:09,100
Beautiful guys right.

52

00:03:09,630  -->  00:03:10,630
He beat it.

53

00:03:10,630  -->  00:03:16,370
This actually doing a lot of the guys he really beats doing procedure right or doing the stuff manually

54

00:03:16,380  -->  00:03:17,660
right.

55

00:03:17,880  -->  00:03:20,660
This thing is awesome.

56

00:03:20,670  -->  00:03:21,400
All right.

57

00:03:21,660  -->  00:03:25,740
Anyway let's actually.

58

00:03:25,740  -->  00:03:26,080
All right.

59

00:03:26,160  -->  00:03:27,520
So I think we're good now.

60

00:03:27,540  -->  00:03:29,840
We have created our route here.

61

00:03:29,850  -->  00:03:35,730
All right later on we're going to create a group just to make sure that all of the admins are in there

62

00:03:36,130  -->  00:03:43,470
and have a middleware for admins and their routes for the alters have middleware for others and so on

63

00:03:43,470  -->  00:03:44,080
and so on.

64

00:03:44,090  -->  00:03:44,570
Right.

65

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:48,360
But anyway I think we're done with this here and I'll see you in the next lecture.

66

00:03:48,360  -->  00:03:49,440
Take care.
