1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,150
All right welcome back a student so we got the right group here.

2

00:00:04,230  -->  00:00:11,340
We got everything set up except that we need to set up our admin class of course are made aware and

3

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:13,900
we also have to set up our.

4

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:20,180
I was thinking about creating We could if we wanted to do all the logic here.

5

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:24,080
But you know I don't want to feel the same with a lot of logic.

6

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:28,150
A lot of stuff I like to also create.

7

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:35,840
I like to create a class here a method is admin method that will actually detected the users and a meaning

8

00:00:35,850  -->  00:00:37,030
shared or not.

9

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:38,490
So that's what I'd like to do.

10

00:00:38,490  -->  00:00:38,720
All right.

11

00:00:38,730  -->  00:00:41,920
Let's actually create a here and then we'll take it over there.

12

00:00:41,970  -->  00:00:42,460
OK.

13

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:53,320
So let's All right let's do a public function and let's just call this admin.

14

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:55,290
There are a couple ways of doing this.

15

00:00:55,290  -->  00:01:01,320
You know you can pass in the role of the user and validated through here if you want to create a function

16

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:04,740
that could do that for the rest of the.

17

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:12,420
You can make something like this check roll and then pass the roll and do all your validation there

18

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:12,720
.

19

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:15,840
I'm going to try to keep it simple and just give you an idea.

20

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:18,850
So if you want to do it like that you can it's up to you.

21

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:26,440
I'm going to do it like this because like I said I'm creating discourse in a long way the heart in the

22

00:01:26,440  -->  00:01:33,540
way that gives you space for you to think critically about how you want your application and how you

23

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:34,620
want your code to be.

24

00:01:34,620  -->  00:01:35,040
All right.

25

00:01:35,040  -->  00:01:40,140
I'm just giving you the guidance I'm guiding you through how he's done I'm teaching you.

26

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:43,020
But I'm also giving your space to be creative.

27

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:43,340
All right.

28

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:44,710
Hopefully that makes sense.

29

00:01:44,940  -->  00:01:52,060
But anyway so we're going to say if this role and we are in use are right.

30

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:54,300
So yes.

31

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:55,830
So we have a

32

00:01:58,620  -->  00:02:00,230
role right here.

33

00:02:00,230  -->  00:02:05,140
We can use this as a property instead of using it like this right.

34

00:02:05,160  -->  00:02:06,780
We can use it like this.

35

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:17,370
So if their own name is equal to Administrator guys if you having issues with all this O.P. That's because

36

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:21,900
you need a little bit more all the foundation of your into programming foundation I suggest for you

37

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:27,570
to take my older course on object oriented programming so you can get a foundation and then after you

38

00:02:27,570  -->  00:02:29,160
take that then you can come here.

39

00:02:29,160  -->  00:02:36,630
All right I just I just wanted to make sure that you're not having issues just in case if you are that's

40

00:02:36,630  -->  00:02:38,100
why you need more foundation.

41

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:43,020
So if we find an administrator we're going to Eckl Well we're going to return true if we're going to

42

00:02:43,020  -->  00:02:46,550
return false call.

43

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:47,340
You're right.

44

00:02:47,880  -->  00:02:54,750
So let's go to out me real quick and here we're going to check to see if and when I do a couple of alleviations

45

00:02:54,750  -->  00:02:55,560
here.

46

00:02:55,950  -->  00:03:04,990
If the low end user that's what we've got to do because we don't want this user to be now logged in

47

00:03:04,990  -->  00:03:05,090
.

48

00:03:05,090  -->  00:03:05,280
Right.

49

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:10,230
So we're going to do this validation and we also going to include even though the value that I'll show

50

00:03:10,230  -->  00:03:11,160
you right now what we doing.

51

00:03:11,310  -->  00:03:14,160
So we're going to check if the user is logged in.

52

00:03:14,210  -->  00:03:16,560
That's ok I already show you how to do that right.

53

00:03:16,770  -->  00:03:21,840
And then we're going to do another validation we're going to say if they or the user

54

00:03:24,540  -->  00:03:28,990
is going to use our function or method.

55

00:03:29,700  -->  00:03:30,290
OK.

56

00:03:30,480  -->  00:03:36,510
Make sure that you include this off glass top here.

57

00:03:36,750  -->  00:03:38,140
It's facade.

58

00:03:39,210  -->  00:03:39,810
And

59

00:03:42,430  -->  00:03:45,000
we've got to say return the net requests.

60

00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:47,040
So that means everything went through.

61

00:03:47,670  -->  00:03:52,220
Go to the next request of the application array.

62

00:03:53,100  -->  00:03:54,300
If for some reason

63

00:03:57,210  -->  00:04:02,010
this user was not logged in or something

64

00:04:05,500  -->  00:04:12,270
returned to I don't know somewhere where she is returning we can actually even give them 4 or 4 page

65

00:04:12,270  -->  00:04:21,150
if we wanted to know or we can take them back to the intended place actually not intended redirect them

66

00:04:21,150  -->  00:04:22,590
back to a four or four page.

67

00:04:22,590  -->  00:04:26,820
As a matter of fact it's time for me to show you how to create a 4 or 4 page.

68

00:04:26,830  -->  00:04:27,510
All right.

69

00:04:27,630  -->  00:04:32,110
We could redirect them to actually the home page.

70

00:04:32,610  -->  00:04:33,240
We wanted to.

71

00:04:33,240  -->  00:04:38,090
Let me show you how to create a forum for Bache and this is why you can't miss any lectures.

72

00:04:38,140  -->  00:04:43,890
I don't I stress this very much because as you can see right now I'm showing you a different technique

73

00:04:44,310  -->  00:04:47,430
that I'm not going to create a whole lecture for it is super easy.

74

00:04:47,580  -->  00:04:51,860
So I'm going to show you how to create a four four page real quick a custom 4:4 page.

75

00:04:51,870  -->  00:04:59,160
Let's go to resources views errors in here you can see that we already have a file three page or we

76

00:04:59,160  -->  00:05:07,030
have to do is create a four or four page Antar done.

77

00:05:07,140  -->  00:05:08,420
That's it.

78

00:05:08,430  -->  00:05:16,770
Now if for some reason costume for forbit you for some reason you have a page that is now found in your

79

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:19,600
application is going to go to this page right here.

80

00:05:19,620  -->  00:05:19,940
All right.

81

00:05:19,950  -->  00:05:24,780
So let's let's actually do it and show you.

82

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:31,340
So let's say you want to go to I don't know profile profiles.

83

00:05:31,360  -->  00:05:32,760
Look at this.

84

00:05:32,880  -->  00:05:33,420
All right.

85

00:05:33,420  -->  00:05:35,080
So don't miss any lecture you don't.

86

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:37,140
You never know what you're going to learn in the next one.

87

00:05:37,140  -->  00:05:39,420
All right cool.

88

00:05:39,420  -->  00:05:42,770
All right so let's go back here.

89

00:05:42,780  -->  00:05:43,270
All right.

90

00:05:43,410  -->  00:05:45,120
So we're good to go here guys.

91

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:50,370
Let's actually try to log in.

92

00:05:50,370  -->  00:05:52,020
We can see the Jose right now.

93

00:05:52,020  -->  00:05:55,010
Let's see what title is he on.

94

00:05:55,020  -->  00:05:57,650
Jose is a.

95

00:05:58,620  -->  00:06:00,960
All right.

96

00:06:01,650  -->  00:06:04,260
Let's make sure that we are implementing this correctly.

97

00:06:04,260  -->  00:06:06,540
As a matter of fact we're going to leave it for the next lecture OK.

98

00:06:06,540  -->  00:06:08,040
We're going to test this out in the next election.

99

00:06:08,040  -->  00:06:09,220
Make sure it's working.

100

00:06:09,310  -->  00:06:13,170
All right now we've got this far with this.

101

00:06:13,200  -->  00:06:15,760
We are not tested at all on the next lecture.

102

00:06:15,870  -->  00:06:17,550
OK.

103

00:06:17,580  -->  00:06:19,870
And we're going to review how everything is working.

104

00:06:19,920  -->  00:06:23,880
Basically I just said sent in twice but I show you how to do a 4 or 4 page.

105

00:06:23,880  -->  00:06:24,620
All right.

106

00:06:24,780  -->  00:06:27,690
Anyway thank you so much you guys and I'll see you in the next lecture
