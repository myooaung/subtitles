00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.350
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:04.460
So I think we are doing pretty good improvement here.

3

00:00:04.490  -->  00:00:06.600
And not just improvement I mean progress.

4

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:07.280
All right.

5

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:09.000
We are progressing through the course.

6

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:10.740
Very good very rapidly.

7

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:14.050
The more do we do this stuff the easier it gets right.

8

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:14.880
OK.

9

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:17.180
So now what's next.

10

00:00:17.190  -->  00:00:22.520
Well we have to create post functionalities working pretty good right.

11

00:00:23.070  -->  00:00:26.160
It's time for us to go and edit the post.

12

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:27.030
All right.

13

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:31.430
So let's go and do this.

14

00:00:31.530  -->  00:00:32.600
We have the edit.

15

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:38.550
Let's go to Adam impulse controller real quick and here we're going to you returning the view.

16

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:40.250
Right.

17

00:00:41.020  -->  00:00:51.680
And we're going to say ad men that are men that pose that it would go.

18

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:55.510
All right let's find the pause first right.

19

00:00:56.370  -->  00:01:02.160
Before we do anything let's just say post fine or fail.

20

00:01:03.550  -->  00:01:04.480
All right.

21

00:01:04.650  -->  00:01:07.680
So once we find the polls we pass it in.

22

00:01:07.680  -->  00:01:09.850
All right.

23

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:12.360
Here we go.

24

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:13.880
All right cool.

25

00:01:13.890  -->  00:01:21.620
Now let's go and let's go to resources pose an added beach.

26

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:22.110
All right.

27

00:01:22.290  -->  00:01:26.360
So we already have something very similar to what we won on the edit page.

28

00:01:26.400  -->  00:01:32.460
So let's go to that create and copy and paste it there.

29

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:36.390
Now let's change a couple of things here real quick.

30

00:01:36.390  -->  00:01:40.730
This should be very easy for you guys but I'm going to do it with you.

31

00:01:41.000  -->  00:01:49.490
So the way you guys are used to it change the model to this.

32

00:01:49.910  -->  00:01:52.880
And they're open to model.

33

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:54.110
That's what I meant.

34

00:01:54.540  -->  00:01:55.630
Let's do this.

35

00:01:55.680  -->  00:01:57.890
Hear what else we need to change.

36

00:01:58.020  -->  00:02:03.380
The Post will make it Patch.

37

00:02:03.730  -->  00:02:04.860
All right.

38

00:02:04.920  -->  00:02:06.510
We need to close this out

39

00:02:06.530  -->  00:02:13.850
.

40

00:02:15.560  -->  00:02:19.130
Right.

41

00:02:21.230  -->  00:02:26.080
We can do the polls ID right here.

42

00:02:26.950  -->  00:02:28.390
OK.

43

00:02:28.550  -->  00:02:30.840
And this should be a camera right here.

44

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:31.290
All right.

45

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:32.810
What else.

46

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:35.080
This is looking good.

47

00:02:35.700  -->  00:02:39.870
All right.

48

00:02:43.410  -->  00:02:44.210
All right cool.

49

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:45.190
Let's check it out.

50

00:02:45.300  -->  00:02:50.200
Oh and another thing that we need is we need to put something to go to that page right.

51

00:02:50.460  -->  00:02:55.400
So let's make it so that way every time we click the name he goes to that page.

52

00:02:55.440  -->  00:03:04.840
So let's go to the end it's a quick and right on the title not on the title and the name.

53

00:03:05.100  -->  00:03:09.590
We're going to put a link that take us there.

54

00:03:09.810  -->  00:03:10.700
All right.

55

00:03:10.890  -->  00:03:14.210
So let's use the round function that is super useful right.

56

00:03:14.790  -->  00:03:16.160
Right.

57

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:21.840
And we're going to say amend that pulls at it.

58

00:03:22.090  -->  00:03:26.010
And we got to pass a parameter with 80.

59

00:03:26.370  -->  00:03:27.080
All right cool.

60

00:03:27.390  -->  00:03:30.450
Let's check it out real quick.

61

00:03:30.480  -->  00:03:30.900
All right.

62

00:03:30.920  -->  00:03:33.600
Enter on support over Antibes.

63

00:03:33.600  -->  00:03:36.000
We need to take that all from there.

64

00:03:36.000  -->  00:03:40.480
All right here we go.

65

00:03:41.440  -->  00:03:44.900
Enter the variable categories.

66

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:46.190
OK we're not passing the categories.

67

00:03:46.200  -->  00:03:48.690
Let's go past the categories as well.

68

00:03:48.690  -->  00:03:59.940
Let's go to them and controller malicious categories and category

69

00:04:05.130  -->  00:04:12.570
name and ID right.

70

00:04:13.190  -->  00:04:16.340
Pass Pasadena right here.

71

00:04:18.390  -->  00:04:23.070
I think we're forgetting all right here.

72

00:04:23.070  -->  00:04:23.710
All right.

73

00:04:23.760  -->  00:04:26.190
Let's see.

74

00:04:26.190  -->  00:04:27.890
Check it out right now.

75

00:04:28.410  -->  00:04:30.330
All right cool right.

76

00:04:30.390  -->  00:04:31.190
That's good.

77

00:04:31.350  -->  00:04:33.260
This is the BHB posts.

78

00:04:33.290  -->  00:04:34.620
It has a BHB category.

79

00:04:34.620  -->  00:04:38.970
This is both Number two let's check it out real quick.

80

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:42.240
All right let's click again.

81

00:04:42.240  -->  00:04:46.230
All right.

82

00:04:52.380  -->  00:04:55.600
Let's go back here.

83

00:04:56.880  -->  00:05:05.930
Let's go to create real quick not create edit.

84

00:05:06.000  -->  00:05:06.360
All right.

85

00:05:06.370  -->  00:05:10.730
Everything's looking good here.

86

00:05:12.770  -->  00:05:13.650
Plus ID

87

00:05:13.650  -->  00:05:19.170
.

88

00:05:19.170  -->  00:05:19.740
There we go.

89

00:05:19.740  -->  00:05:24.640
You see the Lara go category there.

90

00:05:24.810  -->  00:05:26.850
This one doesn't have a category.

91

00:05:26.850  -->  00:05:31.320
That's why it says that it shows the post.

92

00:05:32.010  -->  00:05:33.470
All right.

93

00:05:34.680  -->  00:05:40.240
But once we make it we give it a category we show the category OK.

94

00:05:41.880  -->  00:05:46.010
So this one has Lero in there.

95

00:05:47.190  -->  00:05:50.420
And this is BHB as you can see.

96

00:05:50.570  -->  00:05:55.770
All right working I can tell you that and we're doing it really nicely.

97

00:05:55.770  -->  00:05:56.460
All right.

98

00:05:56.550  -->  00:06:03.790
So in the next lecture we are going to start working on the functionality for updating this post.

99

00:06:03.900  -->  00:06:04.860
Thank you so much guys.

100

00:06:04.860  -->  00:06:06.210
It was pretty easy right.

101

00:06:06.540  -->  00:06:09.520
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
