00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,920
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,920  -->  00:00:07,630
Now that we are able to upload the images and place them in our database and you should be very find

3

00:00:07,640  -->  00:00:09,530
out by the way in your database.

4

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:10,230
OK.

5

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:21,290
So go to your BHB my admin real quick and verify that those photos are being placed in there.

6

00:00:21,680  -->  00:00:22,250
OK.

7

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:30,450
But anyway let's go and build the functionality where we delete them and later on in the course we might

8

00:00:30,630  -->  00:00:34,230
build the functionality where we can select all the pictures and to lead them.

9

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:34,980
All right.

10

00:00:35,050  -->  00:00:38,110
We're probably going to be adding javascript for that.

11

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:42,770
All right but for now we're just going to put up the lead button here somewhere and we're going to lead

12

00:00:42,830  -->  00:00:43,890
each of these pictures.

13

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:44,420
OK.

14

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:48,380
We're going to keep adding more features to this application as we go into course.

15

00:00:48,390  -->  00:00:49,800
Well let's go to our

16

00:00:53,130  -->  00:01:01,260
media page is actually right here resources views media and then we'll go to and it's and this is where

17

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:02,920
we want it.

18

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:04,330
All right.

19

00:01:04,420  -->  00:01:05,580
This just added it right here

20

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:11,610
form would create a whole forum for that.

21

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:17,260
And I want to I want you guys to get used to seeing this forum all over the place.

22

00:01:17,280  -->  00:01:18,350
All right.

23

00:01:18,830  -->  00:01:22,860
This story is just this right away

24

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:31,130
the men media's

25

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:35,300
right.

26

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:37,620
OK.

27

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:41,240
Looks good.

28

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:44,730
This is going to be the lead.

29

00:01:44,730  -->  00:01:45,590
All right.

30

00:01:45,690  -->  00:01:47,650
Let's take this out.

31

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:49,080
Let's change this to danger

32

00:01:51,930  -->  00:01:53,080
and let's look at it.

33

00:01:53,100  -->  00:01:54,170
Well actually that's it.

34

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:58,160
Let's put the lead here.

35

00:01:58,720  -->  00:02:02,250
Let's look at this real quick.

36

00:02:02,300  -->  00:02:11,030
We're now the find so we got to the final real quick though we did that already but no function.

37

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:15,510
So I mean that means medius controller and we're going to find the destroy.

38

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:19,200
Make sure you give it an ID and

39

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:24,230
that's it.

40

00:02:24,300  -->  00:02:25,510
Let's just look at it.

41

00:02:25,550  -->  00:02:26,040
A quick

42

00:02:32,180  -->  00:02:34,590
action and this true action.

43

00:02:34,730  -->  00:02:38,880
The media destroyed not define what we define Now

44

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:52,960
it is defined Neyens now sir.

45

00:02:53,310  -->  00:02:56,730
All right let's spell this correctly actually.

46

00:02:57,160  -->  00:03:02,020
There we go may some parameters.

47

00:03:02,020  -->  00:03:03,510
Yes we're missing the I.D..

48

00:03:03,540  -->  00:03:08,660
We know that what we're trying to we're trying to do without this.

49

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:11,210
All right.

50

00:03:11,990  -->  00:03:12,170
You

51

00:03:16,290  -->  00:03:18,210
can't catch a break.

52

00:03:18,210  -->  00:03:21,420
Everything has to be so perfect guys.

53

00:03:21,450  -->  00:03:22,700
There we go.

54

00:03:23,220  -->  00:03:24,840
All right cool.

55

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:25,830
All right.

56

00:03:26,160  -->  00:03:31,570
So let's go to the main medias and you guys know how to do this already Ray.

57

00:03:31,890  -->  00:03:34,070
I mean super simple stuff.

58

00:03:34,390  -->  00:03:36,590
I should let you do it

59

00:03:39,070  -->  00:03:39,850
find

60

00:03:42,540  -->  00:03:46,400
or fail Heidi.

61

00:03:47,370  -->  00:03:48,120
All right.

62

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:49,820
Let's just give it a

63

00:03:53,700  -->  00:03:57,280
and then here we want to do is on Lincoln.

64

00:03:58,740  -->  00:04:00,420
We're going to give you the file name so

65

00:04:03,810  -->  00:04:09,010
first we got to give it where the file is path and then the filename.

66

00:04:09,220  -->  00:04:09,430
The

67

00:04:13,630  -->  00:04:16,950
photo on file

68

00:04:20,520  -->  00:04:24,960
and delete them redirect

69

00:04:33,890  -->  00:04:34,470
moon

70

00:04:37,400  -->  00:04:41,670
media.

71

00:04:42,030  -->  00:04:47,540
You might want to put a flash here so well you know which pictures your eyes are leading right.

72

00:04:48,060  -->  00:04:49,490
You might want to do that.

73

00:04:49,890  -->  00:04:52,170
Let's leave this one here.

74

00:04:52,230  -->  00:04:57,170
You can see I believe the yellow one because that way you can see which one we are deleting.

75

00:04:57,180  -->  00:04:57,650
All right.

76

00:04:57,810  -->  00:05:01,060
All right so you can see that it's working beautifully guys.

77

00:05:01,410  -->  00:05:09,060
Now like I say you can add a message right after you deleted so you will you know has being successful

78

00:05:09,690  -->  00:05:14,160
or laid on we can add a feature where we can leave more pictures once.

79

00:05:14,160  -->  00:05:14,800
All right.

80

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:18,770
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
