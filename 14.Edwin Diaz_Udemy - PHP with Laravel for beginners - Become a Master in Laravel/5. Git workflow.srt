1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,150
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,150  -->  00:00:08,070
I hope you're having a lot of fun and learning a lot with this lecture year that I'm doing in this election

3

00:00:08,090  -->  00:00:08,210
.

4

00:00:08,310  -->  00:00:09,100
All right cool.

5

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:13,980
So we have learned a couple of comments here and maybe we have now learned them we've just been you

6

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:19,000
know typing and trying to not get overwhelmed with all this information that's cool.

7

00:00:19,020  -->  00:00:20,560
We can do this over again.

8

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:25,770
All right so let's go to our terminal and let's clear things out.

9

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:31,800
We know that we do ls high in L.A. actually L.A. we can see our hitting file.

10

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:35,790
So let's remove that get from there let's remove everything.

11

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:39,310
All right so we're going to remove everything.

12

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:40,660
Whoops.

13

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:42,710
Not good.

14

00:00:42,730  -->  00:00:45,820
There we go and let's just remove that as well.

15

00:00:46,230  -->  00:00:47,390
All right cool.

16

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:49,210
So now we got a clean slate.

17

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:50,040
Let's initialize.

18

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:52,050
Good.

19

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:52,790
All right.

20

00:00:53,160  -->  00:00:58,050
Let's create a file in the mail.

21

00:00:58,070  -->  00:00:58,590
All right.

22

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:05,270
So now we will guest star as we can see get the in the mail there.

23

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:06,080
All right.

24

00:01:06,360  -->  00:01:14,150
So let's just do a commit real quick let's add it and let's do a commit commit

25

00:01:16,840  -->  00:01:20,680
and add a file.

26

00:01:21,810  -->  00:01:22,440
All right.

27

00:01:22,650  -->  00:01:25,070
Basically showing you the work flow.

28

00:01:25,070  -->  00:01:25,780
All right cool.

29

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:27,390
So we do get status.

30

00:01:27,390  -->  00:01:32,840
We don't buy anything but if we do get log we can see the commit here add a file.

31

00:01:33,150  -->  00:01:38,910
All right so now let's add something to the file page.

32

00:01:38,920  -->  00:01:43,650
One feature one at it.

33

00:01:44,790  -->  00:01:46,680
All right.

34

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:47,750
Save it.

35

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:57,570
Let's going out the file that do a comment or feature one.

36

00:01:57,800  -->  00:01:58,620
All right.

37

00:01:58,900  -->  00:02:00,060
Good luck.

38

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:03,290
I hope you see the workflow on this.

39

00:02:03,300  -->  00:02:05,750
All right so now let's do.

40

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:15,400
Let's add another file another feature feature to save it.

41

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:21,660
Good ad good command feature to get log.

42

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:25,160
Now we've got three comments.

43

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:25,860
All right.

44

00:02:26,040  -->  00:02:29,470
So now I want you to look at this.

45

00:02:29,550  -->  00:02:33,190
So let's say I want to go back to my.

46

00:02:33,840  -->  00:02:37,540
This is where out of the file this is where I added the first feature.

47

00:02:37,540  -->  00:02:52,510
They say I want to go back to the first feature on a copy this and get reset hard paste.

48

00:02:53,070  -->  00:02:55,670
Enter gate log.

49

00:02:55,770  -->  00:03:01,710
This clearly is older but log as you can see we only see two commits here.

50

00:03:01,950  -->  00:03:04,220
And this is done out of here.

51

00:03:04,260  -->  00:03:05,130
You see that.

52

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:09,300
So that second that third committee is now there which is a second feature.

53

00:03:09,300  -->  00:03:15,150
So let's add it again.

54

00:03:15,280  -->  00:03:15,800
All right.

55

00:03:15,900  -->  00:03:19,740
Save it.

56

00:03:19,810  -->  00:03:24,520
There's added less committed.

57

00:03:24,530  -->  00:03:25,680
All right.

58

00:03:26,070  -->  00:03:29,400
Let's check the logs again we see three commits.

59

00:03:29,430  -->  00:03:29,980
All right call.

60

00:03:29,990  -->  00:03:39,030
Let's do a good reset and let's go back to that feature one again.

61

00:03:39,530  -->  00:03:43,650
Are we going to do good research without doing the hard version of it.

62

00:03:43,680  -->  00:03:46,600
All right so now as you can see has being on stage.

63

00:03:46,620  -->  00:03:49,230
So now if we do get let's to clear

64

00:03:52,380  -->  00:03:53,660
the gate log.

65

00:03:53,940  -->  00:03:59,910
And as you can see that our committee is not there because we do this sauf we did a soft reset.

66

00:03:59,940  -->  00:04:05,760
So now we do Gestaltists we can see that mortar fire fall right here has not been committed.

67

00:04:05,760  -->  00:04:09,450
So basically our software we said we go back.

68

00:04:09,450  -->  00:04:12,240
All right we go back to one step before.

69

00:04:12,410  -->  00:04:14,700
So that one step before is out in this file.

70

00:04:14,700  -->  00:04:15,090
Right.

71

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:17,250
So it could be committed.

72

00:04:17,250  -->  00:04:17,880
All right.

73

00:04:18,300  -->  00:04:20,220
Well committing this file that would be.

74

00:04:20,220  -->  00:04:22,140
That would be the step.

75

00:04:22,800  -->  00:04:24,600
But it has now been committed here.

76

00:04:24,600  -->  00:04:26,730
So we need to commit it now.

77

00:04:27,450  -->  00:04:34,320
And another thing that you need to know about the soft reset is that the change is still here.

78

00:04:34,320  -->  00:04:34,820
All right.

79

00:04:34,930  -->  00:04:37,180
We have not deleted this.

80

00:04:37,250  -->  00:04:40,470
This only gets deleted when we do a hard reset.

81

00:04:40,470  -->  00:04:44,730
All right so the change is still there is still the follow still mortified.

82

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:46,460
We just took off.

83

00:04:46,470  -->  00:04:48,940
They commit when we do a soft reset.

84

00:04:49,010  -->  00:04:49,820
All right.

85

00:04:49,950  -->  00:04:57,660
So let's do the comment right now we can go back and say add a feature to whoops or the file as being

86

00:04:58,900  -->  00:05:00,980
we got to add it.

87

00:05:01,050  -->  00:05:02,120
There we go and do that.

88

00:05:02,220  -->  00:05:03,890
And then to the command.

89

00:05:04,130  -->  00:05:04,550
All right.

90

00:05:04,590  -->  00:05:06,560
So now we do get log.

91

00:05:06,660  -->  00:05:08,480
We can see the comments there.

92

00:05:09,150  -->  00:05:09,540
OK.

93

00:05:09,540  -->  00:05:11,920
I hope you see how useful this can be.

94

00:05:12,100  -->  00:05:16,320
Because let's say you are you finish in your application for some reason.

95

00:05:16,320  -->  00:05:22,890
You make a mistake at the end of finishing your application and now you're stuck and you saved the file

96

00:05:22,890  -->  00:05:24,100
in a duplicate folder.

97

00:05:24,120  -->  00:05:26,230
You have to go back there and try to find out.

98

00:05:26,370  -->  00:05:30,540
I mean it's a mess unless you have something like virtual control it makes it very easy to go back and

99

00:05:30,540  -->  00:05:31,210
forth.

100

00:05:31,470  -->  00:05:32,090
All right.

101

00:05:32,280  -->  00:05:37,890
So anyway I think we are good here showing you this steps.

102

00:05:38,160  -->  00:05:45,580
And if I have anything else I will of course bring it up to this section here and show you we get.

103

00:05:45,750  -->  00:05:52,470
But this is just a basic commands that you know you know are very useful for you to use on the next

104

00:05:52,470  -->  00:05:56,130
lectures we get to see how we can push this to get help.

105

00:05:56,190  -->  00:05:56,790
All right.

106

00:05:56,790  -->  00:06:02,010
Which is a online repository and we'll explain that on the next lecture.
