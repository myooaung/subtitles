00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:05.670
All right welcome back my students so you have the option to use BHB thinker if you want to in this

2

00:00:05.890  -->  00:00:08.610
lectures is going to be basically the same.

3

00:00:08.660  -->  00:00:14.220
The reason why I'm using routes is because I want to I want you to have like a better visual of what

4

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:15.070
you're doing.

5

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:18.750
And I also want you to have this file just in case you say Edwin.

6

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:22.140
Do we have the routes father we were working with in this section.

7

00:00:22.190  -->  00:00:23.560
Going I say yeah I do.

8

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:26.820
Here's the file you know that's why I'm doing this.

9

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:29.380
Are you going keep some information now.

10

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:32.460
I don't want you to be lazy and not write it because I'm going to give you this file.

11

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:33.330
I might change my mind.

12

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:34.810
I give you this file.

13

00:00:34.890  -->  00:00:37.710
So always write everything down with me.

14

00:00:37.710  -->  00:00:39.520
I want you to learn this stuff really well.

15

00:00:39.540  -->  00:00:41.860
But anyway let's go to Ross real quick.

16

00:00:41.880  -->  00:00:48.210
I'm going to create a different route because we're going to be creating information related information

17

00:00:48.210  -->  00:00:51.560
related modern information data.

18

00:00:52.200  -->  00:00:53.270
All right.

19

00:00:53.460  -->  00:01:02.050
So let's make this first parameter for insert data second primaries the closure function.

20

00:01:03.410  -->  00:01:05.340
Whoops.

21

00:01:06.540  -->  00:01:07.080
All right.

22

00:01:07.080  -->  00:01:08.390
So what do we want to do first.

23

00:01:08.400  -->  00:01:11.450
Well the first thing is to find the user right.

24

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:15.040
And then we find the relationship and then save it.

25

00:01:15.300  -->  00:01:20.970
So how do we find the user was the first thing that we have to put here every time we're dealing with

26

00:01:20.970  -->  00:01:23.040
a model we need to put our database right.

27

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:25.980
So it's going to be the user model.

28

00:01:27.140  -->  00:01:35.420
It's a static and not faint or find it's find one.

29

00:01:35.420  -->  00:01:36.300
Boy but we're going to do this.

30

00:01:36.300  -->  00:01:39.390
We're going to start using this one just in case.

31

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:42.660
So that way we can get some feedback on on that perception.

32

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:45.760
If we have a user or not so fine or fail.

33

00:01:45.820  -->  00:01:56.440
Now remember that we have to add in poor model so that we can use the app backslash Auray user semi-colon

34

00:01:56.470  -->  00:01:56.800
.

35

00:01:57.240  -->  00:01:58.910
We could add it would be H-P storm here.

36

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:03.730
We get a little Leibel when we put a mossel like this or cursor.

37

00:02:03.750  -->  00:02:08.810
All right so once we have the user Let's enter data.

38

00:02:08.820  -->  00:02:10.730
So that's pretty cool.

39

00:02:10.740  -->  00:02:15.920
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you a really cool way of doing this.

40

00:02:15.960  -->  00:02:19.700
I'm going to save the address in an array.

41

00:02:19.800  -->  00:02:27.990
Well I got to instantiate an object from the address model from the Odgers model and then put the data

42

00:02:27.990  -->  00:02:32.130
in there and then use it and then use the relationship to save it.

43

00:02:32.190  -->  00:02:33.040
Watch.

44

00:02:33.180  -->  00:02:34.560
Watch this.

45

00:02:34.560  -->  00:02:35.430
It's going to be pretty cool.

46

00:02:35.430  -->  00:02:41.750
So we're going to instantiate this object and it's going to be address.

47

00:02:42.120  -->  00:02:48.060
And then remember when we do and we were dealing with instances we don't need to use static anywhere

48

00:02:48.070  -->  00:02:48.370
.

49

00:02:48.750  -->  00:02:51.900
So let's import the address models.

50

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:57.160
Well all right.

51

00:02:57.570  -->  00:02:58.920
There we go.

52

00:02:58.920  -->  00:03:02.920
So that's a nice to see this is we were instantiating this if you don't know what this is.

53

00:03:02.940  -->  00:03:08.440
You need to go back and take my Ph.D. O.P. class or write about objects and stuff like that.

54

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:15.870
So we're going to put in a range say here because this is going to be an associate of data right.

55

00:03:15.940  -->  00:03:19.120
We need we have columns and values right.

56

00:03:19.320  -->  00:03:27.410
So the name of this field in the database is name and we're going to name this.

57

00:03:27.470  -->  00:03:29.720
We're going to give the address name right.

58

00:03:30.180  -->  00:03:33.000
All right so one two three four.

59

00:03:33.000  -->  00:03:36.050
Houston I think this is how you're right.

60

00:03:36.060  -->  00:03:42.070
Houston Avenue New York New York 112.

61

00:03:42.700  -->  00:03:44.610
I don't know.

62

00:03:45.680  -->  00:03:46.190
OK.

63

00:03:46.410  -->  00:03:54.900
So now that we have this new object here created with information already that's why we use it in parenthesis

64

00:03:54.900  -->  00:03:58.310
for we have all this information here.

65

00:03:58.350  -->  00:04:01.680
Right now we can go ahead and say oh we're right.

66

00:04:01.710  -->  00:04:05.600
I want the user to grab each method address.

67

00:04:05.790  -->  00:04:16.470
And in this case we do need to put the parentheses to use that method and we and I do this safe and

68

00:04:16.470  -->  00:04:18.060
what are we going to save.

69

00:04:18.060  -->  00:04:20.280
We're going to save this new address

70

00:04:22.720  -->  00:04:24.230
enter.

71

00:04:24.300  -->  00:04:27.180
And now these methods safe is going to take an instance.

72

00:04:27.180  -->  00:04:27.920
OK.

73

00:04:28.170  -->  00:04:34.410
So make sure that you know that if you're using creator of these a different story but this save is

74

00:04:34.410  -->  00:04:40.070
going to take an instance when you are using it like this.

75

00:04:40.080  -->  00:04:41.550
All right cool.

76

00:04:41.580  -->  00:04:43.410
So I think he's ready.

77

00:04:43.410  -->  00:04:48.190
I don't see anything that we're forgetting hopefully we forget something so that way we debug it.

78

00:04:48.260  -->  00:04:49.830
And you know I love to the book guys.

79

00:04:49.830  -->  00:04:56.480
If you ever taken one of my courses so insert enter.

80

00:04:56.880  -->  00:04:59.810
Yes yes yes yes.

81

00:04:59.820  -->  00:05:01.080
All right cool.

82

00:05:01.080  -->  00:05:06.300
The reason why this is not work is because we don't even have a user in our database where as a matter

83

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:09.240
of fact we don't have any data right.

84

00:05:09.450  -->  00:05:15.260
So in our database or table guys come on.

85

00:05:15.450  -->  00:05:16.830
I tell you already did that.

86

00:05:16.890  -->  00:05:18.610
You didn't even let me know.

87

00:05:18.930  -->  00:05:19.740
All right that's cool.

88

00:05:19.740  -->  00:05:20.770
That's OK.

89

00:05:21.150  -->  00:05:22.800
This is quick.

90

00:05:22.800  -->  00:05:25.700
Let's put a user win.

91

00:05:26.260  -->  00:05:28.570
Yes.

92

00:05:28.670  -->  00:05:34.110
All right coring faculty that come back.

93

00:05:34.210  -->  00:05:35.040
Well one two three.

94

00:05:35.040  -->  00:05:36.490
You never want to do that of course.

95

00:05:36.490  -->  00:05:42.110
GUYS PLEASE NO BULL 2:59 in our life server.

96

00:05:42.120  -->  00:05:44.250
All right so that's going to be using number one.

97

00:05:44.250  -->  00:05:47.670
And you see why we put the nullable there.

98

00:05:47.670  -->  00:05:51.150
That way we didn't put our user ID there.

99

00:05:51.240  -->  00:05:56.300
Actually no this is just another one that they use are these.

100

00:05:56.310  -->  00:06:03.750
This one if we were inserting data into the addresses here addresses table doing through doing it through

101

00:06:03.750  -->  00:06:11.820
B-tree my admin in willing would then put the user id we would have a problem but since we did it we're

102

00:06:11.820  -->  00:06:13.810
going to do it through here with a relationship.

103

00:06:13.860  -->  00:06:15.750
We're not going to have a problem.

104

00:06:15.790  -->  00:06:16.720
All right.

105

00:06:16.860  -->  00:06:18.400
Now don't get me wrong.

106

00:06:18.490  -->  00:06:22.500
Peachtree in Miami will let you put it but it will give you a big warning here telling you that you

107

00:06:22.500  -->  00:06:23.810
didn't put it there.

108

00:06:23.820  -->  00:06:26.960
All right so now let's try this again.

109

00:06:26.980  -->  00:06:28.060
Enter.

110

00:06:28.320  -->  00:06:30.640
All right.

111

00:06:33.000  -->  00:06:38.290
Structure is a name is a Master Simon.

112

00:06:38.550  -->  00:06:38.910
All right.

113

00:06:38.910  -->  00:06:44.040
So he's giving us a month's assignment because we're trying to put data that Lara has not giving us

114

00:06:44.040  -->  00:06:52.110
permission that's good that he gave us that error because now we have to go back to our motto address

115

00:06:52.200  -->  00:07:00.440
and tell Larabee listen I need you to allow the name field and this is how we do it.

116

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:04.890
Remember that cool name.

117

00:07:04.890  -->  00:07:11.160
So you go to the model that has given you the bat the math assignment guys are not going to always explain

118

00:07:11.170  -->  00:07:14.840
this much anymore because this is the beginning of relationships.

119

00:07:14.850  -->  00:07:18.080
But later on I'm not going to be explaining this much.

120

00:07:18.270  -->  00:07:20.000
So we get a math assignment.

121

00:07:20.000  -->  00:07:21.490
All right.

122

00:07:22.320  -->  00:07:27.930
And we know because we have these name feel there and does the only name fuel we got besides.

123

00:07:27.930  -->  00:07:33.130
Well we have the name fuel for usable We know we training or the data they address right.

124

00:07:33.510  -->  00:07:33.830
All right.

125

00:07:33.840  -->  00:07:36.580
So let's try this again now insert.

126

00:07:36.670  -->  00:07:40.080
Oh word word guys really good job.

127

00:07:40.080  -->  00:07:42.120
Really good job if you work for you.

128

00:07:42.150  -->  00:07:42.600
All right.

129

00:07:42.720  -->  00:07:43.630
Cool.

130

00:07:43.650  -->  00:07:49.050
So let's go to addresses and as you can see we have a new address with it created.

131

00:07:49.190  -->  00:07:50.100
Oh they did that.

132

00:07:50.160  -->  00:07:51.080
And guess what.

133

00:07:51.510  -->  00:07:54.690
The user id beautiful.

134

00:07:54.690  -->  00:07:58.080
We can however create another one real quick.

135

00:07:58.650  -->  00:08:08.640
Let's put some other dressier and I don't know I'm just going to put a crazy address there for the same

136

00:08:08.640  -->  00:08:10.200
user.

137

00:08:10.200  -->  00:08:19.550
All right so let's go and create one on insert.

138

00:08:20.310  -->  00:08:28.210
Enter refresh while the user id one ID of that address too.

139

00:08:28.530  -->  00:08:34.740
So another user has two addresses of course we don't one there I would want to use it to keep having

140

00:08:34.740  -->  00:08:35.840
different addresses.

141

00:08:35.880  -->  00:08:37.200
You only has one entry.

142

00:08:37.290  -->  00:08:39.120
We want to limit that to one address right.

143

00:08:39.190  -->  00:08:44.040
So we're not going to have to execute this function more than one time.

144

00:08:44.040  -->  00:08:44.840
OK.

145

00:08:45.330  -->  00:08:49.590
And we can put a condition on your application for that but we're not going to get into that right now

146

00:08:49.590  -->  00:08:49.620
.

147

00:08:49.620  -->  00:08:52.070
So anyway now you know how to do this.

148

00:08:52.080  -->  00:08:55.390
And on the next lecture we'll find a way to update in the lead.

149

00:08:55.410  -->  00:08:56.030
Right.

150

00:08:56.280  -->  00:08:58.230
So the next lectures we're going to do that.

151

00:08:58.260  -->  00:09:01.630
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture is
