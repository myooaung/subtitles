00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:05.700
All right welcome back my students so now that we have the form it's time for us to go to the controller

2

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:07.390
and start playing around in there.

3

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:11.990
So let's go to the controller HTP controllers postes controller.

4

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:12.700
There we go.

5

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:14.650
So now we said that this method.

6

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:18.720
All right and we have a year and Terman on the BHB route list.

7

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:26.430
We said that that form is going to be executed here so he's going to the method store.

8

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:29.800
So let's look for that method in the controller.

9

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:30.880
Let's go.

10

00:00:30.990  -->  00:00:32.520
And as you can see he's right here.

11

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:35.250
So this is what we're going to receive the request.

12

00:00:35.430  -->  00:00:37.800
The pole super global values.

13

00:00:37.800  -->  00:00:40.380
Now they create.

14

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:42.360
All right.

15

00:00:42.360  -->  00:00:45.310
Remember that when we go to.

16

00:00:47.040  -->  00:00:48.420
They create.

17

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:50.060
OK.

18

00:00:51.330  -->  00:00:53.050
This is they you or I.

19

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:57.860
They this is the name of the role goes to these create method.

20

00:00:57.870  -->  00:00:59.010
All right.

21

00:00:59.010  -->  00:01:05.200
So now when the user goes to our application let's open a browser real quick.

22

00:01:05.670  -->  00:01:11.880
They go to see a mass that the posts create.

23

00:01:11.910  -->  00:01:14.680
That's where that is going to execute.

24

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:17.740
And this is where we saw that the meant that create stuff right.

25

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:23.520
That's where this method create is returning data from.

26

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:23.940
Right.

27

00:01:24.140  -->  00:01:25.650
But now we don't want to do that.

28

00:01:25.650  -->  00:01:28.520
Now what we want to do is return of you right.

29

00:01:28.850  -->  00:01:30.490
We already have the view.

30

00:01:30.490  -->  00:01:35.510
So we're going to put put it down here that we're going to put down the name of the view.

31

00:01:35.670  -->  00:01:41.940
So Post dot and you can see it right here create You see then create.

32

00:01:41.950  -->  00:01:47.940
So these function view is going to automatically translate that dot notation into a forward slash so

33

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:53.320
that way it would construct a you or I for you just by giving it the name right.

34

00:01:53.360  -->  00:01:57.660
That's why these function view is doing of course you can pass all the parameters and we're going to

35

00:01:57.660  -->  00:01:58.260
see that later.

36

00:01:58.260  -->  00:02:03.360
But so once we have that set that you can come here and you can refresh it.

37

00:02:03.370  -->  00:02:05.820
Now you can see that we have that form already.

38

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:10.550
All right is nothing big right now because this is just for their ministration purposes only.

39

00:02:10.550  -->  00:02:12.420
But later on we're going to make a really nice.

40

00:02:12.420  -->  00:02:14.060
OK.

41

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:17.780
So anyway really cool stuff.

42

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:18.900
All right.

43

00:02:19.780  -->  00:02:21.700
So let's go.

44

00:02:21.700  -->  00:02:25.360
And what's the next step is going to the store method.

45

00:02:25.410  -->  00:02:27.090
And I want to show you something here.

46

00:02:27.360  -->  00:02:33.030
So I said to you that this math is receiving the pull super values or the supposed super global values

47

00:02:33.030  -->  00:02:33.710
right.

48

00:02:33.720  -->  00:02:38.070
So he's doing this in this requests class.

49

00:02:38.190  -->  00:02:40.370
Remember that this is an injection.

50

00:02:40.380  -->  00:02:45.040
Here we injected this class in making these A object.

51

00:02:45.060  -->  00:02:48.790
So now we got all these methods that we can use from this class here.

52

00:02:48.880  -->  00:02:50.240
It is very.

53

00:02:51.040  -->  00:02:51.550
All right.

54

00:02:51.660  -->  00:03:06.900
So if I say return requests all watch this and I going into this summit we get all the the form data

55

00:03:06.900  -->  00:03:07.560
.

56

00:03:07.560  -->  00:03:08.330
All right.

57

00:03:08.760  -->  00:03:09.660
That's what we do.

58

00:03:09.690  -->  00:03:11.310
We get with that.

59

00:03:12.000  -->  00:03:12.920
OK.

60

00:03:13.260  -->  00:03:20.430
So now if I want to get a specific input I could say get in I can put the name of the input that I want

61

00:03:20.430  -->  00:03:26.660
to get returned the data and my sis answer.

62

00:03:26.820  -->  00:03:29.860
Whoops sorry I got to go back.

63

00:03:29.910  -->  00:03:33.160
The input title watches.

64

00:03:33.300  -->  00:03:40.320
So I don't return everything there and therefore I return just a title and we go enter and as you can

65

00:03:40.320  -->  00:03:42.540
see I just returned that value.

66

00:03:42.810  -->  00:03:43.460
OK.

67

00:03:43.770  -->  00:03:45.400
And that goes for the inputs.

68

00:03:45.420  -->  00:03:48.550
Now you can also do something easier.

69

00:03:49.140  -->  00:03:51.030
You can also do this.

70

00:03:51.510  -->  00:03:53.640
Treat it as a property.

71

00:03:53.870  -->  00:03:55.550
OK.

72

00:03:57.350  -->  00:03:57.890
Whoops.

73

00:03:57.930  -->  00:04:01.940
Let's go back I do the same thing again submit the send thing OK.

74

00:04:02.040  -->  00:04:04.870
I like to use it property like one like this.

75

00:04:04.900  -->  00:04:05.570
Right.

76

00:04:06.000  -->  00:04:15.710
And remember the method all returns everything on the form or the inputs enter where you go.

77

00:04:15.780  -->  00:04:16.580
Doesn't work like that.

78

00:04:16.580  -->  00:04:20.180
I tried a couple of times so even returns the by name values.

79

00:04:20.180  -->  00:04:20.690
All right.

80

00:04:20.850  -->  00:04:22.270
Pretty cool stuff right guys.

81

00:04:22.290  -->  00:04:23.820
Anyway on the next lecture.

82

00:04:23.940  -->  00:04:28.120
Well we're going to do is we're going to finally create a record so you can see how it works.

83

00:04:28.200  -->  00:04:30.710
And we even going to do our redirect.

84

00:04:30.720  -->  00:04:31.200
All right.

85

00:04:31.380  -->  00:04:35.420
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
