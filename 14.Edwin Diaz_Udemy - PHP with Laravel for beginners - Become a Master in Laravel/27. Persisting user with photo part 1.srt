1

00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:01,270
All right.

2

00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:03,720
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:09,690
All right so it's time for us to start actually persistence some data in the database not only just

4

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:11,800
persistence but persisting everything right.

5

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:13,950
So let's set this up real quick.

6

00:00:13,980  -->  00:00:19,200
I'm going to comment this all right now that we know that following this that we are able to submit

7

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:24,600
file information we're going to assign a variable right here in this if statement right away.

8

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:25,650
We can do that.

9

00:00:26,000  -->  00:00:26,360
All right.

10

00:00:26,370  -->  00:00:29,590
So that way we don't have to do it down here we can save a little line of code.

11

00:00:29,910  -->  00:00:30,560
All right.

12

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:40,670
So we're going to create a variable here and I'm going to spend a time native function from BHB.

13

00:00:40,850  -->  00:00:45,700
I'm going to get the name of the photo.

14

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:46,490
All right.

15

00:00:46,830  -->  00:00:48,570
So we're going to have the time appended to it.

16

00:00:48,570  -->  00:00:51,040
We could do this at the end of the file as well.

17

00:00:51,200  -->  00:00:55,350
I'm going to do it at the beginning just like Clarabelle does right here you can see that has happened

18

00:00:55,350  -->  00:00:57,070
in the time right here.

19

00:00:57,070  -->  00:01:01,340
All right even though he's opening it in a different format you can if you want to.

20

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:03,950
I'm going to do it this way.

21

00:01:05,280  -->  00:01:07,530
This takes a little bit more modification to do that.

22

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:07,830
OK.

23

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:09,510
You can do that with carbon's pretty easy.

24

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:13,130
But anyway it just takes a little bit more time.

25

00:01:13,170  -->  00:01:14,650
So File.

26

00:01:14,670  -->  00:01:20,400
We're going to move the file to an images folder and we don't have one is going to create and create

27

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:26,430
that in the public directory and we get to give it a second parameter.

28

00:01:26,430  -->  00:01:28,440
We got to give it a name as a second parameter.

29

00:01:28,760  -->  00:01:35,020
OK so once we have that we're going to check for the file if he has one.

30

00:01:35,070  -->  00:01:38,970
We're going to pull out the name appended with the time moving to the images.

31

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:42,240
If not create the images for then this is going to create it.

32

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:44,990
But most of the time we're going to be moving stuff right.

33

00:01:45,300  -->  00:01:51,330
And now here what we need to do is we could do it in many different ways and you get to choose this

34

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:52,050
way.

35

00:01:52,060  -->  00:01:58,470
And guys remember that sometimes and most of the time that I do this lectures I do this the long way

36

00:01:58,480  -->  00:01:58,610
.

37

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:04,220
I want you guys to look at it and think how you can make it better all the time.

38

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:05,430
All right.

39

00:02:05,610  -->  00:02:11,340
Just think about it how you can make each of these lines shorter and work better.

40

00:02:11,340  -->  00:02:11,640
All right.

41

00:02:11,640  -->  00:02:13,750
I'm showing you the long route.

42

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:17,940
Maybe later in the future we create a section where we going to be refactoring some of this stuff a

43

00:02:17,940  -->  00:02:19,790
little more a lot more.

44

00:02:20,010  -->  00:02:24,060
But right now I'm going to show you the basics I'm going to show you how to create these awesome application

45

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:24,460
.

46

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:26,390
Then we make some tweaks later.

47

00:02:26,390  -->  00:02:27,330
OK.

48

00:02:27,360  -->  00:02:28,080
All right.

49

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:30,850
So we're going to use a photo.

50

00:02:31,740  -->  00:02:40,190
We're going to create a photo and I believe we named this file instead of pass.

51

00:02:40,200  -->  00:02:43,630
That's where the confusion was in the beginning there for me.

52

00:02:43,860  -->  00:02:52,360
Usually I usually name this path but I decided to go against my beliefs in name and file.

53

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:54,090
OK.

54

00:02:54,450  -->  00:02:56,940
So horrible.

55

00:02:57,000  -->  00:03:04,590
And it's true that I did try to be a little bit more spontaneous there but it backfired on me.

56

00:03:04,590  -->  00:03:09,460
All right so file and we get to give you the file name.

57

00:03:09,470  -->  00:03:09,810
All right.

58

00:03:09,810  -->  00:03:13,440
So make sure that you include this namespace on top.

59

00:03:13,520  -->  00:03:22,080
Import that right here on top and less assigned.

60

00:03:22,080  -->  00:03:29,070
Since we have all that in here and a photo ID because once we create this photo we going to have an

61

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:31,200
I.D. available to us right away.

62

00:03:31,200  -->  00:03:36,110
Make sure this is not array actually guys right here.

63

00:03:36,210  -->  00:03:42,450
So once we create it we have this very well we have a photo I.D. available to it right away we don't

64

00:03:42,450  -->  00:03:48,000
have to do the you know like we used to doing in adp HPN pulao the last sort or ID or anything like

65

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:50,820
that it does it Automattic for us.

66

00:03:50,820  -->  00:03:58,230
So we can just say photo ID like this.

67

00:03:58,230  -->  00:03:59,860
Pretty cool stuff right.

68

00:03:59,880  -->  00:04:00,810
All right.

69

00:04:01,170  -->  00:04:04,240
So let's just double check this to see if everything's good.

70

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:05,530
OK.

71

00:04:05,790  -->  00:04:07,180
I think we did a lot on this lecture.

72

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:11,740
I'm going to leave this short and we're going to finish it up on the next one OK.

73

00:04:11,850  -->  00:04:15,140
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
