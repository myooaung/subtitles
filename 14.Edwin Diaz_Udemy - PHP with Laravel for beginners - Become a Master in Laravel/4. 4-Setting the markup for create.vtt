00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:00.740
All right.

2

00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:02.300
Welcome my student.

3

00:00:02.310  -->  00:00:05.680
So it's fun for us to start creating the markup for pages.

4

00:00:05.680  -->  00:00:06.010
All right.

5

00:00:06.020  -->  00:00:11.930
So let's go to each page and the first page that we're going to be creating is the Create page.

6

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:12.730
OK.

7

00:00:12.750  -->  00:00:20.640
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create this form like that.

8

00:00:21.200  -->  00:00:21.990
All right.

9

00:00:22.400  -->  00:00:26.280
And now remember what I told you about what we learned about Master layouts.

10

00:00:26.280  -->  00:00:26.890
OK.

11

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:32.660
Now let's go to views actually layouts and we already have a layer right here.

12

00:00:32.960  -->  00:00:33.820
OK.

13

00:00:33.990  -->  00:00:38.280
So we can use that label for I create my fact.

14

00:00:38.310  -->  00:00:40.160
Let's do that.

15

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:48.870
So just like we did in the contact right here on top we're going to take that and we're going to do

16

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:49.690
that.

17

00:00:50.230  -->  00:00:51.340
OK.

18

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:53.890
Let's see if we have anything else that we need.

19

00:00:54.450  -->  00:00:56.640
If you want the photo you could do that.

20

00:00:57.140  -->  00:00:59.020
OK.

21

00:00:59.460  -->  00:01:01.390
It's up to you.

22

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:03.140
OK.

23

00:01:03.240  -->  00:01:04.430
All right there.

24

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:05.260
All right.

25

00:01:05.550  -->  00:01:07.210
So now we create the form.

26

00:01:07.590  -->  00:01:13.920
Let's just put it right there that's fine.

27

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:14.250
All right.

28

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:16.620
So how do we create a form.

29

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:19.690
Well that's a very very good question.

30

00:01:19.740  -->  00:01:24.850
In Largo you don't have to do anything different than in any other application.

31

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:26.630
You just create a form.

32

00:01:26.700  -->  00:01:28.600
I'm going to do that and tab.

33

00:01:28.620  -->  00:01:29.630
All right.

34

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:32.460
And we'll create an input

35

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:36.790
type tÃªtes.

36

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:44.760
Let's give it a name of the same name of the title of the column of our table inside entire database

37

00:01:45.470  -->  00:01:45.980
title.

38

00:01:46.090  -->  00:01:46.390
OK.

39

00:01:46.400  -->  00:01:50.500
Let me let me go back and make sure that us in the column in the migration.

40

00:01:50.700  -->  00:01:58.410
All right so let's go to database migration or go to the post table and make sure that that column is

41

00:01:58.410  -->  00:01:58.960
titled.

42

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:02.870
All right automatically that's what he's going to have interposed superglue.

43

00:02:02.950  -->  00:02:03.550
OK.

44

00:02:03.810  -->  00:02:06.240
So let's go

45

00:02:10.560  -->  00:02:15.450
down here to our create title.

46

00:02:15.550  -->  00:02:19.440
Well right now we should have a bun also.

47

00:02:19.630  -->  00:02:28.810
And we're going to say input types submit name submit let's say okay.

48

00:02:28.860  -->  00:02:29.940
Right.

49

00:02:29.940  -->  00:02:31.100
Very simple form.

50

00:02:31.100  -->  00:02:33.240
You could of course put a label on it.

51

00:02:33.360  -->  00:02:34.090
All right.

52

00:02:34.320  -->  00:02:42.810
I'm going to put a placeholder here placeholder and say answer and third title like this very simple

53

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:44.040
.

54

00:02:44.070  -->  00:02:44.670
All right cool.

55

00:02:44.670  -->  00:02:51.510
So now we have this form what happens is that we need to also also tell of the method that is going

56

00:02:51.510  -->  00:02:52.990
to use to be sending in the data.

57

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:55.700
And because a lot of those super secure.

58

00:02:55.750  -->  00:03:02.050
All right the form is going to be using a method of polls.

59

00:03:02.190  -->  00:03:04.340
OK cool.

60

00:03:04.530  -->  00:03:06.830
And now I want you to look at something real quick.

61

00:03:06.840  -->  00:03:10.250
You see the router here.

62

00:03:10.950  -->  00:03:20.610
When we went to a store something put it in the database we used to post method OK when we want to create

63

00:03:21.360  -->  00:03:26.190
not just create I mean destroy we use the lead med and I'll show you in a minute how to do that.

64

00:03:26.340  -->  00:03:34.210
And what we want to update we use to put or patch OK show we use the you are able to get requests.

65

00:03:34.590  -->  00:03:35.280
OK.

66

00:03:35.280  -->  00:03:38.730
So I hope you see how this works but I'll show you in a minute how we do that OK.

67

00:03:38.910  -->  00:03:47.390
Right now this form here is going to be posting to posts like this.

68

00:03:47.400  -->  00:03:53.940
OK that's where this information is going that's where the post-Super superglued is going to be be sent

69

00:03:54.240  -->  00:03:55.330
to us.

70

00:03:55.340  -->  00:03:56.220
All right.

71

00:03:56.220  -->  00:04:01.260
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one where we finish

72

00:04:01.270  -->  00:04:04.540
constructing the story.

73

00:04:04.950  -->  00:04:07.280
They create and store methods.

74

00:04:07.410  -->  00:04:07.940
OK.

75

00:04:08.010  -->  00:04:08.670
Thank you so much.

76

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:09.180
I'll see you then.

77

00:04:09.180  -->  00:04:09.860
Bye bye.
