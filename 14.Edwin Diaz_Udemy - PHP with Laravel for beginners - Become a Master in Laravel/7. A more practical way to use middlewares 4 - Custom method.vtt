00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:06.240
All right welcome back my students so we have done a lot in this last couple lectures.

2

00:00:06.240  -->  00:00:08.650
It's time for us to start testing this out.

3

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:09.840
Let's test it already.

4

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:11.450
We're ready to test it out.

5

00:00:11.450  -->  00:00:15.320
We might have to change a couple things because I've been doing this kind of fast.

6

00:00:15.340  -->  00:00:20.820
I want to get to the application side of the course but let's go and check this out and see if it's

7

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:21.830
working OK.

8

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:25.250
So we know that if we try to add as admin something is going to happen.

9

00:00:25.250  -->  00:00:25.910
Right.

10

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:29.030
And well first of all we get these little bug.

11

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:35.160
So let's go and fix that is admen and we need to add this class.

12

00:00:35.160  -->  00:00:36.820
All right cool for us.

13

00:00:36.830  -->  00:00:38.220
But that's beautiful.

14

00:00:38.220  -->  00:00:38.830
Let's do it.

15

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:39.750
Let's do it again.

16

00:00:39.750  -->  00:00:42.240
It says you are mistreated because you're seeing this page.

17

00:00:42.240  -->  00:00:51.900
Something is wrong definitely because if you go to your the user's role we can see that these guys subscriber's

18

00:00:51.900  -->  00:00:53.640
not an administrator anymore.

19

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:58.240
All right so the logic is now greed is not great.

20

00:00:58.260  -->  00:01:03.190
OK I can I can see the logic in that mistake right here.

21

00:01:03.230  -->  00:01:11.670
All right let's just say if the if the user is not an admin All right then redirect them back

22

00:01:15.300  -->  00:01:17.120
to this page.

23

00:01:17.190  -->  00:01:17.960
That's it.

24

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:20.570
All right let's do that answer.

25

00:01:20.940  -->  00:01:22.740
As you can see we're done.

26

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:25.740
All right we can access that unless we are an administrator.

27

00:01:25.740  -->  00:01:27.840
So let's test this out real quick.

28

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:33.940
Let's go to users let's add it and let's do a role like the one.

29

00:01:34.220  -->  00:01:35.200
Go.

30

00:01:35.460  -->  00:01:36.060
Beautiful.

31

00:01:36.060  -->  00:01:37.460
Now let's try to edit that.

32

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:42.480
I mean let's try to go to our page outman enter and you are an administrator because you are seeing

33

00:01:42.480  -->  00:01:48.390
this page all because you're seeing this face you are an administrator sometimes on translating from

34

00:01:48.390  -->  00:01:50.030
my language to English.

35

00:01:50.070  -->  00:01:52.730
And it comes backwards.

36

00:01:53.220  -->  00:01:53.510
All right.

37

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:55.500
Hopefully it makes sense for you guys Jorge.

38

00:01:55.620  -->  00:02:04.060
But anyway as you can see how easy this is now all we have to do is every time we want to apply this

39

00:02:04.100  -->  00:02:07.590
ace admin functionality we are middleware.

40

00:02:07.620  -->  00:02:15.630
We just put it in that construct or we can pass is in the parameter like this.

41

00:02:15.630  -->  00:02:23.410
All right we can passing in right here like this is admin.

42

00:02:23.660  -->  00:02:24.470
All right.

43

00:02:24.840  -->  00:02:27.510
I'm going to leave this for Web.

44

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:28.520
All right.

45

00:02:29.340  -->  00:02:30.160
Really cool stuff.

46

00:02:30.160  -->  00:02:34.480
And remember guys the resources are always going to be at the end of the sections or lectures.

47

00:02:34.620  -->  00:02:40.290
Check for those links there though mentation is there where you can take out of this core this course

48

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:47.250
mostly is the practicality Jurai how how practical is this stuff that you know they don't show you in

49

00:02:47.250  -->  00:02:47.760
books.

50

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:54.240
I'm showing you here and you know and the great stuff about this is that we have so many documentation

51

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:58.410
out there so many people having issues that we can just make a little quick search on line and we can

52

00:02:58.410  -->  00:02:59.540
find our problems.

53

00:02:59.610  -->  00:03:02.530
You can post this posted in the discussion.

54

00:03:02.700  -->  00:03:07.610
You can go to the Facebook group and you know your questions will be answered.

55

00:03:07.650  -->  00:03:11.520
If you have any issues now I don't want you to just you know the first hour that you're stuck with the

56

00:03:11.520  -->  00:03:18.330
second hour to call me to message me or to message your friends you know give us some time try to fix

57

00:03:18.330  -->  00:03:18.450
it.

58

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:22.800
Try to play around with it for a couple hours a couple of days until you figure it out.

59

00:03:22.800  -->  00:03:28.530
Believe me you're going to learn a lot more that way than just calling for help every two minutes.

60

00:03:28.530  -->  00:03:29.370
All right.

61

00:03:29.440  -->  00:03:33.370
Anyway thank you so much guys for watching this section of these lectures.

62

00:03:33.450  -->  00:03:34.870
And I'll see you in the next one
