00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:03.690
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture we learned a lot.

2

00:00:03.690  -->  00:00:04.260
Right.

3

00:00:04.380  -->  00:00:09.540
We learned how to build these admin function or method that is now very flexible right now but we could

4

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:11.240
make it flexible if we wanted to.

5

00:00:11.250  -->  00:00:14.600
If you go back to a user model you could write here.

6

00:00:14.790  -->  00:00:20.820
I don't know just pass in the roll name or the role or the user.

7

00:00:20.830  -->  00:00:28.200
And you know just making more than Nemec UK is many ways that you can do these guys many different ways

8

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:28.220
.

9

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:28.900
Right.

10

00:00:28.920  -->  00:00:34.500
You can find out their role and compare it once you pass it through here.

11

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:35.040
All right.

12

00:00:35.140  -->  00:00:40.720
Lay their own name equals to the to the role here.

13

00:00:40.970  -->  00:00:41.440
OK.

14

00:00:41.460  -->  00:00:46.280
So until I die you can pass in that here.

15

00:00:46.400  -->  00:00:48.680
All right you see how you can make it more namak.

16

00:00:48.780  -->  00:00:55.860
But anyway so what I'm going to do with this is down routes we're going to take this out here and we're

17

00:00:55.860  -->  00:00:59.070
going to take it back to the middleware is admin.

18

00:00:59.850  -->  00:01:02.570
And now this made aware is going to be able to do that for us.

19

00:01:02.630  -->  00:01:03.330
Okay.

20

00:01:03.600  -->  00:01:07.950
So if it's admin what we're going to do is we're going to redirect the user

21

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:23.910
return redirect and we're going to redirect them where if intended and let's do admin.

22

00:01:24.010  -->  00:01:26.480
All right and we're going to be all around for that now.

23

00:01:26.850  -->  00:01:28.230
All right.

24

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:37.890
So we're first pulling out the thicket of usury fees if is there is any and if we find them we're going

25

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:40.070
to go and redirect them here.

26

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:44.520
Else we're going to go to the next requests no matter what.

27

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:51.270
All right so now let's go and create a route for admin

28

00:01:54.170  -->  00:01:59.970
and let's do it.

29

00:01:59.970  -->  00:02:01.850
We don't need that anymore.

30

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:09.810
As I actually do all the way down here I just say route

31

00:02:15.220  -->  00:02:15.620
get

32

00:02:18.990  -->  00:02:21.340
admin.

33

00:02:21.720  -->  00:02:26.400
And as a matter of fact the way I'm going to do it is with a admin controller so we're going to build

34

00:02:26.400  -->  00:02:29.050
that admin controller.

35

00:02:29.750  -->  00:02:30.920
OK.

36

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:37.890
And that's the way that I want to do it because it just gives you a bigger example on how this is done

37

00:02:37.890  -->  00:02:38.180
.

38

00:02:38.190  -->  00:02:44.520
So BHP artist and may controller we're going to create a controller here and I'm going faster guys because

39

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:47.000
we have created so many projects.

40

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:48.630
This should be easy for you OK.

41

00:02:48.690  -->  00:02:51.340
Admin controller.

42

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:52.880
All right.

43

00:02:53.030  -->  00:02:59.540
And they are not going to create a resource this is going to be empty.

44

00:02:59.670  -->  00:03:01.170
I mean see where I'm missing admin

45

00:03:04.810  -->  00:03:11.120
invalid row operation.

46

00:03:15.600  -->  00:03:16.200
OK.

47

00:03:16.200  -->  00:03:17.640
The problem is not here.

48

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:21.740
Problem is here.

49

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:23.280
This should be

50

00:03:26.570  -->  00:03:30.140
.

51

00:03:30.650  -->  00:03:31.330
I see.

52

00:03:31.500  -->  00:03:32.120
All right.

53

00:03:32.490  -->  00:03:35.410
So let's do this.

54

00:03:35.700  -->  00:03:40.810
And this is going to go to and it's that's OK let's create a now.

55

00:03:41.170  -->  00:03:42.000
And there we go.

56

00:03:42.030  -->  00:03:46.430
Remember that a few years and they get that you need to give it some type of method here.

57

00:03:46.480  -->  00:03:50.180
All right you only would do this without you doing resource.

58

00:03:50.240  -->  00:03:52.620
OK so clear.

59

00:03:52.620  -->  00:03:55.780
Let's go to our controller.

60

00:03:56.130  -->  00:04:02.280
Let's see if we can find that here it's not there yet so let's synchronize it real quick.

61

00:04:02.280  -->  00:04:04.670
All right cool.

62

00:04:04.710  -->  00:04:07.430
So now here I'm going to apply the middleware.

63

00:04:07.470  -->  00:04:09.260
And I want you to pay very close attention to this.

64

00:04:09.260  -->  00:04:09.850
OK.

65

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:11.980
So we're going to create a function.

66

00:04:12.000  -->  00:04:12.640
All right.

67

00:04:12.660  -->  00:04:15.390
Actually it's going to be public.

68

00:04:16.770  -->  00:04:28.240
Oops I was fast re function and this is going to be a construct you know.

69

00:04:29.520  -->  00:04:30.680
All right.

70

00:04:31.140  -->  00:04:36.080
And this is what's going to be and very similar to these guys.

71

00:04:36.090  -->  00:04:41.350
Look you can just copy this if you want it to OK same thing.

72

00:04:42.090  -->  00:04:55.200
So this made aware whoops and we're going to say is admen I believe we put her as upper case here.

73

00:04:56.960  -->  00:04:59.370
All right.

74

00:04:59.370  -->  00:05:03.030
So if we wanted to see the end of this page

75

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:10.150
we would need to be an administrator now now whoops

76

00:05:15.230  -->  00:05:18.840
let's return something.

77

00:05:19.890  -->  00:05:21.960
You are an administrator

78

00:05:24.720  -->  00:05:27.100
because you are

79

00:05:30.660  -->  00:05:33.670
in this speech.

80

00:05:35.280  -->  00:05:36.690
There we go.

81

00:05:37.500  -->  00:05:40.550
All right.

82

00:05:40.680  -->  00:05:41.270
All right.

83

00:05:41.280  -->  00:05:48.390
So all right so I'm going to leave the second part to the next lecture because we actually gone quiet

84

00:05:48.390  -->  00:05:50.510
a little bit here.

85

00:05:50.530  -->  00:05:54.020
We've gone very far so I don't want to bore you I don't want you to fall asleep.

86

00:05:54.020  -->  00:05:57.990
I want you to if you tell your take a little rest come back to the next part.

87

00:05:58.020  -->  00:05:59.130
I'll see you the next lecture
