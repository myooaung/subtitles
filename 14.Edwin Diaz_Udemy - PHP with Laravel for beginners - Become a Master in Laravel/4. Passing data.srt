1

00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:00,990
All right.

2

00:00:00,990  -->  00:00:10,950
So in the last lecture I challenge you to find out how we pass data right how we pass parameters to

3

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:18,810
our controller and hit this in this in this method and it's all right remember that we already did some

4

00:00:18,810  -->  00:00:21,980
of this in route's So we say that if we put.

5

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:28,670
I show you how to put a force last year and type in the curly brackets and some type of variable here

6

00:00:28,680  -->  00:00:29,490
right.

7

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:34,130
So you might be asking Sosa how in the world do I take you there.

8

00:00:34,710  -->  00:00:35,450
Right.

9

00:00:35,490  -->  00:00:40,410
And then you go then you probably went to here and you say ID.

10

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:43,800
So he's working the number.

11

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:44,580
Is

12

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:50,480
that right.

13

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:56,740
And then you came here and you did this and blah.

14

00:00:56,940  -->  00:00:58,210
And he's working right.

15

00:00:58,320  -->  00:00:59,700
I hope he did that.

16

00:00:59,700  -->  00:01:01,780
If not don't worry about it.

17

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:04,980
I just showed you how to do it right.

18

00:01:05,040  -->  00:01:07,340
You did a good job if you did it that way.

19

00:01:07,360  -->  00:01:08,400
Now don't worry about it.

20

00:01:08,410  -->  00:01:13,980
All right this is super simple stuff for me because I've been doing it for you know for a long time

21

00:01:13,980  -->  00:01:14,340
.

22

00:01:14,340  -->  00:01:21,590
But if you're new to Lara Bell is very very very understandable if you weren't able to do that.

23

00:01:21,590  -->  00:01:22,080
All right.

24

00:01:22,230  -->  00:01:23,610
That's not something I expect you to do.

25

00:01:23,610  -->  00:01:25,000
I just wanted to challenge you.

26

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:30,860
But if you did it you got to learn this really well and you're going to do fantastic if you deny not

27

00:01:30,910  -->  00:01:33,540
you're still going to do fantastic because I'm going to help you out right.

28

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:34,880
So don't worry about that.

29

00:01:35,030  -->  00:01:36,470
Let's go to route again.

30

00:01:36,540  -->  00:01:44,010
And as you can see here you might be wondering how in the world does it know that he has to pass this

31

00:01:44,010  -->  00:01:44,110
.

32

00:01:44,130  -->  00:01:47,310
Don't we need to function.

33

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:48,240
Don't we need a function.

34

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:50,700
Well we already have a function.

35

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:54,690
If you go to post controller we have the in that function this is going to take everything that comes

36

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:56,880
from the you are l right here.

37

00:01:57,360  -->  00:01:58,360
All right.

38

00:01:58,830  -->  00:02:03,510
So we could keep taking IDs here if we wanted to keep taking variables.

39

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:04,590
All right.

40

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:08,150
So that's how we pass information.

41

00:02:08,160  -->  00:02:08,480
All right.

42

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:10,860
That's one of the ways that we can pass information.

43

00:02:10,860  -->  00:02:17,550
We can also pass information remember that we can go back to routes and do that that closure function

44

00:02:17,910  -->  00:02:26,500
and returned the ID from here in that closed closure function from routes as a metaphor.

45

00:02:26,510  -->  00:02:28,500
We did it right here right.

46

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:29,910
All right.

47

00:02:30,090  -->  00:02:43,660
So now on the next lecture I'm going to show you how to make a special type of controller.

48

00:02:43,660  -->  00:02:44,280
All right.

49

00:02:44,460  -->  00:02:51,810
A controller with a resource a router with a resource is going to be pretty fun so stay tuned for that

50

00:02:51,810  -->  00:02:52,020
.

51

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:52,420
Take care
