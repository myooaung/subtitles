00:00:00,650  -->  00:00:06,030
All right welcome back my dear student so in this couple of lectures we're going to do this pretty fast

2

00:00:06,030  -->  00:00:08,160
and we already done some of this stuff already.

3

00:00:08,160  -->  00:00:08,940
Right.

4

00:00:08,940  -->  00:00:09,470
All right.

5

00:00:09,520  -->  00:00:14,500
So we have some tax inserted into our table right or tax table.

6

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:17,700
Now it's time for us to do something else.

7

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:23,700
All right well let's do it manually and create.

8

00:00:23,700  -->  00:00:25,940
All right.

9

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:31,470
We're going to create this new post at the same time we're going to sign the tag.

10

00:00:31,560  -->  00:00:32,360
OK.

11

00:00:32,400  -->  00:00:35,680
So we have the post model right here.

12

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:42,540
So let's go ahead and do this real quick and we're going to do this pretty quick.

13

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:49,020
And you know why we might even do a couple of them a couple lectures in this lecture a couple of relationships

14

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:51,540
already since we already done this before.

15

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:52,250
All right.

16

00:00:52,470  -->  00:00:56,580
So grab the post.

17

00:00:56,580  -->  00:00:58,000
All right.

18

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:03,170
And we used to create a static method and we'll create a new post.

19

00:01:03,180  -->  00:01:06,450
OK we'll say my name

20

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:16,130
and it's going to be my first post.

21

00:01:16,170  -->  00:01:17,120
All right.

22

00:01:18,060  -->  00:01:21,150
Let's actually also create a video.

23

00:01:21,150  -->  00:01:24,430
How about that let's just copy all this.

24

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:38,430
And my first video and it's just a video a movie or something like for movie player.

25

00:01:38,870  -->  00:01:50,370
And we will change this to reflect the video model and to do that let's just import that on top.

26

00:01:50,380  -->  00:01:55,590
Here we go.

27

00:01:55,590  -->  00:01:57,240
All right.

28

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:59,830
Let's create those two real quick.

29

00:02:00,540  -->  00:02:03,620
And you know why the same time let's add some some stuff to it.

30

00:02:03,630  -->  00:02:07,470
Let's find the tag for

31

00:02:11,390  -->  00:02:12,810
actually the tag another Porsche.

32

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:14,360
Let's find the tag.

33

00:02:14,640  -->  00:02:16,930
And this is it.

34

00:02:16,960  -->  00:02:23,910
Find tag number one when a signed tag number one to this post right here.

35

00:02:23,940  -->  00:02:30,430
So we're going to see pools safe actually.

36

00:02:30,720  -->  00:02:34,930
We're going to see tags and then save.

37

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:37,550
OK.

38

00:02:37,590  -->  00:02:40,480
And we're going to save that tag on top there.

39

00:02:41,070  -->  00:02:42,260
OK.

40

00:02:42,300  -->  00:02:46,940
Then we got to go and create a video.

41

00:02:46,940  -->  00:02:49,130
Is this the same at the same time.

42

00:02:49,350  -->  00:02:50,970
And also sign attached to it.

43

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:57,500
And this this tag is going to be I'm going to put in tag number one here and tag number two.

44

00:02:58,050  -->  00:03:02,230
So this is going to be like this.

45

00:03:02,480  -->  00:03:05,920
Number two here.

46

00:03:06,030  -->  00:03:07,100
All right.

47

00:03:07,620  -->  00:03:09,220
And.

48

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:11,480
OK.

49

00:03:11,980  -->  00:03:14,980
When you say I mean see VDU

50

00:03:19,680  -->  00:03:20,880
video tags

51

00:03:23,430  -->  00:03:25,090
save.

52

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:26,810
OK.

53

00:03:27,320  -->  00:03:29,300
And we're going to say tag number two in here.

54

00:03:29,310  -->  00:03:30,010
All right.

55

00:03:30,270  -->  00:03:31,810
I think we're good to go here.

56

00:03:31,830  -->  00:03:32,160
OK.

57

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:40,110
I hope you see what we are doing we just create into our we associate it with creating a post and then

58

00:03:40,110  -->  00:03:45,520
we associate it in tag number one with it which is the tag would ID know of one.

59

00:03:45,780  -->  00:03:51,630
And right here we're saving it right and then we were creating a video and then we associate in tag

60

00:03:51,630  -->  00:03:55,140
number two would ID number two of course and we're saving it.

61

00:03:55,140  -->  00:03:55,770
All right cool.

62

00:03:55,770  -->  00:03:57,240
Let's see if this works.

63

00:03:57,480  -->  00:04:01,050
Hopefully we get some temporary so that way makes this a little exciting right guys.

64

00:04:01,230  -->  00:04:03,600
I don't want you to fall asleep here OK.

65

00:04:03,830  -->  00:04:06,150
So I don't think this is a seam.

66

00:04:06,160  -->  00:04:19,220
No that's do poorly morphic many are we already had are there many too many.

67

00:04:19,710  -->  00:04:25,220
And then create no errors.

68

00:04:25,490  -->  00:04:26,330
Geez.

69

00:04:26,340  -->  00:04:29,300
First post first video.

70

00:04:29,300  -->  00:04:30,080
Look at that.

71

00:04:30,150  -->  00:04:32,930
Let's look at Tagalongs anti-Bible.

72

00:04:33,000  -->  00:04:38,660
So we got the tag uble for polls so that means we have pulse with the of one.

73

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:42,060
We have the tag I.D. sociÃ©tÃ© with that.

74

00:04:42,120  -->  00:04:47,510
And here we have the video number one with a tag ID number two associated with that.

75

00:04:47,520  -->  00:04:49,220
That's beautiful right guys.

76

00:04:49,410  -->  00:04:54,780
I mean we really really created something really amazing in a couple lines with Clarabelle right three

77

00:04:54,780  -->  00:04:55,440
lines.

78

00:04:55,440  -->  00:04:59,510
This would take a lot of lines in native BHB right.

79

00:04:59,610  -->  00:05:03,190
But anyway I think this lecture was long enough I'll see you in the next lectures.

80

00:05:03,340  -->  00:05:05,310
And good job if you follow me.

81

00:05:05,310  -->  00:05:05,940
All right.

82

00:05:06,000  -->  00:05:06,830
Take care.
