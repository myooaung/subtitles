1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,800
All right.

2

00:00:00,840  -->  00:00:04,970
Welcome back my dear student.

3

00:00:05,010  -->  00:00:11,010
All right so we are kind of done with this forum right here from this guy.

4

00:00:11,010  -->  00:00:13,900
It's time for us to start playing around with the controller right.

5

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:17,550
So first of all I want to ask somebody they been do this right.

6

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:18,450
That would be cool.

7

00:00:18,460  -->  00:00:20,020
And we already did therefore create.

8

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:21,150
So we would create.

9

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:24,280
All we got right here is an includes file.

10

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:26,090
So we're going to copy that.

11

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:27,580
We're going to take it to edit.

12

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:31,410
As a matter of fact we already have it included here we don't have to do that.

13

00:00:31,440  -->  00:00:36,020
All we have to do is go to our Controller.

14

00:00:36,040  -->  00:00:36,540
All right.

15

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:43,310
And on our update we need to use the user requests user's requests.

16

00:00:43,350  -->  00:00:45,650
That's all we've got to do there.

17

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:46,360
All right.

18

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:48,950
We already have an included up here.

19

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:53,730
So once we do that we can decimate data now on less.

20

00:00:53,730  -->  00:00:54,690
Everything is filled.

21

00:00:54,690  -->  00:00:57,710
Let's just refresh refresh here.

22

00:00:57,720  -->  00:00:58,780
And as you can see.

23

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:01,820
Well we need to find a place for this error.

24

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:03,470
They are a better place for it.

25

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:06,900
As you can see you can tell that was missing there.

26

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:07,720
OK.

27

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:08,600
All right.

28

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:13,090
So let's go back and try to fix that a little bit.

29

00:01:13,210  -->  00:01:14,160
That's OK.

30

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:17,700
Let's go to are at it

31

00:01:20,860  -->  00:01:24,180
let's see where is breaking.

32

00:01:24,390  -->  00:01:26,550
Everything is like that.

33

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:31,330
It would be nice to have this in a different row.

34

00:01:31,620  -->  00:01:33,900
So we're going to get a class or row.

35

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:38,190
Let's see if that fixes the problem.

36

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:40,520
You can do that as well if you want.

37

00:01:40,540  -->  00:01:45,570
If you have in this type of issue.

38

00:01:45,570  -->  00:01:46,240
Right.

39

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:47,290
OK.

40

00:01:47,800  -->  00:01:49,360
You say this is a problem.

41

00:01:49,420  -->  00:01:56,340
Well let's go back here and let's see what else can we do to it.

42

00:01:56,370  -->  00:01:59,900
All right.

43

00:02:03,240  -->  00:02:05,030
All right.

44

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:09,060
Don't mess with Edwin and telling you right now because

45

00:02:13,770  -->  00:02:17,480
I hate when that happens guys.

46

00:02:17,670  -->  00:02:19,020
I really don't.

47

00:02:19,090  -->  00:02:20,510
No one's going to write it down.

48

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:24,720
Just stop trying to be lazy typing and stuff.

49

00:02:24,720  -->  00:02:33,220
And so you get used to copy and paste and you don't want to type anymore

50

00:02:39,520  -->  00:02:44,590
or use indenting a little bit there.

51

00:02:44,630  -->  00:02:45,210
All right.

52

00:02:45,210  -->  00:02:46,550
So let's see if that works.

53

00:02:46,550  -->  00:02:48,450
I just added another role there.

54

00:02:48,750  -->  00:02:52,310
Hopefully that will do something.

55

00:02:52,310  -->  00:02:54,590
As you can see did it help though.

56

00:02:55,140  -->  00:02:55,470
All right.

57

00:02:55,470  -->  00:02:58,690
Of course you can make the arrow a little smaller than now you can change it.

58

00:02:58,710  -->  00:03:01,140
There is a lot of bootstrap style swearers.

59

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:02,090
OK.

60

00:03:02,100  -->  00:03:09,250
All right but anyway let's go and go and play around with our users controller.

61

00:03:10,050  -->  00:03:13,170
And here we're going to go to the update.

62

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:14,800
OK.

63

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:19,620
So let's test this out first and let's make sure that we are receiving all these data.

64

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:22,730
OK.

65

00:03:22,730  -->  00:03:23,220
And we go

66

00:03:26,100  -->  00:03:28,570
right now and they've been checking for the ID.

67

00:03:29,010  -->  00:03:29,580
We should.

68

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:37,060
But this use this play something here.

69

00:03:37,080  -->  00:03:37,980
There we go.

70

00:03:37,980  -->  00:03:39,800
All right so it's working.

71

00:03:39,850  -->  00:03:40,130
All right.

72

00:03:40,170  -->  00:03:41,450
So let's start.

73

00:03:42,030  -->  00:03:44,000
So the first thing that we got to do what is it.

74

00:03:44,250  -->  00:03:46,680
Well we got to find the user right.

75

00:03:47,610  -->  00:04:00,000
So we find the user and which is eloquent and we say fine or fail whatever use or this is all right

76

00:04:00,010  -->  00:04:00,900
.

77

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:04,570
And that's our least we've got the user now.

78

00:04:04,620  -->  00:04:05,670
That's OK.

79

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:07,760
Now let's check for pictures.

80

00:04:07,950  -->  00:04:12,930
Well first of all let's grab the input for that.

81

00:04:12,990  -->  00:04:13,410
And

82

00:04:16,440  -->  00:04:18,640
I don't know what's going on with me today guys.

83

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:20,960
I think I need more coffee.

84

00:04:21,570  -->  00:04:23,850
I see there are no

85

00:04:27,030  -->  00:04:33,980
requests file and the name was for the ID I believe.

86

00:04:34,230  -->  00:04:35,530
Yes.

87

00:04:36,180  -->  00:04:36,720
OK.

88

00:04:36,840  -->  00:04:40,680
So we check checking for the file we already done this as a matter of fact you can copy and paste if

89

00:04:40,680  -->  00:04:45,930
you like but I would prefer for you to type it in and that's why I'm typing here guys because I want

90

00:04:45,930  -->  00:04:48,870
you guys to type as well.

91

00:04:48,980  -->  00:04:49,730
Right.

92

00:04:50,130  -->  00:04:57,080
And we're going to come cottony with the name.

93

00:04:57,210  -->  00:04:58,790
All right.

94

00:04:59,700  -->  00:05:10,280
Now we just got to move this Whoops to images and we give it a name.

95

00:05:10,380  -->  00:05:11,780
Cool.

96

00:05:11,790  -->  00:05:13,340
All right.

97

00:05:14,220  -->  00:05:14,940
This is good.

98

00:05:14,940  -->  00:05:18,030
All right so we got to leave it.

99

00:05:18,030  -->  00:05:23,330
We're going to leave this live this lecture for the rest of this for the next lecture.

100

00:05:23,330  -->  00:05:25,440
More right now we have completed enough.

101

00:05:25,440  -->  00:05:26,190
All right.

102

00:05:26,340  -->  00:05:31,800
I think you have a pretty good idea how we're going to complete this but you're welcome to finish this

103

00:05:31,800  -->  00:05:34,620
off and then compare your call with me in the next lecture.

104

00:05:34,620  -->  00:05:37,770
Right now I'm going to go and get some coffee.

105

00:05:37,770  -->  00:05:38,640
All right guys.

106

00:05:38,700  -->  00:05:40,780
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
