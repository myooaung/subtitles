1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:03,600
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture we didn't get done.

2

00:00:03,630  -->  00:00:04,530
A lot of a lot.

3

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:08,840
Because I want to make these lectures short shorts or short.

4

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:09,590
OK.

5

00:00:09,750  -->  00:00:14,210
I said it correctly guys my English is getting worse by the minute anyway.

6

00:00:14,610  -->  00:00:18,270
So what we're going to be doing in this lecture is going to be doing a lot more than what we did in

7

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:19,240
the last one.

8

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:24,840
But just to give you some information we can actually make the logging views.

9

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:25,430
All right.

10

00:00:25,580  -->  00:00:31,410
We're going to do that little make Auth. BHB Ortiz in command and we're going to create that because

11

00:00:31,410  -->  00:00:33,080
I like to see something already right.

12

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:35,470
I know you would like to see something created.

13

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:38,190
And so we're going to take care of that so let's do that right now.

14

00:00:38,190  -->  00:00:42,370
BHB Ortiz and make off.

15

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:43,480
All right.

16

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:51,120
Let's see if we get our application working already because we just want to see something going right

17

00:00:51,130  -->  00:00:51,790
.

18

00:00:52,300  -->  00:00:53,040
All right.

19

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:53,550
All right.

20

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:57,210
We can see that our application is already taking form.

21

00:00:57,210  -->  00:00:57,730
All right.

22

00:00:57,840  -->  00:01:01,470
We can register users right out the gate right now.

23

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:03,690
All right cool.

24

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:04,200
All right.

25

00:01:04,200  -->  00:01:13,530
So now let's talk about what we're going to be doing for for this application a little bit more in depth

26

00:01:13,540  -->  00:01:13,890
.

27

00:01:14,220  -->  00:01:20,100
So let's actually open up our resources views we're going to have a couple of folders.

28

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:20,540
Right.

29

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:23,920
And it's actually synchronizes.

30

00:01:24,650  -->  00:01:25,260
There we go.

31

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:28,890
We've got we're going to have a couple of four days besides this four days that we already have.

32

00:01:29,100  -->  00:01:35,540
I think we should put Adam in a separate folder all the admin stuff in one separate folder.

33

00:01:35,640  -->  00:01:36,600
We don't have to.

34

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:41,220
We can actually use middleware to actually prevent users from going into those folders so we don't have

35

00:01:41,220  -->  00:01:45,870
to really create an admin folder and block everybody from there we don't have to do that with Clarabell

36

00:01:45,900  -->  00:01:46,060
.

37

00:01:46,060  -->  00:01:51,420
Gay is a simple as actually creating a middleware and preventing the user from going to different sections

38

00:01:51,420  -->  00:01:52,690
of our application.

39

00:01:52,890  -->  00:02:02,310
So creating an admin folder Users folder or inside the admin ampoules for their entire admin maybe creating

40

00:02:02,310  -->  00:02:05,340
a subscriber for there and a alter for them.

41

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:06,220
How about that.

42

00:02:06,350  -->  00:02:08,430
All right why don't we just do that right now.

43

00:02:08,430  -->  00:02:08,960
Real quick.

44

00:02:09,000  -->  00:02:12,870
All right let's just create a couple of folders just to get things going.

45

00:02:12,870  -->  00:02:15,920
And as a matter of fact and going I'm going to start with admin.

46

00:02:16,070  -->  00:02:19,010
That's for that that we're going to be starting with.

47

00:02:19,020  -->  00:02:24,020
So I mean is going to have an end it's of course Gladman.

48

00:02:24,150  -->  00:02:30,300
We're going to have users folder and users for that is going to have an index.

49

00:02:30,780  -->  00:02:31,330
All right.

50

00:02:31,350  -->  00:02:40,890
So we're going to take a little bit further and we can have a pulse and we can also have categories

51

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:41,490
.

52

00:02:41,490  -->  00:02:47,010
All right so we can say categories and it's all right.

53

00:02:47,250  -->  00:02:51,100
So now we're going to think about this a little bit around users.

54

00:02:51,270  -->  00:02:53,140
Let's start with categories and categories.

55

00:02:53,190  -->  00:02:53,930
What are we going to do.

56

00:02:53,940  -->  00:03:00,960
What I showed you in the demo is that in that we had we were able to create categories and we were able

57

00:03:00,960  -->  00:03:03,880
to see them we can kill two birds in one shot here.

58

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:08,400
So all we really need is a netted page for this one here.

59

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:10,330
All right.

60

00:03:11,580  -->  00:03:13,170
And you can make this however you want.

61

00:03:13,180  -->  00:03:15,880
I just I'm just showing you a way of doing it guys.

62

00:03:16,020  -->  00:03:18,540
If you can come up with a better way.

63

00:03:18,540  -->  00:03:21,670
Once you finish this course you can do whatever you want right.

64

00:03:21,690  -->  00:03:27,180
This is just my way for showing you for demonstrating some of the features that we have learned already

65

00:03:27,180  -->  00:03:27,290
.

66

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:29,060
Some of the techniques are right.

67

00:03:29,160  -->  00:03:30,300
Some polls here.

68

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:33,990
We're going to create what we're going to create to create.

69

00:03:34,290  -->  00:03:39,000
And we are also going to do the edits here.

70

00:03:39,020  -->  00:03:44,010
All right I told you we were going to get a little bit more done in this lecture on the last one and

71

00:03:44,010  -->  00:03:49,780
users we're going to have a create page for users of course in the edit page.

72

00:03:49,980  -->  00:03:54,780
We're going to start with the admin user guys then we're going to jump into altar's and then we're going

73

00:03:54,780  -->  00:03:55,880
to jump into subscribers.

74

00:03:55,880  -->  00:04:00,140
I want to create at least three roles so that what you guys know exactly how to do this.

75

00:04:00,270  -->  00:04:00,720
All right.

76

00:04:00,720  -->  00:04:03,290
And and that's why he's at it.

77

00:04:03,300  -->  00:04:04,420
Beautiful.

78

00:04:04,440  -->  00:04:07,050
I think we should we have enough to start.

79

00:04:07,410  -->  00:04:08,320
All right.

80

00:04:08,820  -->  00:04:15,910
We got to work really hard on admin right now because on admin We need to attack the users.

81

00:04:16,040  -->  00:04:20,790
How do we attack him but I mean we need to attack the U.S. we need to do this section really good.

82

00:04:20,790  -->  00:04:25,320
We need to make sure that users can be created for madmen.

83

00:04:25,350  -->  00:04:28,130
We can we've got to make sure that they can be edited.

84

00:04:28,170  -->  00:04:33,300
We've got to be able to view them right and give them access to different parts of our application.

85

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:39,240
So we've got to do a lot of work here first on users before we can move on to the rest of the application

86

00:04:39,260  -->  00:04:39,360
.

87

00:04:39,450  -->  00:04:40,280
All right.

88

00:04:40,350  -->  00:04:41,160
All right cool.

89

00:04:41,340  -->  00:04:44,850
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
