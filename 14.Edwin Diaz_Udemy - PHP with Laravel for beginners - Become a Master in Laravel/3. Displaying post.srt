1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,570
All right.

2

00:00:00,570  -->  00:00:01,930
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,940  -->  00:00:04,210
STUDENT So we don't have any polls right now.

4

00:00:04,210  -->  00:00:04,500
All right.

5

00:00:04,500  -->  00:00:06,150
We just created the migration.

6

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:14,520
If we go back to our project here and our editor lets actually come back here real quick and let's play

7

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:15,650
around with thinker a little bit.

8

00:00:15,670  -->  00:00:21,840
This go to thinker which Fiore's and thinker and let's just create some quick data.

9

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:22,430
All right.

10

00:00:22,490  -->  00:00:24,480
Nothing too fancy here.

11

00:00:24,670  -->  00:00:42,160
And let's just say post and make sure this new new post and let's create something here real quick.

12

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:44,000
All right.

13

00:00:44,670  -->  00:00:49,590
So while we can do is we can say

14

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:57,900
we don't have to actually create it if we do use is meant that we don't create a guys so you could just

15

00:00:57,900  -->  00:01:00,920
persisted to the database and inspect it if you want.

16

00:01:00,990  -->  00:01:01,760
All right.

17

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:04,220
But you've got to take this method out of there.

18

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:04,890
But anyway

19

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,630
let's create.

20

00:01:12,320  -->  00:01:21,900
Let's just make a title out of it and I'd say something like my first post and Lescure a body

21

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:34,150
of I love Clarabelle with 20 years Antar Whoops.

22

00:01:34,780  -->  00:01:36,870
Don't expect to how a syntax error somewhere.

23

00:01:36,870  -->  00:01:40,340
Let's find out where it is.

24

00:01:41,970  -->  00:01:43,550
Oh one thing guys.

25

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:45,020
And that's why you can't miss the lecture.

26

00:01:45,030  -->  00:01:47,260
Let's actually put.

27

00:01:47,570  -->  00:01:52,750
I just remember here to put my line in the editor.

28

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:54,020
Show line numbers.

29

00:01:54,020  -->  00:01:54,420
All right.

30

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:56,000
Really cool.

31

00:01:56,100  -->  00:02:02,090
I don't use I use them but because I am so used to writing this I don't even look at it anymore.

32

00:02:02,100  -->  00:02:08,440
But it's good to have in mind especially if you're bugging.

33

00:02:08,480  -->  00:02:09,150
All right let's

34

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:15,330
see where the problem is

35

00:02:15,330  -->  00:02:21,540
.

36

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:24,500
We don't need the word Neil here.

37

00:02:24,570  -->  00:02:26,700
And he says mass assignment.

38

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:27,330
OK.

39

00:02:27,450  -->  00:02:33,990
So we need to actually go and make sure there are mass assignment.

40

00:02:33,990  -->  00:02:39,390
We didn't need the word new because we're not creating a new object we already actually are creating

41

00:02:39,390  -->  00:02:40,710
the data directly.

42

00:02:40,710  -->  00:02:41,250
All right.

43

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:44,720
When you want to persist that's when you create a new object.

44

00:02:44,730  -->  00:02:51,480
So let's actually go to a post and let's do some math assignment here real quick.

45

00:02:51,510  -->  00:02:52,780
All right.

46

00:02:52,800  -->  00:02:54,630
Protectin fillable

47

00:02:58,590  -->  00:03:00,160
print is downloadable.

48

00:03:01,170  -->  00:03:05,430
And we're going to make available the category ID.

49

00:03:05,480  -->  00:03:07,790
I think that's OK.

50

00:03:08,030  -->  00:03:13,890
Gorie I mean and what else.

51

00:03:13,890  -->  00:03:15,250
Photo IDs fine

52

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:23,640
that title in the body.

53

00:03:23,660  -->  00:03:24,750
All right.

54

00:03:24,990  -->  00:03:26,520
So let's go and try these again

55

00:03:26,670  -->  00:03:32,500
.

56

00:03:34,500  -->  00:03:36,380
Master Simon title We misspelled.

57

00:03:36,410  -->  00:03:36,980
Probably

58

00:03:40,370  -->  00:03:42,250
no we did not.

59

00:03:43,170  -->  00:03:45,760
OK we have to come out a think actually.

60

00:03:45,990  -->  00:03:50,160
So let's go back page artist and thinker.

61

00:03:51,580  -->  00:03:56,880
All right you have to go back and that's why I love making mistakes guys because if I don't know if

62

00:03:56,880  -->  00:04:01,080
I don't if I don't tell you that it would take you a while for you to figure out that you have to log

63

00:04:01,080  -->  00:04:01,790
back in.

64

00:04:01,890  -->  00:04:03,510
OK.

65

00:04:03,510  -->  00:04:06,210
So let's do it again and let's try this.

66

00:04:06,210  -->  00:04:07,190
There we go.

67

00:04:07,200  -->  00:04:12,930
So now we persist that information to the database and the whole reasoning is to.

68

00:04:12,960  -->  00:04:18,420
So that way we can show some information here but let's just check it real quick.

69

00:04:18,420  -->  00:04:20,540
There we go.

70

00:04:20,990  -->  00:04:28,820
Right now we still have time to go and display some data right here right.

71

00:04:29,010  -->  00:04:31,520
Let's go into that real quick.

72

00:04:31,560  -->  00:04:36,510
You guys know how to do that if you want you can pause a video and try yourself.

73

00:04:36,510  -->  00:04:40,260
Let's go to the controller impulse controller.

74

00:04:40,290  -->  00:04:47,370
This is the end that's when I said polls post here.

75

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:51,420
Let's make sure that we import this on top

76

00:04:54,540  -->  00:04:58,920
compact.

77

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:00,610
All right.

78

00:05:02,190  -->  00:05:02,860
Cool.

79

00:05:03,060  -->  00:05:11,580
So now we go to the aspecific view and we just play that information.

80

00:05:11,580  -->  00:05:12,830
I'm going to use a table.

81

00:05:13,140  -->  00:05:13,700
There we go.

82

00:05:13,710  -->  00:05:17,230
We already have that.

83

00:05:17,230  -->  00:05:18,760
And there we go.

84

00:05:19,470  -->  00:05:27,240
So we're going to say something like if the polls very woods just we're going to display the information

85

00:05:27,240  -->  00:05:38,680
here and if and let's do it for each let's take that object add in there

86

00:05:41,050  -->  00:05:43,350
.

87

00:05:43,620  -->  00:05:52,230
And for we try here remember to do that and start displaying information here let's just play the post

88

00:05:53,040  -->  00:05:55,470
ID right here.

89

00:05:57,120  -->  00:06:01,050
Let's just play the user ID.

90

00:06:01,110  -->  00:06:06,350
We've got to play the user id for now but we wanted to obviously display the owner

91

00:06:09,540  -->  00:06:19,380
and this display the category ID for now until we create a relationship.

92

00:06:20,280  -->  00:06:23,720
Let's just play the photo for now

93

00:06:26,920  -->  00:06:33,870
array and we get it we got to fix this a little bit guys.

94

00:06:34,860  -->  00:06:35,700
Let's see if we.

95

00:06:35,820  -->  00:06:36,870
There we go.

96

00:06:37,440  -->  00:06:46,050
What else Geez a lot to remember.

97

00:06:46,080  -->  00:06:46,610
Right.

98

00:06:46,680  -->  00:06:52,670
Post body.

99

00:06:53,220  -->  00:06:55,300
What is the other one was

100

00:06:57,690  -->  00:07:02,070
.

101

00:07:04,550  -->  00:07:06,380
All right.

102

00:07:08,220  -->  00:07:09,960
All right I think we're done.

103

00:07:09,960  -->  00:07:11,220
What do you think.

104

00:07:11,220  -->  00:07:13,480
All right so I'm going to actually do this.

105

00:07:13,500  -->  00:07:16,970
So you guys don't see me and that plays a very real quick.

106

00:07:16,980  -->  00:07:20,850
All right I just feel this in real quick guys.

107

00:07:20,880  -->  00:07:22,310
All right.

108

00:07:23,040  -->  00:07:24,000
Let's see where we get

109

00:07:27,800  -->  00:07:29,000
answer.

110

00:07:29,040  -->  00:07:32,170
As you can see we have some fields here.

111

00:07:33,310  -->  00:07:33,960
All right.

112

00:07:34,230  -->  00:07:41,220
Obviously we're going to want to display the user here that category in the photo and we want to do

113

00:07:41,220  -->  00:07:44,070
the carbon here as well.

114

00:07:44,070  -->  00:07:57,120
We can do that right now as a matter of fact here we just do diff for humans like this and we can use

115

00:07:57,120  -->  00:08:05,620
copy the same thing for this one back as you can see that changed.

116

00:08:05,640  -->  00:08:07,280
Great.

117

00:08:07,290  -->  00:08:09,180
All right.

118

00:08:09,180  -->  00:08:09,530
Beautiful.

119

00:08:09,540  -->  00:08:13,060
So on the next lecture we're going to set up the relationship and we're going to finish it up.

120

00:08:13,500  -->  00:08:14,990
Thank you so much.

121

00:08:15,000  -->  00:08:15,690
Bye bye.
