1

00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:05,640
All right welcome back I'm a student so on this section here we're going to create a many to many relationship

2

00:00:05,640  -->  00:00:05,880
.

3

00:00:06,030  -->  00:00:12,630
And it's if you remember all right if you remember from you know a couple years ago when we you know

4

00:00:12,630  -->  00:00:17,100
we're learning about the many to many relationship we created three tables Well we had three tables

5

00:00:17,470  -->  00:00:23,850
functioning right we had the roles we had they were all user and we had the users table right.

6

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:26,390
Those three tables need to be related.

7

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:29,100
Right that's what we did before and that's what we do right now.

8

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:33,440
But we are going to be creating the crawl to create Read day and delete.

9

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:36,420
All right so let's open our our editor.

10

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:38,250
We still have the whole project here.

11

00:00:38,250  -->  00:00:39,070
No worries.

12

00:00:39,080  -->  00:00:43,880
Let's just open it open the new one many to many click OK.

13

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:51,570
This window does suffusing BHB storm if not you know how to open it with your editor or ID.

14

00:00:51,570  -->  00:00:52,430
All right cool.

15

00:00:52,620  -->  00:00:58,300
So the first thing that I'm going to do is we've got to set up our database connection real quick.

16

00:00:58,300  -->  00:01:00,000
We're first we need a database right.

17

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:02,360
Let's do that real quick.

18

00:01:02,370  -->  00:01:03,220
All right.

19

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:06,230
So let's go to PH be my admin here.

20

00:01:06,660  -->  00:01:13,690
BHB my admin and let's create a database.

21

00:01:13,710  -->  00:01:19,080
Many to Many relationship I mean database.

22

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:19,770
There we go.

23

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:21,710
That was easy right.

24

00:01:22,500  -->  00:01:24,860
All right cool.

25

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:29,120
So come back here.

26

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:33,820
Many too many beautiful.

27

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:40,270
User name is root password is blank right.

28

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:40,890
All right.

29

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:44,360
So we need a migration right when it's on migrations.

30

00:01:44,430  -->  00:01:49,020
So let's go to database real quick migrations.

31

00:01:49,170  -->  00:01:53,930
We already have the users we need the rolls and they're all user call.

32

00:01:53,940  -->  00:01:57,280
So one of those migration is going to have a model and that's going to be the role.

33

00:01:57,300  -->  00:01:58,590
Right.

34

00:01:58,590  -->  00:01:59,040
All right.

35

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:10,700
So BHP areason migrate and actually let's just create the first one with a model on the migration together

36

00:02:10,710  -->  00:02:12,070
the roles table.

37

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:22,370
So Mario rule and then I am cool if i click here we get that table there.

38

00:02:22,380  -->  00:02:22,880
All right.

39

00:02:22,920  -->  00:02:23,640
Beautiful.

40

00:02:23,640  -->  00:02:26,500
Now let's create a roll user table.

41

00:02:27,170  -->  00:02:27,540
All right.

42

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:31,530
And I hope I hope you remember the convention that we have to follow Al explained to you in a minute

43

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:32,820
if you forgot.

44

00:02:33,030  -->  00:02:33,360
All right.

45

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:41,900
BHB artist and hoops make migration.

46

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:46,500
And this is going to be 3:08 rule.

47

00:02:46,510  -->  00:02:49,530
Use your tea room.

48

00:02:50,990  -->  00:02:52,340
Go.

49

00:02:53,100  -->  00:02:59,580
And it's going to be roll user Antar beautiful.

50

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:00,220
All right let's.

51

00:03:00,270  -->  00:03:03,260
Let me explain to you before I forget to tell you this.

52

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:10,290
Remember that we have to follow this convention with Claribel that way Laura Bell can guess or know

53

00:03:10,320  -->  00:03:12,050
that this is going to be a pivot table.

54

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:19,150
Remember that a pivot pivot table pivot table whatever you want to call it PIII the old t.

55

00:03:19,170  -->  00:03:20,880
Right a lookup table.

56

00:03:20,880  -->  00:03:27,560
So once you follow this convention with making everything basic first of all putting everything alphabetical

57

00:03:27,560  -->  00:03:28,080
order.

58

00:03:28,230  -->  00:03:32,820
So are you know is before they you so we do that right.

59

00:03:33,420  -->  00:03:39,780
And then you're separating two words roll on the score user like that.

60

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:43,460
And of course we make it singular.

61

00:03:43,480  -->  00:03:46,220
All right now roll users roll user.

62

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:48,570
That's how he knows it's a pivot table.

63

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:53,940
That way we can use it like that in Larabee allowable knows the fields the columns and everything.

64

00:03:53,970  -->  00:03:54,270
All right.

65

00:03:54,270  -->  00:03:55,230
So cool.

66

00:03:55,410  -->  00:04:02,250
So now because this is a pivot table we need to give it the IDs of the other tables to relate them.

67

00:04:02,360  -->  00:04:04,960
All right because this is going to be a many to many relationship.

68

00:04:05,250  -->  00:04:05,620
All right.

69

00:04:05,640  -->  00:04:07,650
So integer

70

00:04:10,220  -->  00:04:19,970
and ashes to ashes and the first one is user ID that's by default looking for that and it's not tables

71

00:04:20,000  -->  00:04:21,740
table.

72

00:04:21,960  -->  00:04:23,290
All right.

73

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:30,210
Another integer and this one by the fold is going to be looking for roll ID in all the tables when we

74

00:04:30,210  -->  00:04:32,610
create a real relationship.

75

00:04:32,610  -->  00:04:33,970
All right cool.

76

00:04:33,990  -->  00:04:37,010
You can make this on sign guys.

77

00:04:37,050  -->  00:04:38,580
So it's up to you.

78

00:04:38,770  -->  00:04:40,660
Just like a safety net.

79

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:47,780
You can make of all so-so to you and you can make it in there.

80

00:04:47,800  -->  00:04:49,910
So he looks up this thing.

81

00:04:49,950  -->  00:04:51,800
So he's faster.

82

00:04:51,800  -->  00:04:54,440
All right so we can copy all this stuff.

83

00:04:54,450  -->  00:04:59,150
We want to play this.

84

00:04:59,490  -->  00:05:04,140
All right now just for demonstration purposes only.

85

00:05:04,140  -->  00:05:06,640
I'm not going to make a big application.

86

00:05:06,930  -->  00:05:09,280
I don't need all this.

87

00:05:09,630  -->  00:05:10,880
I can have the index.

88

00:05:10,880  -->  00:05:13,000
That's OK.

89

00:05:14,200  -->  00:05:17,430
As a matter of fact let's just leave it like that.

90

00:05:17,430  -->  00:05:23,990
It really doesn't hurt me on signed and just making sure that this function is good.

91

00:05:24,000  -->  00:05:26,260
All right cool.

92

00:05:26,280  -->  00:05:30,300
They're all stable we need a column here for the rules table.

93

00:05:30,360  -->  00:05:34,570
We need a name for our rolls.

94

00:05:36,930  -->  00:05:40,230
It's going to be a string type.

95

00:05:40,230  -->  00:05:49,320
So we had good rules for all user user ID rule by the cool name.

96

00:05:49,320  -->  00:05:50,340
All right cool.

97

00:05:50,340  -->  00:05:52,810
Now let's do some migration.

98

00:05:52,850  -->  00:05:57,490
Beechfield isn't my great answer.

99

00:05:57,690  -->  00:05:58,450
Beautiful.

100

00:05:58,500  -->  00:06:01,680
Now verify that this has taken place in Europe.

101

00:06:01,700  -->  00:06:05,340
Friedman says you don't want to be migrating to another table.

102

00:06:05,390  -->  00:06:06,040
Right.

103

00:06:06,150  -->  00:06:09,210
So many to many if you click on it you got all your migrations there.

104

00:06:09,210  -->  00:06:10,280
Beautiful.

105

00:06:10,290  -->  00:06:10,950
All right.

106

00:06:10,950  -->  00:06:15,480
So the next lecture we're going to continue with this couple with this new section.

107

00:06:15,480  -->  00:06:19,590
And I wish you the best and I hope you are learning and having a lot of fun guys.

108

00:06:19,620  -->  00:06:21,380
It's my pleasure to teach you.

109

00:06:21,390  -->  00:06:21,810
Thank you.

110

00:06:21,810  -->  00:06:22,890
See you in the next lecture.

111

00:06:22,890  -->  00:06:24,900
Take care.
