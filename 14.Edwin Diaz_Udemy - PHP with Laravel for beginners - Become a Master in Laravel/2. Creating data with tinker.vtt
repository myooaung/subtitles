00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:02.220
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:06.550
It's time for us to learn about thinker thinkers a little command tool that we have.

3

00:00:06.570  -->  00:00:12.030
Well it works with BICI already setting the right but is this little toys going to allow us to play

4

00:00:12.030  -->  00:00:14.860
around with our database school think or t.

5

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:16.280
K e r.

6

00:00:16.370  -->  00:00:17.230
All right.

7

00:00:17.400  -->  00:00:25.120
Now we can play with a database we can create objects and we can insert data into basically the craw

8

00:00:25.130  -->  00:00:30.360
to create read up day in the lead in a database and we can even check for relationships we can do a

9

00:00:30.360  -->  00:00:36.380
lot of stuff here without messing around with route's or the browser or anything like that.

10

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:40.620
So let's let's go ahead and see how we can access this little tool that is really handy.

11

00:00:40.640  -->  00:00:42.040
It comes really handy right.

12

00:00:42.210  -->  00:00:50.160
So what we do is we say BHP artisan thinker center and now we are inside a thinker.

13

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:51.530
You see this.

14

00:00:52.100  -->  00:00:59.790
So HP tells you the PC version that he's using by Justin hillmen and whatever he'll hillmen.

15

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:00.410
All right.

16

00:01:00.720  -->  00:01:02.880
So how do we play around with thinker.

17

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:05.530
Let's actually in on data.

18

00:01:05.810  -->  00:01:06.370
OK.

19

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:07.550
Our table.

20

00:01:08.040  -->  00:01:09.430
Let's actually look.

21

00:01:09.540  -->  00:01:11.100
Table before we do that.

22

00:01:11.100  -->  00:01:14.440
So we had three records here.

23

00:01:14.690  -->  00:01:15.310
OK.

24

00:01:15.600  -->  00:01:17.310
We're going to insert a fourth record.

25

00:01:17.580  -->  00:01:19.320
So that way you can see that it does work.

26

00:01:19.330  -->  00:01:19.820
OK.

27

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:25.330
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable in thinker.

28

00:01:25.470  -->  00:01:26.550
All right.

29

00:01:27.090  -->  00:01:33.440
And they're going to access the namespace of the model I want to use which is post.

30

00:01:33.460  -->  00:01:37.950
Then we're going to call that create method which is a static method right.

31

00:01:38.640  -->  00:01:40.030
And I'm just going to go like this.

32

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:44.390
Just basically the same thing with doing the route but inside thinker.

33

00:01:44.610  -->  00:01:53.740
So we're going to put the title BHB from BHB post from thinker.

34

00:01:55.600  -->  00:01:58.250
We would do that.

35

00:01:58.320  -->  00:02:01.200
Contemned this is going to take an associate of array remember that.

36

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:07.150
And here is the speech content.

37

00:02:07.360  -->  00:02:08.960
I think something like that.

38

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:10.270
I'm just playing around with it.

39

00:02:10.440  -->  00:02:11.420
Enter.

40

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:15.570
We have an arrow there let's go back and we

41

00:02:20.710  -->  00:02:21.520
content

42

00:02:26.330  -->  00:02:27.450
.

43

00:02:28.080  -->  00:02:32.820
The reason why he's doing this is because we don't have an array here.

44

00:02:32.820  -->  00:02:43.140
All right so make sure that you have an array and we enter and now you can see that we have a new title

45

00:02:43.230  -->  00:02:43.640
.

46

00:02:43.860  -->  00:02:48.260
I mean a new post would it id number five and you can see this information here.

47

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:51.840
Now if you want to ask is that a game if you want to see it you can click them.

48

00:02:52.020  -->  00:02:56.130
You can write post and click enter again it would give you that article again they just created that

49

00:02:56.130  -->  00:02:57.030
post.

50

00:02:57.060  -->  00:03:01.620
So we come here to the beach we miasm menu refresh you can see that new data here.

51

00:03:01.620  -->  00:03:03.660
Now you can also

52

00:03:06.570  -->  00:03:08.420
play around with it for entering data.

53

00:03:08.430  -->  00:03:11.610
So you can say I'm going to create another force here

54

00:03:14.760  -->  00:03:17.940
and I'm just going to say I'm just going to create the object.

55

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:18.800
OK.

56

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:20.570
Like this answer.

57

00:03:20.760  -->  00:03:21.210
Whoops

58

00:03:23.650  -->  00:03:24.790
.

59

00:03:25.210  -->  00:03:31.130
Undefined constant.

60

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:31.770
All right.

61

00:03:32.110  -->  00:03:38.150
So I'm going to create this for a quick post.

62

00:03:39.600  -->  00:03:41.210
Oh I was forgetting something.

63

00:03:41.210  -->  00:03:42.660
I know it.

64

00:03:42.690  -->  00:03:43.680
Sorry about that guys.

65

00:03:43.680  -->  00:03:44.210
There we go.

66

00:03:44.230  -->  00:03:47.250
Well just got to see a new post.

67

00:03:47.250  -->  00:03:47.540
OK.

68

00:03:47.550  -->  00:03:49.940
So I just created a object with new polls.

69

00:03:49.950  -->  00:03:50.550
Right.

70

00:03:50.550  -->  00:03:56.730
So now if I want to see the object I go post Antar and that's the object.

71

00:03:56.730  -->  00:04:04.900
Now we can go heading out the properties like this and we can assign values to them.

72

00:04:05.040  -->  00:04:14.880
So I can say new title from this object.

73

00:04:15.190  -->  00:04:16.430
Yea.

74

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:23.360
I say yea enter now you can see that a fight try to pull up the object.

75

00:04:23.370  -->  00:04:25.510
We have a title for the object right.

76

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:28.200
Now keep in mind that this has not been persisted.

77

00:04:28.200  -->  00:04:35.300
It has not being entered into the database yet so let's refresh and you can see that it's not here.

78

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:40.950
So we can play around with it as we can build the object involved in not put anything there.

79

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:52.330
So I can come here again and I can say content Yeah maybe I'm coding.

80

00:04:52.590  -->  00:04:55.340
Actually I got escaped.

81

00:04:56.290  -->  00:05:00.800
I'm coding actually getting to because I already have the double quotes.

82

00:05:00.810  -->  00:05:06.530
That's fine on coding and doing some or something like that.

83

00:05:06.570  -->  00:05:09.060
That's cool answer.

84

00:05:09.150  -->  00:05:12.540
And you can see if we pull out the object.

85

00:05:12.540  -->  00:05:17.390
Now we have two pieces of information right.

86

00:05:17.460  -->  00:05:21.150
We have the title and we have the conta if you want to save it to the database.

87

00:05:21.150  -->  00:05:23.450
Super simple post.

88

00:05:24.000  -->  00:05:29.310
And then we call the Save method right into whoops

89

00:05:31.980  -->  00:05:35.100
parsed syntax on Expect Oh I forgot my

90

00:05:38.400  -->  00:05:41.910
my Dahlia's sorry Antar is true.

91

00:05:41.940  -->  00:05:43.440
That means he was saved.

92

00:05:43.810  -->  00:05:52.710
OK we can bring it back and you can see it has been saved with the updated created and everything.

93

00:05:52.720  -->  00:06:01.170
And if we go back to my admin is click on refresh and we can see that new data has been into all the

94

00:06:01.170  -->  00:06:02.200
fields that we need.

95

00:06:02.340  -->  00:06:03.670
Pretty cool stuff right.

96

00:06:03.960  -->  00:06:09.550
But anyway on the next election I'm going to show you some more thinker commands and how we can do all

97

00:06:09.550  -->  00:06:11.480
the things with data which is pretty cool.

98

00:06:11.820  -->  00:06:12.870
Thank you so much for watching.

99

00:06:12.870  -->  00:06:13.920
I'll see you in the next lecture
