1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,660
All right.

2

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:01,890
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:03,600
I'm a student in this lecture.

4

00:00:03,660  -->  00:00:08,910
We are going to be taking a look on how to create and not Slessor in Lara bell.

5

00:00:08,910  -->  00:00:09,690
All right.

6

00:00:10,020  -->  00:00:17,490
They are accessories a mutator is that sensors are do the functionality that pulls data out of the database

7

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:21,950
without doing and then being able to manipulate it before we get it out.

8

00:00:21,960  -->  00:00:29,910
Now the the mutator is I the is the functionality where we can actually set a value before we go to

9

00:00:29,910  -->  00:00:33,960
the database and manipulate the value and set it in the database.

10

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:38,070
All right so let me show you how we we could do that.

11

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:39,870
So let's go ahead and create.

12

00:00:40,410  -->  00:00:41,520
Let's see what we got here.

13

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:45,860
We've got a route of dates right there.

14

00:00:46,320  -->  00:00:51,140
We are still inside that group so let's go and do something real quick clicks access.

15

00:00:51,270  -->  00:00:53,130
Use an access or let's define what.

16

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:53,720
OK.

17

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:58,440
So let's create a route.

18

00:00:58,440  -->  00:01:00,030
Real quick.

19

00:01:00,510  -->  00:01:06,900
Let's just the roads and we will say we're going to call this

20

00:01:14,990  -->  00:01:16,010
get name.

21

00:01:16,260  -->  00:01:16,860
OK.

22

00:01:16,970  -->  00:01:22,710
So that's what we're going to do we've got to get the name Ryan notchy view from the or call column

23

00:01:23,670  -->  00:01:25,000
from the user model.

24

00:01:25,010  -->  00:01:26,190
We've got to get that out.

25

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:28,140
And we're going to manipulate it before we get it out.

26

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:29,320
So that's what we're going to do.

27

00:01:29,550  -->  00:01:30,620
Ok cool.

28

00:01:30,630  -->  00:01:38,100
So I'm going to say user We're going to use a user model here I'm going to find the first user and bring

29

00:01:38,100  -->  00:01:38,540
him out.

30

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:39,380
OK.

31

00:01:39,540  -->  00:01:44,430
Of course we can't say user name and we're going to see that name.

32

00:01:44,430  -->  00:01:48,450
So let's let's go ahead and open up a

33

00:01:52,540  -->  00:01:55,000
new browser here.

34

00:01:55,260  -->  00:01:57,180
And if we go to get name

35

00:01:59,970  -->  00:02:05,580
I can get maybe we don't have a user.

36

00:02:07,750  -->  00:02:08,750
Let's see.

37

00:02:09,210  -->  00:02:12,480
Let's check our BHB admin first.

38

00:02:12,750  -->  00:02:19,010
Let's see we have a user there.

39

00:02:22,200  -->  00:02:26,200
Let's go and see Pidge be my man.

40

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:29,460
And that's what I love else.

41

00:02:29,500  -->  00:02:34,390
Mass and users.

42

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:38,540
All right looks like we don't have a user I don't know maybe you do.

43

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:46,340
So I'm going to put all lowercase and India's e-mail.

44

00:02:47,730  -->  00:02:50,020
That's all I'm going to do for the user.

45

00:02:50,400  -->  00:02:50,800
OK.

46

00:02:50,820  -->  00:02:52,400
And the password.

47

00:02:53,230  -->  00:02:55,660
Ok cool enter.

48

00:02:55,890  -->  00:02:58,400
And now we can see that we pulao that user.

49

00:02:58,440  -->  00:02:59,140
Cool.

50

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:06,470
So now we are not sir we can't access de-value manipulated before we get there before we we equate.

51

00:03:06,540  -->  00:03:09,180
So let's go to the user model and do that.

52

00:03:09,480  -->  00:03:13,460
Let's go to the user model and is fine the successor now right.

53

00:03:13,460  -->  00:03:16,910
And if you go to the command table which you're going to have a link to.

54

00:03:16,940  -->  00:03:18,500
All right are you going to see exactly how it's done.

55

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:25,380
What I'm going to show it to you is do public function in the way we do this is we say we use a key

56

00:03:25,380  -->  00:03:29,020
the first key when you always have to use this is get.

57

00:03:29,190  -->  00:03:32,830
And then what is it that you want to get.

58

00:03:33,480  -->  00:03:36,960
So now get name.

59

00:03:37,080  -->  00:03:37,550
All right.

60

00:03:37,590  -->  00:03:39,720
And remember this is all going in camel case.

61

00:03:39,720  -->  00:03:44,960
First it starts with a lowercase all right and then everything is Kemel case everywhere.

62

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:46,040
It's in Kemel case.

63

00:03:46,040  -->  00:03:47,100
Uppercase OK.

64

00:03:47,280  -->  00:03:48,390
So good name.

65

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:50,520
And then these were has to go there as well.

66

00:03:50,550  -->  00:03:52,050
Ouch review.

67

00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:53,520
OK.

68

00:03:53,570  -->  00:03:56,850
So look at the convention we use the word get.

69

00:03:56,860  -->  00:04:02,930
Then the name of that column that we want to pulao for get the name of the column we want to get.

70

00:04:02,970  -->  00:04:10,020
And the key word acha you all the time and then whoops you're going to pass a value here.

71

00:04:10,050  -->  00:04:11,710
Could be any very what you want.

72

00:04:11,850  -->  00:04:15,240
I'm using value right here because that's what it is.

73

00:04:15,240  -->  00:04:16,190
Right.

74

00:04:16,860  -->  00:04:19,140
And then we're going to say return.

75

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:21,780
Now you can this is what you mean you played out data.

76

00:04:21,870  -->  00:04:22,470
All right.

77

00:04:22,680  -->  00:04:28,630
So I got to say you see uppercase first and we get to Oprah.

78

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:32,290
Oprah case that all right.

79

00:04:33,420  -->  00:04:40,230
So if we go back there we see that is all lowercase here right now if I refresh.

80

00:04:40,230  -->  00:04:46,250
You can see that the first letter was converted to uppercase.

81

00:04:46,410  -->  00:04:47,140
All right.

82

00:04:47,190  -->  00:04:49,080
I mean you can try whatever you want here.

83

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:49,680
All right.

84

00:04:49,860  -->  00:04:52,980
You can try many different string functions.

85

00:04:52,980  -->  00:04:55,420
String to upper.

86

00:04:55,540  -->  00:04:59,200
Watch this and it's yours to operate.

87

00:04:59,290  -->  00:05:01,570
Enter everything was capitalized.

88

00:05:01,680  -->  00:05:05,060
So you can see it but nothing has been done here though.

89

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:05,790
All right.

90

00:05:05,790  -->  00:05:07,860
And this is where I'm going to get to now.

91

00:05:08,190  -->  00:05:11,630
All right we're going to use a mutator and you can see that we can manipulate the data.

92

00:05:11,640  -->  00:05:18,870
But the mutator works when you actually save the data definitely you convert this to something else

93

00:05:18,870  -->  00:05:19,510
.

94

00:05:19,530  -->  00:05:24,330
So as a matter of fact I'm going to do that in the next lecture so that we can take our time and see

95

00:05:24,330  -->  00:05:25,250
how it works.

96

00:05:25,380  -->  00:05:25,880
OK.

97

00:05:26,010  -->  00:05:29,430
Thank you so much and see you in the next lecture.
