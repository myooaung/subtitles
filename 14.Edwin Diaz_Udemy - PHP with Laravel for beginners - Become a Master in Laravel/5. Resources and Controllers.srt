00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:07,350
All right so when the last lecture I mentioned something about resource right around resource controller

2

00:00:07,370  -->  00:00:07,830
resource.

3

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:09,580
What the heck is that.

4

00:00:09,590  -->  00:00:11,010
Well right what is that right.

5

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:16,810
Well is this a special static function like get.

6

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:17,420
All right.

7

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:25,350
That will give us access to automatically two different types of routes.

8

00:00:25,350  -->  00:00:26,170
All right.

9

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:30,930
That we can use in our controller and I'll show you right now how that works.

10

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:40,290
So I'm going to come in this hour real quick and I'm going to call this special method called resource

11

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:41,350
.

12

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:42,160
All right.

13

00:00:42,730  -->  00:00:43,190
So

14

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:55,810
resource will help us very simply by creating special routes for us that we can use in the controller

15

00:00:55,820  -->  00:00:56,270
sort of.

16

00:00:56,310  -->  00:00:57,600
Let me give you an example.

17

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:01,190
So let's say I want to create everything polls.

18

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:02,380
I'm going to write it down.

19

00:01:02,590  -->  00:01:08,510
Fluoro and I'm going to say pose controller

20

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:12,740
troller.

21

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:20,600
I don't have to type in the method anymore because I'm not just sending requests for the method and

22

00:01:20,730  -->  00:01:26,170
it's sending a request for Create of they delete destroy all that stuff right here.

23

00:01:26,210  -->  00:01:33,360
All right re update creating delete or destroy are already here.

24

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:34,970
So let me show you right now.

25

00:01:35,130  -->  00:01:41,490
So if I go to my little terminal right here and I type in THP artists and you can do this in the regular

26

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:50,790
terminal remember guys and I say route Kallen list enter logo is

27

00:01:53,610  -->  00:02:02,820
with that route that I gave in the first parameter of the method pose he created for me some name routes

28

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:05,560
already polls that in this that store.

29

00:02:05,580  -->  00:02:08,200
So it created all this resources for me.

30

00:02:08,270  -->  00:02:11,000
These names automatically.

31

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:17,250
What that does for me is that not only does it create the names but it also creates the methods in which

32

00:02:17,250  -->  00:02:18,710
there are sent.

33

00:02:18,870  -->  00:02:24,130
So we can see that this post created a send as I get requests.

34

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:25,380
Right.

35

00:02:26,190  -->  00:02:32,690
Because we don't have any information we send in data for this wonderful post that is strongly.

36

00:02:33,100  -->  00:02:34,650
All right.

37

00:02:34,650  -->  00:02:41,010
We are sending some type of ID these get Same with a method that the leading method that special in

38

00:02:41,020  -->  00:02:44,790
Claribel right is very secure.

39

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:50,870
Another one is tools for Slash post update for updating.

40

00:02:50,880  -->  00:02:53,590
We send that as a put or patch.

41

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:59,070
We talk a little bit about that later in the course how we use this patch.

42

00:02:59,070  -->  00:03:06,090
This one is saying as I get to show and this only sends does it get to edit.

43

00:03:06,220  -->  00:03:06,790
All right.

44

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:12,620
So let me show you real quick.

45

00:03:12,990  -->  00:03:22,770
So now if let's say I want to see something right I want to be able to see I'm going to use polls in

46

00:03:22,770  -->  00:03:31,780
my in my view or L polls for us last idea or something might show you that.

47

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:37,830
So let's go to the controller and let's go to the I meant the show right here.

48

00:03:38,070  -->  00:03:41,620
So you can go into a return.

49

00:03:42,810  -->  00:03:56,270
This is this show meant that Yay yea now I'm always exaggerating with my words right.

50

00:03:56,310  -->  00:03:58,410
All right.

51

00:03:58,410  -->  00:04:03,060
So we can see that it is showing an I.D. there.

52

00:04:03,690  -->  00:04:10,210
And if we go to that show right here we see that it does have an I.D. right.

53

00:04:10,350  -->  00:04:12,830
So we have to type it in like that right here.

54

00:04:12,840  -->  00:04:16,180
So enter it doesn't find it.

55

00:04:17,220  -->  00:04:17,820
OK.

56

00:04:18,030  -->  00:04:19,020
That's because

57

00:04:22,380  -->  00:04:23,580
that's fine though.

58

00:04:23,670  -->  00:04:29,800
Real quick.

59

00:04:29,800  -->  00:04:33,740
That's because we're now using that I.D. right here.

60

00:04:33,750  -->  00:04:36,890
So let's use that.

61

00:04:36,910  -->  00:04:41,930
There we go.

62

00:04:42,000  -->  00:04:44,830
PPOs actually is because I wasn't in spudding right.

63

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:46,710
Enter.

64

00:04:46,920  -->  00:04:47,250
All right.

65

00:04:47,250  -->  00:04:52,050
And not only that but we are also passing the I.D. I wasn't putting it correctly before.

66

00:04:52,050  -->  00:04:52,840
All right.

67

00:04:53,160  -->  00:04:54,490
So I hope you see that.

68

00:04:54,810  -->  00:05:04,440
Now if we want to access let's say another method let's call it the method create.

69

00:05:04,490  -->  00:05:05,870
All right.

70

00:05:06,510  -->  00:05:12,740
We can go to the Met to create and just giving giving you an example and we get every turn.

71

00:05:13,860  -->  00:05:21,710
I am the method that creates stuff.

72

00:05:22,110  -->  00:05:23,380
All right.

73

00:05:23,880  -->  00:05:31,790
So now if I go in there you are able and I say pose for Slash create enter.

74

00:05:32,010  -->  00:05:34,350
You can see that that the I guess return.

75

00:05:34,500  -->  00:05:43,900
So what we did was with the resource is that we were able to create all this you are well.

76

00:05:44,320  -->  00:05:53,370
All right parameters for us automatically with our methods that the data gets sent with not only that

77

00:05:53,400  -->  00:06:01,890
but we also have name routes so we could use his name routes in whatever we want our application we

78

00:06:01,890  -->  00:06:05,940
can use it in a link to say in listening user.

79

00:06:05,940  -->  00:06:10,930
If you go to polls that in it's one you are going to go to this part of my application.

80

00:06:11,190  -->  00:06:18,300
Hey user if you go to post that create I want to send you to this part of my web site or application

81

00:06:18,690  -->  00:06:24,600
which is going to allow you to create a user or a post in the form.

82

00:06:24,600  -->  00:06:25,140
All right.

83

00:06:25,410  -->  00:06:36,750
So we without resource we get all this action our name routes I you or I in our methods that the data

84

00:06:36,840  -->  00:06:38,150
that data gets sent.

85

00:06:38,280  -->  00:06:43,430
So this right here this post astore we get post data right here.

86

00:06:43,470  -->  00:06:44,120
All right.

87

00:06:44,310  -->  00:06:54,510
So if a user types in goes to post all right automatically we can create some type of page there that

88

00:06:54,510  -->  00:07:01,500
will send a post request to our database to ask for information or to even input information in our

89

00:07:01,500  -->  00:07:01,970
database.

90

00:07:01,980  -->  00:07:03,690
A super secure.

91

00:07:03,690  -->  00:07:07,430
All right we're going to see that in the application that we will be building later on.

92

00:07:07,440  -->  00:07:13,830
I just want to you do have some really good information on what you know we can do we're resource in

93

00:07:13,830  -->  00:07:20,330
how we communicate it to our polls to our control methods here.

94

00:07:20,650  -->  00:07:22,970
OK I hope you have a really good idea on why they are.

95

00:07:23,070  -->  00:07:24,540
You can go ahead and try the edit.

96

00:07:24,550  -->  00:07:27,790
Will they all the same as long as you follow this convention.

97

00:07:28,020  -->  00:07:30,250
If you don't follow the convention that is here.

98

00:07:30,780  -->  00:07:32,580
It's not going to work for you.

99

00:07:32,640  -->  00:07:37,270
Make sure that you follow this you or I hear all of this.

100

00:07:37,400  -->  00:07:44,210
Here you are else here have an idea after the after the four slash.

101

00:07:44,820  -->  00:07:46,310
All right.

102

00:07:47,280  -->  00:07:52,390
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

103

00:07:52,410  -->  00:07:53,700
Take care.
