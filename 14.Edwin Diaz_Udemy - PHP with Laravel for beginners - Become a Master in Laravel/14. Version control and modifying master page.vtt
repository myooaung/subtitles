00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:03.780
All right welcome back my students I hope you guys are really excited.

2

00:00:03.780  -->  00:00:09.540
We are actually making good progress in this course and learning a lot of new things right.

3

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:10.170
All right.

4

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:14.370
I don't want you to fall asleep in my class or if you're falling asleep or go get some rest and come

5

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:14.970
back.

6

00:00:14.970  -->  00:00:18.930
Drink your coffee if you drink coffee or your natural energy drink.

7

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:19.980
Come back to the class.

8

00:00:19.980  -->  00:00:23.100
I want you here refresh and paying attention.

9

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:23.780
All right.

10

00:00:23.780  -->  00:00:26.700
Anyway we have not done any version control yet.

11

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:27.450
All right.

12

00:00:27.450  -->  00:00:31.190
We need to save our files that we have been creating right.

13

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:34.770
Because what if something happens and we lose everything right.

14

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:39.260
Well I'm not talking about computer backups you should already be doing a computer backup right.

15

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:43.040
She'll really have a hard drive backing up all your stuff automatically.

16

00:00:43.050  -->  00:00:43.810
All right.

17

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:44.770
All right.

18

00:00:44.790  -->  00:00:48.780
Anyway so here I want to do something real quick.

19

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:50.290
I want to fix this here.

20

00:00:50.300  -->  00:00:53.850
I'm going to show you how we're going to be doing styles in this project.

21

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:57.070
So I'm going to do a little inspect inspection here.

22

00:00:57.080  -->  00:00:59.520
I'm going to find out what's wrong.

23

00:00:59.520  -->  00:01:05.600
I see that the body has some type of padding that is affecting it.

24

00:01:05.670  -->  00:01:15.690
Let's actually play around with padding and actually that's a padding top party type.

25

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:17.200
And 30 pixels.

26

00:01:17.210  -->  00:01:21.420
And as you can see if I increase a he goes down.

27

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:26.140
So if I minimize this to zero.

28

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:29.250
Actually it works it's good.

29

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:30.330
So that's what we got to do.

30

00:01:30.330  -->  00:01:36.240
So we got to get the body here on the Admin Page and we have an ideal ready for that page that I actually

31

00:01:36.240  -->  00:01:40.340
placed there when I was creating that file for you guys.

32

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:45.290
So let's go to our file.

33

00:01:45.880  -->  00:01:48.310
And as you can see has an I.D. here in body.

34

00:01:48.330  -->  00:01:56.760
So we're going to get the and copy it and then I want you to go the assets your SAS file click on it

35

00:01:56.760  -->  00:01:57.330
.

36

00:01:57.350  -->  00:01:57.820
All right.

37

00:01:57.900  -->  00:02:00.810
And you guys don't know much about this file do you.

38

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:04.410
Well in the south such as this is a SAS file.

39

00:02:04.440  -->  00:02:11.400
S C S S And We are not going to cover Sassi or last or anything like that but just know that this is

40

00:02:11.400  -->  00:02:16.190
like a super C-s says it's styling file.

41

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:16.740
All right.

42

00:02:16.740  -->  00:02:18.760
You can do even variables in here.

43

00:02:18.780  -->  00:02:23.440
All right but we're not going to get into that is a little complex for this course and that's that will

44

00:02:23.440  -->  00:02:29.070
be another course that I would probably create just to make you guys more productive when you're using

45

00:02:29.070  -->  00:02:30.000
CSSA.

46

00:02:30.000  -->  00:02:36.210
All right but anyway this is what we're going to be writing or files this file is included This is compiled

47

00:02:36.210  -->  00:02:44.450
into public access as an app that VSS not app that SPSS which stands for SAS.

48

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:44.980
Right.

49

00:02:45.240  -->  00:02:52.140
But anyway here I'm going to start writing my Stahl's because this file is above all and all the rest

50

00:02:52.140  -->  00:02:54.340
of the files.

51

00:02:54.420  -->  00:02:54.820
All right.

52

00:02:54.840  -->  00:03:06.550
So let's do actually spatting B C and then tab and we'll make it for me because this is BHB storm.

53

00:03:06.630  -->  00:03:07.650
That's right.

54

00:03:07.650  -->  00:03:09.340
PH B-story baby.

55

00:03:09.540  -->  00:03:10.760
All right padding top.

56

00:03:10.850  -->  00:03:12.450
We're going to make it 0.

57

00:03:12.450  -->  00:03:18.700
B it's you don't have to put it but I write it anyway.

58

00:03:19.080  -->  00:03:23.630
And then we going to come down here and we're going to say golpe because we need to compile a file again

59

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:23.900
.

60

00:03:24.010  -->  00:03:27.220
Golpe right.

61

00:03:27.270  -->  00:03:32.200
So every time you change this this needs to be compiled back to.

62

00:03:33.780  -->  00:03:34.490
Right here.

63

00:03:34.650  -->  00:03:35.830
All right.

64

00:03:36.150  -->  00:03:36.910
All right cool.

65

00:03:36.930  -->  00:03:38.340
So that worked.

66

00:03:38.340  -->  00:03:40.240
You can see here that I was merging.

67

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:41.320
Does all of that.

68

00:03:41.370  -->  00:03:44.480
Let's come back here and see if it worked here.

69

00:03:44.670  -->  00:03:45.650
Refresh.

70

00:03:45.890  -->  00:03:48.880
And as you can see it did not change.

71

00:03:48.990  -->  00:03:50.590
That's because it worked right.

72

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:53.960
Because we were playing around with respect element and we brought it down.

73

00:03:54.090  -->  00:03:56.540
We broke down the padding of body.

74

00:03:56.550  -->  00:03:57.950
Right.

75

00:03:58.870  -->  00:04:02.920
If we take this off goes back so we added that.

76

00:04:03.030  -->  00:04:04.130
Beautiful.

77

00:04:04.140  -->  00:04:09.240
All right so now let's do some version control real quick before we lose any of this stuff and we don't

78

00:04:09.240  -->  00:04:10.690
want to do that.

79

00:04:10.710  -->  00:04:16.200
I'm tired of PH B-story asking me to the version control is actually reminding me I actually like it

80

00:04:16.210  -->  00:04:16.740
.

81

00:04:17.270  -->  00:04:17.730
All right.

82

00:04:17.850  -->  00:04:18.830
I'm not tire of it.

83

00:04:18.930  -->  00:04:20.520
Sorry BHB storm.

84

00:04:20.520  -->  00:04:25.280
All right so let's say get ADD.

85

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:28.070
We're going to add everything we're going to commit.

86

00:04:28.620  -->  00:04:32.430
Good commit and we're going to say that

87

00:04:38.670  -->  00:04:41.520
what kind of stages is admin.

88

00:04:41.550  -->  00:04:46.710
Master page set up.

89

00:04:46.770  -->  00:04:48.310
All right.

90

00:04:48.840  -->  00:04:53.360
Now you can write whatever you want whatever you can be a little more descriptive than what I was there

91

00:04:53.370  -->  00:04:59.190
guys or I I you I'm just doing this as an example guys because I want you guys to have an idea how this

92

00:04:59.190  -->  00:05:00.020
is done.

93

00:05:00.060  -->  00:05:05.820
But as you go alone you're going to create your own styles and you're going to you know follow the conventions

94

00:05:05.820  -->  00:05:08.550
out there that you think are more appropriate.

95

00:05:08.550  -->  00:05:12.740
And you know this is just a guide in Suraiya a guide for you.

96

00:05:12.750  -->  00:05:13.850
All right cool.

97

00:05:13.860  -->  00:05:18.560
So now if we go here good log We've got two commits here.

98

00:05:18.720  -->  00:05:24.080
All right so now we can push this to get up later and then we can pull this from another computer.

99

00:05:24.090  -->  00:05:29.450
So where in the world or somebody else can actually help us build the next Facebook right.

100

00:05:29.460  -->  00:05:30.270
Pretty cool.

101

00:05:30.630  -->  00:05:31.580
But anyway.

102

00:05:31.890  -->  00:05:32.150
All right.

103

00:05:32.160  -->  00:05:33.150
So we are good with this.

104

00:05:33.150  -->  00:05:37.630
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures.
