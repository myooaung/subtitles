1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,640
All right.

2

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:02,550
Welcome back my dear student.

3

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:08,260
So on this lecture you we're going to start up the form to create porks.

4

00:00:08,280  -->  00:00:12,570
All right we've got to learn a lot in this lecture guys or this couple lectures because it's going to

5

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:17,670
really take a couple of lectures since we have a lot of feels right for a forum so let's go ahead and

6

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:18,440
start this.

7

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:27,360
Let's go to our create right here and let's just create the form and we go of course we're going to

8

00:00:27,360  -->  00:00:31,020
go to the store and we already have it almost complete it.

9

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:33,990
I mean post controller that's it.

10

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:37,050
So what is the first thing that we have here.

11

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:41,700
All right we've got to look at our migration real quick and

12

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:53,850
we go now we can look at this.

13

00:00:54,450  -->  00:00:55,410
All right.

14

00:00:55,830  -->  00:01:04,440
So we got the user id we get to get that when we submit a post from my logged in user so we're going

15

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:06,080
to get this with a relationship.

16

00:01:06,180  -->  00:01:11,560
We don't need to worry about that category we don't need to worry about it now.

17

00:01:11,620  -->  00:01:14,530
We're going to have a relationship for that as well.

18

00:01:14,970  -->  00:01:21,760
But all this feels need to be they all need to be imports or this category needs to be an input for

19

00:01:21,760  -->  00:01:24,650
all and has to be an input title embody.

20

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:25,360
All right.

21

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:33,440
So let me actually put this away somewhere so he can guide me right.

22

00:01:33,600  -->  00:01:42,820
That way I don't forget one of those fields so let's go to that create is actually take all these A

23

00:01:42,890  -->  00:01:46,730
here that we don't need for now.

24

00:01:46,740  -->  00:01:48,260
All right cool.

25

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:55,180
So we got title that's going to be the first thing for post.

26

00:01:55,200  -->  00:02:02,150
What else category should be that second one or should be the input.

27

00:02:02,160  -->  00:02:02,490
All right.

28

00:02:02,550  -->  00:02:09,090
Let's say it's field and

29

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:25,690
let's just make this category here let's do a little different than the users category Heidi.

30

00:02:28,410  -->  00:02:29,740
OK.

31

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:34,910
And this is going to be a select.

32

00:02:35,100  -->  00:02:37,090
All right.

33

00:02:38,010  -->  00:02:44,250
Of course we're going to have an array there.

34

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:52,690
For now we're just going to do options.

35

00:02:54,480  -->  00:02:58,780
All right.

36

00:03:02,470  -->  00:03:09,840
Geez I don't like this indentation That's field.

37

00:03:11,540  -->  00:03:13,800
Let's do this a little bit there and let's

38

00:03:22,470  -->  00:03:26,770
we've got to fix this in our live template so that way comes out straight.

39

00:03:27,390  -->  00:03:32,950
Let's go to a live template form.

40

00:03:33,180  -->  00:03:34,280
This just fits that there

41

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:39,850
.

42

00:03:45,290  -->  00:03:45,620
Whoops

43

00:03:51,410  -->  00:03:54,030
that's OK one more for that

44

00:03:54,030  -->  00:04:05,320
.

45

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:07,380
This should be all the way in the wall

46

00:04:10,460  -->  00:04:21,320
and this should be a little bit more than let's say there was too much.

47

00:04:21,330  -->  00:04:23,500
All right I think that's better though.

48

00:04:24,150  -->  00:04:25,750
OK.

49

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:27,370
All right.

50

00:04:27,450  -->  00:04:29,690
So category 80.

51

00:04:29,760  -->  00:04:31,880
This one needs to be there file

52

00:04:34,930  -->  00:04:37,110
and for file we don't have any.

53

00:04:37,300  -->  00:04:38,800
Whoops.

54

00:04:41,560  -->  00:04:46,250
Any of that what else is there.

55

00:04:46,320  -->  00:04:51,180
It's field here.

56

00:04:51,190  -->  00:04:51,550
All right.

57

00:04:51,540  -->  00:04:53,650
Still coming up a little bit.

58

00:04:54,350  -->  00:05:02,610
Not 100 percent but Wolf I think I have to restart my editor have to check on that.

59

00:05:02,860  -->  00:05:08,720
All right so we have a file now the next step is the search area.

60

00:05:09,000  -->  00:05:14,420
Actually I think we have a method for that area

61

00:05:17,800  -->  00:05:25,070
and that would be body right here.

62

00:05:27,340  -->  00:05:33,250
Scription and we're going to pass in another review.

63

00:05:33,280  -->  00:05:35,920
I don't know if I show you how to do this right here.

64

00:05:35,940  -->  00:05:43,520
This third parameter is four attributes and it's going to be rose and we're going to pass it three rows

65

00:05:43,510  -->  00:05:43,560
.

66

00:05:43,560  -->  00:05:46,080
I think there's a good size.

67

00:05:46,080  -->  00:05:46,960
All right.

68

00:05:47,680  -->  00:05:57,340
So this only is tied or this should be what we have in the database actually or ID is for the photo

69

00:06:00,990  -->  00:06:05,150
for the radio.

70

00:06:09,170  -->  00:06:13,480
It's taking form.

71

00:06:13,500  -->  00:06:14,730
All right let's double check.

72

00:06:14,800  -->  00:06:21,010
We've got a title category photo embody.

73

00:06:21,100  -->  00:06:24,550
All right let's now check our application

74

00:06:26,810  -->  00:06:28,650
.

75

00:06:29,590  -->  00:06:36,670
It looks like this one is of classes being applied that doesn't need

76

00:06:40,810  -->  00:06:41,260
to know.

77

00:06:41,250  -->  00:06:42,980
Here let's see.

78

00:06:47,500  -->  00:06:47,770
Now

79

00:06:57,220  -->  00:06:58,810
let's take a class out

80

00:07:07,270  -->  00:07:08,580
one second guys.

81

00:07:08,590  -->  00:07:12,650
For some reason this is this is not working here that's weird.

82

00:07:12,730  -->  00:07:13,720
I'm missing something here.

83

00:07:13,720  -->  00:07:22,160
Let's make sure that this has the files shrewed here and I'm pretty sure he's not there.

84

00:07:22,960  -->  00:07:23,450
All right.

85

00:07:23,480  -->  00:07:28,510
But it's there other classes now working there.

86

00:07:28,500  -->  00:07:31,590
I'm almost certain that this is.

87

00:07:31,600  -->  00:07:33,350
This is correct here.

88

00:07:33,940  -->  00:07:41,370
If we take a look at the create for users maybe I've been coding too much and I don't see it.

89

00:07:42,790  -->  00:07:46,240
You can see that that's almost the same thing here.

90

00:07:47,290  -->  00:07:48,240
Should it matter that.

91

00:07:48,250  -->  00:07:49,180
No they're

92

00:07:52,890  -->  00:07:58,590
going to pay Saray here almost exactly the same on less.

93

00:07:58,620  -->  00:07:59,740
It doesn't have that.

94

00:07:59,800  -->  00:08:00,760
No there.

95

00:08:00,790  -->  00:08:02,390
That's weird.

96

00:08:03,090  -->  00:08:05,900
I'll leave it like that if it doesn't work.

97

00:08:07,600  -->  00:08:10,700
Yes we are we getting this.

98

00:08:11,500  -->  00:08:18,370
I remember it now like this color but that's I guess that's the way it's working right now.

99

00:08:18,670  -->  00:08:19,830
That's weird.

100

00:08:20,400  -->  00:08:21,740
I don't like it.

101

00:08:22,300  -->  00:08:24,260
Let's go and check it out.

102

00:08:24,260  -->  00:08:26,110
It is not the class is now being applied.

103

00:08:26,110  -->  00:08:26,680
You see that

104

00:08:31,940  -->  00:08:35,060
is not being applied to the import

105

00:08:36,750  -->  00:08:41,100
.

106

00:08:42,550  -->  00:08:47,750
Anyway we'll figure that out later and I will let you know how to fix that.

107

00:08:48,000  -->  00:08:50,750
But right now for some reason this is not working here.

108

00:08:50,750  -->  00:08:53,420
If we go to users create users.

109

00:08:53,470  -->  00:08:55,990
Oh it's now working on users either.

110

00:08:55,990  -->  00:08:57,240
So we never got that working.

111

00:08:57,250  -->  00:09:04,190
I was working I think Bush has a better functionality for this.

112

00:09:04,200  -->  00:09:07,630
I got to figure it out and I will always come back and let you guys know.

113

00:09:07,620  -->  00:09:13,920
But right now we have come very far with the Create paused and actually I think we should make this

114

00:09:14,640  -->  00:09:17,640
bigger this tetes area.

115

00:09:17,640  -->  00:09:23,950
So let's take these roles out of you out of there and it's come back to it.

116

00:09:24,250  -->  00:09:25,590
And there we go.

117

00:09:26,880  -->  00:09:29,510
OK.

118

00:09:29,530  -->  00:09:32,030
Pretty cool stuff.

119

00:09:32,070  -->  00:09:36,230
All right so we got to have categories so you can have a photo and a title for it.

120

00:09:36,310  -->  00:09:37,000
Beautiful.

121

00:09:37,000  -->  00:09:38,880
So the next lecture are going to continue with as it is.

122

00:09:38,940  -->  00:09:43,800
When I come up with a solution for this little class thing I will let you know.

123

00:09:44,080  -->  00:09:44,790
Thank you so much.

124

00:09:44,800  -->  00:09:45,270
See you then.

125

00:09:45,280  -->  00:09:45,980
Bye bye.
