00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:00.890
All right.

2

00:00:00.890  -->  00:00:03.160
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:03.170  -->  00:00:07.900
So in the last lecture we make really good progress with our little forum here.

4

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:14.970
And we have it work and you know we just have them working guys.

5

00:00:14.970  -->  00:00:15.390
All right.

6

00:00:15.390  -->  00:00:19.250
So you can see that he's working but now he's not working 100 percent.

7

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:24.840
Let's try to fix that real quick before we go to the next lecture so we know that the area here is the

8

00:00:24.840  -->  00:00:34.740
one that is creating issues so we could make this a little bit smaller so we can wrap this so tets input

9

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:36.620
into a.

10

00:00:37.240  -->  00:00:44.690
And let's see if this works can make it smaller.

11

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:46.470
All right.

12

00:00:47.960  -->  00:00:56.380
As Sam said It's not take effect so we could wrap the whole form in another.

13

00:00:57.850  -->  00:01:00.450
Let's just give this guy right here.

14

00:01:00.690  -->  00:01:03.120
This is going to take care of the issue.

15

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:06.750
All right.

16

00:01:07.770  -->  00:01:09.340
There we go.

17

00:01:10.500  -->  00:01:12.790
All right.

18

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:15.740
All right cool.

19

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:18.750
So now if you want to go ahead and play around with it a little more.

20

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:20.870
You can and just make it the way you want.

21

00:01:21.060  -->  00:01:25.480
But I think we're done with this with this functionality OK.

22

00:01:25.500  -->  00:01:25.920
All right.

23

00:01:25.920  -->  00:01:35.370
So the next I think for us would be to take this to admen and see what we can do here in showing the

24

00:01:35.370  -->  00:01:36.410
replies right.

25

00:01:36.510  -->  00:01:43.440
Because we need to do the same thing we did with the comments.

26

00:01:43.440  -->  00:01:48.170
All right we need to have a link here so that way we can see their replies.

27

00:01:48.320  -->  00:01:51.830
Same thing we did with view polls here.

28

00:01:52.530  -->  00:01:59.520
Actually if we go back to we can view the comments we wanted to the Send thing to the comments section

29

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:00.210
.

30

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:01.050
All right.

31

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:04.020
So let's go into that.

32

00:02:04.080  -->  00:02:09.430
First of all let's go to the reply.

33

00:02:09.840  -->  00:02:11.020
Let's close all of this for us.

34

00:02:11.060  -->  00:02:12.780
We've got a lot of stuff open

35

00:02:16.920  -->  00:02:22.990
close a little bit of this and clean this up a little bit so that we can code.

36

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:28.620
And you guys can see everything good.

37

00:02:31.980  -->  00:02:36.400
All right.

38

00:02:38.630  -->  00:02:43.690
Resources admin comments replies.

39

00:02:43.830  -->  00:02:47.840
All right we've got an index for reply so we can see all the replies there.

40

00:02:48.330  -->  00:02:54.330
And I think that we only need to see replies for specific comments.

41

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:56.860
We don't need to see all the replies.

42

00:02:56.940  -->  00:02:57.900
Right.

43

00:02:58.640  -->  00:03:05.240
So what we wanted to do is have a show page for replies instead.

44

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:16.030
So the show page and then do the same thing we do here with comments we do for replies.

45

00:03:16.340  -->  00:03:21.080
I'm going to copy that to the show on replies.

46

00:03:21.150  -->  00:03:22.660
Am I going to do a little changing here.

47

00:03:22.680  -->  00:03:23.690
OK.

48

00:03:24.430  -->  00:03:24.980
So

49

00:03:27.750  -->  00:03:28.770
let's do

50

00:03:31.620  -->  00:03:33.660
find and replace

51

00:03:33.660  -->  00:03:41.700
.

52

00:03:41.700  -->  00:03:45.900
So we going to replace comments

53

00:03:45.920  -->  00:03:51.880
.

54

00:03:52.590  -->  00:03:55.340
All right.

55

00:03:57.930  -->  00:04:00.540
That's going to replace comments for

56

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:06.720
.

57

00:04:06.720  -->  00:04:07.590
Let's do this

58

00:04:07.590  -->  00:04:13.420
.

59

00:04:17.500  -->  00:04:21.330
Let's take this out and let's do the replace.

60

00:04:21.460  -->  00:04:22.690
We go.

61

00:04:23.250  -->  00:04:24.840
So we're going to replace comments

62

00:04:30.580  -->  00:04:32.040
for replies

63

00:04:32.050  -->  00:04:37.130
.

64

00:04:41.580  -->  00:04:44.410
We're going to change down there.

65

00:04:45.460  -->  00:04:47.100
Let's see this one here quick

66

00:04:47.100  -->  00:04:53.550
.

67

00:04:53.820  -->  00:04:56.700
This only thing differently so I'm going to pass on that one.

68

00:04:56.700  -->  00:05:00.000
This one is named differently and one is named differently.

69

00:05:00.300  -->  00:05:03.480
This one and a change.

70

00:05:03.660  -->  00:05:08.340
Now the next one is comment.

71

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:12.170
Whoops we forgot this one here.

72

00:05:14.090  -->  00:05:16.130
Let's change that for replies.

73

00:05:17.280  -->  00:05:20.200
And now one or two.

74

00:05:20.760  -->  00:05:21.750
Let's go to a comment

75

00:05:26.350  -->  00:05:32.750
.

76

00:05:36.040  -->  00:05:36.750
Please

77

00:05:43.390  -->  00:05:43.910
please.

78

00:05:43.960  -->  00:05:46.710
1 0 1 0 1 0 1

79

00:05:46.720  -->  00:05:52.940
.

80

00:05:54.060  -->  00:05:56.870
That's it.

81

00:05:58.980  -->  00:05:59.250
All right.

82

00:05:59.250  -->  00:06:00.700
And the rest we do ourselves.

83

00:06:00.750  -->  00:06:01.400
All right.

84

00:06:01.560  -->  00:06:04.290
Let's stop being lazy and let's do it right.

85

00:06:04.380  -->  00:06:07.890
So this one here we're just going to say comment

86

00:06:11.310  -->  00:06:13.020
actually will be nice to go to the

87

00:06:19.200  -->  00:06:19.800
comment

88

00:06:22.660  -->  00:06:30.000
we got to leave it right now if we want to go to the we need to pull out of the column and actually

89

00:06:30.000  -->  00:06:37.590
so reply comment post ID.

90

00:06:37.640  -->  00:06:39.010
All right.

91

00:06:39.700  -->  00:06:42.370
How we're going to do that one there.

92

00:06:43.590  -->  00:06:44.180
All right.

93

00:06:44.460  -->  00:06:48.210
So let's make sure that we have that come and reply.

94

00:06:48.210  -->  00:06:49.500
We have that comment there

95

00:06:52.390  -->  00:06:54.070
and income and we have polls.

96

00:06:54.150  -->  00:06:56.850
All right cool

97

00:06:59.270  -->  00:07:01.940
.

98

00:07:02.390  -->  00:07:03.240
All right.

99

00:07:03.270  -->  00:07:03.610
All right.

100

00:07:03.630  -->  00:07:06.050
OK.

101

00:07:07.640  -->  00:07:08.660
OK.

102

00:07:09.330  -->  00:07:13.060
This change the controller here and this one shows a score.

103

00:07:13.140  -->  00:07:21.850
This one is going to say comments comment replies.

104

00:07:22.000  -->  00:07:23.520
All right.

105

00:07:24.460  -->  00:07:28.410
Instead of sending the comment Id with us and replied Id

106

00:07:34.770  -->  00:07:36.160
reply that he

107

00:07:41.490  -->  00:07:44.440
sent in with this as a matter of fact.

108

00:07:45.250  -->  00:07:45.400
He

109

00:07:53.790  -->  00:07:56.830
called my replies I controller.

110

00:07:56.990  -->  00:08:01.930
UPDATE A proof or no proof.

111

00:08:01.930  -->  00:08:02.620
All right.

112

00:08:02.840  -->  00:08:08.820
I think it's looking pretty good on the next lecture we're going to continue modifying this and see

113

00:08:08.820  -->  00:08:10.820
if we can see the replies.

114

00:08:10.830  -->  00:08:13.170
Thank you so much and see you in the next lecture.
