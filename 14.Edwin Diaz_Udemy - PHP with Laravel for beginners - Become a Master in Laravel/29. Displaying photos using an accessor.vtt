00:00:00.160  -->  00:00:02.540
Arrived on the last lecture we got this going right.

2

00:00:02.550  -->  00:00:08.570
We were able to move the image I mean we were able to create the image moving to an image just for that

3

00:00:08.570  -->  00:00:11.310
with it we did a lot of the last lecture was fun right.

4

00:00:11.310  -->  00:00:15.060
All right one thing that we didn't do was to redirect.

5

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:20.290
So make sure every time you're doing that you redirect and make sure that you do the return OK.

6

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:21.800
So now I was going to read that right.

7

00:00:21.810  -->  00:00:25.150
Let's go back here real quick.

8

00:00:25.150  -->  00:00:32.710
Another thing that I want to do before we jump into another section here is that I want to show the

9

00:00:32.700  -->  00:00:36.510
photo of the user I would be useful I think.

10

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:37.530
All right.

11

00:00:38.220  -->  00:00:42.320
So let's do that we already have a relationship set up for that.

12

00:00:42.480  -->  00:00:47.060
If you remember we went to the controller.

13

00:00:47.800  -->  00:00:48.390
Another controller

14

00:00:51.210  -->  00:00:54.810
the user model and we set up that relationship right here.

15

00:00:54.950  -->  00:00:55.470
OK.

16

00:00:55.590  -->  00:00:58.140
Just reminding you just make sure that you have that set.

17

00:00:58.160  -->  00:01:03.770
Guys don't ever escaped a lecture because sometimes I might face one or two things in one lecture.

18

00:01:04.040  -->  00:01:11.490
And if you skipped the lecture you might never have a problem solved for that for that next thing right

19

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:11.520
.

20

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:16.020
So make sure that you always are watching the lectures and paying attention to what I'm doing right

21

00:01:16.380  -->  00:01:23.550
because I are going I can go back in and change things and back and forth and it's just a way of you

22

00:01:23.550  -->  00:01:28.730
know working in real life projects you go back in and out and you change things and modify things so

23

00:01:28.750  -->  00:01:30.530
I will make sure that you don't skip a lecture.

24

00:01:30.590  -->  00:01:31.150
All right.

25

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:33.870
The whole reason we are taking this course is to learn everything you can.

26

00:01:33.870  -->  00:01:34.370
Right.

27

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:37.600
So I always try to show you as much as like any every lecture.

28

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:38.620
Don't skip it.

29

00:01:38.640  -->  00:01:39.220
All right.

30

00:01:39.360  -->  00:01:40.500
Anyway.

31

00:01:41.040  -->  00:01:48.130
So let's go to our resources views and let's go right here.

32

00:01:48.210  -->  00:01:56.280
It's all right so we want to show the photo I.D. the photos should be shown right here photo we could

33

00:01:56.280  -->  00:01:58.820
show the photo with the name together if we wanted to.

34

00:01:58.820  -->  00:02:02.050
The doubt is if that's what you want to do you could do that.

35

00:02:02.150  -->  00:02:03.860
All right.

36

00:02:04.970  -->  00:02:06.320
All right.

37

00:02:07.050  -->  00:02:11.470
Again this is driving me crazy this little indentation.

38

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:17.520
I'm not going to fix that now and I got to spend time fixing it but I would definitely get rid of that

39

00:02:17.520  -->  00:02:18.480
.

40

00:02:18.480  -->  00:02:24.840
All right so we're going to say photo and I think it was file that we.

41

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:29.760
Let's just look it up right now and see what we get.

42

00:02:29.760  -->  00:02:31.970
All right trying to get the name property OK.

43

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:37.640
That's because I'm going to tell you why is because we have some users here.

44

00:02:37.640  -->  00:02:38.160
All right.

45

00:02:38.170  -->  00:02:40.370
They do not have a photo.

46

00:02:40.890  -->  00:02:43.650
All right let's come back here.

47

00:02:44.100  -->  00:02:50.220
See that some users don't have a Ford and you're going to get an error if you try to pulao a property

48

00:02:50.490  -->  00:02:56.490
that doesn't meant that a photo that does not exist for their use or so for that what we need to do

49

00:02:56.490  -->  00:02:58.360
is we need to do an if statement right.

50

00:02:58.530  -->  00:03:04.030
We could if we wanted to do that long way we could say if user forward.

51

00:03:04.350  -->  00:03:10.380
And then you know we write our stuff but I don't want to do it like that takes a lot of lines of code

52

00:03:10.390  -->  00:03:10.580
.

53

00:03:10.770  -->  00:03:21.060
I want to use a shorthand version so I copy this guy right here and I'm going to do this if they use

54

00:03:21.050  -->  00:03:23.000
a photo exist.

55

00:03:23.070  -->  00:03:24.730
I want you to print it out right.

56

00:03:24.780  -->  00:03:25.440
Agway it out.

57

00:03:25.470  -->  00:03:28.210
If not I want you to say no.

58

00:03:28.270  -->  00:03:30.260
No user photo.

59

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:31.870
OK.

60

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:33.360
So watch this.

61

00:03:33.620  -->  00:03:38.590
School back here and let's do that now refresh.

62

00:03:38.760  -->  00:03:44.480
And as you can see the user has no Forder right here or you can put a placeholder if you want.

63

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:45.740
All right.

64

00:03:45.870  -->  00:03:49.200
We can build that feature in.

65

00:03:49.360  -->  00:03:50.750
All right.

66

00:03:51.240  -->  00:03:55.770
Now is explain this because we don't have any images tagged there in the mail.

67

00:03:55.850  -->  00:03:58.470
We're going to do that as you do on images.

68

00:03:58.620  -->  00:03:59.560
Image tag.

69

00:03:59.910  -->  00:04:00.290
All right.

70

00:04:00.300  -->  00:04:13.680
So Image and let's just put this whole thing and say here.

71

00:04:13.800  -->  00:04:16.580
Now this is not we don't want we don't want to do this guys.

72

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:19.730
And this works right now if we try it we try to do like this.

73

00:04:19.950  -->  00:04:28.170
Let's actually put a height constraint here height value and let's just make it 50 or something like

74

00:04:28.170  -->  00:04:28.850
that.

75

00:04:29.310  -->  00:04:32.160
So if I come here and do this you can see my photo there.

76

00:04:32.160  -->  00:04:33.290
OK that's good.

77

00:04:33.480  -->  00:04:41.150
But really we're actually doing the senting again here we're hard hard courting our directory here would

78

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:47.600
be nice if we can go ahead and make this a little bit a little bit more dynamic right and we can.

79

00:04:47.700  -->  00:04:49.650
All right we can do this if we want to.

80

00:04:49.920  -->  00:04:50.770
All right.

81

00:04:50.980  -->  00:04:55.030
So all we have to do is we can go to a photo class.

82

00:04:55.170  -->  00:04:57.160
Let's just go there real quick.

83

00:04:57.780  -->  00:05:10.920
And let's go here and we could do that would say let's just do a protect it and we could call this directory

84

00:05:13.020  -->  00:05:20.300
or let's just say oh Lord of Lords or images or whatever.

85

00:05:20.370  -->  00:05:21.980
Overlord's let's just call overlord's.

86

00:05:21.990  -->  00:05:23.250
All right.

87

00:05:23.970  -->  00:05:26.100
And we're going to make it whatever we want.

88

00:05:26.100  -->  00:05:29.770
This case is going to be images just like this.

89

00:05:29.810  -->  00:05:30.650
All right.

90

00:05:30.990  -->  00:05:38.880
And here we can actually get use an access or two to every time we want to EchoStar file we equate our

91

00:05:38.910  -->  00:05:47.280
with the images attached to it to our path right to our file.

92

00:05:47.430  -->  00:05:53.260
So that way we don't have to go back in here and type this in.

93

00:05:53.280  -->  00:05:56.050
It will come from the database or not from the database.

94

00:05:56.070  -->  00:06:00.120
It will print out already with the images directory.

95

00:06:00.120  -->  00:06:01.000
All right.

96

00:06:01.590  -->  00:06:03.160
Pretty cool stuff right.

97

00:06:03.780  -->  00:06:11.380
So let's just actually clean this up a little bit here.

98

00:06:11.530  -->  00:06:15.400
Stuff that we are now using Let's get it out of there.

99

00:06:15.430  -->  00:06:16.210
All right.

100

00:06:16.230  -->  00:06:18.530
And let's go back to photo.

101

00:06:19.290  -->  00:06:20.910
All right cool.

102

00:06:21.090  -->  00:06:29.700
So let's use that sensor and just to get photo attribute.

103

00:06:31.120  -->  00:06:33.690
Ok we get the photo.

104

00:06:33.890  -->  00:06:38.080
Can you just put it right here.

105

00:06:38.340  -->  00:06:49.560
Actually I don't remember that actually you is file.

106

00:06:50.870  -->  00:06:53.880
There we go.

107

00:06:53.880  -->  00:06:57.410
And we're going to return the uploads.

108

00:06:57.770  -->  00:07:00.420
Whoops.

109

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:04.620
Actually this reloads

110

00:07:07.800  -->  00:07:11.070
concatenated with why with the photo.

111

00:07:11.070  -->  00:07:11.850
Right.

112

00:07:12.420  -->  00:07:13.770
That's all we got to do guys.

113

00:07:13.850  -->  00:07:15.180
And watch this.

114

00:07:15.180  -->  00:07:22.220
Now every time we go in the end it's instead of doing this we just whoops

115

00:07:25.410  -->  00:07:27.620
we just delete that and that's it.

116

00:07:27.960  -->  00:07:31.200
Let's go back there and you work right out of the box.

117

00:07:31.200  -->  00:07:32.610
There we go.

118

00:07:32.610  -->  00:07:34.350
All right cool stuff.

119

00:07:34.350  -->  00:07:39.090
So you see we are implementing what we learned in the course and this is what it's all about.

120

00:07:39.090  -->  00:07:44.400
That's why I create these projects here to show you that you can implement it in real life projects

121

00:07:44.400  -->  00:07:44.490
.

122

00:07:44.490  -->  00:07:45.010
All right.

123

00:07:45.150  -->  00:07:50.130
So if you have a course that teaches how to teaches you how to do something but it doesn't actually

124

00:07:50.610  -->  00:07:55.160
teach you teaches you how to apply it then you're wasting your time.

125

00:07:55.160  -->  00:07:58.890
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
