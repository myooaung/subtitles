1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:02,830
All right welcome back to The Last Lecture.

2

00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:09,780
I was a little tired I didn't want to deal with this but this is active error that I got in the last

3

00:00:09,780  -->  00:00:11,910
lectures because of my form.

4

00:00:11,910  -->  00:00:21,150
I have this status all right and this should be active on both on three places actually on both places

5

00:00:21,150  -->  00:00:22,340
here.

6

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:23,450
All right.

7

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:27,080
Sometimes I call this status if you're taking any milder courses.

8

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:32,160
You know that in a database I call this status but it's you supposed to Callie's active because that's

9

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:33,700
the name of the column right.

10

00:00:33,700  -->  00:00:34,930
All right cool.

11

00:00:35,580  -->  00:00:47,460
So now if we try this we go ahead and refresh this and try this in our image and we try this.

12

00:00:47,460  -->  00:00:54,290
Well first of all we need to make sure that there's some type of data there.

13

00:00:55,210  -->  00:01:01,770
All ID needs to be there us well we've got to put the past where again as you can see now it goes in

14

00:01:01,790  -->  00:01:02,160
.

15

00:01:02,350  -->  00:01:07,440
Now if you were able to submit it with a file you're going to see that this is going to produce an array

16

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:08,260
.

17

00:01:08,280  -->  00:01:09,180
All right.

18

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:09,840
An empty array.

19

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:10,680
Let me just show you

20

00:01:16,850  -->  00:01:23,170
now see that file in theory.

21

00:01:23,760  -->  00:01:25,000
All right.

22

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:31,260
So let's go to the controller I mean use this controller here and let's just figure out well what are

23

00:01:31,260  -->  00:01:31,850
we going to do.

24

00:01:31,890  -->  00:01:32,600
All right.

25

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:35,490
We know we're going to have photos in the user right.

26

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:40,020
This is going to have for us so we need a photo table for that for now.

27

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:44,640
What I want to do is I want to show you and remind you real quick how to persist data.

28

00:01:44,670  -->  00:01:46,250
All right to the database.

29

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:48,220
So now all we have to do here guys.

30

00:01:48,300  -->  00:02:02,020
If you remember is called the user model or well use user model and used a method like this.

31

00:02:02,090  -->  00:02:03,140
Requests.

32

00:02:03,310  -->  00:02:04,230
Oh.

33

00:02:05,150  -->  00:02:06,290
And that's it.

34

00:02:06,480  -->  00:02:14,000
Right now the problem with this is that we're not going to get the pictures.

35

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:16,070
We're not going to get the files.

36

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:18,730
So let's redirect to out me users.

37

00:02:19,330  -->  00:02:20,490
All right.

38

00:02:21,360  -->  00:02:22,020
So

39

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:26,720
let's just get rid of that forever.

40

00:02:27,010  -->  00:02:35,980
OK let's just put some type of name here use to get things going.

41

00:02:36,180  -->  00:02:38,880
It's going to be a not status active

42

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:43,500
.

43

00:02:46,550  -->  00:02:47,040
All right.

44

00:02:47,120  -->  00:02:52,020
So we need that password for you for that.

45

00:02:52,840  -->  00:02:53,470
But

46

00:02:56,610  -->  00:02:57,330
I want to do

47

00:03:07,720  -->  00:03:16,650
as I'm looking for some pictures here in my computer for for some other pictures would be useful for

48

00:03:16,650  -->  00:03:17,780
us.

49

00:03:17,810  -->  00:03:20,140
That's ok I guess we're going to use my picture.

50

00:03:20,370  -->  00:03:21,150
OK.

51

00:03:21,150  -->  00:03:28,820
Let's use it use my picture and whatever password and create and as you can see we get redirected.

52

00:03:29,250  -->  00:03:36,700
We get Jose name e-mail has no role is not active.

53

00:03:37,770  -->  00:03:38,640
OK.

54

00:03:39,120  -->  00:03:48,210
So now let's go back here and we get to see that we did give it a roll but it's not actually taking

55

00:03:48,210  -->  00:03:48,820
that role.

56

00:03:48,870  -->  00:03:55,560
Or I would give it a roll of other let's just inspect her a little bit and find out what happened so

57

00:03:55,560  -->  00:03:57,950
we can see that these roll ID right here.

58

00:03:57,970  -->  00:03:58,990
It has.

59

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:00,820
He has an idea.

60

00:04:00,840  -->  00:04:02,160
This is the select actually

61

00:04:05,380  -->  00:04:05,820
right.

62

00:04:05,970  -->  00:04:09,480
We could see that it has a value to for some reason.

63

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:12,950
It was not it's not doing that in the database.

64

00:04:13,140  -->  00:04:17,940
So let's go and check the database for a quick page.

65

00:04:17,970  -->  00:04:23,690
My admin called hacking users.

66

00:04:23,790  -->  00:04:24,630
All right.

67

00:04:24,780  -->  00:04:27,030
So we can see that their all idea was not set.

68

00:04:27,030  -->  00:04:32,140
For some reason the password was not encrypted so we need to do that.

69

00:04:32,160  -->  00:04:33,090
All right.

70

00:04:33,090  -->  00:04:34,110
This is working.

71

00:04:34,110  -->  00:04:38,030
Everything else is working with a real I.D. is not working let's find out why.

72

00:04:38,280  -->  00:04:46,000
Let's go back here and we can see that we are actually taking the real I.D. there.

73

00:04:46,850  -->  00:04:52,010
All right.

74

00:04:52,020  -->  00:04:58,770
So let's go to our main uses controller.

75

00:05:02,880  -->  00:05:06,660
Let's go back and check this again just to make sure.

76

00:05:06,750  -->  00:05:11,410
So if I try to do this again I think you had to refresh there.

77

00:05:11,730  -->  00:05:14,640
Well you can see that there were all these actually being sent.

78

00:05:14,660  -->  00:05:17,280
But it's not being assigned.

79

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:18,400
And let me tell you why.

80

00:05:18,450  -->  00:05:19,780
If you haven't figure it out yet.

81

00:05:19,800  -->  00:05:23,220
Remember what we learned about mass assignment.

82

00:05:23,550  -->  00:05:24,570
Oh there you go.

83

00:05:24,570  -->  00:05:26,400
Now you remember right.

84

00:05:27,060  -->  00:05:28,100
Mass assignment.

85

00:05:28,140  -->  00:05:36,590
So let's go to app user and let's make sure that that roll I.D. is in this fillable Ari.

86

00:05:36,690  -->  00:05:37,460
All right.

87

00:05:37,700  -->  00:05:42,000
So overall I.D. and whatever other stuff you want in.

88

00:05:42,000  -->  00:05:42,590
Right.

89

00:05:42,600  -->  00:05:43,470
What else will we have.

90

00:05:43,470  -->  00:05:45,380
We have a status right.

91

00:05:45,500  -->  00:05:50,530
Or is active is active wasn't working either.

92

00:05:50,540  -->  00:05:51,420
They just said zero.

93

00:05:51,420  -->  00:05:55,380
I guess that was the default and what was the other one

94

00:05:58,610  -->  00:06:02,770
though that one was real I.D. is active.

95

00:06:02,760  -->  00:06:04,200
That's all that the only two that we have.

96

00:06:04,200  -->  00:06:04,690
Right.

97

00:06:04,920  -->  00:06:07,670
And the photo ID.

98

00:06:07,710  -->  00:06:08,660
All right.

99

00:06:09,030  -->  00:06:11,570
So Real I.D. is active.

100

00:06:11,580  -->  00:06:13,470
Let's just put the real I.D. right here as well

101

00:06:16,530  -->  00:06:16,780
as

102

00:06:20,360  -->  00:06:22,110
photo I.D. right here.

103

00:06:22,670  -->  00:06:23,250
All right.

104

00:06:23,400  -->  00:06:34,610
So now if we go back to our I mean use controller we can try this out.

105

00:06:36,030  -->  00:06:37,720
All right let's try it out again.

106

00:06:37,770  -->  00:06:40,020
See what happens.

107

00:06:40,020  -->  00:06:41,770
All right cool.

108

00:06:42,720  -->  00:06:51,060
Easy to forget stuff when you when you're new and you have a lot of stuff a lot of information you know

109

00:06:52,050  -->  00:06:55,410
thrown to you like I am throwing it to you.

110

00:06:55,410  -->  00:06:57,570
So according Foxhall to come.

111

00:06:57,570  -->  00:06:59,970
We're going to pull Maria in the team.

112

00:06:59,970  -->  00:07:04,050
Maria is going to be a subscriber this time and she is now going to be active.

113

00:07:04,060  -->  00:07:05,100
We don't want her to be active.

114

00:07:05,100  -->  00:07:08,720
We don't have any files on this one.

115

00:07:08,820  -->  00:07:13,910
And just create the user as you can see Marie has been created she's a subscriber she's that active

116

00:07:13,920  -->  00:07:15,630
and she was created a second ago.

117

00:07:15,630  -->  00:07:17,480
That's beautiful guys.

118

00:07:17,490  -->  00:07:18,210
All right.

119

00:07:18,330  -->  00:07:25,660
Let's refresh here and you can see that even the old lady was entered there is active this time which

120

00:07:25,720  -->  00:07:26,870
you actually made it.

121

00:07:27,080  -->  00:07:29,730
So he was active to see if it was working right.

122

00:07:29,730  -->  00:07:34,260
So let's go ahead and create another user real quick.

123

00:07:34,260  -->  00:07:35,820
Let's just create a Peter.

124

00:07:35,820  -->  00:07:37,150
He's always in my courses.

125

00:07:37,170  -->  00:07:48,990
I don't know if you guys can tell but Peter and Maria and pin and Jose they are always in my courses

126

00:07:48,990  -->  00:07:49,600
.

127

00:07:49,650  -->  00:07:50,350
There we go.

128

00:07:50,370  -->  00:07:55,070
As you can see these these guys act if I just wanted you to see that it is working ok.

129

00:07:55,200  -->  00:07:55,590
Beautiful.

130

00:07:55,590  -->  00:08:02,130
So we got it working on the next lecture we got to see how we can you know do some file integration

131

00:08:02,130  -->  00:08:03,030
into this stuff.

132

00:08:03,100  -->  00:08:05,170
Some file features.

133

00:08:05,430  -->  00:08:09,030
Thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you internet lecture
