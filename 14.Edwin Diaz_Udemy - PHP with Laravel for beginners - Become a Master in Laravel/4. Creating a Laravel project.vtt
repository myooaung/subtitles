00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:07.780
Buy Welcome back I'm a student so it's time for us to create a new Treville project ranch.

2

00:00:07.830  -->  00:00:13.110
I want you to be very excited because we're going to be learning some really cool stuff on this course

3

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:15.680
stuff that is going to take you very far away in life.

4

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:19.260
And I want you to be very excited every time you join in a lecture.

5

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:24.350
Don't fall asleep if you fall asleep get get something to wake you up.

6

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:27.970
You know and they keep courting keep practicing keep getting better.

7

00:00:27.970  -->  00:00:32.640
Know that you're doing this for your benefit for your family and always keep motivated when you're doing

8

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:33.150
this stuff.

9

00:00:33.150  -->  00:00:37.080
I know it can get pretty boring when you don't know stuff in the beginning but once you know you're

10

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:39.550
going to create projects and you're going to be very excited.

11

00:00:39.720  -->  00:00:47.040
So let's going open up a terminal and because we have set up our bash files right we can go ahead and

12

00:00:47.040  -->  00:00:54.240
go to the HD docs for they just typing in the docs enter where they're now less typing a command to

13

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:56.750
create a new Largo project with composer.

14

00:00:56.910  -->  00:01:05.420
So we're going to say composer create hyphen project the name of the vendor.

15

00:01:05.580  -->  00:01:14.940
Of all package Lavell the name of the Father that we want and that we want to see a mass that's going

16

00:01:14.940  -->  00:01:21.270
to be the name and that we can say preferred destroy if we wanted it to download the latest version

17

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:23.130
of preferred distribution.

18

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:24.000
We can do that.

19

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:28.960
I have a download 5.2 and they prefer this Review-Journal.

20

00:01:28.970  -->  00:01:32.620
They're right.

21

00:01:33.230  -->  00:01:34.470
They just do it without it.

22

00:01:34.770  -->  00:01:39.850
Enter And now we are doing 5.2.

23

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:46.170
Keep in mind that if in the future for some reason and you know is going to happen if you are looking

24

00:01:46.170  -->  00:01:51.630
at this course and there is another version of Lavoe don't worry about it learn this version and the

25

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:53.010
end of this course.

26

00:01:53.050  -->  00:01:59.380
We always have different sections outlie outlining the changes in Claribel versions.

27

00:01:59.400  -->  00:02:06.840
So if we create a really cool project on this course and you know it's up to version 9 or 10 or 20 Don't

28

00:02:06.840  -->  00:02:07.580
worry about it.

29

00:02:07.710  -->  00:02:12.660
I will actually let you guys know and let you know the differences and if it breaks our application

30

00:02:12.660  -->  00:02:17.340
we'll fix it in that way we can learn a lot more than just you know taking a different course for it

31

00:02:17.350  -->  00:02:17.420
.

32

00:02:17.490  -->  00:02:17.970
All right.

33

00:02:18.180  -->  00:02:21.530
So now we have this installed let's you just check it.

34

00:02:21.750  -->  00:02:26.420
L s enter or awry.

35

00:02:26.820  -->  00:02:33.040
So we got these CMOS their folder and we can go in C see the CMOS enter.

36

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:36.090
LS Right.

37

00:02:36.150  -->  00:02:38.610
So now we can see or files in there.

38

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:39.570
Pretty cool.

39

00:02:39.570  -->  00:02:39.930
All right.

40

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:41.670
So now should be available in the browser.

41

00:02:41.670  -->  00:02:46.900
All we have to do is go to that specific folder and just type in localhost.

42

00:02:46.950  -->  00:02:52.470
I see a mass for their name and then public will be where the that is.

43

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:54.870
Now you won't see anything here for some of you.

44

00:02:54.870  -->  00:02:56.050
You will.

45

00:02:56.220  -->  00:03:04.050
Now this tells me that for some reason Lavoe was not able to ride to our storage file but that's OK

46

00:03:04.050  -->  00:03:04.360
.

47

00:03:04.380  -->  00:03:06.370
And by the way I know that because of experience.

48

00:03:06.370  -->  00:03:07.570
All right.

49

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:13.680
All right let's clear this enter what we're gonna be doing is let's come out of this.

50

00:03:13.800  -->  00:03:17.940
See the dot dot and we're going to give us some permissions.

51

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:22.480
So S.H. mode change mode.

52

00:03:23.230  -->  00:03:31.490
Hi fin R which is a recursive full plus W or right this.

53

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:39.940
So I want to give you some right information right permissions to see mass storage.

54

00:03:39.960  -->  00:03:40.700
All right.

55

00:03:41.070  -->  00:03:50.350
And then enter now if I go back to where we should be good let's say let's do it refresh.

56

00:03:50.370  -->  00:03:54.100
Now we can see that our installation was successful.

57

00:03:54.120  -->  00:03:54.810
All right.

58

00:03:54.870  -->  00:04:03.120
Now these commands are this CMAG This is because of these commands in a Mac Macintosh right.

59

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:06.510
That's how we give some permissions doing this.

60

00:04:06.510  -->  00:04:06.870
All right.

61

00:04:06.870  -->  00:04:10.850
Perfit So now we have our project installed here.

62

00:04:10.890  -->  00:04:14.490
Our next step would be to actually open it up in PSP storm.

63

00:04:14.490  -->  00:04:15.870
So we're going to do the next lecture.

64

00:04:15.870  -->  00:04:16.560
All right.

65

00:04:16.560  -->  00:04:16.930
Perfect.

66

00:04:16.940  -->  00:04:18.390
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.

67

00:04:18.390  -->  00:04:19.960
Bye bye.
