00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.610
Welcome back students.

2

00:00:01.650  -->  00:00:06.570
So it's not for us to start reading information some of you already probably went ahead and started

3

00:00:06.570  -->  00:00:07.560
doing it without me.

4

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:09.970
That's OK because that's where I want you to do.

5

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:12.270
I want you to go out there and try to do it yourself.

6

00:00:12.270  -->  00:00:19.900
So let's create another role here and let's start reading some information.

7

00:00:20.310  -->  00:00:21.140
OK.

8

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:32.490
Let's read some data and let's let's find staff something we have been doing or fail excuse to fail

9

00:00:32.490  -->  00:00:35.010
this time.

10

00:00:35.010  -->  00:00:36.310
All right.

11

00:00:36.960  -->  00:00:46.520
Now we've got to find the relationship so we need an object to that this year somewhere.

12

00:00:46.530  -->  00:00:47.120
All right.

13

00:00:47.310  -->  00:00:49.080
So let's do a for each

14

00:00:51.960  -->  00:00:58.590
day and show you how these two Portlands their

15

00:01:01.220  -->  00:01:02.550
staff.

16

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:05.100
We have photos for staff as well.

17

00:01:05.370  -->  00:01:13.250
We're going to do it as photo and we and we just have one I believe.

18

00:01:13.280  -->  00:01:22.190
So we're just going to return photo path.

19

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:27.870
All right cool.

20

00:01:28.780  -->  00:01:30.330
I get your browser

21

00:01:34.490  -->  00:01:44.110
right in my browser after trying it looking for all my monitors read.

22

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:46.200
There we go.

23

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:48.540
Beautiful.

24

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:49.110
All right.

25

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:56.010
Remember that you can also read with where statements that you can put or where method and find the

26

00:01:56.010  -->  00:01:59.990
right one that you want to pull out and read and you can do all the things with you.

27

00:01:59.990  -->  00:02:00.360
OK.

28

00:02:00.390  -->  00:02:02.010
Remember that we have done that before.

29

00:02:02.010  -->  00:02:04.460
So anyway thank you so much for watching.

30

00:02:04.530  -->  00:02:08.330
