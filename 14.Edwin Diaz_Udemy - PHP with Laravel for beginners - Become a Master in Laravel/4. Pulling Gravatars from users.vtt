00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:00.630
All right.

2

00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:07.370
Welcome back my students so it's about time we add another cool little feature to our application.

3

00:00:07.710  -->  00:00:09.410
And he's going to be a Gravatar.

4

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:09.920
All right.

5

00:00:09.960  -->  00:00:13.290
So for those of you that don't know what a Gravatar is look it up.

6

00:00:13.310  -->  00:00:13.920
All right.

7

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:15.290
I'm just joking.

8

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:19.620
You can see it right here Gravatar is an image that follows you from side to side appearing beside your

9

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:23.360
name when you do things like come in or post on a blog or forum whatever.

10

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:28.100
You have this little picture here what they do is you sign up for them and they're already signed up

11

00:00:28.110  -->  00:00:29.670
so he's going to sign me in.

12

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:33.780
You know the name which they cannot touch say image to your e-mail.

13

00:00:34.230  -->  00:00:37.510
And we're going to use the functionality in our application to the text.

14

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:39.690
This image from people.

15

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:44.560
And we're going to show it right in our application.

16

00:00:44.580  -->  00:00:52.230
But now the cool thing about this is that you can also assign defaults to optional parameters.

17

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:58.140
So let's say using Let's just do a year using Gravatar And let's just do a little search right here

18

00:00:58.140  -->  00:00:59.630
on my breast friend.

19

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:05.540
And if we go to the Wordpress code it's going to tell you exactly how to use it right.

20

00:01:05.580  -->  00:01:12.320
Basically we're going to be using a MT five function to hash the email part of it.

21

00:01:12.320  -->  00:01:15.080
The email part and then we're going to pass on parameters.

22

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:15.540
All right.

23

00:01:15.560  -->  00:01:18.160
I get requests as you can see right here.

24

00:01:18.180  -->  00:01:25.050
All right we can pass this size we can pass rating we can pass the fault there is better than commence

25

00:01:25.050  -->  00:01:25.830
hashing out there

26

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:33.420
if you pool using Gravatar as well.

27

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:37.200
Lara Velle You can also get some documentation on that we're going to do it right now.

28

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:37.770
But

29

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:45.330
this is not it let's just do it right now are you going to see it arrive.

30

00:01:45.410  -->  00:01:47.610
You can look it up in your time.

31

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:50.130
Right now it's about time we actually implement this.

32

00:01:50.130  -->  00:01:57.930
So what we're going to be doing is we're going to go to our user model and we're going to create a new

33

00:01:57.930  -->  00:02:00.280
function here or new method.

34

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:05.640
And this method is going to be what we're going to be doing is we're going to be at Sesi creating a

35

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:09.960
property that does not exist on our application.

36

00:02:09.990  -->  00:02:13.020
That's a cool thing about Clarabelle allows us to do that.

37

00:02:13.290  -->  00:02:15.580
So on this side we're going to do it.

38

00:02:16.290  -->  00:02:19.140
We are going to be using that sensor basically.

39

00:02:19.260  -->  00:02:19.990
Right.

40

00:02:20.150  -->  00:02:23.420
Or a mutator functionality that I already show you.

41

00:02:23.610  -->  00:02:32.480
So let's use Let's use Let's let's do that get Gravatar they just call it that actually view.

42

00:02:33.180  -->  00:02:35.850
We don't have a column.

43

00:02:35.850  -->  00:02:41.520
All right so we're going to create this column a fake column in our application right now.

44

00:02:41.530  -->  00:02:43.020
I want you to pay very close attention.

45

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:44.610
We've already done something like this.

46

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:51.180
I'm going to call this hash and we could create we could make this a property up here if we wanted to

47

00:02:51.180  -->  00:02:55.140
guys that's up to you but you're going to leave it as a variable.

48

00:02:55.170  -->  00:02:56.590
We're going to use them.

49

00:02:56.600  -->  00:03:00.790
The five function because that's how we get down to our.

50

00:03:01.110  -->  00:03:03.540
And we're going to SDR

51

00:03:07.160  -->  00:03:08.070
to where

52

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:13.710
this e-mail from the user.

53

00:03:13.710  -->  00:03:14.660
All right.

54

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:18.180
We are also going to trim this.

55

00:03:18.180  -->  00:03:20.900
Just in case.

56

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:25.370
So let's just add that here we are trimming this.

57

00:03:25.390  -->  00:03:34.230
And as a matter of fact instead of doing this email we are going to do this tributes.

58

00:03:34.980  -->  00:03:37.380
And then that's how we're going to create this

59

00:03:40.350  -->  00:03:41.190
column.

60

00:03:41.250  -->  00:03:48.360
And remember that we're using this convention get Dagget convention Gravatar actually view is going

61

00:03:48.360  -->  00:03:54.180
to allow us to create a new column that does not exist called Gravatar.

62

00:03:54.180  -->  00:04:04.610
All right so once we have that we can come here and we can say return on which a c h t t B.

63

00:04:04.620  -->  00:04:07.610
And this is Gravatar Web site.

64

00:04:08.910  -->  00:04:15.860
Gravatar there are a couple there friend you or else but this is the one we're going to be using.

65

00:04:16.320  -->  00:04:18.860
I think is only one extra you are l different one.

66

00:04:18.870  -->  00:04:27.110
But as long as you return in Gravatar that come forward slash Avatar something you're good to go.

67

00:04:27.130  -->  00:04:27.770
All right.

68

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:31.530
We're going to return it with a hash like this.

69

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:32.740
There we go.

70

00:04:33.540  -->  00:04:34.920
All right cool.

71

00:04:34.950  -->  00:04:37.090
So now all we got to do.

72

00:04:37.110  -->  00:04:37.690
Yes.

73

00:04:37.770  -->  00:04:42.530
Let's go to our let's go to our application real quick.

74

00:04:42.530  -->  00:04:46.950
We don't even have a slogan

75

00:04:46.950  -->  00:04:52.600
.

76

00:04:52.600  -->  00:04:57.540
You know I don't even remember what e-mail we have for this user.

77

00:04:57.550  -->  00:05:02.740
Try this e-mail.

78

00:05:02.740  -->  00:05:03.220
All right.

79

00:05:03.240  -->  00:05:07.560
It's now that it's called and faculty then

80

00:05:13.290  -->  00:05:16.160
there we go.

81

00:05:16.690  -->  00:05:19.230
All right.

82

00:05:19.620  -->  00:05:25.230
And we don't have any comments so we need to make a comment for appose.

83

00:05:25.470  -->  00:05:28.550
Let's come here and let's just create a round and come in.

84

00:05:29.010  -->  00:05:37.130
I love this pose of our javascript.

85

00:05:38.800  -->  00:05:41.050
Right.

86

00:05:41.260  -->  00:05:41.620
All right.

87

00:05:41.640  -->  00:05:44.460
Your message has been submitting and waiting moderation.

88

00:05:44.670  -->  00:05:45.600
Cool.

89

00:05:46.170  -->  00:05:52.380
We need to create some type of link here that would take us to admin but I'm hoping that you already

90

00:05:52.380  -->  00:05:57.640
know how to do that which is super simple guys or comments let's approve it.

91

00:05:57.660  -->  00:06:00.680
View the comment real quick.

92

00:06:00.840  -->  00:06:08.640
It's telling us Well that's because we have that link we need to update it with sleuth to look for slogger

93

00:06:08.640  -->  00:06:08.720
.

94

00:06:08.720  -->  00:06:09.370
All right.

95

00:06:09.570  -->  00:06:12.740
So make sure that you have the linking of data controller.

96

00:06:13.050  -->  00:06:13.530
Right.

97

00:06:13.620  -->  00:06:20.680
If we have to to actually take those two way I think is the link only that we need to update there.

98

00:06:21.210  -->  00:06:25.260
But anyway let's go to our polls right here.

99

00:06:25.330  -->  00:06:27.930
And as you can see we have this picture already.

100

00:06:28.020  -->  00:06:30.510
Because this is the user's picture.

101

00:06:30.510  -->  00:06:43.860
But if we go to this graph Let's go to our post where is it polls view and let's see where this message

102

00:06:43.860  -->  00:06:44.580
is being

103

00:06:47.650  -->  00:06:49.240
displayed.

104

00:06:50.130  -->  00:06:56.130
Right now we can see that right here this message is here.

105

00:06:56.160  -->  00:07:04.030
So instead of this what we need to do is we need to grab the user a year.

106

00:07:05.790  -->  00:07:16.170
And just like this Gravatar in a attribute type of way that's going to allow us to see that Gravatar

107

00:07:16.780  -->  00:07:20.010
are-I user Gravatar.

108

00:07:20.010  -->  00:07:20.830
All right cool.

109

00:07:21.060  -->  00:07:28.830
So when I go back to your comment refresh and as you can see that's my Gravatar right there.

110

00:07:29.060  -->  00:07:30.370
Bright cool stuff right.

111

00:07:30.510  -->  00:07:32.320
And you can pass although the faults right here.

112

00:07:32.310  -->  00:07:45.240
So let's go back to the user model here and I'm going to attach some parameter default equals and let's

113

00:07:45.240  -->  00:07:52.540
say m m just in case well I don't think I don't know that's going to show because just in case my the

114

00:07:52.710  -->  00:07:59.360
image they email is not available it will display a mystery man right.

115

00:07:59.610  -->  00:08:01.830
That's what this M M stands for.

116

00:08:01.830  -->  00:08:09.900
You can also come here and do an ampersand and pass in a size array.

117

00:08:09.930  -->  00:08:15.880
If Widding have a responsive or an image size here for Avatar we can change the size of it.

118

00:08:16.290  -->  00:08:21.120
All right there are many cool little features that you can go to the to the World War Breske coordinates

119

00:08:21.750  -->  00:08:23.160
and find some more information.

120

00:08:23.160  -->  00:08:28.890
There is a whole bunch of tutorials on Gravatar as well but I hope you're really excited because we

121

00:08:28.890  -->  00:08:36.580
were able to pull this this Gravatar from the Gravatar dot com Web site.

122

00:08:36.820  -->  00:08:37.170
Right.

123

00:08:37.170  -->  00:08:44.760
By using this cool little functionality we were able to create a view on the fly and actually view a

124

00:08:44.760  -->  00:08:46.730
column that does not exist right.

125

00:08:46.740  -->  00:08:48.800
Basically right.

126

00:08:48.810  -->  00:08:51.470
So really cool stuff with our guys.

127

00:08:51.480  -->  00:08:53.340
I hope you're having a lot of fun.

128

00:08:53.370  -->  00:08:55.860
Hope you enjoyed the course and I'll see you in the next.

129

00:08:55.860  -->  00:08:57.240
Extra lectures.

130

00:08:57.240  -->  00:08:58.520
Take care guys.
