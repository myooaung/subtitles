00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:01.170
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.180  -->  00:00:01.930
I'm a student.

3

00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:08.380
It's time for us to learn how to do the inverse of one to one relationship to the chambers or of a couple

4

00:00:08.390  -->  00:00:09.100
relationships.

5

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:09.690
Right.

6

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:14.930
Basically with the inverse function idea we can pull out stead of pulling out the pulse of the user

7

00:00:14.930  -->  00:00:24.230
or we can pulao the user Double-O so that the user or right from that post model.

8

00:00:24.240  -->  00:00:24.600
All right.

9

00:00:24.600  -->  00:00:27.780
So anyway I almost confused myself there a little bit.

10

00:00:27.780  -->  00:00:29.780
So let's go ahead and test this out real quick.

11

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:34.650
What I'm going to do is I'm going to say get the post.

12

00:00:34.810  -->  00:00:36.160
Whoops.

13

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:36.960
All right.

14

00:00:36.960  -->  00:00:39.090
That belongs to a user right.

15

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:46.460
So post and then will do id here as well.

16

00:00:46.710  -->  00:00:51.340
And then I say user We're going to put our user level on to the polls.

17

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:52.740
That's what I've been trying to say guys.

18

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:53.070
All right.

19

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:54.390
Don't laugh at me.

20

00:00:54.390  -->  00:00:56.910
Don't make jokes.

21

00:00:56.910  -->  00:00:58.790
This is serious stuff.

22

00:00:58.790  -->  00:01:00.100
All right cool.

23

00:01:00.630  -->  00:01:01.360
All right.

24

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:09.350
So we can go ahead and return the post.

25

00:01:09.390  -->  00:01:13.670
First of all we got to do is we've got to find that post.

26

00:01:13.700  -->  00:01:14.920
All right.

27

00:01:15.570  -->  00:01:21.090
And then we say I want to return the user and the user name.

28

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:22.330
All right.

29

00:01:22.920  -->  00:01:23.680
Cool.

30

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:28.010
So let's make sure that we have this idea right here.

31

00:01:28.050  -->  00:01:29.040
Perfect.

32

00:01:29.040  -->  00:01:33.490
All right so now that we got that done here let's actually apply to the model real quick.

33

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:36.120
So let's go to the user.

34

00:01:36.270  -->  00:01:41.050
Now use of the post and run on the polls we need to create that functionality.

35

00:01:41.280  -->  00:01:55.710
So we're going to save public function user and then we're going to say return this belongs to.

36

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:56.430
All right.

37

00:01:56.690  -->  00:02:03.590
So we're going to be like this app user like this beautiful.

38

00:02:03.590  -->  00:02:03.950
All right.

39

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:07.060
So now let's go ahead and try this out real quick.

40

00:02:07.080  -->  00:02:07.840
All right.

41

00:02:08.190  -->  00:02:16.440
So now here we'll come here and we'll say listen I want to get the polls number one that belongs to

42

00:02:16.440  -->  00:02:20.150
these user enter.

43

00:02:20.240  -->  00:02:25.350
I mean I want to get the user that belongs to this polls.

44

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:26.160
All right.

45

00:02:26.160  -->  00:02:32.220
Am I saying that correctly the user that belongs to this post.

46

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:34.470
Yeah that's fine right there.

47

00:02:34.470  -->  00:02:36.940
This user belongs to this post.

48

00:02:37.180  -->  00:02:38.420
Yeah I'm good guys.

49

00:02:38.430  -->  00:02:38.860
All right.

50

00:02:38.970  -->  00:02:43.470
So as you can see we defined the reverse right.

51

00:02:43.470  -->  00:02:50.210
We are doing the reversed and we call this actually the inverse re the inverse relationship.

52

00:02:50.250  -->  00:02:55.390
So you can do this with different relationships so make sure that you learned is really good.

53

00:02:55.770  -->  00:02:58.420
Basically what we did we did the opposite right.

54

00:02:58.440  -->  00:03:07.800
We went to the model right and created a function called post and then we went all routes to pull this

55

00:03:07.800  -->  00:03:08.840
information out.

56

00:03:09.150  -->  00:03:13.030
We search the polls right.

57

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:17.480
And then we took out the users out of their user name out.

58

00:03:17.480  -->  00:03:18.200
All right.

59

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:21.260
So the only day was the inverse version of it.

60

00:03:21.450  -->  00:03:23.350
So we learned that's pretty cool.

61

00:03:23.550  -->  00:03:28.080
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
