00:00:00.100  -->  00:00:00.720
It all right.

2

00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:02.010
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:09.000
I'm a student so we have our one to one installation Clarabelle ready.

4

00:00:09.020  -->  00:00:11.600
The next thing to do is to open it up.

5

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:17.430
So let's go ahead and open it up in ph being storm in my case effusions of blind go ahead and use sublime

6

00:00:17.440  -->  00:00:17.880
.

7

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:27.540
And then I click on open new project re open and I'm going to look for my desktop of course and action

8

00:00:27.570  -->  00:00:35.590
on my desktop what my folder where I have this right nose and users.

9

00:00:35.610  -->  00:00:38.930
And it should be under Applications

10

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:42.480
.

11

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:45.030
And let's go right here.

12

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:47.130
That's not it that's not a word is it.

13

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:49.240
Where is where is it.

14

00:00:49.260  -->  00:00:53.930
It was easier to find before but we go Sam.

15

00:00:54.720  -->  00:00:59.260
I can just type in the address right there if I wanted to.

16

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:02.110
I took the long route this time anyway.

17

00:01:02.610  -->  00:01:07.100
One to one I close this out.

18

00:01:07.090  -->  00:01:08.050
All right cool.

19

00:01:08.130  -->  00:01:14.200
So the next thing to do here and this is the typical workflow right next thing to do is to create a

20

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:14.760
database.

21

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:16.420
But first we need it to name right.

22

00:01:16.420  -->  00:01:18.730
So let's go to the EMV here.

23

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:20.060
Let's name our database.

24

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:20.810
Right.

25

00:01:20.910  -->  00:01:22.220
So I'm going to create.

26

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:30.320
We're going to create a database called 1 to 1 on that score.

27

00:01:31.110  -->  00:01:31.710
Right.

28

00:01:32.010  -->  00:01:34.030
You don't have to put on the score.

29

00:01:34.260  -->  00:01:37.070
You can just leave it the way it is like this.

30

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:42.080
And that's say actually for invigoration it.

31

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:42.860
This is it.

32

00:01:42.860  -->  00:01:53.400
Right but here we are using BHB my admin so we do have a route and this has to be left empty.

33

00:01:54.190  -->  00:01:58.740
OK because we have no password when we install Zahm by default.

34

00:01:58.740  -->  00:01:59.220
All right.

35

00:01:59.280  -->  00:02:04.890
So now we need to go here and create our migration real quick.

36

00:02:04.890  -->  00:02:08.350
But before we do that let's go ahead and create a database.

37

00:02:08.430  -->  00:02:10.090
Impeach be my admin right.

38

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:13.260
So BHB my admin Antar.

39

00:02:13.980  -->  00:02:18.730
Let's create a database and you know make sure that I don't have any other data.

40

00:02:18.750  -->  00:02:27.050
It's like OK databases one to one.

41

00:02:27.060  -->  00:02:30.790
That was the name we gave it create.

42

00:02:30.810  -->  00:02:31.240
All right.

43

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:32.990
Let's say that's all we've got to do with this.

44

00:02:33.030  -->  00:02:38.970
I'm going to minimize this because we might need it later on just to say things are a couple of things

45

00:02:38.970  -->  00:02:40.020
that we're doing.

46

00:02:40.020  -->  00:02:41.630
Perfect.

47

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:42.660
All right.

48

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:48.020
So now I want to create a migration because actually we already have a migration.

49

00:02:48.100  -->  00:02:53.940
I'm going to show you we have one by default and you guys know that already right is in the database

50

00:02:53.950  -->  00:02:54.930
for a year.

51

00:02:55.470  -->  00:03:05.580
We have the users and we have the password but we need a migration for our for the relationship since

52

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:09.200
we're going to be doing a cross in this relationship right.

53

00:03:09.360  -->  00:03:11.140
So let's do a migration real quick.

54

00:03:11.140  -->  00:03:24.920
BHB artists can make as to the model and let's call this a dress and we go there we go.

55

00:03:24.930  -->  00:03:31.440
Now we have this migration and it's going to be just an address and we're going to be able to do the

56

00:03:31.440  -->  00:03:37.020
crowd saying that the U.S. has one address and we're going to do the everything there that we need to

57

00:03:37.020  -->  00:03:37.440
do.

58

00:03:37.650  -->  00:03:39.920
So let's go ahead and say string.

59

00:03:40.500  -->  00:03:43.110
And it's going to be the name of the

60

00:03:46.330  -->  00:03:56.730
array of the address or name and address field or something like that or we could even create a CD house

61

00:03:56.760  -->  00:04:00.170
number whatever we want is going to leave it like this as name.

62

00:04:00.170  -->  00:04:02.640
Now I'm going to go here to my termino.

63

00:04:02.640  -->  00:04:08.260
I'm going to say BHB in my agree because I'm ready.

64

00:04:08.440  -->  00:04:09.250
Answer.

65

00:04:09.510  -->  00:04:15.480
We have migrated that and now we have BHP my admin here somewhere I'm just going to refresh it.

66

00:04:15.720  -->  00:04:20.970
And now we have our migrations done and everything set out for us to start doing the crud.

67

00:04:20.990  -->  00:04:21.570
All right.

68

00:04:21.720  -->  00:04:26.430
So I hope you're having a lot of fun and I'll see you in the next lecture.
