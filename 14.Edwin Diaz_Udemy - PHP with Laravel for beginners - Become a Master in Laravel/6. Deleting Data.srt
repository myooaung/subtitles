00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:06,540
All right welcome back my students on this lecture here we're going to learn how to delete using polymorphic

2

00:00:06,540  -->  00:00:07,170
relation.

3

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:10,640
All right cool.

4

00:00:10,650  -->  00:00:11,030
All right.

5

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:14,910
Why do I keep writing this instead of copy and pasting guys.

6

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:23,610
Come on I told you that because we want to get used to writing it so that way is in our heads and when

7

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:30,480
we go to sleep we dream about this stuff and when we wake up we have new ideas on what programs we can

8

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:31,910
create.

9

00:00:31,910  -->  00:00:32,460
All right.

10

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:37,470
Like I have a really good idea and I to tell you because you know you might take my idea and become

11

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:41,660
a billionaire but you know we can talk about it.

12

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:46,160
So anyway we're going to find this to have the first staff member right.

13

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:53,570
And you know if we find him we've got to say and right here let's just say if we find them.

14

00:00:54,210  -->  00:01:03,370
All right we're going to allow these photos and use the method here for this and they need it.

15

00:01:03,390  -->  00:01:04,760
That's what we've got to do right now.

16

00:01:04,770  -->  00:01:07,930
We find this guy because he hasn't paid the bills.

17

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:10,440
And if we find all his forces we're going to lead it.

18

00:01:10,650  -->  00:01:11,420
All right.

19

00:01:11,430  -->  00:01:15,830
Now you can also remember that you can also do something like this.

20

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:27,970
You can find his photos where we're name something equals bad food or something.

21

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:28,740
All right.

22

00:01:28,800  -->  00:01:34,830
GBG you can do this stuff like this if you want of course is more is more.

23

00:01:34,820  -->  00:01:39,600
Come into the where ID.

24

00:01:40,950  -->  00:01:41,680
OK.

25

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:46,030
So let's check to check it out real quick.

26

00:01:46,030  -->  00:01:47,070
All right.

27

00:01:47,070  -->  00:01:50,380
Polymorphic the.

28

00:01:50,880  -->  00:01:52,570
We need more data.

29

00:01:53,800  -->  00:01:56,510
Enter refresh.

30

00:01:56,520  -->  00:02:01,890
That is the only picture we had that's why we need data.

31

00:02:01,990  -->  00:02:03,470
Right right right.

32

00:02:03,870  -->  00:02:08,580
So we're done with this one here and let's see if on the next lecture's I can show you some more tricks

33

00:02:08,590  -->  00:02:08,620
.

34

00:02:08,640  -->  00:02:10,030
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.

35

00:02:10,050  -->  00:02:11,440
Bye bye.
