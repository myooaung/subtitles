00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.860
All right welcome back my story.

2

00:00:01.860  -->  00:00:07.980
So let's set up the relationship so that way we can actually display some of this relationship here

3

00:00:08.000  -->  00:00:08.050
.

4

00:00:08.070  -->  00:00:09.580
Let's fix this.

5

00:00:09.860  -->  00:00:11.730
This dramady ear.

6

00:00:12.590  -->  00:00:13.070
All right.

7

00:00:13.200  -->  00:00:14.990
So we need to play that category.

8

00:00:14.990  -->  00:00:16.470
We don't have a category yet.

9

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:24.000
We're going to have that in the future but we want to display the user and even we don't have this yet

10

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:27.120
but we will have a photo for it.

11

00:00:27.130  -->  00:00:31.130
But at least a user lets build that relationship real quick.

12

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:32.150
All right.

13

00:00:33.300  -->  00:00:36.790
So we're going to say that it has a Orner right.

14

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:43.070
So we got to use user We're going to set up this relationship for the user.

15

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:46.260
We're going to see public function polls

16

00:00:49.300  -->  00:00:54.420
when I say that.

17

00:00:58.130  -->  00:00:58.750
OK.

18

00:00:58.970  -->  00:01:01.510
And that's just froze on me by the way.

19

00:01:02.040  -->  00:01:09.110
This has many of you don't need to set this up to make all that won't work.

20

00:01:09.120  -->  00:01:10.610
I'm just making this up.

21

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:15.260
Well I'm just creating this one now because I don't want to forget later.

22

00:01:15.260  -->  00:01:15.970
All right.

23

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:20.060
But to make this one work here you don't need this one.

24

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:20.810
All right.

25

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:27.540
So we turned this has many stories and I have Ray.

26

00:01:27.810  -->  00:01:29.080
There we go.

27

00:01:29.760  -->  00:01:42.720
Let's go back to the post and we're going to say here Public Function user that we're going to say this

28

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:48.830
one here belongs to a user.

29

00:01:50.020  -->  00:01:50.760
OK.

30

00:01:50.760  -->  00:01:58.830
So we've got to make sure that we have that fill up because if we don't we're going to have an error

31

00:01:58.870  -->  00:01:59.930
OK.

32

00:02:00.660  -->  00:02:05.400
If we go here and try to play that now.

33

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:16.170
So let's go to our post and that's and if we try to display the owner like this pose user name watch

34

00:02:16.170  -->  00:02:17.590
what's going to happen.

35

00:02:18.120  -->  00:02:19.440
Learn from it.

36

00:02:19.440  -->  00:02:26.010
Try to get a property of an object is not an object yet because we don't have these user ID.

37

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:30.450
So let's make sure that we include our user ID there.

38

00:02:31.110  -->  00:02:37.430
And now to get the same problem oh we haven't committed that yet.

39

00:02:38.190  -->  00:02:40.240
There we go.

40

00:02:40.260  -->  00:02:42.180
All right.

41

00:02:42.180  -->  00:02:42.900
Beautiful.

42

00:02:43.170  -->  00:02:45.350
So you can see the name of that pose.

43

00:02:45.570  -->  00:02:46.860
Or we can call that owner.

44

00:02:46.860  -->  00:02:52.230
Now user can call the owner if you want.

45

00:02:52.230  -->  00:02:54.240
It's up to you.

46

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:55.850
OK.

47

00:02:57.510  -->  00:03:02.640
It's up to you however you want to do it you might see it as a user later on.

48

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:03.300
All right.

49

00:03:03.570  -->  00:03:06.150
I just got my name on it for now.

50

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:09.360
All right we got to also set up the relationship for the photo.

51

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:10.900
Let's do that right now.

52

00:03:11.490  -->  00:03:14.190
So let's go to our polls

53

00:03:17.240  -->  00:03:21.900
and we say that this user has one for all.

54

00:03:22.410  -->  00:03:24.460
I was just being lazy there guys.

55

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:29.020
Instead of writing this stuff don't be like me and write it down.

56

00:03:29.430  -->  00:03:30.310
All right.

57

00:03:31.410  -->  00:03:36.010
So we got to say that this post has one photo.

58

00:03:36.030  -->  00:03:38.160
All right cool stuff.

59

00:03:38.160  -->  00:03:47.310
Now this one here is also going to have one category so the category

60

00:03:51.570  -->  00:03:54.950
we're just doing things a little bit ahead of time right.

61

00:03:55.290  -->  00:04:01.500
And make sure that whatever fills one it is here in Philly was all right

62

00:04:05.960  -->  00:04:19.570
they should be protected here for liberals is the name of the rule.

63

00:04:19.760  -->  00:04:21.030
This.

64

00:04:21.930  -->  00:04:25.600
OK.

65

00:04:25.800  -->  00:04:27.310
All right cool.

66

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:32.910
I think we're done with relationships here.

67

00:04:32.910  -->  00:04:33.590
All right cool.

68

00:04:33.600  -->  00:04:36.900
So we're going to take it to the next lecture where we're going to continue with this.

69

00:04:36.900  -->  00:04:37.750
Thank you so much.

70

00:04:37.800  -->  00:04:39.400
And see you in the next one
