1

00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:04,230
All right welcome back my students so now that we have initialized.

2

00:00:04,230  -->  00:00:04,760
Good.

3

00:00:04,950  -->  00:00:06,620
It's time for us to start using.

4

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:07,240
All right.

5

00:00:07,410  -->  00:00:08,680
So let's get to it.

6

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:13,130
Let's go to our terminal and make sure that you are inside that folder OK.

7

00:00:13,170  -->  00:00:14,210
All right cool.

8

00:00:14,220  -->  00:00:18,180
So the first thing that you could learn though I want you to Larry's guest status.

9

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:20,930
This is going to tell us everything we're going to use this command a lot.

10

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:22,860
It's just going to let us know what's going on.

11

00:00:22,860  -->  00:00:23,420
All right.

12

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:29,310
So let's say for example we let's drop this in brackets.

13

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:33,150
I think I have brackets somewhere here.

14

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:37,830
Let me see brackets we go.

15

00:00:38,340  -->  00:00:41,500
Let's drop this in there.

16

00:00:41,680  -->  00:00:42,590
All right.

17

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:47,350
As you can see there is nothing here but he fired a file.

18

00:00:47,440  -->  00:00:51,720
I'm going to use touch in this case the mail.

19

00:00:51,810  -->  00:00:56,780
You can see that he did follow there.

20

00:00:56,790  -->  00:00:57,600
All right.

21

00:00:58,050  -->  00:01:05,470
If I had that and I say status it says that we have an on track file.

22

00:01:05,470  -->  00:01:05,970
All right.

23

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:07,650
That's what he's telling us.

24

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:11,840
Let's go ahead and add something to this file that's double click it.

25

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:18,870
And this is the reason why I'm using brackets here is because this is a very simple lecture a couple

26

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:20,000
of simple lectures.

27

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:27,780
I don't want to you know open BHB storm and have it have all their files there because when you open

28

00:01:27,790  -->  00:01:31,770
PSAP store and when you try to do something like this is going to ask them all their files in there

29

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:32,100
.

30

00:01:32,160  -->  00:01:34,770
I don't wonder I want everything to be very clear for you.

31

00:01:34,770  -->  00:01:41,600
So we are using a very simple editor like brackets or we can use no bad or any other type of editor

32

00:01:41,610  -->  00:01:42,240
out there.

33

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:44,430
It doesn't have to be BHB storm OK.

34

00:01:44,760  -->  00:01:45,060
All right.

35

00:01:45,060  -->  00:01:47,340
So we're going to add something here we're going to add the key word.

36

00:01:47,350  -->  00:01:55,950
Hello I'm going to save the file and if we go back to guess status is not going to let us know anything

37

00:01:55,950  -->  00:01:56,580
else.

38

00:01:56,580  -->  00:02:01,440
He's just let Keep letting us us and letting us know that he's on track he's not being tracked.

39

00:02:01,440  -->  00:02:05,840
Remember that the job of good is actually to keep track of your files.

40

00:02:05,940  -->  00:02:11,970
So if you at a lecture like let's imagine for a second this is an application and we added let's say

41

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:21,810
let's just do it right here at it first let's add a feature 1 one 2 application.

42

00:02:21,810  -->  00:02:22,300
All right.

43

00:02:22,500  -->  00:02:25,620
Let's say we do this and we add this feature to our application.

44

00:02:25,780  -->  00:02:28,780
But we want it to track because we're going to keep adding features.

45

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:32,670
And maybe one day we're going to have something that's going to fail and we want to come back to that

46

00:02:32,670  -->  00:02:35,700
specific time where application was working.

47

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:37,210
We can do where we store.

48

00:02:37,500  -->  00:02:38,100
All right.

49

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:39,200
We can do a rollback.

50

00:02:39,210  -->  00:02:39,740
Right.

51

00:02:39,900  -->  00:02:42,930
So let's see.

52

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:45,930
This is called good as and let's just clear this away.

53

00:02:46,010  -->  00:02:47,250
Well you can see it clearly.

54

00:02:47,520  -->  00:02:50,190
We're going to do good add in the name of the file.

55

00:02:50,370  -->  00:02:54,890
Or if you want to add everything in that Arek three you put it up.

56

00:02:54,960  -->  00:02:58,380
All right so I'm going to do a job because I don't have any other files.

57

00:02:58,380  -->  00:03:00,360
Most of the time you went out all your files.

58

00:03:00,360  -->  00:03:01,770
So you do that die anyway.

59

00:03:01,920  -->  00:03:07,410
So now if you say good status you can see that it says new file in green.

60

00:03:07,410  -->  00:03:08,100
Right.

61

00:03:08,490  -->  00:03:11,170
In that age the e-mail.

62

00:03:11,220  -->  00:03:11,570
All right.

63

00:03:11,670  -->  00:03:12,820
So now we're keeping track of that.

64

00:03:12,820  -->  00:03:20,970
So if I if I do anything here if I even put a space and put a dot in save it and I do just that.

65

00:03:20,970  -->  00:03:30,150
Now it says that I modified that file and now we got two versions of when our first insert of the file

66

00:03:30,160  -->  00:03:30,730
.

67

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:32,190
All right.

68

00:03:32,570  -->  00:03:36,680
And now when I mortify does that's how he keeps track.

69

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:38,340
So now if I would get comment

70

00:03:41,280  -->  00:03:46,210
and get comment is a command that he's going to record that specific time.

71

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:46,590
All right.

72

00:03:46,620  -->  00:03:53,240
Specific time when I added the first when I first saved a file which is this one here.

73

00:03:53,270  -->  00:03:53,670
All right.

74

00:03:53,670  -->  00:03:55,110
I know this can be very confusing.

75

00:03:55,110  -->  00:03:57,990
First played is going to be become very clear.

76

00:03:58,080  -->  00:03:59,040
The more you do it.

77

00:03:59,050  -->  00:04:00,210
All right of course.

78

00:04:00,240  -->  00:04:06,530
So we're going to say good commed with a little flack here with I am and flag to same message.

79

00:04:06,570  -->  00:04:07,140
Right.

80

00:04:07,350  -->  00:04:17,010
And we're going to say it feature or feature one.

81

00:04:17,510  -->  00:04:18,530
Enter.

82

00:04:18,630  -->  00:04:19,330
All right.

83

00:04:19,770  -->  00:04:25,000
As you can see one file change first this has being a first comment.

84

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:28,070
Now if you do a good log you can see all your comments there.

85

00:04:28,130  -->  00:04:32,970
A new age committee is going to have a identifier.

86

00:04:32,970  -->  00:04:40,230
This is how we go back in time and say listen I want to go back to this where my kamay was this number

87

00:04:40,540  -->  00:04:44,860
and we're going to see that later on but this is just a little crass lecture here OK.

88

00:04:44,880  -->  00:04:45,470
All right.

89

00:04:45,990  -->  00:04:53,520
So now if I do get started is I still see that all the time where I added this dot when I say my file

90

00:04:54,480  -->  00:05:00,210
remember that because I got it first does and you can go back in time in the video you can rewind it

91

00:05:00,210  -->  00:05:01,760
.

92

00:05:01,830  -->  00:05:08,590
I first added this added feature one up to application and I saved it and then later I added a dot.

93

00:05:08,910  -->  00:05:18,780
So now this comment here will be for the DOT So if I go like this get Let's at it first.

94

00:05:18,780  -->  00:05:21,990
All right good ad there we go.

95

00:05:22,110  -->  00:05:25,980
And now let's do a comment on it.

96

00:05:26,010  -->  00:05:35,070
Dot to sentence in feature one or something like that.

97

00:05:35,070  -->  00:05:36,300
All right.

98

00:05:37,200  -->  00:05:42,220
Enter now with two guests that is not in there right.

99

00:05:42,240  -->  00:05:43,890
We get we do get Glaude.

100

00:05:44,280  -->  00:05:47,880
And as you can see we have two recordings now.

101

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:49,030
All right.

102

00:05:49,140  -->  00:05:51,840
Now remember this is that crash little lecture.

103

00:05:51,840  -->  00:05:56,790
We're going to keep doing this a couple of times over and over with different commands so that where

104

00:05:56,790  -->  00:06:00,180
you can get a better idea you can get very good audio OK.

105

00:06:00,270  -->  00:06:03,880
You don't need to be a on a yet later on you will become one.

106

00:06:03,910  -->  00:06:04,500
All.

107

00:06:04,590  -->  00:06:04,940
All right.

108

00:06:04,950  -->  00:06:10,810
So cool let's say for example I want to go back to where this dad was in there.

109

00:06:10,860  -->  00:06:11,600
All right.

110

00:06:11,910  -->  00:06:12,800
How can I do that.

111

00:06:12,810  -->  00:06:16,160
Well we go back to the first one.

112

00:06:16,590  -->  00:06:22,230
Because right now this is the latest one this is with a dot and if we go by that we need to go back

113

00:06:22,230  -->  00:06:25,200
to this one this is the one that did not have the dot.

114

00:06:25,320  -->  00:06:34,000
So to go back we do get reset Haar and I will explain to you what we said does.

115

00:06:34,200  -->  00:06:38,680
This is a soft reset without the flag this with the heart.

116

00:06:39,310  -->  00:06:40,860
It's the hard reset.

117

00:06:40,860  -->  00:06:44,550
This means that we're going to race everything we're going to raise the command.

118

00:06:44,790  -->  00:06:49,940
We've got to make sure we're going to risk everything to that point in time.

119

00:06:49,950  -->  00:06:54,700
So now if I do this this command will not be available anymore.

120

00:06:55,050  -->  00:06:59,840
But if I do the self reset the commit when I'll be there.

121

00:06:59,860  -->  00:07:05,970
But that changes would still be available or I don't know if I may explain it later on.

122

00:07:05,970  -->  00:07:08,750
We're going to we're going to do this a couple of times you're going to see.

123

00:07:08,760  -->  00:07:09,150
All right.

124

00:07:09,150  -->  00:07:14,830
So anyway let's do this thing actually restudy.

125

00:07:15,220  -->  00:07:24,030
Let's just base it again because I think instead of there enter and now you see you saw that actually

126

00:07:24,030  -->  00:07:29,480
that first command did not have anything on a just how they were hello and nice.

127

00:07:29,520  -->  00:07:32,850
Actually I put it put in the wrong information.

128

00:07:32,850  -->  00:07:36,320
I should have put the word hello so good log.

129

00:07:36,510  -->  00:07:39,650
Whoops there we go.

130

00:07:39,930  -->  00:07:45,000
So instead of this it should have been done when they had the key word Hello.

131

00:07:45,390  -->  00:07:46,210
All right.

132

00:07:46,890  -->  00:07:53,760
So now as you can see there we went back in time to where we were how this file with the word Hello

133

00:07:53,780  -->  00:07:53,990
.

134

00:07:54,180  -->  00:07:54,670
All right.

135

00:07:54,690  -->  00:07:59,070
So anyway I hope we get a really good idea of what it is and we're going to keep doing this a couple

136

00:07:59,070  -->  00:08:04,890
of more times and then we're going to take it to get up and show you how to push this to a place on

137

00:08:04,890  -->  00:08:07,130
line where you can share it with other people.

138

00:08:07,140  -->  00:08:09,850
And let's say you have a really good project and you want to share it.

139

00:08:09,960  -->  00:08:11,180
You will be able to do it.

140

00:08:11,190  -->  00:08:11,580
All right.

141

00:08:11,580  -->  00:08:12,880
So it's going to be pretty cool actually.

142

00:08:12,880  -->  00:08:13,510
All right.

143

00:08:13,710  -->  00:08:16,490
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
