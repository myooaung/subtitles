00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.610
All right we'll come back to the students so it's tough for us to start setting up a route so roots

2

00:00:04.630  -->  00:00:05.990
in views.

3

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:06.420
All right.

4

00:00:06.480  -->  00:00:08.340
So what are we going to do.

5

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:09.480
Is super simple.

6

00:00:09.600  -->  00:00:11.880
Let's set up our route first.

7

00:00:12.260  -->  00:00:15.710
So we're going to go to app HTP and route's right.

8

00:00:16.260  -->  00:00:17.200
Ok cool.

9

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:22.330
So I'm going to do this all the way in the bottom here of the code.

10

00:00:22.330  -->  00:00:31.680
We are getting a lot of cold re comment this and I'm going to use one of these comments and

11

00:00:35.350  -->  00:00:44.840
this here and what we can call this is crowd allocation.

12

00:00:45.050  -->  00:00:46.310
Now.

13

00:00:48.690  -->  00:00:52.590
Even though this is you can't I don't know if you can call this an application is going to be very small

14

00:00:52.590  -->  00:00:55.620
but it works.

15

00:00:55.620  -->  00:00:58.170
So we're going to do this with a resource.

16

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:03.660
Remember that a resource is going to give us some pre-define already route names and you our eyes.

17

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:04.790
OK.

18

00:01:05.460  -->  00:01:06.250
All right.

19

00:01:06.260  -->  00:01:15.540
So pose and then we're going to create a controller and the controller is going to be as a matter of

20

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:17.330
fact we already have a controller.

21

00:01:17.460  -->  00:01:22.770
We don't have to create when we get a pulse controller So this is going to go to pose controller guys

22

00:01:23.340  -->  00:01:28.260
and do not worry too much if you don't understand everything 100 percent on this.

23

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:35.000
Beginning lectures by the time you get to the main application on this course.

24

00:01:35.140  -->  00:01:35.910
All right.

25

00:01:36.030  -->  00:01:41.490
You are going to know this stuff and you're going to be such you're going to be very confident about

26

00:01:41.490  -->  00:01:42.050
everything.

27

00:01:42.060  -->  00:01:42.320
OK.

28

00:01:42.330  -->  00:01:43.380
Trust me.

29

00:01:43.650  -->  00:01:44.520
All right.

30

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:47.100
So now to look at these routes.

31

00:01:47.210  -->  00:01:47.570
All right.

32

00:01:47.670  -->  00:01:54.870
If you remember we do BHB artisan route Liz OK.

33

00:01:55.020  -->  00:01:58.630
And as you can see we have some pretty fine stuff waiting for us.

34

00:01:58.650  -->  00:02:03.340
We got your eyes right here and you'll see how that works in a minute.

35

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:08.400
And we've got the name of those routes so we can refer to them by the wrong names and then we have the

36

00:02:08.400  -->  00:02:14.740
action where they going what their class and the mentors that they are targeting.

37

00:02:14.760  -->  00:02:17.220
As you can see this is the med that at.

38

00:02:17.250  -->  00:02:21.970
This is the controller and then they admit that store in that's created is short of showing it.

39

00:02:21.990  -->  00:02:25.280
Those are the mentors that we shall have in our controller OK.

40

00:02:25.320  -->  00:02:30.190
And we should click on them which we have those methods there.

41

00:02:30.220  -->  00:02:36.290
All right now those methods are going to have more actually better information better functionality

42

00:02:36.300  -->  00:02:40.060
now since we are going to be creating a little application here so.

43

00:02:40.530  -->  00:02:43.480
So we've got now that we have set up our route.

44

00:02:43.500  -->  00:02:45.090
Let's set up our views.

45

00:02:45.150  -->  00:02:52.590
So let's go to resources right here views and then they're going to right click on views and I'm going

46

00:02:52.590  -->  00:02:59.390
to click new as a matter of fact let me just add it's file templates let me do something here.

47

00:02:59.610  -->  00:03:03.810
BHB file.

48

00:03:03.810  -->  00:03:05.090
See if I can

49

00:03:14.750  -->  00:03:19.820
I'm going to click on the plus symbol right here as you can see guys am going to name this blade.

50

00:03:20.040  -->  00:03:25.350
And what we're going to do is we're going to create this new extension for Bley for PH B-story if you

51

00:03:25.360  -->  00:03:33.570
use in PH BE storm now when you create a file not an extension but when you create a file automatically

52

00:03:33.580  -->  00:03:35.790
that this extension will be added to the file.

53

00:03:35.820  -->  00:03:43.850
So this is going to be blade and then we're going to say Dot actually play that BHP.

54

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:44.760
OK.

55

00:03:45.090  -->  00:03:47.010
So I'll show you right now how this works exactly.

56

00:03:47.010  -->  00:03:48.980
So I'm going to click Apply and OK.

57

00:03:49.110  -->  00:03:54.260
Now every time I want to create a file Bley file I'm going to write click new.

58

00:03:54.260  -->  00:03:55.540
Now I look for the blade.

59

00:03:55.560  -->  00:03:57.170
You see the name play.

60

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:02.970
And now if I type in the folder name because if you don't type of wood extension it creates a folder

61

00:04:03.390  -->  00:04:04.370
why creates a file.

62

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:10.300
But if you put a forward slash and you say I want to create an index watch what's going to happen.

63

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:14.360
So he creates the folder and then creates the file with extension.

64

00:04:14.400  -->  00:04:16.540
Bley that we already set.

65

00:04:16.540  -->  00:04:16.850
All right.

66

00:04:16.860  -->  00:04:17.660
Pretty cool for sure.

67

00:04:17.670  -->  00:04:18.030
I do that.

68

00:04:18.040  -->  00:04:19.940
Well you don't have to typing this extension.

69

00:04:19.960  -->  00:04:21.180
I believe that BHB.

70

00:04:21.180  -->  00:04:22.070
OK.

71

00:04:22.080  -->  00:04:24.430
So we have this folder we have the index.

72

00:04:24.450  -->  00:04:29.090
Let's create another one inside the Forderung that's where I right clicked.

73

00:04:29.190  -->  00:04:34.310
We going to create the Create page right click again.

74

00:04:34.320  -->  00:04:37.400
We're going to create the edit.

75

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:42.180
And we are going to create the show.

76

00:04:42.180  -->  00:04:44.820
Those are the only ones we need right now.

77

00:04:45.480  -->  00:04:46.350
OK.

78

00:04:46.800  -->  00:04:49.090
Nothing else you use for them.

79

00:04:49.140  -->  00:04:50.050
Beautiful.

80

00:04:50.050  -->  00:04:56.820
So this is where we're going to have the create form the edit form which are very similar.

81

00:04:56.820  -->  00:04:59.600
This is daine that's what we're going to be showing or posts.

82

00:04:59.730  -->  00:05:05.270
And this is the show where we are going to be showing specific post the show page.

83

00:05:05.270  -->  00:05:06.160
OK.

84

00:05:06.180  -->  00:05:10.000
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
