00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,400
All right welcome back my excellent student we are ready to rumble again.

2

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:09,040
All right so now we are ready to find the relationships on tomorrow.

3

00:00:09,040  -->  00:00:09,540
All right.

4

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:14,870
So the polls in the video model should have that taxing method in there OK.

5

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:15,180
All right.

6

00:00:15,200  -->  00:00:19,920
That's the one that caused him more of too many men on the eloquent class and now I'm going to show

7

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:20,960
you what I just said.

8

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:21,630
OK.

9

00:00:21,750  -->  00:00:26,960
So let's go to the app and then let's go let's say for example let's go to the polls model here.

10

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:28,290
OK.

11

00:00:28,430  -->  00:00:39,490
And this is what's going to have the tags here method because we want to be able to tag at the polls

12

00:00:39,490  -->  00:00:39,560
.

13

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:43,190
We want to be able to say I want to get all the tax from the polls.

14

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:43,920
Right.

15

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:48,500
So this is where we get to half the Tagamet and now we're going to return here.

16

00:00:48,690  -->  00:00:52,590
Like I just said are more Too many method so let's returned

17

00:00:55,830  -->  00:01:03,930
this more if not more of many like we did before.

18

00:01:03,940  -->  00:01:07,120
Well we I think we'll use that one.

19

00:01:07,320  -->  00:01:09,030
We can also use more of my money.

20

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:14,580
I mean there are many other ones that we can use but we're going to use more too many.

21

00:01:14,610  -->  00:01:16,600
Because that's what we're doing here.

22

00:01:16,630  -->  00:01:19,560
All right we're Morfin this too many.

23

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:20,160
All right.

24

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:23,130
So where are we going to be doing.

25

00:01:23,130  -->  00:01:29,870
Here is app and we need to refer to the tag estÃ©e model here.

26

00:01:30,150  -->  00:01:34,680
And then Taggett will.

27

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:37,000
OK.

28

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:38,820
Beautiful.

29

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:41,900
So I think I'm spending incorrectly taxable.

30

00:01:41,910  -->  00:01:42,540
All right.

31

00:01:42,540  -->  00:01:49,380
So now that we have this here we have to go back to the the tag model right here and we've got to let

32

00:01:49,380  -->  00:01:50,630
him know a listen.

33

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:52,300
All right.

34

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:54,180
The Post wants you.

35

00:01:54,300  -->  00:01:55,200
All right.

36

00:01:55,200  -->  00:02:00,760
So let's go public function and we're going to say polls.

37

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:01,360
All right.

38

00:02:01,470  -->  00:02:05,970
So now on this and this is what we are not find the med for each of its related models.

39

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:06,900
All right.

40

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:12,980
So for this example we're going to define Polsce method and that will define the videos as well.

41

00:02:13,260  -->  00:02:15,170
But we're going to use polls.

42

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:15,890
All right.

43

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:17,540
So let's do return

44

00:02:20,300  -->  00:02:27,120
this and this one is where we're going to be doing more by many.

45

00:02:27,150  -->  00:02:27,480
OK.

46

00:02:27,480  -->  00:02:28,570
Not on the last one.

47

00:02:28,570  -->  00:02:34,350
Like I said before I just you know what I meant was that we can use more of by many methods as well

48

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:39,330
we have many different mentors that we can use not to use it on the other side.

49

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:42,640
All right so this tag is going to be more.

50

00:02:42,690  -->  00:02:46,490
It's going to be used shared by many That's what we're saying here.

51

00:02:46,620  -->  00:02:47,410
OK.

52

00:02:47,610  -->  00:02:50,190
So who's it going to be share from.

53

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:52,110
It's going to be share from post.

54

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:55,140
So that's what we've got to really put a human first parameter.

55

00:02:55,200  -->  00:02:56,900
And of course we got to say staggerer.

56

00:02:56,910  -->  00:02:58,400
All right.

57

00:02:59,170  -->  00:03:08,520
Taggett Well as you can see this is taking the the singular name of the table because if you go to the

58

00:03:08,520  -->  00:03:20,430
migration right here let's go base and then right here is taking the singular name of that table.

59

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:21,180
All right.

60

00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:26,120
So anyway let's go back.

61

00:03:26,120  -->  00:03:28,610
All right so we're we're good with tags right.

62

00:03:28,620  -->  00:03:30,680
Let's go back here.

63

00:03:30,710  -->  00:03:31,690
We can do the Wii.

64

00:03:31,710  -->  00:03:36,580
Let's just do the videos were let's just copy this real quick.

65

00:03:36,600  -->  00:03:37,580
All right.

66

00:03:37,860  -->  00:03:48,180
And I was like All right my voice has left my body in a bad way there let's just do video here see that

67

00:03:48,180  -->  00:03:51,230
way you know what we're doing video.

68

00:03:51,710  -->  00:03:53,860
OK.

69

00:03:54,960  -->  00:04:02,400
Now we're going to do just pull out the information from Paul so that way you can see how it works and

70

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:03,900
then you can do the rest if you want.

71

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:04,830
All right.

72

00:04:04,890  -->  00:04:09,720
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture where we are going to

73

00:04:09,720  -->  00:04:13,410
be retrieving some of the relationships so that way you can see how it works.

74

00:04:13,410  -->  00:04:15,210
But I want you to try it on your own.

75

00:04:15,240  -->  00:04:16,470
This is super simple guys.

76

00:04:16,470  -->  00:04:24,180
We have been retrieving related models and you know all the models before when we got to well when the

77

00:04:24,180  -->  00:04:24,980
same way.

78

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:25,880
OK.

79

00:04:26,160  -->  00:04:33,270
So then we find it ok we find one and we returned with the method as a dynamic property.

80

00:04:33,270  -->  00:04:37,500
So just try to figure it out and try to do it on the next lecture we're going to have a lot more fun

81

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:37,530
.

82

00:04:37,530  -->  00:04:38,160
OK.

83

00:04:38,220  -->  00:04:41,310
So keep it up be doing a great job if you follow me on to here.

84

00:04:41,390  -->  00:04:46,240
And if you are coming back here with all the knowledge of all the relationships that we have done you're

85

00:04:46,260  -->  00:04:48,380
doing awesome so keep doing it.

86

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:49,350
We are learning a lot.

87

00:04:49,350  -->  00:04:50,510
We're going to learn some more.

88

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:50,920
Take your.

89

00:04:50,920  -->  00:04:51,870
See you in the next lecture
