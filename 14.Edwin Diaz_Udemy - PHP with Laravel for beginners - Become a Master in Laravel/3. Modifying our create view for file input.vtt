00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:02.710
All right welcome back to the students on this section.

2

00:00:02.890  -->  00:00:04.780
We've got to learn about uploading files right.

3

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:09.300
So let's go to a form and I'm already in the create view.

4

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:10.110
OK.

5

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:12.170
So see a mass.

6

00:00:12.170  -->  00:00:18.200
We were resources views and of course the Post folder and the Create view.

7

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:18.770
All right.

8

00:00:18.870  -->  00:00:25.530
So now in order for us to receive data write to actually tell this form listen we need to also accept

9

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:31.800
files we need to create out more and typewrite multi data part.

10

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:35.190
So let's go and see this thing in action.

11

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:42.750
Let's see why our form is now actually receiving files so this time we cannot receive files because

12

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:52.320
it's missing the Antibes So let's go to pools create and I'll show you right now if you inspect it.

13

00:00:52.430  -->  00:00:55.370
All right let's go right here.

14

00:00:55.380  -->  00:00:58.990
You can see that we don't have that achieve you right.

15

00:00:59.250  -->  00:01:01.220
We don't have the actually view and type anywhere.

16

00:01:01.350  -->  00:01:10.080
So in order for us to add that to our function let's just take this in order for us to add here in this

17

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:12.390
open function or method.

18

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:22.020
If you want to call it that we need to actually add it right here as a second parameter or as yes a

19

00:01:22.020  -->  00:01:23.570
third parameter actually.

20

00:01:23.880  -->  00:01:28.560
And we get to say files equals true that's all.

21

00:01:28.560  -->  00:01:31.560
So we the key files and then we got a value true.

22

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:32.550
So that's what it is.

23

00:01:32.570  -->  00:01:35.940
This associate of array if you want to call it that we refresh it.

24

00:01:35.960  -->  00:01:41.900
And now if we go back to it you can see that the anti was automatically added there once we we placed

25

00:01:41.900  -->  00:01:43.520
that key.

26

00:01:43.660  -->  00:01:44.290
OK.

27

00:01:44.370  -->  00:01:46.380
Super cool stuff right.

28

00:01:46.400  -->  00:01:46.910
All right.

29

00:01:47.160  -->  00:01:49.470
So now that we have our form mortified.

30

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:50.000
All right.

31

00:01:50.130  -->  00:01:56.160
The next step is to actually create the input right because we don't have any input here for that to

32

00:01:56.160  -->  00:01:57.040
all build right.

33

00:01:57.090  -->  00:01:59.530
We don't have that little button.

34

00:01:59.940  -->  00:02:01.720
So let's go ahead and create that.

35

00:02:01.740  -->  00:02:05.170
And I was thinking maybe we should create or above this one.

36

00:02:05.170  -->  00:02:10.300
So let's create a real quick.

37

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:14.070
As a matter of fact already the I show you guys how to do this already.

38

00:02:14.070  -->  00:02:18.800
Tets field is a little snippet.

39

00:02:18.810  -->  00:02:20.160
So this is where it comes in handy.

40

00:02:20.160  -->  00:02:21.150
You see that.

41

00:02:21.620  -->  00:02:23.430
OK a few.

42

00:02:23.430  -->  00:02:28.410
For some reason they now follow me when I show you how to create snippets on the last section or one

43

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:29.940
of the sections in the courses.

44

00:02:30.030  -->  00:02:35.850
Make sure that you just copy one of these guys and just paste them in here and just change this.

45

00:02:35.850  -->  00:02:38.320
Let's change this to say something like.

46

00:02:38.610  -->  00:02:45.900
Actually we don't even need a label for the input writing this info type is going to be.

47

00:02:46.320  -->  00:02:49.190
First of all let's give it a name.

48

00:02:49.240  -->  00:02:54.850
All right so it's going to be a file and then we can just call this file like this.

49

00:02:54.870  -->  00:02:55.700
All right.

50

00:02:55.980  -->  00:02:58.870
And we can take all this off.

51

00:02:58.890  -->  00:03:01.800
Now let's look at it and see how it looks.

52

00:03:01.840  -->  00:03:03.190
Refresh.

53

00:03:03.210  -->  00:03:11.540
And as you can see right here what is above the title is actually make sure it's below the title.

54

00:03:12.090  -->  00:03:15.280
Who's right here.

55

00:03:15.310  -->  00:03:17.200
I think that's all that's better there.

56

00:03:17.340  -->  00:03:23.760
Now don't worry about this being now formatted now being formatted when bootstrap will take care of

57

00:03:23.760  -->  00:03:28.310
that when we build a real really nice application we will be building OK.

58

00:03:28.680  -->  00:03:32.520
But meanwhile let's just leave it like this.

59

00:03:32.520  -->  00:03:33.010
OK.

60

00:03:33.110  -->  00:03:35.980
We have one in which too much time on the waste.

61

00:03:36.000  -->  00:03:42.100
All right so now that we modify our form right to accept files and we created this input.

62

00:03:42.210  -->  00:03:43.590
Now we need to receive the data.

63

00:03:43.590  -->  00:03:45.500
So that's going to that's going to be the next lecture.

64

00:03:45.500  -->  00:03:46.000
Okay.

65

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:47.270
Thank you so much for watching.

66

00:03:47.280  -->  00:03:48.150
And I see you then.

67

00:03:48.150  -->  00:03:48.880
Bye bye.
