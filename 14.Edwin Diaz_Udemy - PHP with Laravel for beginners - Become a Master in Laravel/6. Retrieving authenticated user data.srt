1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:01,610
All right welcome back my sister.

2

00:00:01,610  -->  00:00:08,780
And so sad for us to find out how to read tree authenticate a user's information or identikit it you

3

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:10,560
know applications right.

4

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:11,810
All right so cool.

5

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:16,500
Let's go to our home view here.

6

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:17,640
I want you to see something here.

7

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:21,170
This view here would not be available unless you are logged in.

8

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:21,950
How.

9

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:29,400
If you go back to your home controller OK we have this thing called middleware in the constructor meaning

10

00:00:29,400  -->  00:00:31,300
that this is going to be activated.

11

00:00:31,730  -->  00:00:37,620
All right throughout this home controller that means that every method is inside this home controller

12

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:43,350
would be protected by the middleware or unless you are authenticating it would not allow you to proceed

13

00:00:43,350  -->  00:00:43,790
.

14

00:00:43,790  -->  00:00:44,260
All right.

15

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:50,170
So I'm logged into my application right now I can easily go to Forest last home.

16

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:52,930
Whoops right here.

17

00:00:53,100  -->  00:00:54,490
You can see that right.

18

00:00:54,600  -->  00:00:58,590
But if I'm locked now and I try to go back in there.

19

00:00:58,590  -->  00:01:00,500
I get redirected to Logan.

20

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:01,500
OK.

21

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:02,730
So I know that stuff.

22

00:01:02,730  -->  00:01:05,650
Now let's log in real quick.

23

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:09,440
I'm logged in.

24

00:01:09,570  -->  00:01:10,120
All right.

25

00:01:10,230  -->  00:01:13,830
I want you to understand that we're going to go over this matter where later on but I just want you

26

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:14,820
to be aware of that.

27

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:17,240
So how do we pulao the users information.

28

00:01:17,260  -->  00:01:24,420
And guys remember these routes here all right there are the fine right here.

29

00:01:24,960  -->  00:01:27,000
OK that route for home.

30

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:30,930
You see the control of the route before flight home goes to one controller.

31

00:01:30,930  -->  00:01:33,280
So that's where we are right here.

32

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:33,890
OK.

33

00:01:34,140  -->  00:01:39,750
But anyway let's retrieve some of the users information and what I'm going to do is I'm going to access

34

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:45,780
a class called off and the method for user.

35

00:01:45,780  -->  00:01:51,420
All right this is where how we ox's out indication identikit a user with its class.

36

00:01:51,420  -->  00:01:56,000
So let's click on there and let's import it on top.

37

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:02,090
Make sure you importing this and make sure that you have this compact user already had it there.

38

00:02:02,320  -->  00:02:05,630
But that's because I have my dog bark.

39

00:02:05,630  -->  00:02:07,420
You know I had to remake the lectures so.

40

00:02:07,620  -->  00:02:13,540
But anyway so compact user used to do it from scratch review.

41

00:02:13,770  -->  00:02:16,150
Beautiful So we now that we're passing the user.

42

00:02:16,470  -->  00:02:22,590
If we go to the home controller real quick we can use Bley right here to display the user's name so

43

00:02:22,590  -->  00:02:26,200
we can say a user name ok.

44

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:28,960
Dennings should say the name of that person right.

45

00:02:29,270  -->  00:02:29,890
There we go.

46

00:02:29,940  -->  00:02:30,740
You are logged in.

47

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:31,340
Yes.

48

00:02:31,350  -->  00:02:31,870
All right.

49

00:02:32,010  -->  00:02:34,080
So that's how we retrieve the user's information.

50

00:02:34,080  -->  00:02:36,050
Let's go back to Rousey here.

51

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:39,680
I'm going to come in this out and show you another way to check.

52

00:02:39,750  -->  00:02:42,320
I'm going to show you a way to check the users logged in.

53

00:02:42,630  -->  00:02:44,920
All right cool.

54

00:02:45,120  -->  00:02:51,620
So we can say if we use is meant to check.

55

00:02:51,760  -->  00:02:52,320
All right.

56

00:02:52,320  -->  00:02:53,280
That's it.

57

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:57,080
Make sure that you import this on top.

58

00:02:57,080  -->  00:02:58,360
All right.

59

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:02,480
So we're going to return.

60

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:04,970
All right.

61

00:03:05,490  -->  00:03:12,290
The user is logged in.

62

00:03:12,750  -->  00:03:14,250
All right.

63

00:03:15,050  -->  00:03:15,270
All right.

64

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:17,280
Let's go to our route.

65

00:03:17,280  -->  00:03:19,310
Real quick.

66

00:03:19,740  -->  00:03:22,470
There we go the users logged in.

67

00:03:22,860  -->  00:03:30,040
But if we log now you can see that we didn't see anything right.

68

00:03:30,350  -->  00:03:31,380
Nothing.

69

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:39,900
So let's go and go to home log in again.

70

00:03:39,930  -->  00:03:41,300
All right.

71

00:03:41,430  -->  00:03:42,770
Whoops.

72

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:46,390
Oh and one thing about this.

73

00:03:47,450  -->  00:03:52,740
Well this logging system does is that if you keep trying here over and over again is going to lock you

74

00:03:52,740  -->  00:03:54,060
out for a couple of minutes.

75

00:03:54,060  -->  00:03:57,570
I don't know if it was 15 minutes or five minutes the first time.

76

00:03:57,600  -->  00:03:59,000
You can go to Larabee and check it out.

77

00:03:59,010  -->  00:04:02,100
But they would actually count how many times you tried.

78

00:04:02,220  -->  00:04:03,300
And he would lock you out.

79

00:04:03,300  -->  00:04:03,950
All right.

80

00:04:04,110  -->  00:04:08,250
So that's one of the cool things about this is Logan.

81

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:10,210
All right cool.

82

00:04:10,470  -->  00:04:16,410
So what else let's actually try to log in a user.

83

00:04:16,410  -->  00:04:22,040
All right so let's say you have a form and you are getting some values from the form.

84

00:04:22,050  -->  00:04:27,580
Like maybe they username and password and you want to create this you went out A.K. that user.

85

00:04:27,610  -->  00:04:28,220
All right.

86

00:04:28,470  -->  00:04:33,510
So you would do something like this once you and you would put this in a model or something.

87

00:04:33,510  -->  00:04:37,780
OK guys in a user might or.

88

00:04:38,730  -->  00:04:39,590
OK.

89

00:04:39,690  -->  00:04:40,000
All right.

90

00:04:40,020  -->  00:04:42,940
So let's do this.

91

00:04:45,210  -->  00:04:52,740
And this time it is the method and we can pass an array here real quick and we can say something like

92

00:04:53,610  -->  00:05:01,570
if the username in the database equal to the user name you give him the form and password.

93

00:05:03,230  -->  00:05:03,700
All right.

94

00:05:03,720  -->  00:05:04,200
Is.

95

00:05:04,210  -->  00:05:05,150
Cool.

96

00:05:05,190  -->  00:05:10,340
So the past where you give it me then you're good to go.

97

00:05:10,350  -->  00:05:11,640
I want you to read.

98

00:05:11,670  -->  00:05:13,760
I want to redirect you.

99

00:05:14,610  -->  00:05:15,290
OK.

100

00:05:15,420  -->  00:05:19,930
Back to where you try to log in.

101

00:05:20,970  -->  00:05:22,050
All right.

102

00:05:22,740  -->  00:05:24,650
That's what we do in this piece of code here.

103

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:30,340
So we not only just the we are the user but we're giving it the same you or I.

104

00:05:30,380  -->  00:05:31,900
They try to log in.

105

00:05:31,920  -->  00:05:39,690
So if they were trying to go to admin for some reason before and they got redirected back of course

106

00:05:39,690  -->  00:05:40,860
we don't have that route.

107

00:05:40,950  -->  00:05:46,110
But if they got redirected back to log in because of that and they try to logging now they are going

108

00:05:46,100  -->  00:05:50,240
to get redirected to outman the next time because that's what it's meant to doing.

109

00:05:50,460  -->  00:05:53,890
And we can put a default here just in case.

110

00:05:53,910  -->  00:05:54,930
All right cool.

111

00:05:54,930  -->  00:06:00,080
And the reason why this is underlined like this with it has red lines because I haven't put values forward

112

00:06:00,690  -->  00:06:01,610
for that yet.

113

00:06:01,680  -->  00:06:04,860
So my ids letting me know hey listen these variables are empty.

114

00:06:04,870  -->  00:06:06,230
See that.

115

00:06:07,050  -->  00:06:15,370
So now it's for the other one we can leave user name by itself you know.

116

00:06:15,690  -->  00:06:16,730
All right cool.

117

00:06:16,740  -->  00:06:17,960
So that's one way of doing this.

118

00:06:17,970  -->  00:06:24,930
Now you can also log at my real quick guys at the end of this section check for resources check for

119

00:06:24,930  -->  00:06:28,200
links I gave you this link so you can go to the documentation.

120

00:06:28,200  -->  00:06:29,810
Look at this method you can do that yourself.

121

00:06:29,820  -->  00:06:34,130
So Breezer stuff and just giving you an overview of some of the methods.

122

00:06:34,290  -->  00:06:35,670
But this is piece of cake.

123

00:06:35,670  -->  00:06:36,130
OK.

124

00:06:36,150  -->  00:06:43,230
In the project that we're going to be creating We are going to be really really really practicing the

125

00:06:43,350  -->  00:06:47,760
practices stuff really we're going to really jump into the project and we're going to create something

126

00:06:47,760  -->  00:06:51,580
amazing that you're going to love and that you're going to get a lot of knowledge from OK.

127

00:06:51,660  -->  00:06:57,060
This is basically going over a couple of things and things that you can go into the station and do yourself

128

00:06:57,060  -->  00:06:57,090
.

129

00:06:57,090  -->  00:07:01,740
But this gives you an idea how he's done so when you look at the documentation is going to be easier

130

00:07:01,740  -->  00:07:02,730
for you to digest.

131

00:07:02,730  -->  00:07:03,330
OK.

132

00:07:03,450  -->  00:07:05,130
Anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

133

00:07:05,130  -->  00:07:06,160
It's been a pleasure.

134

00:07:06,300  -->  00:07:08,410
And I'll see you in the next lecture
