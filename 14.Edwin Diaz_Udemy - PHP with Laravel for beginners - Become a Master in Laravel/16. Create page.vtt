00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.300
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.310  -->  00:00:06.510
The students in this lecture we're going to work with they create file just so that way we can start

3

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:07.340
creating users.

4

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:16.110
But before we do that let's actually check the database real quick to see if we need other columns here

5

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:17.220
or any other roles.

6

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:23.680
So let's go to call hacking real quick and let's go to BHB admin.

7

00:00:24.290  -->  00:00:25.020
All right.

8

00:00:25.020  -->  00:00:31.210
Let's go to that database and let's check the users we can see that we have the roll ID.

9

00:00:31.210  -->  00:00:38.470
That would be useful to actually show the roll of the user and to see.

10

00:00:38.520  -->  00:00:41.540
And also the active part of it.

11

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:43.700
I think that would be very useful to do that.

12

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:48.360
We don't have anything else here that we need right now.

13

00:00:48.360  -->  00:00:51.780
All right so let's actually do that real quick.

14

00:00:51.780  -->  00:01:02.210
So let's after e-mail I think it would be useful to do it after the here and we use a roll and we'll

15

00:01:02.250  -->  00:01:06.120
say active.

16

00:01:07.170  -->  00:01:07.560
All right.

17

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:11.550
So we've got to actually build a little system for this.

18

00:01:11.550  -->  00:01:11.940
All right

19

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:18.590
.

20

00:01:18.590  -->  00:01:19.590
I'm going to actually

21

00:01:23.700  -->  00:01:25.400
take it all the way here.

22

00:01:26.610  -->  00:01:28.840
All right.

23

00:01:30.770  -->  00:01:32.640
OK.

24

00:01:32.670  -->  00:01:39.780
All right so they're all of the users so we're going to use Groll name.

25

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:40.510
All right.

26

00:01:41.010  -->  00:01:41.820
Let's go back.

27

00:01:41.820  -->  00:01:43.100
Already show you how to do that guys.

28

00:01:43.150  -->  00:01:45.210
We're pulling out the owner.

29

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:46.080
All right.

30

00:01:46.380  -->  00:01:52.860
And remember instead of using the methods a lot of it allows us to use properties.

31

00:01:52.860  -->  00:01:53.760
All right.

32

00:01:53.760  -->  00:01:55.750
So that's cool.

33

00:01:55.830  -->  00:02:00.610
We have to actually create a we have a rule for that.

34

00:02:00.620  -->  00:02:03.080
Age just went to though this I

35

00:02:07.260  -->  00:02:12.680
have to push this a little bit because we need to roll ideas well be active.

36

00:02:12.780  -->  00:02:13.860
So after all

37

00:02:19.080  -->  00:02:26.920
we have to do it over a little bit of validation here or out indication right.

38

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:30.230
All right we're going to find out if these users active.

39

00:02:30.220  -->  00:02:30.740
All right.

40

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:36.210
So we're going to say if user as a matter of fact I'm going to show you.

41

00:02:36.210  -->  00:02:40.320
Let's do it in one line here guys.

42

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:41.360
All right.

43

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:43.940
So we're going to use itinerary here.

44

00:02:43.950  -->  00:02:49.650
Condition of Clarabelle blade the 10:3 ternary.

45

00:02:49.860  -->  00:02:58.060
So we're going to see if the user.

46

00:03:01.740  -->  00:03:07.880
I want you to display user is and this is a prop. active marae

47

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:19.260
display that if it's there actually I mean see if it's user active equals

48

00:03:25.920  -->  00:03:27.450
equals.

49

00:03:27.810  -->  00:03:32.860
One thing that we could do that we can say active.

50

00:03:33.420  -->  00:03:34.430
OK.

51

00:03:34.920  -->  00:03:36.970
Yeah that's the way we set it up over there.

52

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:47.000
And if the user it's not active if it's zero then we're going to say inactive.

53

00:03:47.710  -->  00:03:48.190
OK.

54

00:03:48.300  -->  00:03:57.480
I was trying to figure out if it was 0 or 1 if we that we set up in our database.

55

00:03:57.480  -->  00:03:59.990
So if we go back here let's just double check.

56

00:04:00.300  -->  00:04:00.720
OK.

57

00:04:00.720  -->  00:04:05.650
These guys active in one means active and 0 means it's not.

58

00:04:06.240  -->  00:04:11.990
So here this is the same thing as using the temporary in the BHB native BHB.

59

00:04:12.000  -->  00:04:17.520
Right but we use in blades that are doing echo we are actually using blate to do that.

60

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:25.590
So if the user is active is equal to one of these properties active is equal to one we are going to

61

00:04:25.600  -->  00:04:26.430
display active.

62

00:04:26.430  -->  00:04:30.220
If it's not that's what the calling is we're going to say it's not active.

63

00:04:30.220  -->  00:04:31.340
All right.

64

00:04:31.980  -->  00:04:37.410
So let's just refresh real quick as you can see the user is active.

65

00:04:37.440  -->  00:04:40.190
All right cool.

66

00:04:40.230  -->  00:04:48.900
So now let's go back and create the other page that we need actually is already created polishers.

67

00:04:49.980  -->  00:04:54.630
Make sure that we are extending this man

68

00:04:57.210  -->  00:04:58.050
content

69

00:05:02.370  -->  00:05:05.250
stop.

70

00:05:06.210  -->  00:05:10.180
And this is where we're going to be creating users this is going to be a really exciting lecture right

71

00:05:10.180  -->  00:05:10.680
here.

72

00:05:10.770  -->  00:05:12.960
A couple lectures.

73

00:05:12.960  -->  00:05:15.600
All right so.

74

00:05:17.220  -->  00:05:22.090
And create loops.

75

00:05:23.490  -->  00:05:24.900
Let's actually look at the

76

00:05:27.960  -->  00:05:30.620
route so let's clear this out.

77

00:05:30.680  -->  00:05:36.410
BHP areason route list.

78

00:05:36.480  -->  00:05:37.360
All right.

79

00:05:37.680  -->  00:05:42.750
So there you or I for this would be I mean you'd just create.

80

00:05:43.880  -->  00:05:45.100
OK I misspelled that.

81

00:05:45.120  -->  00:05:48.940
That's what he's saying there.

82

00:05:49.290  -->  00:05:55.480
So if we go to the controller real quick there we go you probably.

83

00:05:55.480  -->  00:05:59.580
You guys probably saw that before I even did it.

84

00:05:59.580  -->  00:06:00.610
There you go.

85

00:06:00.720  -->  00:06:02.440
All right so we got this page started.

86

00:06:02.530  -->  00:06:05.610
Well the next lecture we're going to work a lot on this forum right.

87

00:06:05.620  -->  00:06:10.290
So really get really excited because you're going to be learning really cool stuff in the next lecture

88

00:06:10.290  -->  00:06:10.320
.

89

00:06:10.320  -->  00:06:10.820
OK.

90

00:06:11.010  -->  00:06:13.030
So wake up get your coffee ready.

91

00:06:13.050  -->  00:06:16.000
If you don't have it or your natural energy drink.

92

00:06:16.080  -->  00:06:18.440
Let's get started on the next lecture.

93

00:06:18.450  -->  00:06:19.610
Take care.
