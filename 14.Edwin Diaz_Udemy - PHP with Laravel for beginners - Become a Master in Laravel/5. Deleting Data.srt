00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:06,540
All right welcome back my sister and so we're going to start deleting some of these relationships right

2

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:18,280
now in my data right here my Ph.D. admin not in this one in this one.

3

00:00:18,390  -->  00:00:24,940
Actually they are both the same sort about the guys in this here.

4

00:00:24,940  -->  00:00:30,350
I've got a couple of tags and I have a couple of polls that are related to some of them.

5

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:33,090
Now your data my data may not be the same or right.

6

00:00:33,090  -->  00:00:36,150
So we've got polls number one into here.

7

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:42,420
If I want to tag Jubal's you can see that I've got polls one in two and this one is related to two and

8

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:43,980
three.

9

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:46,050
All right so I got the two and three tags.

10

00:00:46,080  -->  00:00:47,270
Two and Three.

11

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:50,870
I don't have a three here so I'm going to create a three right now.

12

00:00:50,870  -->  00:00:52,500
All right.

13

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:54,010
There we go.

14

00:00:54,150  -->  00:00:55,680
So we got polls for me.

15

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:57,500
Post Number One and Two.

16

00:00:57,930  -->  00:01:02,310
All right have relationships right here.

17

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:03,420
All right.

18

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:05,930
So I'm going to delete this one in here.

19

00:01:06,960  -->  00:01:08,490
All right.

20

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:09,710
Beautiful.

21

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:11,060
OK.

22

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:15,270
So it's just I want you to see what happens.

23

00:01:15,290  -->  00:01:15,930
All right.

24

00:01:16,040  -->  00:01:18,230
With this relationship when we delete it.

25

00:01:18,940  -->  00:01:22,010
OK.

26

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:25,820
I don't know what's going on with my browser today.

27

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:26,820
It's acting up.

28

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:28,580
I'm going to have to do an update on my computer.

29

00:01:28,590  -->  00:01:35,580
But anyway let's go ahead and create the delete route.

30

00:01:35,580  -->  00:01:36,960
We've done this many times.

31

00:01:36,960  -->  00:01:43,620
It's just and it's the same thing with this one guys with a polymorph and we need too many but a little

32

00:01:43,620  -->  00:01:49,140
confusing since we have so many tables.

33

00:01:49,140  -->  00:01:55,990
So what we've got to do is we find the post right.

34

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:02,700
Let's say we find pools number one right now we use a foreach each to loop through that collection because

35

00:02:02,700  -->  00:02:03,870
we are linked to a collection.

36

00:02:03,870  -->  00:02:07,820
Remember those tax.

37

00:02:07,830  -->  00:02:13,640
That's what we're going to be looking through as tag.

38

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:16,190
Now this becomes the object.

39

00:02:16,230  -->  00:02:24,450
Now I can say tag all right where ID equals.

40

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:29,260
We've got two and three right away ID goes to I wanted to delete it.

41

00:02:29,260  -->  00:02:30,100
All right.

42

00:02:30,930  -->  00:02:33,300
Cool let's try this out.

43

00:02:33,330  -->  00:02:36,810
And let me make this a little big.

44

00:02:36,810  -->  00:02:42,470
Here we go.

45

00:02:42,480  -->  00:02:43,730
All righty.

46

00:02:44,490  -->  00:02:50,960
This has been a very hard lecture to make because every time I'm creating this lecture either my my

47

00:02:51,050  -->  00:02:57,990
the dog in the house barks somebody comes in the house or you know I mean in my office somebody comes

48

00:02:57,990  -->  00:03:01,830
in the office every time I try to create It's like just something goes up.

49

00:03:01,950  -->  00:03:05,470
But anyway hopefully I'll be able to finish it with you guys this time.

50

00:03:05,550  -->  00:03:06,790
So delete.

51

00:03:07,170  -->  00:03:12,520
Enter and refresh.

52

00:03:12,540  -->  00:03:13,670
All right.

53

00:03:14,040  -->  00:03:15,210
This is the

54

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:20,810
tag as you can see with the little tag number two.

55

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:24,590
Now that is less than the tag number three.

56

00:03:26,220  -->  00:03:33,220
As you can see we're deleting the task tags through our relationship right refresh

57

00:03:34,780  -->  00:03:38,340
.

58

00:03:39,650  -->  00:03:50,550
We go here tagging walls and we got actually one polls and two polls and we got tagged two and three

59

00:03:50,560  -->  00:03:50,950
.

60

00:03:51,360  -->  00:03:53,740
OK.

61

00:03:53,760  -->  00:03:59,510
And now in order for this to be the lead and we've got to find in order for this attack to be the leader

62

00:03:59,520  -->  00:04:01,250
this is what gets confusing guys.

63

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:07,950
We have to actually find polls number one guys number two and we try to look for polls number one.

64

00:04:07,950  -->  00:04:09,660
And look if we're talking number three.

65

00:04:09,660  -->  00:04:10,500
All right.

66

00:04:10,950  -->  00:04:12,390
So that's that's the problem.

67

00:04:12,390  -->  00:04:14,400
That's why they're not the leader there.

68

00:04:14,430  -->  00:04:19,650
So if we're going to find polls number two and the lead attack that he has because that's a relationship

69

00:04:19,680  -->  00:04:21,300
that's it's tag.

70

00:04:21,570  -->  00:04:22,030
Delete.

71

00:04:22,080  -->  00:04:23,240
Oops.

72

00:04:24,140  -->  00:04:27,900
The lead refresh now here guys.

73

00:04:27,900  -->  00:04:31,920
Now here right here is gone.

74

00:04:31,920  -->  00:04:32,220
All right.

75

00:04:32,220  -->  00:04:37,830
And then this tag your eye here is related to nobody.

76

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:40,230
So let's relay this tag to

77

00:04:42,780  -->  00:04:45,530
this pose.

78

00:04:46,550  -->  00:04:48,090
So it's related to number one.

79

00:04:48,090  -->  00:04:52,030
Now let's see.

80

00:04:53,010  -->  00:04:55,320
Oops.

81

00:04:55,410  -->  00:04:56,380
All right.

82

00:04:57,390  -->  00:05:00,340
Almost there.

83

00:05:01,860  -->  00:05:04,930
I tell you it is not your day is not your day.

84

00:05:04,980  -->  00:05:09,410
As you can see there there's one time here.

85

00:05:09,450  -->  00:05:15,120
This tag is supposed to be related to post number one.

86

00:05:16,020  -->  00:05:19,940
And then for his own reasons still there.

87

00:05:19,950  -->  00:05:21,200
All right.

88

00:05:21,960  -->  00:05:25,950
That's because we generally tag number three oh geez.

89

00:05:26,730  -->  00:05:28,340
Over guns.

90

00:05:28,400  -->  00:05:31,160
Or I got this letter because it's funny right.

91

00:05:31,440  -->  00:05:32,150
Refresh.

92

00:05:32,190  -->  00:05:34,100
No tags.

93

00:05:35,400  -->  00:05:37,790
All right so I think we're done with the leads.

94

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:42,760
And if you have if you guys have any questions feel free to ask.

95

00:05:42,840  -->  00:05:49,080
Go in the discussion and have your laughter they also have some fun coding in them practicing and I'll

96

00:05:49,080  -->  00:05:50,730
see you in the application section.

97

00:05:50,770  -->  00:05:52,930
OK soon.

98

00:05:53,010  -->  00:05:54,120
Take care.
