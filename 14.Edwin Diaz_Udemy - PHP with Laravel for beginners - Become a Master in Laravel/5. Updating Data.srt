1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,730
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,740  -->  00:00:06,120
So it's time for us to learn how to update using the polymorphic relationship.

3

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:07,100
All right cool.

4

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:13,520
Let's go and open our HP storm if you have one.

5

00:00:13,710  -->  00:00:14,660
If you don't.

6

00:00:14,940  -->  00:00:15,940
Don't worry about it.

7

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:18,750
We use a or other editor.

8

00:00:18,870  -->  00:00:22,450
Let's get around for this.

9

00:00:22,480  -->  00:00:24,540
Right this is going to be the update

10

00:00:24,540  -->  00:00:31,100
.

11

00:00:31,140  -->  00:00:32,060
All right.

12

00:00:32,400  -->  00:00:44,110
So first we find staff ray machines find one or fail it.

13

00:00:45,560  -->  00:00:46,050
Right.

14

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:47,790
OK cool.

15

00:00:48,640  -->  00:00:49,180
And

16

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:55,060
let me see if we can do a little different here guys.

17

00:00:55,230  -->  00:00:57,530
All right let me show you how to do it this way.

18

00:00:57,540  -->  00:01:03,210
All right so let's do a staff photos.

19

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:04,700
All right.

20

00:01:04,710  -->  00:01:06,490
So you know how to do this.

21

00:01:06,660  -->  00:01:09,810
And let's just do a where.

22

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:13,690
I don't know ID equals one.

23

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:17,580
Bring me the first one.

24

00:01:19,080  -->  00:01:20,180
OK.

25

00:01:20,260  -->  00:01:20,530
And

26

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:24,200
I want to change it.

27

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:25,620
Let's change.

28

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:27,410
Let's grab it let's gravity in the variable.

29

00:01:27,410  -->  00:01:31,830
Look at these watches for you.

30

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:32,400
All right.

31

00:01:32,400  -->  00:01:36,150
So remember now I have this object now because first we change the subject.

32

00:01:36,150  -->  00:01:38,120
They get returns a collection.

33

00:01:38,310  -->  00:01:43,240
So let's do let's use a safe method here.

34

00:01:43,610  -->  00:01:44,750
And this is safe.

35

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:46,420
Save it.

36

00:01:46,440  -->  00:01:49,770
But we haven't even put in the properties yet.

37

00:01:49,770  -->  00:01:51,840
So the only property that we can.

38

00:01:51,850  -->  00:01:57,620
Well one of the problems that we can get is the path that's a column there and we're going to say updating

39

00:01:58,230  -->  00:02:01,410
exemple the GBG.

40

00:02:01,890  -->  00:02:03,270
All right let's see how this works.

41

00:02:03,270  -->  00:02:04,960
OK let's see if it works for us.

42

00:02:04,960  -->  00:02:05,870
All right.

43

00:02:06,330  -->  00:02:08,000
All right cool.

44

00:02:08,130  -->  00:02:08,900
Update

45

00:02:11,630  -->  00:02:13,420
us.

46

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:19,690
And to whoops that looks like work Ray BHB my admin.

47

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:25,440
Let's go and order the polymorphic photos.

48

00:02:25,460  -->  00:02:28,000
Act as you can see set of date example.

49

00:02:28,000  -->  00:02:30,460
So it worked beautiful.

50

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:31,990
You saw how easy that was.

51

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:34,740
Michel you spell it correctly OK.

52

00:02:34,800  -->  00:02:37,640
All right so you can do stuff like this when you updating.

53

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:39,530
Of course there are other ways of doing it.

54

00:02:39,900  -->  00:02:42,030
But I wanted to show you to show it to you.

55

00:02:42,040  -->  00:02:43,670
You can do it like this.

56

00:02:43,680  -->  00:02:47,550
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
