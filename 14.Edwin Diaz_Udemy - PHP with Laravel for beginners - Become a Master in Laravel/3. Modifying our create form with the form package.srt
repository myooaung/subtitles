1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:00,880
All right.

2

00:00:00,920  -->  00:00:02,460
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02,470  -->  00:00:09,570
The student so the last lecture we learned how installed this form package.

4

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:09,980
All right.

5

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:14,790
And we even learned some of the fields that it creates automatically right when we did inspect element

6

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:15,510
.

7

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:20,340
Now we're going to learn how to pass a couple of parameters and not just use the ones in the fold but

8

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:22,790
actually override those default parameters.

9

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:24,640
Now let's go to our browser.

10

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:25,770
Let's check this out first.

11

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:27,680
Let's see if it works right.

12

00:00:27,780  -->  00:00:32,520
We've got to make sure that this stuff works.

13

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:33,030
So

14

00:00:36,780  -->  00:00:43,980
let's going canso this and if we try to use this it says method not allowed.

15

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:44,480
Right.

16

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:47,820
Well if you look at it you inspect element again right.

17

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:53,870
If we do that and we see what's going on is going to send those to our create method.

18

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:55,250
That's not what we want.

19

00:00:55,560  -->  00:01:03,290
All right we want to go to the update method now of the I'm sorry to the store method.

20

00:01:03,680  -->  00:01:04,210
OK.

21

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:08,140
So let's go ahead and do this real quick.

22

00:01:08,240  -->  00:01:12,300
It's I'm going to go ahead and pass a couple of Ramadan's I'm going to pass an array actually.

23

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:18,430
And with a couple of keys the first key that I'm going to put in here is demented.

24

00:01:18,450  -->  00:01:20,280
What method do we want to use.

25

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:24,020
Well this is going to be storing information.

26

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:26,560
We are going to be using a post.

27

00:01:26,670  -->  00:01:32,390
All right now I'm going to separate it and we're going to put another parameter here.

28

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:34,470
Where is the action where is it going to.

29

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:38,160
All right well we want this to go to a specific you are now.

30

00:01:38,190  -->  00:01:41,820
But at the same time we want this to go to a specific method.

31

00:01:41,820  -->  00:01:42,080
Right.

32

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:47,550
So why don't we use that why don't we use use a controller and the method to where he's going.

33

00:01:47,550  -->  00:01:57,230
So let's do that is going to the polls controller at what At story method.

34

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:58,680
All right remember that.

35

00:01:58,680  -->  00:02:00,240
So this is the way we do it here.

36

00:02:00,270  -->  00:02:04,150
We put the controller first and that's the controller we have for

37

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:10,870
pulls post controller and then demand that work is going right.

38

00:02:11,220  -->  00:02:12,090
All right cool.

39

00:02:12,330  -->  00:02:14,010
So now let's try to see if it works.

40

00:02:14,010  -->  00:02:19,380
OK so I'm going to take that I'll refresh it.

41

00:02:19,590  -->  00:02:21,060
And now let's create another

42

00:02:23,970  -->  00:02:27,870
enter as you can see it just created that.

43

00:02:27,870  -->  00:02:31,430
So let's go back and create another one.

44

00:02:32,550  -->  00:02:34,920
All right what else.

45

00:02:35,800  -->  00:02:38,790
Clarabell of course we're missing Loubert right.

46

00:02:39,090  -->  00:02:42,720
Submit and as you can see it's working perfectly.

47

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:43,600
All right.

48

00:02:44,070  -->  00:02:49,340
So now that we pass him down let's actually create the closing form tag.

49

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:54,090
So let's take that out of here.

50

00:02:55,590  -->  00:03:01,710
The curly bracket exclamation if you do that one curly bracket one inflammation BHB strong will finish

51

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:02,480
it for you.

52

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:09,870
So we do the form and then close static method call.

53

00:03:09,900  -->  00:03:10,960
All right.

54

00:03:11,340  -->  00:03:15,900
So now we go back and we check it to see if it still works right.

55

00:03:16,420  -->  00:03:17,940
It looks like it's working.

56

00:03:18,210  -->  00:03:19,290
Cool.

57

00:03:19,290  -->  00:03:24,700
All right so now let's create this input right here the title input.

58

00:03:24,750  -->  00:03:26,110
So how we do this.

59

00:03:26,130  -->  00:03:34,080
Well if you use ambil strap which later on we will be using bootstrap of course you have to have some

60

00:03:34,080  -->  00:03:36,020
type of def here.

61

00:03:36,450  -->  00:03:42,090
Would a form of group actually right here.

62

00:03:42,240  -->  00:03:49,420
All right and say this we will have a name put a label and on the input so that we go.

63

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:52,600
And now let's create a label.

64

00:03:53,580  -->  00:03:58,630
Remember that all this information would be the last lecture of the sectional guys.

65

00:03:58,730  -->  00:04:02,400
I know to give you the resources so you can find out how to do this.

66

00:04:02,430  -->  00:04:03,340
All right.

67

00:04:03,450  -->  00:04:07,080
Remember to go to the Lauber collect the Web site as a matter of fact I think I have a window here that

68

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:08,060
I can show you.

69

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:12,330
And you can see all the possibilities for this.

70

00:04:12,410  -->  00:04:18,390
All right all the methods all the extra stuff you can do is going to be pretty cool if for some reason

71

00:04:18,390  -->  00:04:19,890
I forget to give you the resources.

72

00:04:19,890  -->  00:04:22,380
Go check out the documentation.

73

00:04:22,380  -->  00:04:22,800
All right.

74

00:04:22,840  -->  00:04:27,940
The version number of the Larabee you're using and the H mail.

75

00:04:27,960  -->  00:04:28,880
All right cool.

76

00:04:29,190  -->  00:04:31,250
So now let's learn how to create this label.

77

00:04:31,470  -->  00:04:36,600
All right so of course we're going to have a label function and we're going to pass a couple of parameters

78

00:04:36,600  -->  00:04:42,160
so the label function and the farmers are going to be as follows.

79

00:04:42,260  -->  00:04:44,330
I'm going to say that title right.

80

00:04:44,610  -->  00:04:54,540
And then whatever title we won in this case we want to use title like this or the Post name or whatever

81

00:04:54,540  -->  00:04:55,460
you want to use.

82

00:04:55,710  -->  00:04:56,010
OK.

83

00:04:56,010  -->  00:04:58,820
That's going to be this is going to be.

84

00:04:59,470  -->  00:04:59,920
All right.

85

00:04:59,910  -->  00:05:03,210
What he's for and this is going to be the actual tÃªtes.

86

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:04,610
The people can see.

87

00:05:04,650  -->  00:05:05,200
All right.

88

00:05:05,340  -->  00:05:06,690
So now we got the label.

89

00:05:06,720  -->  00:05:12,450
Let's go ahead and create the tets input form.

90

00:05:12,930  -->  00:05:16,740
Then tets function.

91

00:05:16,920  -->  00:05:20,880
Now first parameter is the name attribute value.

92

00:05:21,180  -->  00:05:23,780
OK this is where the name equals whatever.

93

00:05:23,820  -->  00:05:29,310
In this case is going to be title The second parameter is going to be the default.

94

00:05:30,030  -->  00:05:32,550
And we're going to use no for that.

95

00:05:32,550  -->  00:05:34,980
And the third parameter can be anything you want.

96

00:05:35,010  -->  00:05:36,890
In this case we're going to pass an array.

97

00:05:37,260  -->  00:05:45,660
And we're going to use a class because later on we will need a class for bootstrap write form control

98

00:05:45,660  -->  00:05:47,540
would be the bootstrap class.

99

00:05:48,300  -->  00:05:55,040
And of course I forgot my single quotes we

100

00:05:57,590  -->  00:05:59,080
control.

101

00:05:59,920  -->  00:06:00,950
All right.

102

00:06:01,950  -->  00:06:02,910
Cool.

103

00:06:02,910  -->  00:06:07,190
Now this has to Courtland's there.

104

00:06:07,230  -->  00:06:07,950
All right.

105

00:06:08,280  -->  00:06:15,030
So they say the tests were there and he will go back and you can see that we have.

106

00:06:15,030  -->  00:06:18,950
And that's the first one that we created.

107

00:06:18,960  -->  00:06:22,100
Actually that's just the Laro one that we created.

108

00:06:22,110  -->  00:06:23,670
And this is the old one.

109

00:06:24,030  -->  00:06:24,460
OK.

110

00:06:24,540  -->  00:06:28,970
So now we can remove this old one from here.

111

00:06:30,690  -->  00:06:33,920
All right cool.

112

00:06:33,960  -->  00:06:37,960
So now let's go and try it out to see if it works.

113

00:06:38,850  -->  00:06:44,600
Example cement Y LA it's working.

114

00:06:44,970  -->  00:06:47,100
Ok cool.

115

00:06:47,100  -->  00:06:51,610
All right so now we could if we wanted to create a bun as well.

116

00:06:51,630  -->  00:06:55,780
So let's do that actually.

117

00:06:56,870  -->  00:06:57,710
There we go.

118

00:06:57,930  -->  00:07:05,660
And we don't we don't need a label for form for the bar and so we're going to say form submit

119

00:07:09,690  -->  00:07:12,950
and that's if all form meant if you want to leave it like that.

120

00:07:12,990  -->  00:07:23,690
That's up to you if you want to modify it or you can modify it and you can say create post and then

121

00:07:23,690  -->  00:07:33,000
we can pass an array here for the class so you can say class and of course you can give a B and later

122

00:07:33,000  -->  00:07:38,840
on you're not going to see this resource here for the class because we don't have bootstrap linked yet

123

00:07:38,880  -->  00:07:40,310
but we will in the future.

124

00:07:40,580  -->  00:07:41,090
All right.

125

00:07:41,220  -->  00:07:45,420
And now you can take this off course right.

126

00:07:45,540  -->  00:07:49,980
Now of course you want what you want if you want to create a group for it.

127

00:07:49,980  -->  00:07:50,580
You can

128

00:07:54,810  -->  00:07:56,750
write up to you.

129

00:07:56,760  -->  00:07:58,830
Now let's go back and see how that looks.

130

00:07:58,950  -->  00:07:59,970
Answer.

131

00:07:59,970  -->  00:08:04,540
There we go.

132

00:08:04,580  -->  00:08:06,820
Here we go.

133

00:08:08,550  -->  00:08:09,570
Now it's working.

134

00:08:09,570  -->  00:08:14,680
Now we got a form totally made with bootstrap function odds.

135

00:08:14,700  -->  00:08:21,010
I mean with the reform package functionality which is pretty cool.

136

00:08:21,330  -->  00:08:27,450
All right later on you're going to see why so useful and how we can use it to make our application a

137

00:08:27,450  -->  00:08:31,620
little bit more dynamic in some of you already know this how we can make a little bit more dynamic and

138

00:08:31,620  -->  00:08:32,200
easier.

139

00:08:32,250  -->  00:08:33,090
OK.

140

00:08:33,090  -->  00:08:36,710
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
