1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,010
All right so after a couple hiccups in the last lecture we're way to get the comments working right

2

00:00:05,010  -->  00:00:05,510
.

3

00:00:05,520  -->  00:00:06,790
Pretty cool stuff though.

4

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:08,170
Laura is beautiful.

5

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:09,420
Very cool.

6

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:09,830
All right.

7

00:00:09,890  -->  00:00:17,220
So I was playing around a little bit with it so we can see here that we have a comment here.

8

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:20,180
I think this will work even though I don't mind fixing bugs.

9

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:21,960
We got that one working.

10

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:26,060
Now it's time for us to start showing comments in our admin area right.

11

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:31,190
That way we can delete them all or update them or do whatever we need to do with him.

12

00:00:31,190  -->  00:00:31,720
All right.

13

00:00:31,910  -->  00:00:33,060
Cool.

14

00:00:33,250  -->  00:00:37,080
So admin comments in this.

15

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:38,700
Let's go.

16

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:39,060
All right.

17

00:00:39,060  -->  00:00:40,810
First we get a table.

18

00:00:41,390  -->  00:00:42,730
All right.

19

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:45,960
At least we have something there.

20

00:00:45,960  -->  00:00:47,020
All right cool.

21

00:00:47,070  -->  00:00:51,030
Now that we have something there let's go to our controller real quick and try to pass something before

22

00:00:51,030  -->  00:00:53,100
we try to show something right.

23

00:00:53,370  -->  00:01:00,890
So let's pass as we go to controllers and post comments controller.

24

00:01:00,890  -->  00:01:01,490
All right.

25

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:03,360
And that's right here.

26

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:05,800
That's Bhatt's past the comments

27

00:01:10,930  -->  00:01:14,500
comments and

28

00:01:17,390  -->  00:01:21,660
yeah that's fine.

29

00:01:22,010  -->  00:01:23,330
Pass them right here

30

00:01:24,130  -->  00:01:29,640
.

31

00:01:30,500  -->  00:01:32,590
Hope you guys are having a good day.

32

00:01:32,640  -->  00:01:35,460
It's really awesome to be calling today.

33

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:36,420
It's really nice weather.

34

00:01:36,420  -->  00:01:39,180
Our size is like around 75 where I am pretty.

35

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:40,110
Really amazing.

36

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:43,560
I love the weather in Florida right now.

37

00:01:43,740  -->  00:01:50,100
And I have an office here where I you know I used to come in and record some of these videos here so

38

00:01:50,400  -->  00:01:51,720
it's pretty nice.

39

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:55,700
The weather is like around 75 to 80 85.

40

00:01:55,740  -->  00:01:58,770
All right so let's go to college right now.

41

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:03,870
And now that we're passing the men we can start seeing them.

42

00:02:04,350  -->  00:02:13,350
But here what I want to do is I want to say if count comments

43

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:19,720
is greater than zero we're going to show it.

44

00:02:21,210  -->  00:02:26,110
And and if.

45

00:02:26,130  -->  00:02:26,590
All right.

46

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:29,660
So we have some comments there.

47

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:35,330
What if we do it backwards and disappears.

48

00:02:35,370  -->  00:02:37,010
So it's working.

49

00:02:37,070  -->  00:02:37,860
All right.

50

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:46,430
That's just a little test there used to make sure that it's working.

51

00:02:46,470  -->  00:02:48,170
That's one nail statement real quick here.

52

00:02:48,210  -->  00:03:01,200
And let's just say else this poor H-1 with a class of tech center from Bootstrap and let's just say

53

00:03:01,200  -->  00:03:03,130
no comments.

54

00:03:04,200  -->  00:03:05,160
OK.

55

00:03:05,640  -->  00:03:12,460
So let's turn this around again and see how that looks.

56

00:03:12,480  -->  00:03:13,040
No comment.

57

00:03:13,040  -->  00:03:14,640
He's right in the middle too.

58

00:03:14,700  -->  00:03:24,800
We've got to get these comments thing out right here Friday right there.

59

00:03:24,950  -->  00:03:26,680
Right.

60

00:03:27,910  -->  00:03:28,730
OK.

61

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:32,670
And let's take this to rose out of here to Rose.

62

00:03:32,710  -->  00:03:39,630
Let's do that for each right here.

63

00:03:40,100  -->  00:03:41,370
There's two comments.

64

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:42,060
Comment

65

00:03:50,070  -->  00:03:55,690
and for each one we want to see here do we care about the I-Team.

66

00:03:55,710  -->  00:03:57,700
Well for us because we are in development.

67

00:03:57,750  -->  00:03:59,260
Sure will.

68

00:03:59,280  -->  00:04:02,320
We'll get the ID from the comment.

69

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:03,070
What else will we.

70

00:04:03,090  -->  00:04:08,430
We want to see about it come and what we want to see who wrote that comment.

71

00:04:09,000  -->  00:04:10,220
What else.

72

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:12,210
Their e-mail address will be nice

73

00:04:16,170  -->  00:04:18,240
and calm.

74

00:04:18,780  -->  00:04:19,910
Maybe a data comment.

75

00:04:19,930  -->  00:04:24,520
But let's just do the common body here.

76

00:04:24,540  -->  00:04:25,620
All right.

77

00:04:25,980  -->  00:04:32,400
So in terms of bodies it can be really long so you guys can either create a show or view for that for

78

00:04:32,400  -->  00:04:37,180
the for the comment just to see that individual comments so you can edit the whatever you want.

79

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:44,050
But I'm just going to show you here because oh let's change this thing here.

80

00:04:44,700  -->  00:04:50,470
I'm going to show it here because this is mostly the supplication is moreover demonstration application

81

00:04:50,480  -->  00:04:55,670
than actually something that that we are going to be.

82

00:04:55,830  -->  00:05:00,960
Actually it is an application that you can take to the web and then we are going to do that at the end

83

00:05:00,950  -->  00:05:06,260
of the course of course and then some of you are probably already doing that.

84

00:05:06,990  -->  00:05:13,020
But some of the things that I do I do here in this course is to show you to reinforce the knowledge

85

00:05:13,020  -->  00:05:15,330
that we got in the beginning of the course.

86

00:05:15,330  -->  00:05:15,840
OK.

87

00:05:15,930  -->  00:05:21,420
So some of that some sometimes I do things the hard way and the long wait for you guys to think and

88

00:05:21,420  -->  00:05:22,600
do it a short way.

89

00:05:22,620  -->  00:05:23,860
And the more creative way.

90

00:05:23,910  -->  00:05:24,590
OK.

91

00:05:24,900  -->  00:05:25,420
All right.

92

00:05:25,530  -->  00:05:28,360
So we are actually showing really good information here.

93

00:05:28,360  -->  00:05:31,590
Let's face the table headings here.

94

00:05:31,910  -->  00:05:39,450
So let's turn the e-mails the next one and the body here

95

00:05:39,450  -->  00:05:46,740
.

96

00:05:47,310  -->  00:05:50,220
You know what it will be nice to see the post right.

97

00:05:50,640  -->  00:05:51,450
That will be nice.

98

00:05:51,450  -->  00:05:53,430
Let's put it right here somewhere.

99

00:05:54,210  -->  00:06:02,500
Maybe we can convert this to the post so we can a comment.

100

00:06:03,020  -->  00:06:06,540
Those ID actually.

101

00:06:06,570  -->  00:06:12,980
Let's let's do this let's create a link here.

102

00:06:13,710  -->  00:06:16,920
And this route

103

00:06:21,330  -->  00:06:22,270
I think we gave them.

104

00:06:22,350  -->  00:06:23,750
And the polls stay home.

105

00:06:23,750  -->  00:06:32,050
The polls are out and then we just take the polls I.D. their common polls I.D. and we can say View polls

106

00:06:32,470  -->  00:06:33,260
.

107

00:06:34,120  -->  00:06:36,210
That's that's going to take us right to the polls.

108

00:06:36,230  -->  00:06:37,100
Whoops.

109

00:06:37,110  -->  00:06:41,150
If we can get it without syntax error that would be nice.

110

00:06:41,390  -->  00:06:45,810
And oops what did I do here.

111

00:06:46,500  -->  00:06:51,310
That looks terrible.

112

00:06:53,280  -->  00:06:56,420
Really bad.

113

00:06:56,730  -->  00:06:58,480
Trying to get a property in.

114

00:06:58,570  -->  00:06:59,280
OK.

115

00:06:59,460  -->  00:07:03,590
Let's go to comment and make sure that that comment has a post.

116

00:07:03,600  -->  00:07:03,840
All right.

117

00:07:03,840  -->  00:07:04,350
Public

118

00:07:06,840  -->  00:07:08,060
Function.

119

00:07:08,070  -->  00:07:08,700
Post

120

00:07:11,750  -->  00:07:14,170
return.

121

00:07:14,470  -->  00:07:20,560
This belongs to a pause.

122

00:07:20,590  -->  00:07:23,460
Don't we already have this function somewhere.

123

00:07:23,620  -->  00:07:26,080
Nobody nada.

124

00:07:26,520  -->  00:07:27,830
OK.

125

00:07:28,800  -->  00:07:29,750
There we go.

126

00:07:29,940  -->  00:07:32,960
Your post goes straight to the post.

127

00:07:32,970  -->  00:07:35,630
Pretty cool stuff right.

128

00:07:37,440  -->  00:07:38,220
All right.

129

00:07:38,220  -->  00:07:43,620
What else can we do there let's go back.

130

00:07:43,620  -->  00:07:43,970
All right.

131

00:07:43,980  -->  00:07:46,620
We can also count.

132

00:07:46,770  -->  00:07:49,760
We can also see the replies there but we're going to do that later.

133

00:07:49,760  -->  00:07:50,370
We can.

134

00:07:50,370  -->  00:07:53,230
We're going to set up the replies later.

135

00:07:53,250  -->  00:07:59,780
Right now we have it will be nice to wear like a little delete functionality to the lead and approve

136

00:07:59,790  -->  00:08:01,890
the post.

137

00:08:03,180  -->  00:08:05,470
Whoops.

138

00:08:06,990  -->  00:08:11,780
So maybe a delete button right here an approved one.

139

00:08:11,970  -->  00:08:16,590
So I will one click and we can pull the polls because right now these polls most of them are going to

140

00:08:16,590  -->  00:08:20,490
be by default and they're all going to be on approve.

141

00:08:20,490  -->  00:08:22,470
We have to come here and approve them.

142

00:08:22,500  -->  00:08:28,020
So why don't we do that on the next lecture create like functionality where we are proof the post and

143

00:08:28,020  -->  00:08:28,730
delete it.

144

00:08:28,740  -->  00:08:29,220
All right.

145

00:08:29,280  -->  00:08:30,900
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

146

00:08:30,900  -->  00:08:32,950
Take care.
