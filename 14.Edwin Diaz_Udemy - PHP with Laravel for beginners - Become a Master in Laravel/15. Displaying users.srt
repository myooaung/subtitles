1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:07,110
All right welcome back my ideas stood and so we got our admin working right we got this admin adding

2

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:12,000
here just to let us know that we are actually receiving this view properly.

3

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:12,780
All right cool.

4

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:19,730
So what we're going to be doing now is creating demat or mark up for the rest of the views.

5

00:00:19,740  -->  00:00:23,020
So for the create for the editing or for users.

6

00:00:23,240  -->  00:00:27,720
All right well we want to do is not hearing Adam and we're going to know we're not going to work on

7

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:29,110
dashboard right now.

8

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:36,420
We're going to leave this dash for maybe for last for the for laughs for the for the course because

9

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:46,560
we can incorporate a lot of features here later on maybe some you know users settings or post settings

10

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:49,040
or category settings or something like that later on.

11

00:00:49,050  -->  00:00:52,780
Right now what we want to worry about is users.

12

00:00:52,800  -->  00:00:59,650
So that way we can create users we can edit users of the users polls and categories and all that right

13

00:00:59,700  -->  00:00:59,780
.

14

00:00:59,790  -->  00:01:01,820
So let's get to it right now.

15

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:02,780
All right.

16

00:01:02,790  -->  00:01:06,520
So let's open up your editor open up the project and let's get it going.

17

00:01:06,520  -->  00:01:07,440
All right.

18

00:01:07,500  -->  00:01:08,010
All right.

19

00:01:08,200  -->  00:01:12,390
So let's go to resources real quick.

20

00:01:12,390  -->  00:01:16,530
Resources admin users.

21

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:16,890
All right.

22

00:01:16,920  -->  00:01:20,520
So we've got to worry about this guy right here.

23

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:21,660
All right.

24

00:01:21,930  -->  00:01:27,150
This is where we are going to be showing our users so we already have the resource for that right.

25

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:30,470
We have our methods our control is set up for that.

26

00:01:30,510  -->  00:01:36,220
So if we go to your app it's the ATP controllers we've done.

27

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:40,060
We don't actually have the users control it do we actually we do right here.

28

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:42,270
I mean users control is all we have that.

29

00:01:42,850  -->  00:01:45,490
Ok cool.

30

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:47,400
So now if I go to admin users

31

00:01:51,190  -->  00:01:52,770
OK we have a blank page.

32

00:01:52,830  -->  00:01:54,270
We have to set that up.

33

00:01:54,300  -->  00:01:55,100
All right.

34

00:01:55,440  -->  00:02:01,830
Let's go to our admin.

35

00:02:01,860  -->  00:02:03,470
Actually we can do this by hand guys.

36

00:02:03,480  -->  00:02:05,660
I'll show you how easy it is let's just do it.

37

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:06,630
We're not going to copy and paste.

38

00:02:06,630  -->  00:02:07,610
Let's just do it like this.

39

00:02:07,620  -->  00:02:10,070
OK let's do it stands here.

40

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:15,700
And we're going to stand the layouts folder is going to be the admin file.

41

00:02:15,970  -->  00:02:18,420
And then here we're going to your Say section.

42

00:02:18,630  -->  00:02:25,770
It's going to be content and stop or you can put an section.

43

00:02:25,770  -->  00:02:27,350
All right cool.

44

00:02:27,970  -->  00:02:31,680
And here we're going to see users.

45

00:02:32,760  -->  00:02:35,010
Let's go now and see what we have.

46

00:02:35,370  -->  00:02:36,800
Whoops.

47

00:02:36,870  -->  00:02:40,650
Make sure if you bring another tour guys make sure you save your documents.

48

00:02:40,650  -->  00:02:41,660
There we go.

49

00:02:41,670  -->  00:02:43,040
All right cool.

50

00:02:43,260  -->  00:02:48,160
So now what I want to do is actually get something going here I want to see something happen.

51

00:02:48,420  -->  00:02:53,980
So if one of these early users we got to actually bring the data.

52

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:54,750
All right.

53

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:57,880
First I want to create some type of table here.

54

00:02:57,990  -->  00:03:04,100
Let's see if I can see right now if I type table and tab.

55

00:03:04,940  -->  00:03:11,530
I don't get much right I just get an hour and a beginning and ending tag for table.

56

00:03:11,550  -->  00:03:12,650
That's not good.

57

00:03:12,660  -->  00:03:16,010
What I want to do is every time I type table I want a whole table layout.

58

00:03:16,020  -->  00:03:24,840
So for that let's go online real quick and let's just say bootstrap table.

59

00:03:25,980  -->  00:03:32,370
And I think these people here are W3 school has a nice table that we can just copy but we're not going

60

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:34,400
to just copy it we're going to make a Templi out of it.

61

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:37,540
So let's see this tape was fine.

62

00:03:38,280  -->  00:03:39,110
All right.

63

00:03:39,410  -->  00:03:40,360
OK.

64

00:03:40,800  -->  00:03:41,340
So

65

00:03:44,190  -->  00:03:46,590
all I can do here.

66

00:03:46,590  -->  00:03:46,800
All right.

67

00:03:46,800  -->  00:03:50,840
So let's go over with them here from the table.

68

00:03:50,880  -->  00:03:52,790
Copy it.

69

00:03:53,250  -->  00:03:55,320
Come back here.

70

00:03:55,320  -->  00:03:57,850
We're going to paste it in here.

71

00:03:57,990  -->  00:03:59,120
All right.

72

00:03:59,850  -->  00:04:06,250
As a matter of fact let's go to a file BHB storing preferences or settings depending on what OS you

73

00:04:06,250  -->  00:04:06,990
are using.

74

00:04:07,100  -->  00:04:16,570
It's typing here live templates and we all go to user and listservs add another live template here I'm

75

00:04:16,570  -->  00:04:19,500
going to pass all that coding here.

76

00:04:19,570  -->  00:04:20,440
All right.

77

00:04:20,790  -->  00:04:28,880
I'd like to have my tags a little bit more to the to the war.

78

00:04:29,420  -->  00:04:34,670
There we go a little bit guys.

79

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:35,930
There we go.

80

00:04:36,460  -->  00:04:44,360
And that is going to be table an array bootstrap table.

81

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:46,290
OK.

82

00:04:46,980  -->  00:04:55,850
And the fine the amount and BHB.

83

00:04:56,820  -->  00:05:00,230
All right cool.

84

00:05:00,750  -->  00:05:01,180
Fine

85

00:05:06,690  -->  00:05:08,120
no.

86

00:05:09,260  -->  00:05:11,100
OK.

87

00:05:12,180  -->  00:05:17,250
All right plie Let's check it out real quick table.

88

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:17,780
There we go.

89

00:05:17,790  -->  00:05:18,680
Now we have a table.

90

00:05:18,750  -->  00:05:20,110
Really cool stuff right.

91

00:05:20,120  -->  00:05:21,340
So now we go back.

92

00:05:21,340  -->  00:05:23,490
We should have a really cool table that we can always

93

00:05:27,190  -->  00:05:28,210
see.

94

00:05:28,800  -->  00:05:29,580
All right.

95

00:05:29,570  -->  00:05:33,660
So this is what we're going to have our users display when have their ID their name whatever information

96

00:05:33,660  -->  00:05:36,060
we have from the user right.

97

00:05:36,540  -->  00:05:39,120
So let's go back to our controllers.

98

00:05:39,180  -->  00:05:41,800
Let's go to in there real quick and Ryabkov.

99

00:05:41,800  -->  00:05:48,920
Here we're going to say when I say everything on a variable and we're going to use model here use or

100

00:05:48,940  -->  00:05:52,040
find or fail.

101

00:05:53,490  -->  00:06:02,450
And as a matter of fact the way we're going to do this is like this we go can actually display that

102

00:06:03,320  -->  00:06:07,840
off and I actually want to display all users actually.

103

00:06:08,220  -->  00:06:11,970
And what I was going to do is we were going to only display the users I would log then but we're going

104

00:06:11,970  -->  00:06:17,620
to do that for other roles out there for subscribers or other one of these play them.

105

00:06:17,670  -->  00:06:23,630
All right but we're not going to deal with users when we are doing with when we are using another role

106

00:06:23,620  -->  00:06:29,990
like Alter for for Polsce we're going to actually you know display the polls for the use of those logged

107

00:06:30,000  -->  00:06:31,090
in for all their roles.

108

00:06:31,110  -->  00:06:34,580
But for this admin here we're going to display all users.

109

00:06:34,590  -->  00:06:35,620
So user.

110

00:06:35,810  -->  00:06:46,040
And when you're going to say all OK and let's include that clouds on top make sure that you import it

111

00:06:46,440  -->  00:06:47,790
with its name space.

112

00:06:48,140  -->  00:06:54,090
And here we're going to use a little function I showed you about earlier a long time ago a lot of lectures

113

00:06:54,090  -->  00:06:58,010
ago called Compact.

114

00:06:58,010  -->  00:07:02,760
Now let's go back to indebt and we're going to start displaying this stuff here.

115

00:07:02,750  -->  00:07:03,260
So

116

00:07:06,570  -->  00:07:10,640
I'm going to use this as an ID.

117

00:07:10,920  -->  00:07:14,800
This would be the name the email.

118

00:07:14,810  -->  00:07:19,800
And what I also want to show that's about it for now.

119

00:07:19,800  -->  00:07:20,750
All right.

120

00:07:20,750  -->  00:07:22,280
I'm going to take all this out

121

00:07:22,280  -->  00:07:28,130
.

122

00:07:28,130  -->  00:07:28,920
I'm going to wrap.

123

00:07:28,940  -->  00:07:33,050
I'm going to actually do a statement here just to make sure that we have users right.

124

00:07:33,600  -->  00:07:39,350
So if users then I want to actually execute this code right here.

125

00:07:39,750  -->  00:07:43,400
So let's just say and if we're to end the if statement.

126

00:07:44,310  -->  00:07:46,080
OK.

127

00:07:46,130  -->  00:07:55,860
And now we're going to do a for each year to loop through that and take the object out of there.

128

00:07:56,100  -->  00:07:59,220
Let's end it for each right here.

129

00:08:00,720  -->  00:08:05,820
Ok cool.

130

00:08:05,810  -->  00:08:06,320
All right.

131

00:08:06,360  -->  00:08:12,920
So now here this is the idea of the users are we going to use Belaid and we're going to say user ID

132

00:08:12,930  -->  00:08:14,040
.

133

00:08:14,970  -->  00:08:16,040
The next step is

134

00:08:18,810  -->  00:08:19,040
a

135

00:08:21,990  -->  00:08:23,310
user name

136

00:08:30,620  -->  00:08:34,710
.

137

00:08:35,000  -->  00:08:35,380
Right

138

00:08:35,410  -->  00:08:42,700
.

139

00:08:42,990  -->  00:08:44,100
User email.

140

00:08:44,530  -->  00:08:46,440
And let's see how it looks.

141

00:08:46,530  -->  00:08:52,740
Let's see if we get anything.

142

00:08:52,750  -->  00:08:54,590
All right.

143

00:08:54,650  -->  00:08:55,320
Answer.

144

00:08:55,560  -->  00:09:01,160
And as you can see we got the idea of the user which is Coralee one the name and the e-mail address

145

00:09:01,160  -->  00:09:01,520
.

146

00:09:01,520  -->  00:09:02,250
All right cool.

147

00:09:02,370  -->  00:09:05,550
You know what it would be nice to together created the soil.

148

00:09:05,550  -->  00:09:11,100
So let's just do that here.

149

00:09:14,100  -->  00:09:19,120
And I don't know why I get my indentation all messed up here.

150

00:09:19,190  -->  00:09:30,690
Some reason create it and update it will do that too as well.

151

00:09:30,750  -->  00:09:32,300
All right cool.

152

00:09:32,370  -->  00:09:40,480
So you see that every time I do mind intention it's messing up a little bit.

153

00:09:40,800  -->  00:09:42,460
I got to fix that.

154

00:09:42,540  -->  00:09:43,290
I think I know why.

155

00:09:43,320  -->  00:09:46,480
But anyway let's create it at

156

00:09:51,000  -->  00:09:52,230
and let's do

157

00:09:55,110  -->  00:09:57,000
it.

158

00:09:57,910  -->  00:10:01,500
All right.

159

00:10:04,740  -->  00:10:12,960
I've got to fix my shortcuts in this copy of sublime sublime BHB storm enter.

160

00:10:12,990  -->  00:10:14,700
All right cool.

161

00:10:14,690  -->  00:10:15,230
All right.

162

00:10:15,260  -->  00:10:18,420
And this is just a an example guys lead on.

163

00:10:18,480  -->  00:10:20,590
As a matter of fact let's do it right now.

164

00:10:20,630  -->  00:10:30,350
We can use methods on the time stamps right with carbon carvings are including Lavell Mbai defaults

165

00:10:30,750  -->  00:10:31,350
and I'll show you.

166

00:10:31,350  -->  00:10:35,590
I showed you that already a lot of lectures ago where we were.

167

00:10:35,610  -->  00:10:42,580
Time stamps are a can be can be used as instances of carbon where we actually use or met carbons methods

168

00:10:42,620  -->  00:10:43,920
to do other things with it.

169

00:10:43,910  -->  00:10:44,560
Right.

170

00:10:44,580  -->  00:10:54,190
So for create it we can say we can use a method called Let's do this for humans.

171

00:10:54,570  -->  00:10:55,900
Hopefully I'm spending it right.

172

00:10:55,900  -->  00:10:58,030
I'm not though.

173

00:10:58,700  -->  00:11:01,830
Whoops.

174

00:11:01,860  -->  00:11:07,430
For humans to underscore this is correct here.

175

00:11:07,430  -->  00:11:10,470
All right let's do this one too.

176

00:11:11,860  -->  00:11:17,730
Now if I go back there and I refresh we can see that this was created 15 hours ago.

177

00:11:17,750  -->  00:11:18,650
Cool right.

178

00:11:18,890  -->  00:11:23,190
Instead of having that day there we just say how long has a has been created.

179

00:11:23,490  -->  00:11:25,250
I think this is pretty cool.

180

00:11:25,250  -->  00:11:25,800
All right.

181

00:11:25,830  -->  00:11:30,470
So I think we are done with this plan they use her for now and we're going to continue with his lectures

182

00:11:30,570  -->  00:11:34,580
in the next one with this subject.

183

00:11:34,590  -->  00:11:35,460
Take care.
