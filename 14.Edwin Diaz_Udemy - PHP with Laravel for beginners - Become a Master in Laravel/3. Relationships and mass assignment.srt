1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,780
All right.

2

00:00:00,780  -->  00:00:01,950
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:01,950  -->  00:00:03,630
I hope you're really motivated.

4

00:00:03,630  -->  00:00:05,070
We are learning a lot of good stuff.

5

00:00:05,080  -->  00:00:06,630
We'll are we going to keep learning more.

6

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:07,470
All right cool.

7

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:10,550
So we are creator our mark migrations.

8

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:15,150
It's time for us to start setting up the relationship and doing the math assignments set up as well

9

00:00:15,160  -->  00:00:15,190
.

10

00:00:15,210  -->  00:00:18,340
So let's open up BHB storm.

11

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:22,920
And if I can make this a little bigger that would be nice.

12

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:24,080
There we go.

13

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:31,260
I don't know how he was I guess I had a small monitor attached to my computer anyway so let's go and

14

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:32,770
set up our relationship.

15

00:00:32,770  -->  00:00:33,200
All right.

16

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:40,060
And let me see something real quick to our relationship.

17

00:00:40,080  -->  00:00:41,210
It's

18

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:45,760
true.

19

00:00:46,820  -->  00:00:51,570
All right.

20

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:55,510
Cool.

21

00:00:55,540  -->  00:00:59,370
So now in the User we got to go back to the user.

22

00:00:59,400  -->  00:01:00,060
OK.

23

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:09,130
And we have to say Pawlick function roles.

24

00:01:09,350  -->  00:01:12,740
All right.

25

00:01:15,660  -->  00:01:16,410
Beautiful.

26

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:21,230
So here what we got to do is say return this.

27

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:24,840
We launched too many.

28

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:27,320
OK.

29

00:01:27,960  -->  00:01:31,770
Rules now rules roll.

30

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:34,530
There we go.

31

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:35,940
All righty.

32

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:37,520
So this is good.

33

00:01:37,520  -->  00:01:39,780
We've got users all set up now.

34

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:45,440
Let's make sure we have Master Simon on our role here Mario.

35

00:01:45,630  -->  00:01:50,780
So let's say protect the and let me see if I remember fillable.

36

00:01:51,270  -->  00:02:01,440
And the only thing that we're going to be editing here is and name call is set up already.

37

00:02:01,440  -->  00:02:02,820
All right.

38

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:09,300
Remember that if you want to do the opposite and get the user out of roles you set up that relationship

39

00:02:09,300  -->  00:02:13,880
right here and you can do all the stuff there as well with without relationship.

40

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:15,580
We might touch on that later.

41

00:02:15,720  -->  00:02:21,550
But anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
