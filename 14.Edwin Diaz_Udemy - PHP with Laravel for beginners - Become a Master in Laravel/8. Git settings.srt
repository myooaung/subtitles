1

00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:01,960
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:09,660
Before we start pushing projects into the hub and in doing more things we get less actually set up our

3

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:10,920
good settings.

4

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:11,430
All right.

5

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:17,670
Let's set that up so that way when we are sharing stuff with people somewhere else they can know who

6

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:19,230
the comments belong to.

7

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:20,000
All right.

8

00:00:20,080  -->  00:00:22,820
So let's do it like this.

9

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:28,060
If you notice when I do get a comment oh good lord.

10

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:29,280
Well we don't have anything here.

11

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:31,000
Let's go to the learning.

12

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:31,850
Good.

13

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:38,240
And if I do get a log we have a couple of committee but he says the name.

14

00:00:38,250  -->  00:00:42,840
My name is Gordon faculty and this is my e-mail.

15

00:00:42,870  -->  00:00:43,560
All right.

16

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:46,130
As you can see right here according to faculty other works.

17

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:48,880
Boy that's what he's saying that my e-mail is.

18

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,700
So I want to set that up.

19

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:51,930
So he says something else.

20

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:52,390
Right.

21

00:00:52,530  -->  00:00:54,870
So I got to say good.

22

00:00:55,200  -->  00:00:59,600
Actually called config global.

23

00:00:59,970  -->  00:01:03,690
And you can do this from any file as long as you have good initialized All right.

24

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:08,630
And I got to say that my username is doing.

25

00:01:09,090  -->  00:01:10,600
But I've got to put quotes around here.

26

00:01:10,620  -->  00:01:14,160
So I'm going to see it when I just go live like this one.

27

00:01:14,610  -->  00:01:15,980
Enter now.

28

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:27,670
I also want to change my email address to say something like and when at courting faculty.

29

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:29,600
All right.

30

00:01:31,500  -->  00:01:34,170
Now for the good log.

31

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:34,930
All right.

32

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:38,490
Well I still have that there because I made those comments with that.

33

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:53,470
But if I make a new comment and I say new when you file that age the amount and I do get ad good command

34

00:01:56,660  -->  00:02:00,480
file if I do get blog.

35

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:07,590
You can see that I knew comment was created by Edwin That's the author and he has my new e-mail address

36

00:02:07,590  -->  00:02:07,770
.

37

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:08,330
All right.

38

00:02:08,370  -->  00:02:14,100
So I want you to do the settings before we start pushing projects into get help or I push and file.

39

00:02:14,100  -->  00:02:17,040
So that way when you are sharing there people know who you are.

40

00:02:17,190  -->  00:02:18,600
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

41

00:02:18,600  -->  00:02:20,160
I'll see you in the next lecture OK.

42

00:02:20,160  -->  00:02:21,240
Take care.

43

00:02:21,240  -->  00:02:22,530
Bye bye.
