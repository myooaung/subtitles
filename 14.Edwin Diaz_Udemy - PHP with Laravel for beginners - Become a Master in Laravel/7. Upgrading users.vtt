00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.690
All right.

2

00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:07.550
Welcome back my students so the last lecture we saw that we have a little problem here right we have

3

00:00:07.600  -->  00:00:11.880
this method is causing a problem.

4

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:12.960
All right cool.

5

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:14.470
Let's face it.

6

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:16.890
I have an idea what it is.

7

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:22.240
So let's go here guys I'm doing some of this stuff I'm actually doing a improvising in.

8

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:26.420
I'm not I haven't really got really into it.

9

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:26.800
All right.

10

00:00:26.800  -->  00:00:27.900
This is Schuss.

11

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:34.260
I decided to walk great this course and I'm doing it and I want to show you what it is to make a mistake

12

00:00:34.540  -->  00:00:35.690
in how to fix it.

13

00:00:35.690  -->  00:00:35.940
All right.

14

00:00:35.940  -->  00:00:38.350
So in the future that might help you a lot more.

15

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:41.330
And those of you that are my students you know how I do things.

16

00:00:41.330  -->  00:00:41.700
Right.

17

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:45.770
So you know that I like to do with making mistakes and then fixing them.

18

00:00:45.840  -->  00:00:47.640
All right just to give you that knowledge too.

19

00:00:47.870  -->  00:00:48.680
All right.

20

00:00:49.110  -->  00:00:49.680
All right.

21

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:54.780
So let me just take this Logan controllers and registering all of our controllers out of here let's

22

00:00:54.780  -->  00:00:56.600
clean this up a little bit.

23

00:00:57.360  -->  00:00:58.870
All right.

24

00:00:59.070  -->  00:01:01.010
Don't delete that route's file yet.

25

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:02.550
All right.

26

00:01:02.670  -->  00:01:09.730
All right so we get in these areas for from the controller because this has been deprecated.

27

00:01:09.750  -->  00:01:17.400
All right and it's going to be a long time ago but we still use Day and we're going to be using something

28

00:01:17.400  -->  00:01:22.710
a little bit more and more newer than that newer than that so let's go to

29

00:01:25.560  -->  00:01:34.230
HDTV controllers and let's go to AOD man uses controller.

30

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:35.490
OK.

31

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:39.540
All right so you see we're using less right here and you can do a little search in your file command

32

00:01:39.620  -->  00:01:40.520
for control.

33

00:01:40.590  -->  00:01:47.040
Any editor will find it and you can just find this and OK this fits.

34

00:01:47.070  -->  00:01:53.330
I think this function pluck or mentor could do it.

35

00:01:53.410  -->  00:01:55.380
All right let's check it out.

36

00:01:55.430  -->  00:01:58.720
It is for this door not always for the Create.

37

00:01:58.990  -->  00:02:04.500
Let's do the and it.

38

00:02:04.650  -->  00:02:05.690
Let's see it.

39

00:02:05.720  -->  00:02:07.050
There we go.

40

00:02:07.530  -->  00:02:08.790
Because that's the one that we need.

41

00:02:08.790  -->  00:02:10.600
Pluck pluck should do it.

42

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:15.410
Let's pluck the name ID out of there and let's bring it down.

43

00:02:15.420  -->  00:02:17.100
All right that's what he's saying there.

44

00:02:17.280  -->  00:02:18.390
That's refreshing.

45

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:19.640
And why law.

46

00:02:19.980  -->  00:02:21.620
All right.

47

00:02:21.660  -->  00:02:23.570
Nice job.

48

00:02:23.940  -->  00:02:25.320
Really nice job.

49

00:02:25.320  -->  00:02:27.690
I'm proud of you create.

50

00:02:27.840  -->  00:02:30.150
Here we go.

51

00:02:30.480  -->  00:02:33.470
So can we all day the user Let's find out.

52

00:02:34.380  -->  00:02:34.640
All right.

53

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:38.380
Hopefully we don't get some type of errors on thing.

54

00:02:38.670  -->  00:02:42.900
Do we have a RICO Swaby here like we have another lecture's we don't.

55

00:02:42.900  -->  00:02:45.410
Actually we do write here but that's just me.

56

00:02:45.420  -->  00:02:47.590
Probably creating that before.

57

00:02:47.790  -->  00:02:51.600
Let's give them a image.

58

00:02:51.630  -->  00:02:56.970
Let's just say Rico sort of looks like this guy update.

59

00:02:56.970  -->  00:02:58.590
There we go.

60

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:00.460
So he's working.

61

00:03:00.630  -->  00:03:02.700
All right.

62

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:04.390
All right.

63

00:03:05.340  -->  00:03:07.730
Let's go back here.

64

00:03:07.740  -->  00:03:09.830
Let's try to create a user real quick.

65

00:03:09.930  -->  00:03:12.760
Let's create Do we have a Maria here.

66

00:03:12.870  -->  00:03:14.330
Maria is always in the lectures too.

67

00:03:14.350  -->  00:03:16.320
Yeah she's there.

68

00:03:16.320  -->  00:03:23.950
Let's just create a another one this create a giant super famous.

All right.

70

00:03:24.730  -->  00:03:29.970
John works at coding faculty with us.

71

00:03:30.000  -->  00:03:30.740
All right.

72

00:03:31.020  -->  00:03:32.850
Courtney is going to be huge in the future.

73

00:03:32.850  -->  00:03:35.580
Guys you want to be part of it let me know.

74

00:03:36.210  -->  00:03:38.150

78

00:03:50.620  -->  00:03:52.180

And so we've got our users working on your percentage looks like nothing is wrong with it.

89

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:28.560
And let's jump in to the poll section here to see what areas do we get.

90

00:04:28.560  -->  00:04:33.930
If you want to go ahead and do it yourself and try to fix it because it's basically it's always going

91

00:04:33.930  -->  00:04:35.540
to be the same thing.

92

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:36.360
All right.

93

00:04:36.930  -->  00:04:38.340
Go ahead and do it.
