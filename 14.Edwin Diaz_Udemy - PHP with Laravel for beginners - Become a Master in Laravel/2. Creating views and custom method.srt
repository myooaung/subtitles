1

00:00:01,680  -->  00:00:03,590
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:08,060
So in this lecture we are going to be taking a look at views.

3

00:00:08,060  -->  00:00:08,640
All right.

4

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:16,710
I'm going to be leaving the last one which is you know for these main subjects these main things which

5

00:00:16,710  -->  00:00:22,590
is NBC right model view and controller I want to leave the last one the best one for last which is the

6

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:25,660
model I think is one of the best things to talk about.

7

00:00:25,830  -->  00:00:28,950
We're going to be dealing with models a lot when we're building applications.

8

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:32,450
But anyway I hope you're really excited because we to learn about views right.

9

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:33,480
Yay.

10

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:41,130
Anyway let's go ahead and learned about views so we our viewers located views are located in resources

11

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:45,920
right here in the same level as app resources views.

12

00:00:45,960  -->  00:00:49,710
And this is where our views are right now.

13

00:00:49,830  -->  00:00:54,140
Let's use this resource that we got here.

14

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:58,050
It's controller post controller tool displacement views.

15

00:00:58,290  -->  00:01:06,150
So let's go to HDTV controllers both controllers click on it and if you are using BHB storm you can

16

00:01:06,150  -->  00:01:10,750
double click on your shift key and you can search files like this.

17

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:20,680
Just type in the name of your class and you are their boss controller and you're like that.

18

00:01:20,680  -->  00:01:21,500
All right.

19

00:01:21,930  -->  00:01:28,470
And if you have Windows you can go ahead and look for a shortcut key which I don't remember at this

20

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:34,440
point I think is the same thing but sometimes it doesn't work on my Windows computer so make sure that

21

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:35,280
you look for that.

22

00:01:35,280  -->  00:01:40,800
If not you can set it up with the HP store and whatever key you want things to happen.

23

00:01:40,810  -->  00:01:41,300
All right.

24

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:45,470
Just go to your settings or preferences and you can play around with it.

25

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:46,240
All right.

26

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:54,150
Anyway so another thing that we got to do is let's say for example we're going to be showing something

27

00:01:54,150  -->  00:01:58,820
so let's me see is that the best one.

28

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:01,640
As a matter of fact let's create a custom one.

29

00:02:01,650  -->  00:02:02,310
How about that.

30

00:02:02,310  -->  00:02:03,220
You want to do that.

31

00:02:03,390  -->  00:02:04,450
Let's do that.

32

00:02:04,470  -->  00:02:08,030
Super easy to create a custom controller method for a controller.

33

00:02:08,040  -->  00:02:13,320
So public and I want to show you as much as I can on this lecture.

34

00:02:13,330  -->  00:02:17,810
So you're going to see me doing things that are not uniform with other things.

35

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:22,200
Just I don't know where I come up and I'll show you how to do something custom All right.

36

00:02:22,440  -->  00:02:40,790
So function function and show you look at my convention right show flashes from this show my view.

37

00:02:44,200  -->  00:02:45,230
All right.

38

00:02:45,390  -->  00:02:46,380
Like this.

39

00:02:46,380  -->  00:02:49,860
You can do that as well.

40

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:54,770
You can follow this one as well.

41

00:02:54,850  -->  00:03:00,220
Sure my view even though I like this one show you.

42

00:03:01,740  -->  00:03:02,250
All right.

43

00:03:02,250  -->  00:03:11,420
So now we're going to be returning you so we're going to use a view meant for that view function while

44

00:03:11,500  -->  00:03:11,980
you do.

45

00:03:11,980  -->  00:03:13,830
Are we going to we're going to return.

46

00:03:13,830  -->  00:03:15,970
Well we're going to make one right.

47

00:03:16,950  -->  00:03:23,400
So let's actually create a view something that makes sense right guys.

48

00:03:23,400  -->  00:03:24,300
Contact page.

49

00:03:24,300  -->  00:03:24,850
All right.

50

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:30,530
And then we're going to return a contact view that makes sense or I was just making things up there

51

00:03:30,540  -->  00:03:32,250
it didn't look very nice.

52

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:35,940
So let's go to our resources and their views.

53

00:03:35,940  -->  00:03:41,280
For that I'm going to right click on it and then go into create a BHB file.

54

00:03:41,900  -->  00:03:51,060
I'm going to call this contact dot blade dot THP am going to show you in a minute why we're doing this

55

00:03:51,060  -->  00:03:51,080
.

56

00:03:51,090  -->  00:03:55,790
But they just follow me right now and they will explain that later OK.

57

00:03:56,100  -->  00:03:59,140
Enter All right.

58

00:03:59,160  -->  00:04:05,220
Now this that blaze because we are using as you can see the welcome that Bley that BHB here this is

59

00:04:05,400  -->  00:04:08,240
the full file for our work on Page.

60

00:04:08,240  -->  00:04:10,710
A lot of fine welcome page.

61

00:04:10,710  -->  00:04:18,230
The reason why we using these dot blades because HP uses a templating engine a feature a special programming

62

00:04:18,250  -->  00:04:24,030
psi Lauber uses that too.

63

00:04:24,040  -->  00:04:30,900
Now BHB Larabee uses that to to do things easier with BHB and you'll see in a minute how we can use

64

00:04:30,900  -->  00:04:42,510
blade to instead of writing for example BHB ekal like dis equil there's no way we can eliminate all

65

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:53,130
this and and do this for the curly brackets like this and write whatever we want in there to echo for

66

00:04:53,130  -->  00:04:57,410
example a variable like this.

67

00:04:57,420  -->  00:04:57,810
All right.

68

00:04:57,810  -->  00:05:03,850
So that eliminates a lot of PH BE CALLED IN OUR templates in our HD.

69

00:05:04,060  -->  00:05:05,700
All right.

70

00:05:05,700  -->  00:05:14,550
Anyway so we've got the contact page creator created there and we can use this sample the mail and welcome

71

00:05:15,170  -->  00:05:23,120
and just going to copy this to contact entery there.

72

00:05:23,130  -->  00:05:25,130
All right.

73

00:05:25,170  -->  00:05:26,390
Take all this time Laurie.

74

00:05:26,400  -->  00:05:29,670
You don't need that.

75

00:05:30,330  -->  00:05:31,660
I don't have no styles.

76

00:05:31,660  -->  00:05:37,670
Now a my applicant with your application yet because we have installed will strike and assure you in

77

00:05:37,660  -->  00:05:45,240
a minute how to do that but right now I think we could put it from the Internet.

78

00:05:45,240  -->  00:05:47,390
We wanted to but I'm not going to do that.

79

00:05:47,850  -->  00:05:53,150
Let's see something real quick.

80

00:05:53,240  -->  00:05:59,180
This is all right.

81

00:05:59,180  -->  00:06:01,900
So I'm just going to put H-1 here.

82

00:06:01,920  -->  00:06:08,400
Hello contact page actually contact page.

83

00:06:08,400  -->  00:06:09,660
There we go.

84

00:06:10,530  -->  00:06:17,490
So let's go to our controller right here and we should be seen this.

85

00:06:17,520  -->  00:06:20,710
Let's make sure our route is good.

86

00:06:20,850  -->  00:06:26,510
We don't have a route for that so let's create a route.

87

00:06:26,610  -->  00:06:32,430
So we're going to say route get in parentheses.

88

00:06:32,430  -->  00:06:38,960
That's a static method remember when we type in contact.

89

00:06:39,540  -->  00:06:42,810
I want you to go to the pulse controller

90

00:06:46,230  -->  00:06:50,390
to the Met the contact.

91

00:06:50,390  -->  00:06:51,360
All right.

92

00:06:51,870  -->  00:06:53,210
So that's all he's saying.

93

00:06:53,250  -->  00:06:59,300
So make sure you have your routes good your method defined.

94

00:06:59,330  -->  00:06:59,810
All right.

95

00:06:59,820  -->  00:07:03,020
And of course your view and the views for her.

96

00:07:03,180  -->  00:07:12,390
Now this function impulse control of view will look for a file name contact inside the views folder

97

00:07:12,390  -->  00:07:12,990
.

98

00:07:12,990  -->  00:07:20,200
But if you had if you had another folder let's say for example and for the call names let's just create

99

00:07:20,290  -->  00:07:20,430
.

100

00:07:20,550  -->  00:07:22,510
Just say BHB file.

101

00:07:22,890  -->  00:07:30,080
And I said for names of all pages and I have a contact page in there click enter.

102

00:07:30,240  -->  00:07:36,890
You can see that I just create a directory or for the call pages and inside there I have contact.

103

00:07:36,900  -->  00:07:37,480
All right.

104

00:07:37,620  -->  00:07:40,840
I could do that as well but I would have to change it here.

105

00:07:41,130  -->  00:07:52,110
So I would have to say something like pages contact contact ok or pages that contact just to make it

106

00:07:52,110  -->  00:07:53,150
easier.

107

00:07:53,220  -->  00:07:54,480
You can do that as well.

108

00:07:54,690  -->  00:08:01,230
But in this case we're using this here and I'm going to delete this directory and then right click in

109

00:08:01,230  -->  00:08:04,880
the lead all right.

110

00:08:04,970  -->  00:08:12,120
So now we should see something then when we type in contact Let's go ahead and type in contact.

111

00:08:12,180  -->  00:08:13,170
There we go.

112

00:08:13,170  -->  00:08:16,770
See they're beautiful.

113

00:08:16,830  -->  00:08:21,360
So now we're able to show a view using the controller which is pretty cool.

114

00:08:21,360  -->  00:08:27,950
Now you are you're welcome to do more things if you want and play around with it.

115

00:08:28,090  -->  00:08:33,090
All right on the next lecture we are going to be passing data to views.

116

00:08:33,120  -->  00:08:37,960
So you really know how to pass data to that returned key word that we use right.

117

00:08:37,980  -->  00:08:42,660
Bass strings with variables in there.

118

00:08:43,140  -->  00:08:48,060
Now do it with a view and see if you can do that on the next lecture.

119

00:08:48,060  -->  00:08:48,810
We will do that.

120

00:08:48,810  -->  00:08:51,090
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.

121

00:08:51,090  -->  00:08:51,540
Keep it up
