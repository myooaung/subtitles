00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:04.440
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture I was kind of tired I went and had a rest.

2

00:00:04.440  -->  00:00:05.700
So I'm good to go now.

3

00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:06.690
All right cool.

4

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:12.390
So let's go back to our edit right here.

5

00:00:12.480  -->  00:00:15.050
And as you can see we're sending all this data to the post.

6

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:20.100
Now when you're about to the bug this and you want to make sure that this is actually going to we're

7

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:21.530
supposed to go.

8

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:27.150
All right well you need to do is go to your controller and on the Update you return something you say

9

00:00:27.170  -->  00:00:31.430
OK it's working ok.

10

00:00:31.650  -->  00:00:32.590
Something like this.

11

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:37.600
So that way you know that you're not wasting your time with that.

12

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:41.420
All right so let's go and we'll check this out real quick.

13

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:47.540
I hate that feature of arm of Mac where you can make this when it goes back like that.

14

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:49.730
But anyway.

15

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:53.270
All right cool.

16

00:00:53.310  -->  00:00:57.380
So now if I try to edit this you see that it says it's working.

17

00:00:57.390  -->  00:01:02.760
All right so we are receiving the data and what you can do as well is that you can return the request

18

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:02.790
.

19

00:01:02.790  -->  00:01:07.360
All right here.

20

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:09.360
All right.

21

00:01:09.370  -->  00:01:18.750
So Samit as you can see the talking's getting submitted with all the name values as well.

22

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:20.280
All right including the title right here.

23

00:01:20.280  -->  00:01:21.750
So cool stuff.

24

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:24.440
So we're getting everything we need now.

25

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:25.470
So how do we do this.

26

00:01:25.470  -->  00:01:27.760
Well first of all we find it right.

27

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:38.120
So we would say we find or fail this record with an idea of one and now we grab the object try because

28

00:01:38.160  -->  00:01:45.710
it's one object and we say you know why I want to update this and I want to update everything.

29

00:01:45.810  -->  00:01:57.910
Now one of the or the requests and put it in the table and at the same time I also want to return redirect

30

00:01:59.890  -->  00:02:06.930
OK and redirect to pose that and it's OK.

31

00:02:07.750  -->  00:02:08.720
Cool.

32

00:02:08.820  -->  00:02:10.200
I think we're good to go.

33

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:11.480
We're golden guys.

34

00:02:11.760  -->  00:02:18.940
Let's go back and we want to edit this to say updated BHB submit.

35

00:02:19.080  -->  00:02:22.000
No found exception.

36

00:02:22.020  -->  00:02:23.980
So why would that happen.

37

00:02:24.260  -->  00:02:30.720
OK well let's go back here to our edit and see what's going on.

38

00:02:31.950  -->  00:02:32.660
All right.

39

00:02:32.970  -->  00:02:38.210
So OK I see I see what's going on.

40

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:45.710
We are redirecting use in the view functionality that name brand functionality it doesn't work with

41

00:02:45.710  -->  00:02:46.890
a redirect.

42

00:02:46.890  -->  00:02:50.190
So let's go back here and we can use this.

43

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:51.160
OK.

44

00:02:51.390  -->  00:02:56.060
So let's use we regulate this.

45

00:02:56.160  -->  00:02:58.120
All right cool.

46

00:02:58.800  -->  00:03:01.350
Let's go back.

47

00:03:01.350  -->  00:03:04.370
There we go of data APHC we see that.

48

00:03:05.100  -->  00:03:05.500
All right.

49

00:03:05.550  -->  00:03:12.030
It would be nice if we have a link here that when we click it it takes us to the edit page right.

50

00:03:12.060  -->  00:03:13.110
So let's do that.

51

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:14.970
Let's go to our show

52

00:03:17.310  -->  00:03:20.690
page and let's put a link on that title.

53

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:22.680
OK.

54

00:03:23.020  -->  00:03:25.140
And on this whoops

55

00:03:29.940  -->  00:03:33.630
and the A-Trak Let's put that little function that I show you how to create.

56

00:03:33.840  -->  00:03:34.860
Let's do the blade

57

00:03:37.610  -->  00:03:46.000
array and let's do pose that at it as a second parameterless pass the ID.

58

00:03:46.000  -->  00:03:47.860
All right so we take yours there.

59

00:03:48.330  -->  00:03:49.140
Ok cool.

60

00:03:49.140  -->  00:03:50.350
That is good.

61

00:03:51.030  -->  00:03:55.520
Let's refresh here and we see that link we click on it and we take us there.

62

00:03:55.530  -->  00:04:06.240
So now my second pose let's just say of the red to my second pose submit as you can see right there

63

00:04:06.260  -->  00:04:06.390
.

64

00:04:06.410  -->  00:04:13.580
Angle yes click on it and they are beautiful.

65

00:04:13.590  -->  00:04:14.130
All right.

66

00:04:14.370  -->  00:04:17.280
So in the next lecture Let me show you how to delete this.

67

00:04:17.490  -->  00:04:20.210
And we are almost done with this functionalities.

68

00:04:20.220  -->  00:04:23.500
