00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.250
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:06.120
I'm a student so on this lecture we're going to learn how to update and delete data.

3

00:00:06.150  -->  00:00:06.610
All right.

4

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:11.790
Well the last lecture we created we persist is some data we create an object around we think are a little

5

00:00:11.790  -->  00:00:12.200
bit right.

6

00:00:12.190  -->  00:00:19.620
So we created an object even non-persistent then we persisted it mean that we went ahead and put it

7

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:22.490
in the database in the database table that's fine.

8

00:00:22.680  -->  00:00:27.600
But what I want to tell you is that sometimes you might see that mine for me might be different from

9

00:00:27.600  -->  00:00:31.260
the last video or whatever information I have on the table and I just got it.

10

00:00:31.260  -->  00:00:33.850
So you just focus on what you're learning.

11

00:00:33.990  -->  00:00:37.080
So if I told you in the last lecture that you were going to learn how to be in the lead.

12

00:00:37.080  -->  00:00:42.600
Focus on the worry about what kind of data I have in my table or what or if it's different from yours

13

00:00:42.600  -->  00:00:42.630
.

14

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:48.180
Do not worry about that just worry that we have data in the table and worry that you're going to learn

15

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:49.860
how to all day in the lead on this lecture.

16

00:00:49.860  -->  00:00:50.400
OK.

17

00:00:50.460  -->  00:00:56.130
Because sometimes I have to come back to the lecture and delete certain data because my computer can

18

00:00:56.130  -->  00:00:58.760
fail my internet could fail.

19

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:05.420
The editor could fail and I have to delete constantly and change the data inside there to kind of have

20

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:07.970
things going for you guys to see working.

21

00:01:08.270  -->  00:01:08.790
OK.

22

00:01:08.850  -->  00:01:13.190
So anyway let's go to BHB think what to think.

23

00:01:13.190  -->  00:01:13.740
Real quick.

24

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:16.090
So Beechfield isn't thinker.

25

00:01:16.530  -->  00:01:21.330
Let's create a variable to hold that object that we're going to be finding.

26

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:23.400
So we're going to find the post.

27

00:01:23.550  -->  00:01:25.640
So we write the name namespace right.

28

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:34.050
And the two Colon's to say we're going to define a method that actually write a mantra that we have

29

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:41.820
already called Find and we're going to find Recker with the number three if you have one.

30

00:01:41.880  -->  00:01:44.400
If you don't have it find whatever record you want.

31

00:01:44.460  -->  00:01:50.400
We're going to get the object and we are going to of the it's properties are going to obey this and

32

00:01:50.410  -->  00:01:55.760
I say updated Recker with ID 3.

33

00:01:56.440  -->  00:01:57.930
OK.

34

00:01:58.410  -->  00:02:02.400
Antar OK how that is not in the database yet.

35

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:02.730
All right.

36

00:02:02.750  -->  00:02:05.280
I just want you to see that.

37

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:12.270
So now we are going to I just press my up arrow key and my keyboard and we're going to obey the content

38

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:22.330
of day of data Recker content with ID 3.

39

00:02:22.350  -->  00:02:29.460
All right if I go like this and I go in the database you can see right here you're going to see that

40

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:32.550
it doesn't change because we haven't persisted on information.

41

00:02:32.760  -->  00:02:39.570
So in order for us to persist we're going to save posts save Antar and he says SRL right here that means

42

00:02:39.570  -->  00:02:41.000
that data is persistent.

43

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:46.620
If I refresh it you can see that as being all data and the great thing about it when you use the Save

44

00:02:46.620  -->  00:02:52.620
method is that they created that and they updated our Enter automatically for us.

45

00:02:52.890  -->  00:02:53.660
OK.

46

00:02:53.880  -->  00:02:58.180
So now we know how to update data right now.

47

00:02:58.470  -->  00:03:02.250
Let's learn how to delete and I'm going to show you something right now and what's going to happen is

48

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:07.470
I want you to pay very close attention to this feel right here remember that we have created this functionality

49

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:14.580
when we try to delete an item he actually doesn't get the leader he gets to trash so we won't be able

50

00:03:14.580  -->  00:03:16.830
to actually delete the item normally right.

51

00:03:16.840  -->  00:03:20.100
So we have to use special function to delete it permanently.

52

00:03:20.100  -->  00:03:25.230
Right now if we try to delete this record with the number three we get to have a date here right.

53

00:03:25.230  -->  00:03:27.360
So let's try that real quick.

54

00:03:27.360  -->  00:03:28.250
We're still out there.

55

00:03:28.280  -->  00:03:31.480
You're right let's see the lead.

56

00:03:31.980  -->  00:03:33.610
And you can see that is true.

57

00:03:33.810  -->  00:03:37.240
So we still have the old you where the number three there.

58

00:03:39.450  -->  00:03:44.560
And refresh and you can see that just still there that record.

59

00:03:44.610  -->  00:03:47.700
But we have a day that mean it was self deleted.

60

00:03:47.700  -->  00:03:49.620
So that means it was trashed.

61

00:03:49.620  -->  00:03:53.670
Now let's see if we think we can pool it and delete it permanently.

62

00:03:53.670  -->  00:03:54.170
Let's see.

63

00:03:54.270  -->  00:04:05.320
That can happen so I'll post and it's actually let's do this for a quick.

64

00:04:05.340  -->  00:04:06.210
All right.

65

00:04:06.390  -->  00:04:13.070
Space and we're going to see pros and only trust

66

00:04:15.630  -->  00:04:18.100
only trust.

67

00:04:19.540  -->  00:04:19.970
OK.

68

00:04:20.170  -->  00:04:23.880
That see if I say only trust Antar.

69

00:04:24.660  -->  00:04:29.730
Let's see can I forced to lead it

70

00:04:32.920  -->  00:04:37.620
and Terry this one let's go here and check it out.

71

00:04:38.420  -->  00:04:41.200
As you can see the record has been deleted.

72

00:04:41.730  -->  00:04:42.840
All right.

73

00:04:42.840  -->  00:04:48.230
So we think we can do the same thing that we can do basically where with our application we routes.

74

00:04:48.420  -->  00:04:55.230
We can use the same methods and we gain property but the good thing we're thinking is that we can play

75

00:04:55.230  -->  00:05:01.830
around here first before jumping in to creating a route into all kinds of crazy stuff in our application

76

00:05:01.830  -->  00:05:02.050
.

77

00:05:02.190  -->  00:05:06.720
That's sometimes a little hard to do right because we were short on time some time.

78

00:05:06.720  -->  00:05:10.590
So this is pretty cool to have a tool like this that we can use.

79

00:05:10.590  -->  00:05:11.130
All right.

80

00:05:11.280  -->  00:05:16.200
So anyway I hope you have a lot of fun we think is a lot of other commands that you can try it out with

81

00:05:16.200  -->  00:05:21.570
thinker and that's it just for you to go to Lero Well that come in and find out some more information

82

00:05:21.570  -->  00:05:23.880
about think if you want to play around with it a little more.

83

00:05:23.880  -->  00:05:24.550
All right.

84

00:05:24.570  -->  00:05:26.850
Anyway thank you so much for watching this.

85

00:05:26.970  -->  00:05:29.750
And I'll see you in the next lectures
