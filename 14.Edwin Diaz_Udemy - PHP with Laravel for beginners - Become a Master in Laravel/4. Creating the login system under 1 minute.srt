00:00:00,140  -->  00:00:04,890
Bereit will come back and what you said and this is Edwin D.S. a game with another beautiful tutorial

2

00:00:04,890  -->  00:00:05,460
for you guys.

3

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:09,390
All right so we got the database we've got the migration.

4

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:13,360
Now it's time to make this on the one minute so I want you to put your timer.

5

00:00:13,390  -->  00:00:14,020
All right.

6

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:16,680
And I already will spend a couple of seconds talking.

7

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:17,150
All right.

8

00:00:17,370  -->  00:00:18,930
So let's create.

9

00:00:19,320  -->  00:00:20,050
All right.

10

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:26,840
Let's create the the system real quick and probably already 30 seconds talking so it probably on a lot

11

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:28,320
under 30 seconds.

12

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:40,360
This is a command BHB artisan make us enter while you're done that it's probably under 10 seconds right

13

00:00:40,390  -->  00:00:40,780
.

14

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:44,520
Let's go back to this.

15

00:00:44,970  -->  00:00:49,350
Let's refresh and let's say the registration system is done.

16

00:00:49,380  -->  00:00:54,950
I promise you under one minute I should have promised under nine seconds if I didn't talk so much.

17

00:00:54,960  -->  00:00:57,960
Probably was probably going to be under five seconds.

18

00:00:57,960  -->  00:01:01,610
All right so that say you see how easy that was.

19

00:01:01,680  -->  00:01:02,930
We created a database.

20

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:13,650
We migrated it and now we just did that small command PH BE make Auth. BHB already some make Auth. and

21

00:01:13,650  -->  00:01:14,220
walla.

22

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:22,230
Does command has created their auth folder that has the log in file the register file has the password

23

00:01:22,530  -->  00:01:29,890
has another follicle passwords and that has the emails in there and they reset the reset functionalities

24

00:01:29,910  -->  00:01:30,320
.

25

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:36,480
As you can see right here we have layouts for a master page and I'll show you the method which is pretty

26

00:01:36,480  -->  00:01:36,720
cool.

27

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:38,980
I'll show you all the files right now as a matter of fact.

28

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:45,560
So let's go to resources views and I've got to synchronize mine.

29

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:47,330
All right.

30

00:01:47,370  -->  00:01:51,150
So I got it off for the here and you can see we got e-mails.

31

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:52,150
All right.

32

00:01:52,590  -->  00:01:55,740
We got passwords for that.

33

00:01:55,740  -->  00:02:00,120
We got a log in the registration registration.

34

00:02:00,290  -->  00:02:05,470
We got the lay out which is a master label we have bootstrap already here available for us.

35

00:02:05,700  -->  00:02:05,960
All right.

36

00:02:05,970  -->  00:02:10,480
So we have to those include this masturbation in our other pages and we were good to go.

37

00:02:10,540  -->  00:02:13,350
As you can see we're yielding content.

38

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:14,010
All right.

39

00:02:14,100  -->  00:02:17,160
So we are basically in your way guys.

40

00:02:17,190  -->  00:02:21,140
So in the next lecture we're going to register a user.

41

00:02:21,140  -->  00:02:21,680
All right.

42

00:02:21,810  -->  00:02:23,410
As a matter of fact the store right now.

43

00:02:23,420  -->  00:02:23,880
Right.

44

00:02:23,970  -->  00:02:25,980
Let's just register so you can see it.

45

00:02:25,980  -->  00:02:27,390
So let's register.

46

00:02:27,630  -->  00:02:39,720
I'm going to register myself as India's and to register as courting faculty that call my password which

47

00:02:39,720  -->  00:02:41,940
is now my real password just in case.

48

00:02:42,090  -->  00:02:44,090
And then I'm going to register it.

49

00:02:44,530  -->  00:02:50,990
While not only is this going to register that user comput is going to logo's in.

50

00:02:51,000  -->  00:02:52,850
So we are logged in that we can log out.

51

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:57,770
So I'm going to go right now to let me open a browser.

52

00:02:58,320  -->  00:03:03,850
Actually I thought I have BHB my admin there but I do not.

53

00:03:03,870  -->  00:03:09,450
Let's go to Lavell and Laro bill.

54

00:03:10,000  -->  00:03:15,840
Logon to users and as you can see we have a user created not only that but they have that password has

55

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:17,300
been hashed.

56

00:03:17,400  -->  00:03:20,370
So I hope you can see how powerful our view is.

57

00:03:20,370  -->  00:03:22,710
Guys I mean it just gives me goosebumps right.

58

00:03:22,700  -->  00:03:25,350
Anyway thank you so much for watching this and the next lecture.

59

00:03:25,350  -->  00:03:26,940
We're going to inspect this a little bit more.

60

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:27,690
OK.

61

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:30,010
Take care and have a wonderful day.

62

00:03:30,150  -->  00:03:30,450
Bye bye
