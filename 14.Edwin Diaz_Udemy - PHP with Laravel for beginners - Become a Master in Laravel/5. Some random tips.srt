00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,670
All right welcome back my students so now I have encountered an issue and one of the lectures and I

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:09,200
wanted to come back and let you guys know how I'm fixing this.

3

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:17,010
For some reason my Ph.D. artist and is now working so if I try to refresh refresh reset or refresh it's

4

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:25,140
now working even if I try to migrate or even roll back ok when that happens.

5

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:30,850
The best way to do it is not deleting it from here you need to go to the database in the lead or your

6

00:00:30,850  -->  00:00:32,390
table is there.

7

00:00:32,450  -->  00:00:33,880
OK.

8

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:41,140
So I will go to that database and I will select all of this and delete them all.

9

00:00:41,450  -->  00:00:46,820
OK let's just drop it where is the drop here.

10

00:00:47,460  -->  00:00:50,000
Yes I want to drop them all.

11

00:00:50,030  -->  00:00:50,980
All right.

12

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:52,050
And now

13

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:59,820
you delete whatever you want to hear which is this one that I wanted really.

14

00:00:59,880  -->  00:01:02,220
You don't have to follow me on this lecture.

15

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:04,520
I'm just showing you how we do something like this.

16

00:01:04,510  -->  00:01:09,000
All right if I have a problem with BHB my artisan.

17

00:01:09,820  -->  00:01:11,120
Now let's go back.

18

00:01:11,130  -->  00:01:15,260
Art is an angry answer.

19

00:01:15,290  -->  00:01:16,380
Now they all migrated.

20

00:01:16,380  -->  00:01:17,790
So everything is fixed again.

21

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:18,340
OK.

22

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:23,970
So when you encounter issues like die and you use mph we already said and you making migrations and

23

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:29,340
doing this and doing that and you are in there he does it stops working go back in the lead.

24

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:33,790
Every time all the tables in there you can just generate them again.

25

00:01:33,790  -->  00:01:34,950
Isn't that beautiful guys.

26

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:35,600
Right.

27

00:01:35,640  -->  00:01:41,270
You don't have to go in and do this manually in the Petri maddening anymore.

28

00:01:41,550  -->  00:01:44,460
You can just run the migration things done for you.

29

00:01:44,460  -->  00:01:44,880
Beautiful.

30

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:48,760
Anyway I just wanted to record this video to help you guys with that.

31

00:01:48,910  -->  00:01:52,050
And on the next lecture We'll continue with our relationships.

32

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:52,500
Thank you
