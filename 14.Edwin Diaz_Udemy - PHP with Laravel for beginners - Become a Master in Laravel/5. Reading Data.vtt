00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.790
Hey welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.830  -->  00:00:04.110
So I hope you're having a really awesome day.

3

00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:07.350
I'm having an extra ordinary day.

4

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:09.240
I almost cannot pronounce that word.

5

00:00:09.240  -->  00:00:13.590
But anyway if you see the way I teach you guys I do this with love.

6

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:14.330
Why.

7

00:00:14.340  -->  00:00:16.840
Because I want you to learn this course.

8

00:00:16.860  -->  00:00:21.510
This class is this information and now fall asleep.

9

00:00:21.510  -->  00:00:25.390
I mean two courses in lectures where you just fall asleep.

10

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:29.760
I don't want you to fall asleep and if you falling asleep right now go take five minutes.

11

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:34.610
Go get your coffee go go go get some natural energy drink out there and get up.

12

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:35.820
You need to focus.

13

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:36.450
All right.

14

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:39.000
So let's go into this beautiful.

15

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:44.190
And I'm talking to you could be 80 years old you could be my grandpa you could be my brother my sister

16

00:00:44.190  -->  00:00:45.580
my mother whatever it is.

17

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:49.300
I'm talking to you talk to everybody the same you my students no matter who you are.

18

00:00:49.590  -->  00:00:54.120
And I love you no matter what color you are and how old are you.

19

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:54.540
All right.

20

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:55.780
But anyway enough of me.

21

00:00:55.950  -->  00:00:57.610
Let's go and get this going.

22

00:00:57.620  -->  00:00:57.860
Right.

23

00:00:57.860  -->  00:01:02.760
So the last lecture we learn how to create data on this lecture.

24

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:06.660
We're going to learn how to read it right but we already know this stuff.

25

00:01:06.660  -->  00:01:10.670
I'm just going over again because this is the crud section.

26

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:12.720
So I have to go all over again.

27

00:01:12.720  -->  00:01:13.440
All right.

28

00:01:13.440  -->  00:01:18.080
I was going to copy and paste or that but why.

29

00:01:18.090  -->  00:01:23.000
When we can just write it and get faster every time we write it re read.

30

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:26.820
So we getting I don't even have to explain myself what I'm doing right guys.

31

00:01:26.820  -->  00:01:28.080
You already know this stuff.

32

00:01:28.290  -->  00:01:30.230
You've done it a dozen times already.

33

00:01:30.550  -->  00:01:32.170
Ok cool.

34

00:01:32.190  -->  00:01:39.800
So we get a user array we assign it to a variable use a model find or fail.

35

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:51.090
We go one and this time we're going to use it for each eye because what we get out of here and we see

36

00:01:51.120  -->  00:01:55.410
for each almost forgot a road right for each.

37

00:01:55.410  -->  00:01:56.650
Do you believe it.

38

00:01:57.300  -->  00:02:01.290
And my ph Pistone was not helping me there.

39

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:02.730
All right.

40

00:02:02.790  -->  00:02:08.910
So we look to the user roles as role we pull that out.

41

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:17.090
And can you guess what you get out of here if you returned is this actually died dump it.

42

00:02:17.110  -->  00:02:23.010
All right you can you can expect what you're getting out of it right guys this way you learn more the

43

00:02:23.010  -->  00:02:26.690
more you return or you Vardhan pay or die down.

44

00:02:26.700  -->  00:02:33.790
But you know when you pulling out information the more you learn about what you're getting out OK.

45

00:02:34.890  -->  00:02:38.170
As you can see right now we're getting this object out of it.

46

00:02:38.210  -->  00:02:38.670
All right.

47

00:02:38.730  -->  00:02:43.930
But if you go and indict them.

48

00:02:45.500  -->  00:02:49.340
Watch this.

49

00:02:51.150  -->  00:03:01.410
If you died dump this use arole know what you get a collection and then you can say OK in the zero key

50

00:03:01.470  -->  00:03:04.140
we have a object.

51

00:03:04.140  -->  00:03:08.140
All right you can have another key which will be probably equal to one.

52

00:03:08.220  -->  00:03:11.940
And then that's when the second one and you will have another object.

53

00:03:12.040  -->  00:03:17.980
All right and this object has many different attributes and relationships.

54

00:03:18.480  -->  00:03:20.190
Look it has a pivot table.

55

00:03:20.250  -->  00:03:23.920
You can inspect these guys and even get smarter with this.

56

00:03:23.920  -->  00:03:24.720
All right.

57

00:03:25.110  -->  00:03:31.110
The more you dig in the more you're going to learning always always go back to the documentation.

58

00:03:31.110  -->  00:03:36.410
I'm always going to try to put a link to each section but if I forget you know where to find the larva

59

00:03:36.420  -->  00:03:39.780
that can go there and find the information you're looking for.

60

00:03:39.780  -->  00:03:40.780
All right cool.

61

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:45.050
So that's what is called in depth learning.

62

00:03:45.060  -->  00:03:47.240
All right you can look it up on Google.

63

00:03:47.340  -->  00:03:51.950
The P in death the E P T H.

64

00:03:51.960  -->  00:03:55.290
Learning every little thing that I do.

65

00:03:55.290  -->  00:04:00.710
You can always go ahead and learn it really well and you become the best in Larabee if you do that.

66

00:04:00.990  -->  00:04:05.490
So anyway you get a collection out of here and what we're doing with this collection is we're looping

67

00:04:05.490  -->  00:04:09.870
through it and we're pulling all these object all right which is going to be wrong.

68

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:17.910
Now we're always going to be the object and you can go ahead and echo these out and call that property

69

00:04:17.910  -->  00:04:19.380
of the object.

70

00:04:19.380  -->  00:04:20.920
All right.

71

00:04:21.120  -->  00:04:23.710
It's not at congers at all.

72

00:04:23.710  -->  00:04:24.950
There we go.

73

00:04:25.650  -->  00:04:27.740
So there we go.

74

00:04:28.410  -->  00:04:29.190
All right.

75

00:04:29.220  -->  00:04:33.390
I'm going to show you how to do some really cool tricks with this later on.

76

00:04:33.480  -->  00:04:34.160
But not now.

77

00:04:34.170  -->  00:04:34.610
Right.

78

00:04:34.740  -->  00:04:36.840
But anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

79

00:04:36.840  -->  00:04:38.100
This was a short lecture.

80

00:04:38.100  -->  00:04:43.230
Hopefully you'll learn a lot and I see you in the next lecture.
