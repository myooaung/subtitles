00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:05.400
All right welcome back my students so I decided to actually show you how to do this little slide down

2

00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:07.710
type of effect with Jake wherever you are right.

3

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:12.330
So first of all we got to get on top of the year.

4

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:15.830
All right let's go and try to build something here.

5

00:00:15.840  -->  00:00:17.490
All right.

6

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:21.970
So let's go we're we have the nested right here.

7

00:00:22.440  -->  00:00:29.820
OK so we got that nested function right here which should have school a little bit that way

8

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:35.700
.

9

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:35.950
All right.

10

00:00:35.970  -->  00:00:41.400
So we got to think about it and really think about it.

11

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:53.640
All right so we have the form here and it will be nice to have a container that we actually cover this

12

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:55.880
whole thing.

13

00:00:56.820  -->  00:01:00.030
Actually we can have something that will take over

14

00:01:02.610  -->  00:01:12.410
this let's just make a day here with a comment or reply container or something like that.

15

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:16.670
And that's how we're going to wrap everything around.

16

00:01:18.330  -->  00:01:22.050
All right there we go.

17

00:01:22.050  -->  00:01:22.620
All right.

18

00:01:22.860  -->  00:01:30.150
And then say here I want to also have a button to use in javascript.

19

00:01:30.150  -->  00:01:42.480
Let's give it a class let's give it Tuggle reply and then BTA and another class VTAM primary

20

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:49.620
and we're going to take it to the right.

21

00:01:50.700  -->  00:01:53.880
So we have the pool right.

22

00:01:53.880  -->  00:02:00.330
All right cool reply Let's check it out.

23

00:02:00.970  -->  00:02:02.910
Well there we go.

24

00:02:02.910  -->  00:02:06.370
So we got this reply but there is not doing much right now.

25

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:08.860
Would be nice if we hook ups and javascript to it.

26

00:02:08.910  -->  00:02:15.720
So right below here we could create a section for javascript.

27

00:02:15.720  -->  00:02:21.840
We already have Jake where we included here so we can use that.

28

00:02:22.020  -->  00:02:25.480
Let me actually look to see layouts.

29

00:02:25.480  -->  00:02:34.650
Let's go to out real quick and it's blog post.

30

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:39.630
Do we have javascript would do with javascript we are now yielding anything.

31

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:45.250
So less yield.

32

00:02:49.210  -->  00:02:49.770
Excuse me.

33

00:02:49.770  -->  00:02:54.300
We can do scripts.

34

00:02:56.160  -->  00:03:00.650
So here we can see a section for scripts

35

00:03:03.820  -->  00:03:07.920
can stop you right here.

36

00:03:07.920  -->  00:03:08.470
All right.

37

00:03:08.810  -->  00:03:09.090
Cool.

38

00:03:09.090  -->  00:03:16.480
So now let's build some type of event here in javascript so that where we can hook this up we can detect

39

00:03:16.480  -->  00:03:19.210
it by an event.

40

00:03:19.650  -->  00:03:25.560
So we got this use javascript here and

41

00:03:29.640  -->  00:03:36.710
reply container I believe was the one here.

42

00:03:37.410  -->  00:03:42.770
Yeah actually it's common.

43

00:03:46.830  -->  00:03:47.160
Yeah.

44

00:03:47.160  -->  00:03:52.630
This is the container but this is the button right here so it's toggle reply.

45

00:03:52.800  -->  00:03:53.720
All right.

46

00:03:54.140  -->  00:03:56.720
But the problem is that this has a name that I don't like.

47

00:03:56.720  -->  00:04:01.500
Come and reply container.

48

00:04:01.500  -->  00:04:06.040
All right so that's OK.

49

00:04:06.420  -->  00:04:08.700
And then we're going to find the

50

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:14.580
Tobel reply.

51

00:04:15.720  -->  00:04:16.910
That's OK.

52

00:04:17.130  -->  00:04:24.350
We could just find the toggle reply and say what I like to actually link have a little ness here.

53

00:04:24.510  -->  00:04:30.320
That's just my preference guys would like it I regularly to toggle reply.

54

00:04:31.620  -->  00:04:44.510
We can do a click event here on click if you want but that's the way I like to keep it.

55

00:04:44.910  -->  00:04:45.330
All right.

56

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:46.950
Bring it down.

57

00:04:47.820  -->  00:04:51.820
And we're going to say this and

58

00:04:54.840  -->  00:05:02.510
I mean you see we got to see how many does this thing is.

59

00:05:02.910  -->  00:05:11.580
So this we go to the next nets div which is common nested comment

60

00:05:11.700  -->  00:05:18.490
.

61

00:05:18.900  -->  00:05:21.090
Let's actually put this

62

00:05:22.710  -->  00:05:28.910
.

63

00:05:31.860  -->  00:05:34.140
Let's just do it right here.

64

00:05:34.140  -->  00:05:35.160
Actually

65

00:05:39.390  -->  00:05:43.970
we got the container we got the tile will reply right here.

66

00:05:44.220  -->  00:05:45.500
All right.

67

00:05:46.200  -->  00:06:00.660
So we got those two things and we could do another here which would be comment reply and this one is

68

00:06:00.660  -->  00:06:06.290
the one that we got a high and then show that's we that's how we're going to do it.

69

00:06:06.330  -->  00:06:06.750
So

70

00:06:11.070  -->  00:06:18.010
I know this seems a little confusing guys but follow me here OK.

71

00:06:19.110  -->  00:06:22.130
So on this guy right here.

72

00:06:22.260  -->  00:06:25.720
All right we are wrapping the button.

73

00:06:25.770  -->  00:06:26.460
We're wrapping.

74

00:06:26.460  -->  00:06:30.050
This guy that has deforming psi.

75

00:06:30.060  -->  00:06:31.080
All right.

76

00:06:31.080  -->  00:06:33.810
So now let's look at it real quick to see how that looks.

77

00:06:33.810  -->  00:06:37.510
If we didn't make any mistakes Well this reply is there now

78

00:06:40.920  -->  00:06:47.120
but we have to high that that's high this guy comment.

79

00:06:47.280  -->  00:06:48.520
Let's go to this yes.

80

00:06:48.560  -->  00:06:54.130
Yes.

81

00:06:55.320  -->  00:06:59.060
And this play on

82

00:07:02.590  -->  00:07:04.550
we've got to play around with a little bit.

83

00:07:04.550  -->  00:07:05.370
So that way

84

00:07:11.000  -->  00:07:14.490
that way we can show and explain what we wanted to.

85

00:07:14.970  -->  00:07:17.790
So right now it's still ok it's not there.

86

00:07:17.790  -->  00:07:24.840
Their form is not there but you can see you can see the replies but you don't see the form and that's

87

00:07:24.840  -->  00:07:25.340
what we want.

88

00:07:25.340  -->  00:07:27.850
We want to click here and then see the form.

89

00:07:27.900  -->  00:07:28.940
All right.

90

00:07:29.970  -->  00:07:30.990
So we're getting there

91

00:07:30.990  -->  00:07:37.500
.

92

00:07:37.500  -->  00:07:37.860
All right.

93

00:07:37.890  -->  00:07:46.230
So here we get it.

94

00:07:47.220  -->  00:07:53.850
I'm trying to calculate here after this container we got the button here and actually high the next

95

00:07:53.850  -->  00:07:54.130
one.

96

00:07:54.150  -->  00:07:55.570
OK.

97

00:07:55.800  -->  00:07:56.920
So that's how I want it.

98

00:07:56.940  -->  00:08:01.680
All right because that way we don't have to actually go crazy trying to find it in the dorm.

99

00:08:01.760  -->  00:08:06.500
So that's and then we can say sly.

100

00:08:06.870  -->  00:08:10.270
And thanks BHB store for helping me.

101

00:08:11.310  -->  00:08:17.350
And we're going to say slow if I remember correctly and we can pass some type of callback function here

102

00:08:18.150  -->  00:08:19.420
if we want to.

103

00:08:19.710  -->  00:08:26.880
What I'm not going to do that with the way it is let's check it out real quick Wolf.

104

00:08:27.000  -->  00:08:31.850
Well there we go.

105

00:08:31.860  -->  00:08:37.160
All right you might want to FaceTime or type of in another container or something right.

106

00:08:37.210  -->  00:08:42.260
That's cosmetic that's just because we probably have it in.

107

00:08:42.310  -->  00:08:46.100
We need to align it somewhere.

108

00:08:46.190  -->  00:08:48.090
All right but we've got that working.

109

00:08:48.180  -->  00:08:53.270
It's and it's a little bit more adjustment now right.

110

00:08:53.820  -->  00:08:55.370
But we got it working.

111

00:08:55.410  -->  00:09:00.330
Anyway thank you so much for watching this and I'll see you in the next lecture.
