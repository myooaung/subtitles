1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:02,520
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:08,900
So on this lecture I'm going to talk to you a little bit about controllers or I maybe a lot.

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:13,170
But anyway I don't try to divide the lectures so they don't get to be too long.

4

00:00:13,190  -->  00:00:17,580
But anyway so what our control is what we talked a little bit about the let me show you what they really

5

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:17,910
are.

6

00:00:17,910  -->  00:00:18,510
All right.

7

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:20,870
So controllers are the middleman.

8

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:21,500
Where are they.

9

00:00:21,500  -->  00:00:28,950
First of all they are located on their app HTP and then controllers on this for their right here.

10

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:35,700
Now you can have a subfolder for all the type of controllers or I know you can just put other controllers

11

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:36,030
in there.

12

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:38,070
Usually we have them on their controllers.

13

00:00:38,340  -->  00:00:45,710
And there is a law robo calls with one controller as this version specifies here controller.

14

00:00:45,790  -->  00:00:46,170
All right.

15

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:49,380
So if I double click it this will be a controller.

16

00:00:49,400  -->  00:00:49,850
All right.

17

00:00:49,860  -->  00:00:55,620
Now this control might be a little different from the rest but because this is the main controller.

18

00:00:55,640  -->  00:01:02,130
But let me explain to you a little bit about maybe a key word that some of you have not seen before

19

00:01:02,180  -->  00:01:02,340
.

20

00:01:02,390  -->  00:01:04,830
Namespace and use.

21

00:01:04,830  -->  00:01:05,390
All right.

22

00:01:05,550  -->  00:01:10,720
So what is a namespace keyword versus what does this do.

23

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:19,380
Well namespace in those four functions in class is wide scope scope does for variables basically allows

24

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:27,630
us to use the same function names or class name in different parts of the same application that we have

25

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:30,000
without causing many problems.

26

00:01:30,000  -->  00:01:30,490
All right.

27

00:01:30,570  -->  00:01:37,140
So for example let's say I have a function called I don't know run this query.

28

00:01:37,310  -->  00:01:37,880
All right.

29

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:42,660
And then I have another function Colver on the square in the same application imagine what would happen

30

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:47,840
if I call the same function name in the same application.

31

00:01:47,850  -->  00:01:49,160
I would have a problem.

32

00:01:49,290  -->  00:01:55,290
They speccing what we can do is we have a namespace like this right namespace and we get we get to say

33

00:01:55,300  -->  00:01:58,740
OK I'm going to have this function.

34

00:01:58,740  -->  00:02:01,890
The first one called.

35

00:02:03,400  -->  00:02:10,290
Whether we say run this query we're going to have this function run this Querrey all right or we're

36

00:02:10,290  -->  00:02:17,290
going to have this for the core functions functions one.

37

00:02:17,310  -->  00:02:18,040
All right.

38

00:02:18,330  -->  00:02:19,990
So we have a namespace for that.

39

00:02:20,160  -->  00:02:25,620
And this is where we're going to be finding that Randy Square-D function for frankly under the directory

40

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:29,630
function functions one then the next function.

41

00:02:30,220  -->  00:02:35,340
We can do it in the second directory functions to just see that.

42

00:02:35,340  -->  00:02:39,450
So basically what you're going to do what we do is we organize those functions in different parts of

43

00:02:39,450  -->  00:02:42,180
our application even though they have the same name.

44

00:02:42,180  -->  00:02:46,680
We use a namespace to differentiate the functions.

45

00:02:46,680  -->  00:02:49,700
All right even though they have the same name so we don't have a collision.

46

00:02:50,100  -->  00:02:50,640
All right.

47

00:02:50,730  -->  00:02:57,600
So space should be clear if not go and look it up on line or you're going to find a lot of information

48

00:02:57,920  -->  00:02:59,340
use.

49

00:02:59,380  -->  00:03:10,410
All right is to import that specific class or namespace to this scope right here to this file.

50

00:03:10,620  -->  00:03:15,610
So if I want to use this everything that's here.

51

00:03:16,000  -->  00:03:22,570
All right in this file I will use use or it will import that class or that namespace to our coring file

52

00:03:22,580  -->  00:03:24,780
so we can use that functionality.

53

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:26,400
That's why I used us.

54

00:03:26,410  -->  00:03:29,550
All right you going to see that a lot in Lero Bill.

55

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:30,050
All right.

56

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:33,070
But anyway let's get it over with the controller.

57

00:03:33,070  -->  00:03:38,250
So now control is we can create a control it's super simple we can right click just like we create another

58

00:03:38,250  -->  00:03:47,880
file new BHB file whatever and we can just say polls say and you got you got to follow this convention

59

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:49,480
of camel case.

60

00:03:49,500  -->  00:03:59,080
All right polls controller and we just say and that say you create a post controller.

61

00:03:59,100  -->  00:03:59,910
All right.

62

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:07,950
Now in Clarabell there is an easier way to do this to create a controller and it's using a terminal

63

00:04:07,950  -->  00:04:13,190
right here ph bipartisan or the command line tool BHB artisan.

64

00:04:13,200  -->  00:04:14,160
Let me just delete this.

65

00:04:14,160  -->  00:04:19,340
I'm going to reichlich it and I'm going to delete it.

66

00:04:19,350  -->  00:04:27,690
Right now if I use BHB artisan and this little tour right here this terminal in PH BE Stormy's is sending

67

00:04:27,690  -->  00:04:30,060
us using the terminal itself.

68

00:04:30,060  -->  00:04:30,530
All right.

69

00:04:30,660  -->  00:04:34,560
We just have the convenience of using it right here inside BHP storing for those of you the happy HP

70

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:35,100
storm.

71

00:04:35,160  -->  00:04:37,330
But I feel happy HP storm.

72

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:46,980
Get that your terminal and type in BHB partisan right make controller.

73

00:04:47,810  -->  00:04:49,310
All right.

74

00:04:50,190  -->  00:04:57,240
So as you can see undoing make Kallen controller all lowercase and this has to be done exactly like

75

00:04:57,240  -->  00:04:57,780
this.

76

00:04:57,780  -->  00:05:03,220
And then the name of your controller so Folse controller.

77

00:05:03,630  -->  00:05:08,760
If I do it like this and I click enter it will create that controller.

78

00:05:08,760  -->  00:05:15,120
Now if I go back to my door and I click it you can see that it is creating in fact double click it.

79

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:21,470
You can see that there already has a name Spey for me is importing the requests.

80

00:05:21,510  -->  00:05:22,430
All right.

81

00:05:22,830  -->  00:05:25,070
And I even have the class defined already.

82

00:05:25,070  -->  00:05:29,200
So I just I just have to start writing my methods right here.

83

00:05:29,290  -->  00:05:35,640
All right now I like to use it with the resource and the resource is something that I'm going to talk

84

00:05:35,640  -->  00:05:40,130
to you a little bit about later but just know that the resource is everything.

85

00:05:40,140  -->  00:05:41,250
It's like the crowd.

86

00:05:41,340  -->  00:05:42,060
All right.

87

00:05:42,060  -->  00:05:45,210
Create read of they deleting all that's good stuff.

88

00:05:45,210  -->  00:05:46,760
That's what the resource are going to be.

89

00:05:46,770  -->  00:05:47,230
Right.

90

00:05:47,340  -->  00:05:52,500
So if I want to create a controller with all my methods let's say if I know if I have an application

91

00:05:52,500  -->  00:06:00,600
that is going to to create read updating delete We already know that then I can do it in another way

92

00:06:00,600  -->  00:06:00,690
.

93

00:06:00,690  -->  00:06:07,590
Let me just delete this real quick and this time I'm going to use the BHB command to write a terminal

94

00:06:08,430  -->  00:06:10,400
which is the same thing as a terminal here guys.

95

00:06:10,440  -->  00:06:11,160
Right.

96

00:06:11,570  -->  00:06:19,410
And for those of you who are using Windows the same thing as your command as you get a command prompt

97

00:06:19,410  -->  00:06:19,770
right.

98

00:06:19,890  -->  00:06:21,060
So I'm going to I'm going to do this.

99

00:06:21,060  -->  00:06:31,920
BHB areason make Kallen controller and then I'm going to do this.

100

00:06:32,770  -->  00:06:42,840
Hi and resource resource and then Pooles controller and 2.

101

00:06:42,920  -->  00:06:43,420
All right.

102

00:06:43,560  -->  00:06:55,320
Now if I click the sidebar here for those of you that have another editor you can just call it.

103

00:06:56,340  -->  00:07:02,520
You can just refresh or application you should do it automatically though or I mind taking a little

104

00:07:02,520  -->  00:07:12,100
bit to do some reason to refresh here and click synchronize.

105

00:07:12,180  -->  00:07:12,900
No actually

106

00:07:19,260  -->  00:07:20,080
let me do in your

107

00:07:23,610  -->  00:07:26,830
resource center Oh he's already.

108

00:07:26,840  -->  00:07:31,310
This is just not here in my application yet let me see if it is.

109

00:07:31,310  -->  00:07:37,150
Now depending on your computer and your home.

110

00:07:37,170  -->  00:07:37,890
OK there we go.

111

00:07:37,890  -->  00:07:43,370
Now he's here if I double click it right click on this letter we're going to bring that down.

112

00:07:43,470  -->  00:07:47,940
You can see that he created the resource for me created in index method that is going to display the

113

00:07:47,940  -->  00:07:56,270
home page create method store method to save the information in a database to show the view to edit

114

00:07:56,370  -->  00:07:58,810
and even of they and destroy.

115

00:07:59,040  -->  00:08:02,180
So that's what we talk about what we mean we resource.

116

00:08:02,200  -->  00:08:02,560
Right.

117

00:08:02,640  -->  00:08:04,870
So this is a controller right.

118

00:08:05,590  -->  00:08:10,470
And we can do a lot of things here this is how we control the information coming from the database and

119

00:08:10,470  -->  00:08:15,090
go into the view and back and forth right on the next lecture I'm going I'm going to show you how to

120

00:08:15,090  -->  00:08:15,890
use a controller.

121

00:08:15,890  -->  00:08:16,470
OK.

122

00:08:16,740  -->  00:08:19,110
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
