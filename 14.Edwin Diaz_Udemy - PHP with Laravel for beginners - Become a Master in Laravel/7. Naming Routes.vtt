00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:03.420
Welcome back my students I hope you're having a lot of fun.

2

00:00:03.480  -->  00:00:08.850
And you I hope you are very excited by what you're learning right here because Laura Bell is one of

3

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:14.640
the best framework's in the world for BHB if you learn this you would never be jobless.

4

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:15.150
All right.

5

00:00:15.170  -->  00:00:17.220
You just have to go out there and let people know what you know.

6

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:20.860
But anyway follow me here.

7

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:27.870
Now we study routes how we can put in the first parameter where we want to go and then you know return

8

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:33.750
some information through here and we even learn how to pass same parameters.

9

00:00:34.020  -->  00:00:36.710
But the cool thing about route's is naming them.

10

00:00:36.720  -->  00:00:37.620
All right.

11

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:42.030
So for example let's say let's just copy one of these guys actually let's write it down or like to write

12

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:44.770
it down because that way you get used to it.

13

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:48.120
So let's say we create you see how this looks.

14

00:00:48.120  -->  00:00:53.340
This is a starting method just a regular starting method that you can see in a couple of parameters

15

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:53.610
.

16

00:00:53.610  -->  00:00:58.310
Let's say you have a router I super long like this admin pulls

17

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:03.780
just one whatever.

18

00:01:03.810  -->  00:01:05.930
I mean polls like this that's fine.

19

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:12.900
And then you have your of course your closure function here.

20

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:14.370
All right you bring it down.

21

00:01:14.820  -->  00:01:20.670
Let's say you have this big long you are out but you want people to actually type in something a little

22

00:01:20.670  -->  00:01:24.370
bit less bigger than that let's just put put it like this.

23

00:01:24.390  -->  00:01:29.350
Let's just give it another parameter example right.

24

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:35.020
Let's say you want them to type something a little shorter than you can name this route.

25

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:36.860
Give it like a nickname.

26

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:38.070
Very simple.

27

00:01:38.070  -->  00:01:45.680
All you have to do is create another parameter here and say array.

28

00:01:46.230  -->  00:01:52.020
Actually you want to wrap everything inside this so you're going to put this at the end.

29

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:53.450
Right.

30

00:01:54.570  -->  00:01:59.580
And we're get to do this as.

31

00:02:00.450  -->  00:02:03.560
And then this is going to be an associate of array.

32

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:11.880
And you can type whatever you want let's just say let's call it ad men pull home or something like that

33

00:02:11.880  -->  00:02:12.880
.

34

00:02:12.880  -->  00:02:13.720
All right.

35

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:18.850
And then you've got to do this uses.

36

00:02:19.020  -->  00:02:23.070
Actually we don't have to do use because we are not using a controller.

37

00:02:23.220  -->  00:02:24.410
You will learn later on.

38

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:31.740
But anyway as you can see here all we did was put on the rain the second parameter actually wrapping

39

00:02:31.740  -->  00:02:33.810
everything.

40

00:02:33.810  -->  00:02:39.330
All right so now I'll show you right now with a helper function.

41

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:48.920
So let's just say you are well and let's just use a helper function from Claribel call route to access

42

00:02:48.930  -->  00:02:50.610
that route.

43

00:02:50.620  -->  00:02:54.170
And I'm just going to say at home.

44

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:59.410
So what we're doing here is we grabbing this raÃºl we grabbing it and we are saving in this you or else

45

00:02:59.430  -->  00:03:05.910
so that way you can see it when I can show it to you that it is actually a data value is this right

46

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:06.670
here.

47

00:03:06.910  -->  00:03:07.320
Right.

48

00:03:07.410  -->  00:03:08.930
And I'll repeat that again.

49

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:18.790
But anyway so they're going to say this is this you are l is and then we're going to concatenate your

50

00:03:18.810  -->  00:03:20.450
L variable.

51

00:03:20.780  -->  00:03:22.140
And when I close it up.

52

00:03:22.140  -->  00:03:34.980
So now if I go to this route right here on your show right here if I go to that you can see that it

53

00:03:34.980  -->  00:03:35.580
takes

54

00:03:38.420  -->  00:03:39.570
everything.

55

00:03:39.670  -->  00:03:40.850
All right.

56

00:03:41.370  -->  00:03:53.020
So what this means is sorry about that guys that this admin that home is a senting is this.

57

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:53.460
All right.

58

00:03:53.460  -->  00:04:00.780
Another way to actually which is pretty cool to actually find this owl is by going to terminal and in

59

00:04:00.930  -->  00:04:02.680
doing a.

60

00:04:03.700  -->  00:04:05.910
And I'll show you right now as a matter of fact let's click here.

61

00:04:05.910  -->  00:04:14.510
This little box terminal and right here this is a little termino that comes with BHB storm rifle those

62

00:04:14.510  -->  00:04:17.010
of you that BHP storm.

63

00:04:17.050  -->  00:04:24.510
All right you don't have to be storm open your terminal and go to the sea M-S folder let you see actually

64

00:04:27.300  -->  00:04:34.160
if I go to terminal right here and I go to see the CMOS we can type it in.

65

00:04:34.150  -->  00:04:39.700
Let's just clear everything and let's just say BHB Arty's Sen.

66

00:04:39.830  -->  00:04:40.480
All right.

67

00:04:40.770  -->  00:04:48.030
And we're going to say route Colan list and then enter.

68

00:04:48.180  -->  00:04:53.730
Right as you can see this this adducing command and we've got to we're got to get into it later.

69

00:04:53.750  -->  00:04:56.460
But don't don't worry about it too much right now.

70

00:04:56.460  -->  00:05:02.190
You can see right now that the name of this route is admin at home.

71

00:05:02.260  -->  00:05:04.000
All right.

72

00:05:04.450  -->  00:05:07.050
And this is the med to get requests.

73

00:05:07.080  -->  00:05:09.390
We'll get into that more later on.

74

00:05:09.560  -->  00:05:17.250
But we just know that we were able to grab that big long u r l and use it and rename it give it a nickname

75

00:05:17.250  -->  00:05:17.640
.

76

00:05:17.640  -->  00:05:18.110
All right.

77

00:05:18.240  -->  00:05:23.640
So not only are we able to do this in Laro bell without having folders and files or anything like that

78

00:05:24.050  -->  00:05:26.480
but we are also able to nickname it.

79

00:05:26.490  -->  00:05:27.070
All right.

80

00:05:27.150  -->  00:05:32.760
We are able to give it a smaller name and use it and this little function right here allows us to use

81

00:05:32.840  -->  00:05:33.020
.

82

00:05:33.120  -->  00:05:45.600
So if we had to you are for example we have a link right we have a link like this ref whatever and a

83

00:05:45.600  -->  00:05:52.190
link like this in the inside is ref we can say we could write something like this route.

84

00:05:52.770  -->  00:05:56.550
And then the name had me in that home or whatever.

85

00:05:56.850  -->  00:06:00.180
And when we click on that link it's not going to happen.

86

00:06:00.180  -->  00:06:05.860
Now I'll just give you an example when we click on that link in this ref is going to have all of that

87

00:06:05.980  -->  00:06:07.460
all these you are going there.

88

00:06:07.460  -->  00:06:09.770
All right well we click on he's going to take us to this.

89

00:06:09.870  -->  00:06:10.880
You are all there.

90

00:06:11.130  -->  00:06:11.370
Right.

91

00:06:11.370  -->  00:06:14.410
But this is just a crazy example here don't worry about that.

92

00:06:14.410  -->  00:06:14.920
All right.

93

00:06:15.030  -->  00:06:17.940
But anyway we're done here.

94

00:06:17.940  -->  00:06:23.320
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next.

95

00:06:23.350  -->  00:06:27.590
Actually let me make it like this so you have it.

96

00:06:27.590  -->  00:06:29.700
You can copy it.

97

00:06:29.730  -->  00:06:31.560
I'll see you later guys.

98

00:06:31.560  -->  00:06:31.870
Bye bye
