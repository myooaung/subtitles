00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:02,600
All right welcome back my sister.

2

00:00:02,760  -->  00:00:06,450
So it's time for us to learn how to lead with the many to many relationship.

3

00:00:06,450  -->  00:00:08,480
Now we already know how to do this right.

4

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:18,280
It's super easy we just create a route right or route like some people call it and we just name it.

5

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:24,570
And why should we not naming it we are setting it up right here.

6

00:00:25,550  -->  00:00:26,920
We're setting up get requests.

7

00:00:26,940  -->  00:00:35,070
So we find the user in this case because we want to find out its relationship should do fine or fail

8

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:36,480
here.

9

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:40,310
Once we have the user we can look through it.

10

00:00:40,380  -->  00:00:49,160
It's relationship roles and we can go ahead and say delete but this method right here will delete all

11

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:51,300
the relationships in the database.

12

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:57,970
So let's let's actually do it so you can see it but I'm pretty sure you already know that.

13

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:01,870
I was just playing around here returning some data.

14

00:01:02,420  -->  00:01:04,170
Let's just say delete.

15

00:01:04,470  -->  00:01:05,110
OK.

16

00:01:05,400  -->  00:01:07,020
So I just executed that.

17

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:16,520
And let's just open another window here and open BHB my admin many to many relationship.

18

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:18,150
And we have no rules.

19

00:01:18,160  -->  00:01:20,100
OK let's create one.

20

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:26,010
I'm going to go to the create method that we created or functionality I believe right now is doing subscriber

21

00:01:26,010  -->  00:01:26,080
.

22

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:29,080
And if you don't have the same values don't worry about it guys.

23

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:31,800
I'm constantly changing my data.

24

00:01:31,810  -->  00:01:36,300
Just worry about what you're learning right here that is more important than my data in the database

25

00:01:36,300  -->  00:01:37,440
.

26

00:01:37,470  -->  00:01:40,290
Enter refresh.

27

00:01:40,800  -->  00:01:42,430
OK we've got two of them.

28

00:01:42,520  -->  00:01:43,460
All right.

29

00:01:43,710  -->  00:01:46,080
I think we executed a couple of times.

30

00:01:46,190  -->  00:01:52,400
Let's just actually let's just edit this one here.

31

00:01:52,440  -->  00:01:56,030
I'm going to call this author.

32

00:01:57,030  -->  00:01:57,480
All right.

33

00:01:57,510  -->  00:01:59,270
Cool.

34

00:01:59,280  -->  00:01:59,510
All right.

35

00:01:59,520  -->  00:02:00,600
So one of the leads.

36

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:01,380
Number five.

37

00:02:01,400  -->  00:02:06,510
Let's go ahead and do that because the limit is not very exciting if you're deleting everything as you

38

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:06,810
can.

39

00:02:06,860  -->  00:02:10,510
As you saw there we were able to delete everything from the database.

40

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:15,180
It was not in there but we don't want to do that right most of the time.

41

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:16,160
We don't want to do that.

42

00:02:16,170  -->  00:02:21,990
We want to delete it where statements of what we're going to do is we're going to set up we're going

43

00:02:21,990  -->  00:02:23,450
to look through it.

44

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:25,580
Whoops.

45

00:02:25,860  -->  00:02:28,410
Way down there.

46

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:32,820
We're going to look through it through its rules.

47

00:02:32,840  -->  00:02:38,520
We're going to set it up for a role and then once we have that let's just do or die dumb Brooke quick

48

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:40,550
can see what we get.

49

00:02:41,780  -->  00:02:43,740
Oh OK.

50

00:02:43,780  -->  00:02:45,820
That would be interesting right guys.

51

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:52,940
Always do like Dom's Ambar Dobson and try to find out what you have so you can do things with it.

52

00:02:53,130  -->  00:02:58,100
OK so we have this object now with is of Julie King ouches its methods.

53

00:02:58,170  -->  00:03:06,000
Remember that this comes from the model so we have some stuff available to us so we can do is we can

54

00:03:06,000  -->  00:03:12,980
say roll where Id eat cause I believe is five.

55

00:03:13,730  -->  00:03:21,930
So where ID equals five we go now the elite Watch this.

56

00:03:22,080  -->  00:03:25,200
I think that's more exciting right guys.

57

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:26,060
All right girls.

58

00:03:26,150  -->  00:03:26,520
All right.

59

00:03:26,520  -->  00:03:38,340
Every time I say guys and girls guys I mean girls to enter with fresh and while Law is gone.

60

00:03:38,340  -->  00:03:38,890
All right.

61

00:03:39,060  -->  00:03:40,870
You guys scare there for a minute.

62

00:03:41,100  -->  00:03:42,510
You do that I delete everything.

63

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:44,780
No we deleted them when we won it.

64

00:03:44,800  -->  00:03:44,970
All right.

65

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:50,700
So remember every time you looping through this collections or raise whatever it is that has objects

66

00:03:50,700  -->  00:03:54,030
inside right we can access its methods.

67

00:03:54,210  -->  00:03:57,460
We have the where methods they're really mad.

68

00:03:57,480  -->  00:03:58,740
This is saving all that.

69

00:03:58,950  -->  00:04:00,320
And then you can do things with it.

70

00:04:00,330  -->  00:04:01,310
All right.

71

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:02,810
All right cool.

72

00:04:03,060  -->  00:04:08,360
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures.
