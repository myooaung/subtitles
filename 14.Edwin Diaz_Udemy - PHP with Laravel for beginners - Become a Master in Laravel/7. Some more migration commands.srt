00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:03,960
All right welcome back my students are just like I promise I'm going to show you a couple of more things

2

00:00:03,960  -->  00:00:05,240
about migration.

3

00:00:05,520  -->  00:00:12,720
And one of the commands that I would like to do is I would like to reset everything right here because

4

00:00:12,900  -->  00:00:17,560
you know I changed my mind and I don't want to have any tables anymore I want to.

5

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:19,010
Any migrations.

6

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:27,180
So if I wanted to delete all this all these tables I can.

7

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:27,570
All right.

8

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:37,540
So all I've got to do is just say let's just clear a command and say Ph.D. artists and migrate reset

9

00:00:38,470  -->  00:00:39,590
Antar.

10

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:42,060
They will all roll back.

11

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:42,560
All right.

12

00:00:42,720  -->  00:00:53,130
So now if you look at this Clarabell see a the only table we have is migration because what we're doing

13

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:58,270
is we're keeping track of the migrations right of the batch.

14

00:00:58,280  -->  00:00:59,300
All right.

15

00:00:59,970  -->  00:01:06,120
So anyway now let's migrate everything again.

16

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:11,310
So I'm going to say clear now BHP migrate.

17

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:13,340
We migrate to our tables again

18

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:19,020
and this year's refresh.

19

00:01:19,020  -->  00:01:26,110
We see that we have more tables again you see how useful this is post users possible resets.

20

00:01:26,190  -->  00:01:28,180
But now let me show you another one.

21

00:01:28,670  -->  00:01:35,040
A really cool one is that let's say you make a change in a couple of different migrations right instead

22

00:01:35,040  -->  00:01:39,610
of actually you rolling back manually and then migrating again.

23

00:01:39,690  -->  00:01:45,040
Well you can do is run this command HP already send call in Refresh.

24

00:01:45,240  -->  00:01:48,380
And what this is going to do is going to roll it back.

25

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:49,190
Right.

26

00:01:49,250  -->  00:01:54,240
It's going to take off all the data at the tables and then is going to migrate it again for you which

27

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:54,930
is really cool.

28

00:01:54,930  -->  00:01:59,570
This is what I use most of the time when I make difference when I'm testing things out.

29

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:00,260
All right.

30

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:05,220
When I edit a lot of that a lot of them instead of doing going back into an over rolling bag and then

31

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:07,620
migrating I just do a refresh.

32

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:08,220
All right.

33

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:14,720
Again you can learn more stuff if you run the BHB artists Anchorman.

34

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:16,440
All right.

35

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:18,500
And then you will have all that information right here.

36

00:02:18,720  -->  00:02:24,120
Refresh you said roll back oh another cool thing is that you can also check the status so if you say

37

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:27,330
BHB artisan status

38

00:02:32,130  -->  00:02:32,920
actually not now.

39

00:02:32,940  -->  00:02:37,880
This one is actually migrates status sorry about that.

40

00:02:38,010  -->  00:02:38,790
There we go.

41

00:02:38,790  -->  00:02:39,690
You can see that.

42

00:02:39,720  -->  00:02:40,840
Has this ran.

43

00:02:40,920  -->  00:02:41,350
Yes.

44

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:43,080
It gives you a y for yes.

45

00:02:43,120  -->  00:02:52,080
So if Fido migration reset and I do the roll a status is going to tell me has this run is going to give

46

00:02:52,080  -->  00:02:52,330
me.

47

00:02:52,340  -->  00:02:53,410
Didn't know.

48

00:02:53,910  -->  00:02:54,710
All right.

49

00:02:55,020  -->  00:02:56,490
Pretty cool stuff guys.

50

00:02:56,490  -->  00:02:58,970
So anyway thank you so much for watching.

51

00:02:58,980  -->  00:03:01,570
Hope you learn a bunch in this application.

52

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:06,880
I mean these lectures and we're going to be learning a lot more and when we build our application.

53

00:03:06,890  -->  00:03:07,230
Right.

54

00:03:07,410  -->  00:03:11,070
That's where the really juice of the course comes in.

55

00:03:11,370  -->  00:03:15,100
So keep active keep motivated you're learning really cool stuff.

56

00:03:15,120  -->  00:03:18,630
I don't want you sleeping if you tie your if you caught it too much.

57

00:03:18,630  -->  00:03:19,750
Go take a rest.

58

00:03:19,770  -->  00:03:23,130
Come back with a fresh mind and be ready to learn more.

59

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:28,020
Remember that you're doing this for you for your family you're doing it for whatever reason you're doing

60

00:03:28,020  -->  00:03:29,670
and you're taking the cause and you need it.

61

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:31,280
So pay very close attention.

62

00:03:31,280  -->  00:03:33,940
I don't want you to study anything else until you finish this course.

63

00:03:34,200  -->  00:03:34,780
All right.

64

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:36,750
Take care and I'll see you in the next lectures
