00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:01.790
All right welcome.

2

00:00:01.800  -->  00:00:02.970
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02.970  -->  00:00:06.490
I'm a student so it's fun for us to learn about blade.

4

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:07.780
All right.

5

00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:17.330
Now I tell you that blade is a templating engine for BHP basically BHP has a native BHP Templi engine

6

00:00:17.360  -->  00:00:22.890
that you can use but it's not very friendly and there are all other templating engines out there it

7

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:28.440
just makes BHP a lot easier to use with the male or just clear something cleaner.

8

00:00:28.470  -->  00:00:28.900
OK.

9

00:00:28.920  -->  00:00:32.900
Just like you see in this curly brackets here this is just a little bit of blade.

10

00:00:32.910  -->  00:00:33.360
All right.

11

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:39.930
So blade Let's start by creating a master template with blade are-I Let me show you how useful blade

12

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:40.950
can be.

13

00:00:40.950  -->  00:00:49.820
And as you can see here we are creating a contact page post page and we have just too much mail.

14

00:00:49.840  -->  00:00:56.760
All right imagine if we wanted to have a friend navigation for each of these pages or different content

15

00:00:56.760  -->  00:00:56.780
.

16

00:00:56.780  -->  00:01:02.340
We will have to go ahead and copy and paste this stuff over and over again what if we wanted to have

17

00:01:02.340  -->  00:01:04.910
the same navigation.

18

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:05.640
All right.

19

00:01:05.640  -->  00:01:08.330
We will have to copy and paste the same navigation over and over again.

20

00:01:08.330  -->  00:01:11.030
Right that's what we use includes in BHB right.

21

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:15.560
We use the key we include the function include or require.

22

00:01:15.570  -->  00:01:19.340
And then we include certain things in the mail from.

23

00:01:19.360  -->  00:01:24.150
And we break it down with head or food or navigation whatever into different files right.

24

00:01:24.270  -->  00:01:27.690
Well we can do something a little bit cooler in Lara bell.

25

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:28.150
All right.

26

00:01:28.320  -->  00:01:36.600
So I'm going to create a new BHB file where if I rectory saw rector with a new ph before I'm going to

27

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:47.410
call these are three layouts for Slash and let's just name an app that BHP actually app that blade that

28

00:01:47.510  -->  00:01:47.800
.

29

00:01:48.900  -->  00:01:49.220
All right.

30

00:01:49.230  -->  00:01:56.590
And this app is very popular between developers this is what even Larabee uses.

31

00:01:56.610  -->  00:01:57.240
All right.

32

00:01:57.360  -->  00:02:03.510
That name of that file app that would be probably the master page right now probably that will be the

33

00:02:03.510  -->  00:02:04.590
master page.

34

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:14.640
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a question mark and then tab to create a layout.

35

00:02:14.670  -->  00:02:17.670
Now what I want to do is a reality of using Bushra.

36

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:28.750
You have something like this if that core that is said is actually container and they enter.

37

00:02:29.550  -->  00:02:34.910
OK so you have a container and here you have some type of content right.

38

00:02:34.940  -->  00:02:36.710
So what you can do with blade is this.

39

00:02:36.720  -->  00:02:38.290
You can put in that symbol.

40

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:47.580
And uses function call yield and then here you can put let's say content.

41

00:02:47.580  -->  00:02:49.330
Right.

42

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:55.140
And here you could do something like this.

43

00:02:55.230  -->  00:03:05.850
Yield and yield is doing exactly what is actually saying yielding or Hey we could do the footer down

44

00:03:05.850  -->  00:03:08.130
here and I'll show you in a minute.

45

00:03:08.130  -->  00:03:08.700
So

46

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:18.460
let's go to let's say the contact page.

47

00:03:18.500  -->  00:03:20.780
All right.

48

00:03:22.620  -->  00:03:28.110
So this is the contact page right here.

49

00:03:28.110  -->  00:03:34.080
Let's just take all this age the male up and I'm going to say it stands on top here and I use another

50

00:03:34.080  -->  00:03:43.140
function and I'm going to extend the layouts that app and that say I don't have to type in the blade

51

00:03:43.250  -->  00:03:46.140
and the DOT BHB or I don't have to type that in.

52

00:03:46.170  -->  00:03:53.950
Now this is going to be extending is going to be including Basically this all this template right here

53

00:03:53.960  -->  00:03:54.030
.

54

00:03:54.120  -->  00:03:54.980
Everything.

55

00:03:55.530  -->  00:03:56.580
All right.

56

00:03:56.580  -->  00:04:07.080
So let's go back here and now in order for us to get this here whatever whatever is in between this

57

00:04:07.080  -->  00:04:10.300
container I'll show you in a minute.

58

00:04:10.830  -->  00:04:18.600
We have to use that other function call section and put the name that we put in these yield functionality

59

00:04:18.600  -->  00:04:23.460
right here which is content in that section here.

60

00:04:23.490  -->  00:04:25.500
So we can see content.

61

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:27.160
Now we have to close it all right.

62

00:04:27.390  -->  00:04:37.040
We keep saying we can say something like N.S. or we can't even say stop if we want it so like this.

63

00:04:37.160  -->  00:04:38.760
All right.

64

00:04:39.960  -->  00:04:42.870
Now this is a contact page right.

65

00:04:43.020  -->  00:04:48.640
So I could say something like contact page here.

66

00:04:48.690  -->  00:04:49.870
All right.

67

00:04:51.060  -->  00:05:00.620
Now let's copy this real quick and let's take it to the post page and paste it in there and do pull

68

00:05:00.630  -->  00:05:02.360
speech here.

69

00:05:03.120  -->  00:05:03.780
Right.

70

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:06.000
So now if we visit

71

00:05:11.850  -->  00:05:21.990
contact enter if we do view page source you can see that all of that is included in there.

72

00:05:21.990  -->  00:05:26.710
So why is the beauty of doing this is that we don't have all of them male.

73

00:05:26.940  -->  00:05:28.630
And each page is different.

74

00:05:28.820  -->  00:05:35.900
So just in case here let's say for example in this contact page I want to display in javascript right

75

00:05:35.910  -->  00:05:36.080
.

76

00:05:36.300  -->  00:05:38.220
I could say something like S..

77

00:05:38.280  -->  00:05:44.250
This is a section for the footer and stop here.

78

00:05:44.610  -->  00:05:47.960
I want this place in javascript so I'm going to write a script.

79

00:05:48.000  -->  00:05:50.250
I am going to say Alert

80

00:05:53.620  -->  00:05:58.920
Hello fizzer.

81

00:05:59.040  -->  00:06:03.600
Now let me go to the polls control here real quick.

82

00:06:03.660  -->  00:06:04.040
All right.

83

00:06:04.070  -->  00:06:06.060
I shall post

84

00:06:08.670  -->  00:06:12.630
so if I go to the contact page and typing in.

85

00:06:12.630  -->  00:06:17.640
Or you can see that I that I get is javascript but if I go to post

86

00:06:20.320  -->  00:06:32.120
all I have to type a variable is not going to work because we don't have that variable in there.

87

00:06:32.210  -->  00:06:33.610
All right.

88

00:06:34.020  -->  00:06:39.090
Post let's just put the variable in there and make it work

89

00:06:41.770  -->  00:06:45.000
and Id

90

00:06:47.780  -->  00:06:53.080
then we do the name and then we do the password right.

91

00:06:53.520  -->  00:06:57.120
Make sure that you put dollar symbols again.

92

00:06:57.120  -->  00:06:59.360
Blade is not going to do it for us.

93

00:06:59.490  -->  00:07:00.180
Right.

94

00:07:00.240  -->  00:07:03.170
So we've got to let Bley know that they are variables.

95

00:07:03.180  -->  00:07:06.660
All right so now we go back to it.

96

00:07:06.690  -->  00:07:09.210
We should be able to see that.

97

00:07:09.390  -->  00:07:13.780
All right post that is.

98

00:07:13.810  -->  00:07:15.360
And there we go.

99

00:07:15.390  -->  00:07:16.340
As you can see there.

100

00:07:16.350  -->  00:07:16.840
All right.

101

00:07:17.070  -->  00:07:23.550
So now you can see that we can only use where we need insert pages so if we need an alert and contact

102

00:07:23.550  -->  00:07:29.310
page we have it if we need a variables in the other page we don't have to include it.

103

00:07:29.670  -->  00:07:30.520
All right.

104

00:07:30.840  -->  00:07:36.330
So this is why Bley so useful in the next lecture I'm going to show you some more examples with Blaye

105

00:07:36.330  -->  00:07:37.800
that you are going to love.

106

00:07:37.800  -->  00:07:39.070
I can guarantee you that.

107

00:07:39.200  -->  00:07:44.120
And you can do create multiple layouts if you want to lay up for admin go ahead and do it right.

108

00:07:44.160  -->  00:07:46.380
Anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.

109

00:07:46.380  -->  00:07:49.120
Keep having some more fun guys.
