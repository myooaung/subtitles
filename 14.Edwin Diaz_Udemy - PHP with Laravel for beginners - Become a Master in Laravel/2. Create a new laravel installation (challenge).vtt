00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.480
All right welcome back many students I hope you had a lot of fun doing this by yourself.

2

00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:09.530
You probably have been doing this by yourself for a lot of lectures ago but that's OK.

3

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:10.100
All right.

4

00:00:10.230  -->  00:00:15.130
If for some reason you weren't able to do it go back and look at the lectures that I've done this and

5

00:00:15.130  -->  00:00:17.910
then refer to that and make sure that you do it correctly.

6

00:00:17.940  -->  00:00:18.300
All right.

7

00:00:18.320  -->  00:00:20.970
I'm not going to do it like I say I want you to do this.

8

00:00:20.970  -->  00:00:22.540
I want you to start doing this.

9

00:00:22.590  -->  00:00:28.950
So if you were sleeping or you were just watching me all the time now you're forced to make this happen

10

00:00:28.970  -->  00:00:29.050
.

11

00:00:29.100  -->  00:00:29.680
All right.

12

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:35.100
This is the name of the application you should have your database connection in place issue even be

13

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:43.750
open in your editor or Aiyer your DI EMV should be should have a database similar to this.

14

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:49.050
You should have migrated to the fold migrations.

15

00:00:49.050  -->  00:00:55.020
You sure have a user register and logged in already and you shall have it open right.

16

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:58.940
So just do this and come back to if you have not done so.

17

00:00:59.160  -->  00:01:01.600
Doing post a video and go do it right.

18

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:04.040
I'm forcing you to do this because I want you to learn.

19

00:01:04.130  -->  00:01:08.120
I don't want you to come here fall asleep and not learn anything.

20

00:01:08.110  -->  00:01:09.490
That doesn't make me successful.

21

00:01:09.490  -->  00:01:14.290
What makes me sucessful if my students are smart by doing the work that I give them.

22

00:01:14.290  -->  00:01:14.820
All right.

23

00:01:14.830  -->  00:01:17.970
Anyway let's talk a moment with us.

24

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:26.040
So now when we do this make us we we create a mirror where we we we don't create a made away is already

25

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:26.370
there.

26

00:01:26.370  -->  00:01:27.910
But let me show you.

27

00:01:28.470  -->  00:01:30.260
And this is something that you already know.

28

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:36.570
But if we go to the home controller remember that I told you that I was going to explain to you about

29

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:37.150
this.

30

00:01:37.190  -->  00:01:40.330
This is the middleware off I'm going to show you where they are.

31

00:01:40.370  -->  00:01:42.270
They are in kernel that BHB.

32

00:01:42.780  -->  00:01:43.450
OK.

33

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:44.310
And he's right here.

34

00:01:44.310  -->  00:01:45.230
You see that.

35

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:56.490
So basically this off is the name like the alias for this class authenticate class and this class is

36

00:01:57.260  -->  00:01:58.300
right here.

37

00:01:58.440  -->  00:01:59.580
See it.

38

00:01:59.610  -->  00:02:02.240
So we got the name space we got the whole path.

39

00:02:02.310  -->  00:02:04.310
HVD be aware out the gate.

40

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:06.870
That's what he is referring to.

41

00:02:06.870  -->  00:02:11.850
All right so every time we to use his middleware we refer to it by its name we could use the name space

42

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:14.320
if we wanted to the whole namespace but why.

43

00:02:14.340  -->  00:02:22.620
When we have this property here that allows us to access this key right here and referred refer to it

44

00:02:22.620  -->  00:02:24.970
by by the name right cool.

45

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:28.950
So what if we wanted to create our own made aware Well that's easy.

46

00:02:28.950  -->  00:02:31.260
You come here you create a new file.

47

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:37.550
You follow this convention uppercase camel case basically as you can see two words here encrypt and

48

00:02:37.550  -->  00:02:39.540
then and that's where these cookies.

49

00:02:39.540  -->  00:02:48.540
This is redirect if any has a camel case conventions so you follow that make sure that your motto wares

50

00:02:48.690  -->  00:02:51.650
have the name space on top.

51

00:02:51.650  -->  00:02:55.360
All right and you can use the Fuquay if you using it.

52

00:02:55.360  -->  00:02:57.090
All right nothing to say right.

53

00:02:57.090  -->  00:02:58.000
Super simple.

54

00:02:58.110  -->  00:02:59.050
OK.

55

00:02:59.070  -->  00:03:00.640
But I don't want to create it manually.

56

00:03:00.660  -->  00:03:06.170
You know we have already a command that does that for us so let's say I want to create a middle where

57

00:03:06.450  -->  00:03:12.950
they has to do were roles so that way we can only allow certain users to certain parts of our application

58

00:03:12.960  -->  00:03:13.860
so how we do this.

59

00:03:13.870  -->  00:03:23.410
Well we say Beechfield isn't make middle where in now you name your middleware role.

60

00:03:24.430  -->  00:03:27.060
Nowhere in this

61

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:32.220
answer has been created.

62

00:03:32.250  -->  00:03:38.270
Now if you go to your middleware you can see we're all made aware right here.

63

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:42.270
While are done for us.

64

00:03:42.310  -->  00:03:42.980
All right.

65

00:03:43.050  -->  00:03:46.370
So this is how simple it is to create a middleware.

66

00:03:46.380  -->  00:03:51.900
Now we're going to make this lecture very short because on the next lecture I'm going to show you how

67

00:03:51.900  -->  00:03:53.020
to use them.

68

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:53.820
OK.

69

00:03:54.090  -->  00:03:57.710
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
