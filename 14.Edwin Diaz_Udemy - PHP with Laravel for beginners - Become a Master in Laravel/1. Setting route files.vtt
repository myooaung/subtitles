00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.780
All right.

2

00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:02.940
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.970  -->  00:00:06.020
So what is the next step that we have here.

4

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:09.630
Well the next step is to create post-ride.

5

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:14.270
Right now we don't have that page though that's where we get a custom 404 page.

6

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:14.640
All right.

7

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:18.440
You can however let them actually make our custom page a little bit better real quick.

8

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:20.400
And that's why you can't miss a lecture.

9

00:00:20.430  -->  00:00:22.430
You see that I'm showing you something else.

10

00:00:22.440  -->  00:00:22.840
All right.

11

00:00:23.040  -->  00:00:28.050
So let's go to our errors for four Bage.

12

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:34.390
We're going to extend this to be like the home page.

13

00:00:34.410  -->  00:00:37.010
So they are words

14

00:00:40.340  -->  00:00:44.610
that this is section

15

00:00:48.550  -->  00:00:53.450
can do this.

16

00:00:54.750  -->  00:01:07.860
And here we can say we can get a little class of that center and we can say oops something like this

17

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:16.770
little page available and we can put the lingo back to where wherever you came from.

18

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:17.810
All right cool.

19

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:21.970
So for example if we try that again.

20

00:01:22.390  -->  00:01:22.820
Whoops.

21

00:01:22.850  -->  00:01:25.580
And no age of any white thing this looks a little better right.

22

00:01:26.010  -->  00:01:27.030
OK.

23

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:30.960
All right.

24

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:31.370
All right.

25

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:34.540
Let's go here.

26

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:40.200
All right so the next step for us is for you to get Polsce right to create Polsce.

27

00:01:40.200  -->  00:01:42.710
So let's go to AB.

28

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:45.620
We don't have a controller for it yet.

29

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:48.080
We don't have routes for it yet.

30

00:01:48.090  -->  00:01:49.510
So we need to create all that.

31

00:01:49.520  -->  00:01:49.880
All right.

32

00:01:49.880  -->  00:01:52.140
We don't have any models for it yet.

33

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:54.370
So let's start by defining the route.

34

00:01:54.390  -->  00:01:56.970
Let's go and do this real quick here.

35

00:01:57.360  -->  00:02:03.140
So the polls are going to be available for admin users for now.

36

00:02:03.150  -->  00:02:08.820
All right well admin is always going to be this is going to be out in force.

37

00:02:08.910  -->  00:02:11.450
So this is only going to be available for admen later on.

38

00:02:11.450  -->  00:02:15.700
We're going to make some posts available for authors or something like that.

39

00:02:15.750  -->  00:02:20.030
Hopefully later on in the application if we get to that.

40

00:02:20.040  -->  00:02:22.530
So this is going to be admin Polsce

41

00:02:25.670  -->  00:02:26.490
controller.

42

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:30.830
Let's go ahead and create I can show the real quick BHB admin.

43

00:02:30.870  -->  00:02:36.290
I mean areason make controller

44

00:02:39.090  -->  00:02:42.340
and we are in a creator with a resource.

45

00:02:42.420  -->  00:02:47.770
Let's name it admin pose controller.

46

00:02:48.720  -->  00:02:51.070
OK I'll just clear this out.

47

00:02:51.510  -->  00:02:53.770
I got to do my synchronizer Asian.

48

00:02:53.790  -->  00:02:55.050
You guys don't have to do that.

49

00:02:55.050  -->  00:02:57.250
Probably but I do.

50

00:02:58.410  -->  00:03:03.720
All right there we go.

51

00:03:04.290  -->  00:03:10.950
Make sure that you do your your good your version control good for your user section because your user

52

00:03:10.950  -->  00:03:11.910
section is working.

53

00:03:11.910  -->  00:03:14.500
Right guys.

54

00:03:14.550  -->  00:03:19.680
One thing that I want to do also here is that we should actually have some type of feature here where

55

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:25.980
we can click if you're logged in and you are an admin and you can do that yourself.

56

00:03:26.310  -->  00:03:30.180
You would display here a link where you can click on and go to admin.

57

00:03:30.210  -->  00:03:31.620
All right that's a super use for us.

58

00:03:31.630  -->  00:03:36.750
Yes you do that if you see a wrong in my application it's because I already did that.

59

00:03:36.860  -->  00:03:39.920
And you should know how to do that.

60

00:03:39.930  -->  00:03:40.530
All right.

61

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:44.420
Anyway let's create some links here so it takes us to where we need to go.

62

00:03:45.120  -->  00:03:49.540
But let's actually that's annoying.

63

00:03:50.880  -->  00:03:51.690
So routes.

64

00:03:51.690  -->  00:03:52.640
All right.

65

00:03:53.280  -->  00:03:55.500
We have the home controller right here.

66

00:03:55.900  -->  00:04:08.090
I mean the impulse controller let's just define this for a quick return you to Addleman that pulls and

67

00:04:08.130  -->  00:04:12.340
it's let's go there let's do that real quick.

68

00:04:12.350  -->  00:04:30.200
Ray buse man the pose this in its stance and layouts and you see how easy this starts getting.

69

00:04:30.420  -->  00:04:35.040
All right because it's going to be very similar stuff on what you've done before.

70

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:36.640
All right that's the beauty of doing it.

71

00:04:36.690  -->  00:04:38.720
Doing this with blade.

72

00:04:39.420  -->  00:04:40.250
All right.

73

00:04:40.980  -->  00:04:44.350
And pose.

74

00:04:44.400  -->  00:04:45.880
All right.

75

00:04:46.500  -->  00:04:52.190
So now if for some reason we go out in pools it should be available.

76

00:04:52.190  -->  00:04:53.200
There we go.

77

00:04:53.850  -->  00:04:54.190
OK.

78

00:04:54.210  -->  00:05:00.330
Let's actually fix this links here so that we can have that working.

79

00:05:00.720  -->  00:05:05.590
Let's go to layouts in Blaye.

80

00:05:07.080  -->  00:05:19.860
Let's go down to where he says spokes and we can add a row actually function the route and man that

81

00:05:20.080  -->  00:05:25.760
posts that it's cool.

82

00:05:25.790  -->  00:05:28.610
Same thing here.

83

00:05:28.730  -->  00:05:30.370
So route

84

00:05:37.800  -->  00:05:40.520
that create beautiful.

85

00:05:40.530  -->  00:05:50.410
All right let's go and do the same thing for create that we did for here and this should do that.

86

00:05:50.580  -->  00:05:50.970
And

87

00:05:54.130  -->  00:05:57.180
on it it was just going to say it's post

88

00:05:59.800  -->  00:06:03.960
and then create create post

89

00:06:08.440  -->  00:06:12.060
refresh whole posts create post.

90

00:06:12.150  -->  00:06:14.340
But we don't have any don't create pools.

91

00:06:14.640  -->  00:06:15.460
For some reason

92

00:06:21.070  -->  00:06:27.240
OK the reason why that's not working is because we haven't set it up here yet.

93

00:06:27.270  -->  00:06:31.820
So we're going to a lot of copy and pasting here and modify these a little.

94

00:06:32.240  -->  00:06:35.570
There we go create bowls.

95

00:06:35.610  -->  00:06:37.950
There we go working.

96

00:06:37.970  -->  00:06:39.720
All right so we go route's working.

97

00:06:39.720  -->  00:06:41.190
Our files are working.

98

00:06:41.280  -->  00:06:47.930
Now we've got to build the functionality behind the scenes right the database stuff.

99

00:06:48.210  -->  00:06:50.890
So we get to target that later.

100

00:06:51.060  -->  00:06:51.780
Take care.

101

00:06:51.780  -->  00:06:52.500
It was a pleasure.

102

00:06:52.530  -->  00:06:53.860
And hopefully you got this done.

103

00:06:53.850  -->  00:06:56.910
If not we watched the video super simple Bebai
