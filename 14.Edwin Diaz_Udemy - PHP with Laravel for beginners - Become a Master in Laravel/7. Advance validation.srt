00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,100
All right welcome back to the students on this lecture I'm going to show you how to create an advance

2

00:00:05,930  -->  00:00:14,130
validation and I'm also going to show you how to put all this cool the hear in little snippets so that

3

00:00:14,140  -->  00:00:18,570
we don't have to keep writing in writing and writing over and over and over again.

4

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:19,180
All right.

5

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:20,170
All right cool.

6

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:28,410
So right now as you know we are you know just using this value the function function idea right here

7

00:00:28,410  -->  00:00:34,620
just doing it manually but we could if we wanted to create a whole class and they inject that class

8

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:35,190
right here.

9

00:00:35,230  -->  00:00:37,130
The requests show you right now.

10

00:00:37,410  -->  00:00:45,540
So let's see BHB areason that's when you want to know what type of commands you one type have available

11

00:00:45,540  -->  00:00:45,690
.

12

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:52,050
So right now it's going to tell me that I can make all of this right here.

13

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:56,550
You see that in one of these is says requests and that's what we want.

14

00:00:56,550  -->  00:00:58,150
We want to make our requests.

15

00:00:58,230  -->  00:00:59,510
Pretty cool stuff right.

16

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:12,090
So we're going to say BHB areason make requests and we've got to give it a name create pose requests

17

00:01:12,110  -->  00:01:12,990
.

18

00:01:13,860  -->  00:01:15,870
Whoops there we go.

19

00:01:15,960  -->  00:01:16,560
Enter.

20

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:19,820
OK the request has been successfully created.

21

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:22,870
Oh it doesn't say that but it says requests create a successful.

22

00:01:22,920  -->  00:01:23,760
All right cool.

23

00:01:23,760  -->  00:01:25,200
So where is this class now.

24

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:27,350
Well we have our requests folder.

25

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:28,340
OK.

26

00:01:28,530  -->  00:01:38,580
And as you can see it's why not here because I haven't synchronized my folder so I'm just going to synchronize

27

00:01:38,580  -->  00:01:38,880
it.

28

00:01:38,950  -->  00:01:41,320
And while there we go.

29

00:01:41,370  -->  00:01:42,540
All right cool.

30

00:01:43,140  -->  00:01:52,940
So now we have this class here where we can authorize or not authorize this functionality for certain

31

00:01:53,730  -->  00:01:55,280
pieces of our application.

32

00:01:55,430  -->  00:02:04,080
OK right now I'm not going to worry about the rising or now rising because we've got to make this open

33

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:10,380
says we are not really creating something really advance here so I'm going to authorize to everybody

34

00:02:10,830  -->  00:02:12,960
to be able to use this.

35

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:14,720
All right.

36

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:15,660
All right.

37

00:02:15,660  -->  00:02:19,130
So just in case if you wanted to use this function for.

38

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:22,700
I don't know for just post then you were right there logic right here.

39

00:02:22,710  -->  00:02:24,780
But we are using this for everybody.

40

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:28,330
So that's where we're going to be putting that as true.

41

00:02:28,350  -->  00:02:33,240
And now this is where we type in the rules so we already have rules that we can use right.

42

00:02:33,480  -->  00:02:38,370
We have a tie on and we have the content if you want to but I say that's all you got to do here and

43

00:02:38,370  -->  00:02:44,940
now instead of using this requests we can use force requests.

44

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:46,810
We can say this.

45

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:51,510
Let's go and it's happening here.

46

00:02:51,510  -->  00:02:54,090
Create post requests.

47

00:02:54,090  -->  00:02:55,020
All right.

48

00:02:55,290  -->  00:03:01,830
So you can put the whole namespace like that but if you want to pull your mouse over the HP song help

49

00:03:01,830  -->  00:03:04,870
you import this all the way to the top.

50

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:06,160
OK.

51

00:03:06,480  -->  00:03:08,680
So this is how you were imported all the way to the top.

52

00:03:08,680  -->  00:03:10,620
You first put it where it is.

53

00:03:10,620  -->  00:03:14,200
This is a namespace app HTP requests.

54

00:03:14,820  -->  00:03:18,640
And then the name of that requests right here and the name of that class.

55

00:03:18,660  -->  00:03:22,500
So that way you can use it here and we use it as requests.

56

00:03:22,500  -->  00:03:31,590
Now if you go back to that let's see if I can find a window that we can use if we go back to see a mess

57

00:03:32,070  -->  00:03:34,270
create and we try to do this again.

58

00:03:34,410  -->  00:03:40,950
We still have the same functionality but there are differences that are actually as a matter of fact

59

00:03:40,950  -->  00:03:47,130
let's just take this off so that way you can see it working it's commented at our actually.

60

00:03:47,960  -->  00:03:49,220
Here we go.

61

00:03:50,080  -->  00:03:52,880
OK.

62

00:03:53,340  -->  00:03:57,840
And we go and try to do it actually went through.

63

00:03:58,530  -->  00:04:01,260
Let's go back here and see where in the world just happen

64

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:12,050
.

65

00:04:15,710  -->  00:04:21,990
All right let's go back to our fourth request here to our class actually.

66

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:25,660
Oh we forgot the require here.

67

00:04:26,070  -->  00:04:29,970
OK we need to do this required.

68

00:04:30,630  -->  00:04:32,070
OK.

69

00:04:32,070  -->  00:04:34,920
Now I'm going to go and do each job.

70

00:04:34,920  -->  00:04:35,430
All right.

71

00:04:35,530  -->  00:04:43,560
Enter And as you can see now it works OK I'm glad that I actually went now and change that here and

72

00:04:43,560  -->  00:04:52,070
took that off so that where you can see that we still needed to complete the key and values here.

73

00:04:52,080  -->  00:04:54,240
All right cool.

74

00:04:54,240  -->  00:04:54,640
All right.

75

00:04:54,690  -->  00:04:56,430
So there you have it.

76

00:04:56,520  -->  00:04:58,270
Advanced valuation guys.

77

00:04:58,320  -->  00:05:01,200
Oh and I forgot to show you the.

78

00:05:01,520  -->  00:05:04,620
And I was going to do then the next lecture because it's going to take me a couple of minutes to show

79

00:05:04,620  -->  00:05:09,210
you how we can create some snippets and that way you don't have to keep writing over and over again

80

00:05:09,300  -->  00:05:15,660
especially the form code which is a little complicated in the beginning even though you should practice

81

00:05:15,660  -->  00:05:15,690
.

82

00:05:15,690  -->  00:05:18,750
I'm going to show you a way to to have a shortcut.

83

00:05:18,810  -->  00:05:20,490
In writing this stuff over and over again.

84

00:05:20,490  -->  00:05:21,020
OK.

85

00:05:21,240  -->  00:05:24,930
Anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
