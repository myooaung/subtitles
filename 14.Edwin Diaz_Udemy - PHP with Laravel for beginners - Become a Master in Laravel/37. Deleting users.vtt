00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:05.460
All right welcome back to sort of the last lecture I told you that we were going to test this out to

2

00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:07.650
see if it's working I'm pretty sure it is working.

3

00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:10.130
But I wanted to just test it out a little bit for you guys.

4

00:00:10.140  -->  00:00:16.050
And also I did something here that you guys were watching and I just wanted I wanted you to be aware

5

00:00:16.050  -->  00:00:18.410
of I just add a little feature is not much.

6

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:23.100
I'm going to log in and let's see if it lets me log in with this one here.

7

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:24.090
All right cool.

8

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:27.930
So then what I did is I added this feature to our admin area.

9

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:34.520
Now if these users the admin is not going to log in but since this admin is going to log in.

10

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:35.350
All right.

11

00:00:35.490  -->  00:00:42.020
So if I go to my database real quick and my database information might be different from yours choose

12

00:00:42.050  -->  00:00:43.400
me.

13

00:00:43.470  -->  00:00:47.100
We can see that user Edwyn is a admin.

14

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:51.820
So that's why he's able to log in if we change him to number two.

15

00:00:52.080  -->  00:00:57.360
And that's how he was before I just changed it myself without looking at it.

16

00:00:57.360  -->  00:01:00.610
Of course if I refresh here it will log me now.

17

00:01:00.690  -->  00:01:03.380
It would not allow me to get into that section.

18

00:01:03.450  -->  00:01:07.590
It would not log me out but it would not allow me to go to admin right.

19

00:01:07.890  -->  00:01:09.720
So we know he's working.

20

00:01:10.590  -->  00:01:12.500
Let's go and change that again.

21

00:01:13.050  -->  00:01:14.060
Cool.

22

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:19.290
All right let's go back to our men and let me show you the change that I that I did and I'm going to

23

00:01:19.290  -->  00:01:21.350
leave that to you but I already did that.

24

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:26.810
I added this little I added the name here of the user logged in.

25

00:01:26.820  -->  00:01:29.030
You guys should know how to do that.

26

00:01:29.220  -->  00:01:32.390
I'm not even going to tell you or even give you a hint.

27

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:35.430
Well I'm going to give you a little hint right.

28

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:37.120
I'm not going to be that bad.

29

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:42.210
If you go to the logon page to the home page you can see that we have it right here.

30

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:47.640
All you have to do is put this code wherever it is into the admin section and remember that this is

31

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:51.270
being pulled by a Master Page guys.

32

00:01:51.270  -->  00:01:53.930
Gosh I almost told you how to do it.

33

00:01:54.340  -->  00:01:55.280
I didn't want to do that.

34

00:01:55.350  -->  00:01:56.560
I just couldn't hold my tongue.

35

00:01:56.610  -->  00:01:57.320
All right.

36

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:01.160
So all right so what is the next step for us to do here.

37

00:02:01.340  -->  00:02:01.620
All right.

38

00:02:01.620  -->  00:02:06.490
Let me actually tell you we are able to create users.

39

00:02:06.600  -->  00:02:07.690
Pretty cool stuff.

40

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:13.200
Ray we are able to enter as a matter of fact let's just try it out.

41

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:15.090
Real quick guys let's call.

42

00:02:15.150  -->  00:02:24.730
Let's actually make Rico and I already have an e-mail for Rico fleshes do.

43

00:02:25.080  -->  00:02:27.770
I don't know coding faculty.

44

00:02:27.900  -->  00:02:29.670
I got to get used to my own web site name.

45

00:02:29.670  -->  00:02:31.380
You know let's give it a roll link.

46

00:02:31.420  -->  00:02:33.790
Rick one administrator is always an administrator everywhere.

47

00:02:33.790  -->  00:02:34.800
Right guys.

48

00:02:34.800  -->  00:02:37.680
All right so let's make recal a very attractive guy.

49

00:02:37.730  -->  00:02:38.840
Right.

50

00:02:39.690  -->  00:02:41.350
There is no attractive people here.

51

00:02:41.350  -->  00:02:42.450
Guys there's no truck.

52

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:45.060
The guys Rico should be this guy right here.

53

00:02:45.060  -->  00:02:47.820
He's very attractive.

54

00:02:48.120  -->  00:02:48.740
All right.

55

00:02:48.820  -->  00:02:53.000
Let's go we create a recall.

56

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:57.960
As you can see we go now will we have a lot of guys with the same picture right.

57

00:02:58.070  -->  00:02:59.630
Oh yes.

58

00:02:59.840  -->  00:03:03.680
Or let these guys really famous or people like him.

59

00:03:03.700  -->  00:03:06.230
You know we got repeat images here.

60

00:03:06.240  -->  00:03:07.550
So we have to delete them.

61

00:03:07.590  -->  00:03:10.220
So that is going to be the next letter.

62

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:10.860
Right.

63

00:03:11.040  -->  00:03:13.530
As a matter of fact let's actually do it here.

64

00:03:13.530  -->  00:03:15.210
Super simple as.

65

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:16.410
Let's do it right now.

66

00:03:16.410  -->  00:03:16.650
All right.

67

00:03:16.650  -->  00:03:19.450
Let's go to the Owlman.

68

00:03:20.330  -->  00:03:24.090
I mean use this controller and we have the destroy method right here.

69

00:03:24.090  -->  00:03:25.070
Really cool stuff.

70

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:25.790
All right.

71

00:03:26.220  -->  00:03:26.510
All right.

72

00:03:26.520  -->  00:03:31.630
But before we do that let's actually create the form that is going to do this right.

73

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:36.230
We can't put a functionality right here on this site to delete it.

74

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:41.610
All we can do a multiple one a multiple one is actually the one that is going to require a couple of

75

00:03:41.610  -->  00:03:42.330
more lectures.

76

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:45.590
Right so we're not going to get into town till we finish.

77

00:03:45.630  -->  00:03:50.440
A lot of stuff in our in our application.

78

00:03:50.490  -->  00:03:53.850
Maybe we'll get into that in the next couple lectures.

79

00:03:53.850  -->  00:03:54.470
Who knows right.

80

00:03:54.500  -->  00:03:54.820
Who knows.

81

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:57.650
But I'm just letting you know I know it's going to take a couple of lectures.

82

00:03:57.670  -->  00:03:59.660
Is it going to take javascript for us to do that.

83

00:03:59.670  -->  00:04:06.810
But right now if we wanted to lead a user let's go here let's add a button right here to delete it.

84

00:04:06.870  -->  00:04:07.560
All right.

85

00:04:08.040  -->  00:04:13.440
So let's go to resources and then go to Edit

86

00:04:16.440  -->  00:04:17.580
users edit.

87

00:04:17.730  -->  00:04:18.460
All right.

88

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:23.230
So we've got a form right here and we got to create a forum with the lead method.

89

00:04:23.310  -->  00:04:28.130
I know I know that sounds weird but that's just the way it is.

90

00:04:28.140  -->  00:04:32.040
All right so that's the one there.

91

00:04:32.340  -->  00:04:37.160
As a matter of fact I'm going to make it so it is in the same form.

92

00:04:37.170  -->  00:04:38.770
Let's see how that goes.

93

00:04:38.910  -->  00:04:42.630
Created in the same space.

94

00:04:42.630  -->  00:04:45.150
So give us a forum open.

95

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:50.100
That's how I have it in my other I we go up and form.

96

00:04:50.220  -->  00:04:52.280
I don't have the here nor here.

97

00:04:52.300  -->  00:04:53.940
I think it is form.

98

00:04:54.240  -->  00:04:54.650
There we go.

99

00:04:54.650  -->  00:04:56.290
So we have a forum here.

100

00:04:56.300  -->  00:04:59.610
We are now make sure that the Met is delete.

101

00:04:59.850  -->  00:05:03.330
And here is destroy

102

00:05:07.650  -->  00:05:11.890
OK and we we're going to admin users controller

103

00:05:14.530  -->  00:05:16.540
and we don't mean this stuff

104

00:05:20.310  -->  00:05:20.820
delete

105

00:05:24.940  -->  00:05:26.640
user.

106

00:05:27.930  -->  00:05:33.590
OK let's make sure that this is danger.

107

00:05:33.670  -->  00:05:35.130
All right.

108

00:05:35.890  -->  00:05:37.480
OK.

109

00:05:38.160  -->  00:05:39.480
Minimize this a little bit.

110

00:05:39.490  -->  00:05:43.340
Well not minimize it but bring it down a little bit less refresh here.

111

00:05:43.900  -->  00:05:48.060
And of course we're missing a parameter because we are using the stroy.

112

00:05:48.460  -->  00:05:56.120
As you can see that you or I is has an ID so we need that here to work.

113

00:05:56.200  -->  00:06:00.920
So let's close this ng a.

114

00:06:03.850  -->  00:06:09.810
It's not just take it with a user ID.

115

00:06:09.810  -->  00:06:12.390
All right there we go

116

00:06:12.400  -->  00:06:18.700
.

117

00:06:18.750  -->  00:06:20.400
Come on enter.

118

00:06:20.410  -->  00:06:22.560
There we go.

119

00:06:22.560  -->  00:06:23.870
All right.

120

00:06:24.550  -->  00:06:25.840
That's cool.

121

00:06:25.840  -->  00:06:28.280
And let's make sure that we get something out of it right.

122

00:06:28.380  -->  00:06:30.870
And that it is working.

123

00:06:30.880  -->  00:06:42.480
So let's go to our users and this story right here let's return the strongly.

124

00:06:42.540  -->  00:06:46.830
There we go.

125

00:06:47.950  -->  00:06:50.440
Why it's working.

126

00:06:51.000  -->  00:06:57.670
Morais So let's find the user.

127

00:06:57.670  -->  00:07:02.620
As a matter of fact we don't need to do anything as set any variables.

128

00:07:02.830  -->  00:07:06.730
We can say use or find or fail.

129

00:07:06.730  -->  00:07:12.250
We're going to find the user with that I.D. and we're going to say I want you to delete this guy and

130

00:07:12.250  -->  00:07:13.290
will you delete him.

131

00:07:13.300  -->  00:07:16.770
I want you to redirect that there right there.

132

00:07:16.930  -->  00:07:19.810
Redirect to admin

133

00:07:22.780  -->  00:07:25.260
users.

134

00:07:26.350  -->  00:07:28.990
Oh right.

135

00:07:29.660  -->  00:07:37.310
Well one of the lead is one or I or Rico I mean actually we need to really one of these guys are literally

136

00:07:37.380  -->  00:07:38.160
recoil.

137

00:07:38.200  -->  00:07:40.110
No I don't want the leak or no.

138

00:07:40.120  -->  00:07:43.230
It's the lead on the lead.

139

00:07:43.670  -->  00:07:46.330
All right it's deleted but we forgot to return.

140

00:07:46.400  -->  00:07:54.180
If we go back you can see that John is not there anymore but need these needs to be returned.

141

00:07:54.580  -->  00:07:57.130
All right.

142

00:07:57.550  -->  00:08:03.770
All right do we have another other guy here let's give you another picture guys.

143

00:08:03.910  -->  00:08:05.010
All right.

144

00:08:05.800  -->  00:08:08.170
Poor guy.

145

00:08:08.170  -->  00:08:12.230
Of course images there's a recall.

146

00:08:12.230  -->  00:08:17.000
I think this guy looks like a recall Swaby right here.

147

00:08:17.920  -->  00:08:19.120
All right cool.

148

00:08:19.350  -->  00:08:21.040
That's ok I guess.

149

00:08:21.040  -->  00:08:24.380
All right.

150

00:08:24.610  -->  00:08:25.560
Right.

151

00:08:25.570  -->  00:08:29.320
Why don't we actually do something about this by an array.

152

00:08:29.350  -->  00:08:30.430
What can we do.

153

00:08:30.430  -->  00:08:35.160
We can actually pull this to the right and make it look ok.

154

00:08:35.980  -->  00:08:48.180
I guess if we do something like I don't know let's create a class here.

155

00:08:49.400  -->  00:08:52.610
Let's go back here.

156

00:08:52.810  -->  00:08:56.350
Let's see if we can actually create a class.

157

00:08:56.620  -->  00:08:59.570
Actually we could if we wanted to create a class.

158

00:08:59.800  -->  00:09:03.130
Yeah right here is fine and we'll say class

159

00:09:07.050  -->  00:09:12.330
pool right.

160

00:09:12.340  -->  00:09:12.650
All right.

161

00:09:12.660  -->  00:09:16.980
Let's see ups.

162

00:09:18.370  -->  00:09:20.310
Nope nope nope nope that's not.

163

00:09:20.320  -->  00:09:22.540
We don't need to do that actually.

164

00:09:23.110  -->  00:09:24.760
We don't need to create another array.

165

00:09:24.760  -->  00:09:26.170
We could do that.

166

00:09:26.530  -->  00:09:31.990
And as you can see right here what we need to come up with a way to actually make it so is here right

167

00:09:31.990  -->  00:09:35.130
now we try to inspect the real quick.

168

00:09:35.130  -->  00:09:42.720
We can see that the reason why it doesn't let it go up is because it takes this one takes the whole

169

00:09:42.730  -->  00:09:44.100
space.

170

00:09:44.130  -->  00:09:47.300
So we need to make down smaller somehow.

171

00:09:47.880  -->  00:09:49.160
All right.

172

00:09:49.300  -->  00:09:49.990
So

173

00:09:52.750  -->  00:09:53.950
I don't know let's.

174

00:09:54.460  -->  00:09:58.210
And we should actually take another lecture to do this right guys.

175

00:09:58.280  -->  00:10:05.710
We are taking from the their own lecture to do this.

176

00:10:06.280  -->  00:10:09.180
That's ok we can do it.

177

00:10:09.820  -->  00:10:11.240
All right.

178

00:10:12.420  -->  00:10:26.340
So this made here we can maybe give it another class of let's see call small sets.

179

00:10:26.560  -->  00:10:27.310
Let's try this.

180

00:10:27.310  -->  00:10:29.980
We're going to play around with it with a Basrah classes.

181

00:10:29.980  -->  00:10:32.080
I see how we can.

182

00:10:32.200  -->  00:10:33.620
As you can see now it works.

183

00:10:33.620  -->  00:10:43.450
Right now we can do this and that would make a really really cool to make two balloons like that.

184

00:10:43.450  -->  00:10:52.460
Let's actually create another class here to we sit as well.

185

00:10:52.480  -->  00:10:54.900
That's pretty cool.

186

00:10:54.900  -->  00:10:58.720
Let's do that refresh.

187

00:10:59.530  -->  00:11:00.850
Oh there you go.

188

00:11:00.850  -->  00:11:04.810
All right let's leave it like I think it is pretty cool if you want to make it smaller.

189

00:11:04.810  -->  00:11:06.080
You can.

190

00:11:06.250  -->  00:11:07.300
I just got a little idea.

191

00:11:07.310  -->  00:11:08.880
I think it looks pretty cool.

192

00:11:08.880  -->  00:11:10.470
All right cool.

193

00:11:10.480  -->  00:11:12.530
So I think we were good here guys.

194

00:11:12.580  -->  00:11:15.870
Thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next lecture
