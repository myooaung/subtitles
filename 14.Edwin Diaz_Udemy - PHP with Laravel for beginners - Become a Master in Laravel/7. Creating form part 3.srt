1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:00,690
All right.

2

00:00:00,690  -->  00:00:02,040
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:12,950
My student so we have our validations in place but we need to actually hook it up to our top posts or

4

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:19,790
create requests and we also need to display the errors below here somewhere.

5

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:20,460
OK.

6

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:25,650
So that's going to be our next challenge if you want to go ahead and positivity on and try to do that

7

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:26,900
yourself.

8

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:29,740
You are welcome to doing OK.

9

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:34,630
So let's go ahead and do that real quick.

10

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:41,520
We're going to say close create requests we can use it like this but we could if we wanted to employ

11

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:43,280
this on top.

12

00:00:43,290  -->  00:00:44,040
All right.

13

00:00:44,610  -->  00:00:53,760
And now what we got to do is we've got to go to the Form eight and include our form errors.

14

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:54,410
All right.

15

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:56,880
So let's go to our

16

00:00:59,580  -->  00:01:00,720
form here.

17

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:06,100
Actually let's do this let's divide this create a rule for it.

18

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:06,850
A quick

19

00:01:10,420  -->  00:01:15,510
array and create another rule here.

20

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:18,230
And we're going to see include.

21

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:20,250
And we're going to include the

22

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:29,040
Cluj dot for mirror.

23

00:01:29,390  -->  00:01:30,210
OK.

24

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:39,090
Let's go now to our create refresh to submit it and we can see all the errors right here.

25

00:01:39,290  -->  00:01:39,540
OK.

26

00:01:39,570  -->  00:01:43,220
You can modify this and get a different name if you want to.

27

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:49,890
That's the way we have it we have our category ID on top for two ID.

28

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:59,890
We should actually make this so that way it will be or for some type of category like that if you want

29

00:01:59,910  -->  00:02:02,340
you reorganize and you can live with the same way.

30

00:02:02,340  -->  00:02:03,950
Actually let's go and reorganize.

31

00:02:03,960  -->  00:02:05,620
Guys let's stop being lazy right.

32

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,660
If I don't do it you will not do it either.

33

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:09,130
All right.

34

00:02:09,150  -->  00:02:15,550
So let's go to our here.

35

00:02:15,720  -->  00:02:17,770
So what we want first is this title

36

00:02:21,270  -->  00:02:27,710
and the second would be category then for all and the body that's it.

37

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:34,100
Now I tell you I'm going to take that feature off I swear.

38

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:34,700
There we go.

39

00:02:34,720  -->  00:02:39,770
Title category photo and body.

40

00:02:39,780  -->  00:02:44,330
All right so we got our validations in place.

41

00:02:44,330  -->  00:02:46,550
Here we go.

42

00:02:47,970  -->  00:02:48,740
All right beautiful.

43

00:02:48,750  -->  00:02:51,840
So on the next thing that we got to work on.

44

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:52,270
All right.

45

00:02:52,290  -->  00:02:54,490
It's updating this information in the data.

46

00:02:54,510  -->  00:02:57,830
They start actually doing this right now.

47

00:02:58,330  -->  00:03:00,010
So impulse control are

48

00:03:04,000  -->  00:03:08,520
right in the way we're going to do this is a little bit different than what we have been doing in other

49

00:03:08,520  -->  00:03:11,600
lectures because this post has an owner.

50

00:03:11,660  -->  00:03:19,660
We could actually pulao the owner the use or that's love then and then update the relationship.

51

00:03:19,880  -->  00:03:20,200
All right.

52

00:03:20,220  -->  00:03:22,410
So we could do that because they are

53

00:03:25,870  -->  00:03:41,430
actually user user that there go and come here and now we can go ahead and say user posts and update

54

00:03:41,430  -->  00:03:42,570
it this way.

55

00:03:42,610  -->  00:03:45,410
All right on the next lecture I want to show you how to do this.

56

00:03:45,530  -->  00:03:49,160
What I want you to also think outside the box and try to do it yourself.

57

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:56,280
I want you to try to of they all these fields are right here with relationships right.

58

00:03:56,340  -->  00:03:58,880
Of course we don't have a relationship or category yet.

59

00:03:59,010  -->  00:04:06,360
So don't worry about down to worry about photo but try to actually update this pose and make sure that

60

00:04:06,360  -->  00:04:07,300
he belongs to the user.

61

00:04:07,290  -->  00:04:10,740
Try to do that and see what can you do.

62

00:04:10,740  -->  00:04:11,100
All right.

63

00:04:11,100  -->  00:04:13,150
You were never known to you try.

64

00:04:13,340  -->  00:04:15,160
I will see you in the next lecture will we.

65

00:04:15,170  -->  00:04:18,470
We are where we will compare our code and see.

66

00:04:18,480  -->  00:04:19,940
They are a match.

67

00:04:19,950  -->  00:04:20,330
Take care
