1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,740
All right welcome back with your students.

2

00:00:01,740  -->  00:00:07,300
So now that we know how to insert information into our database trying to learn how to pull it out.

3

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:07,810
All right.

4

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:09,980
So I want you to come in this hour real quick.

5

00:00:10,030  -->  00:00:14,310
I'm going to write this from scratch every single time I want you to get very used to writing this.

6

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:15,880
So ingrained in your brain.

7

00:00:15,880  -->  00:00:16,430
Right.

8

00:00:16,440  -->  00:00:27,270
So we're going to make a comment here when I call this database raw askew Aquarius and think this is

9

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:30,900
appropriate.

10

00:00:31,470  -->  00:00:32,860
There we go.

11

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:33,250
All right.

12

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:39,510
So let's write let's create a RAWI if you want to positively do unto yourself first do it and then you

13

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:40,790
can compare it with my code.

14

00:00:40,840  -->  00:00:43,790
See how it relates.

15

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:46,930
So we got to create the first parameter as a.

16

00:00:47,100  -->  00:00:49,800
You are that you are of course of this get method.

17

00:00:49,830  -->  00:00:53,230
Second problem is going to be what the function right.

18

00:00:53,500  -->  00:01:00,530
Parentheses one pair of parentheses one pair of curly brackets bring you down.

19

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:02,870
Use a DB class Array.

20

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:11,100
And we're going to say select first parameter is going to be what we select.

21

00:01:11,750  -->  00:01:14,120
And you can use a single Tessie's the single quotes.

22

00:01:14,220  -->  00:01:16,240
That's how we have it and there's the command Tayshaun.

23

00:01:16,290  -->  00:01:25,490
So we get to select everything from where from polls our table right where Id equals.

24

00:01:26,510  -->  00:01:28,330
OK.

25

00:01:28,410  -->  00:01:36,270
Second parameter we're going to bind this question mark with this value right here.

26

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:36,840
That's all we're doing.

27

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:41,980
Remember this is a type of a real way right now.

28

00:01:42,330  -->  00:01:43,970
So we're selecting this.

29

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:48,570
And now we can actually save those rissoles here in a variable.

30

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:54,000
Now this is going to return an array of results.

31

00:01:54,000  -->  00:01:54,850
All right.

32

00:01:55,170  -->  00:01:56,720
This results come in.

33

00:01:56,720  -->  00:01:59,550
A s t d.

34

00:01:59,550  -->  00:02:06,000
All right class object meaning that whatever is coming from there whatever resource we get from there

35

00:02:06,000  -->  00:02:08,490
it comes in a generic empty class.

36

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:13,560
So that mean we can add them like properties of an object like dynamic properties.

37

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:20,100
All right so all we can access them like is results whatever.

38

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:23,650
This results like this.

39

00:02:24,340  -->  00:02:24,930
OK.

40

00:02:25,140  -->  00:02:29,550
But because it is an array we need to look the way right.

41

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:30,030
Right.

42

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:34,170
So I want you to post a video and try to do that yourself.

43

00:02:34,320  -->  00:02:40,560
Look to these results and come out with that title and return it.

44

00:02:40,710  -->  00:02:45,730
Do that and I'll do that in a in one second.

45

00:02:45,870  -->  00:02:47,520
I hope you're able to do it right.

46

00:02:47,520  -->  00:02:52,650
So I just paused a really like for I don't know how many seconds were in your psi and probably like

47

00:02:52,800  -->  00:02:53,650
less than a second.

48

00:02:53,670  -->  00:02:57,980
But anyway so let's use the for each.

49

00:02:58,470  -->  00:03:07,640
And let's look through it and we like this results as result.

50

00:03:07,660  -->  00:03:09,020
All right.

51

00:03:09,840  -->  00:03:19,230
Or we can make it better we can say we saw US post or this make it more semantic and we can return

52

00:03:21,510  -->  00:03:24,680
post title.

53

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:25,410
There we go.

54

00:03:25,410  -->  00:03:29,370
Now let's go to the browser and let's check it out real quick.

55

00:03:29,370  -->  00:03:32,900
For the last read enter.

56

00:03:32,970  -->  00:03:33,530
There you go.

57

00:03:33,570  -->  00:03:39,690
They will get the title out of it and you can do that with the other column name content or whatever

58

00:03:39,810  -->  00:03:42,510
other column you have in your record.

59

00:03:42,630  -->  00:03:43,150
OK.

60

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:44,730
So as you can see this returns.

61

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:49,920
And now if I come in this hour in I returned.

62

00:03:50,430  -->  00:03:52,830
This guy here.

63

00:03:55,020  -->  00:03:56,580
You see what we're getting the browser.

64

00:03:56,580  -->  00:04:00,980
We get this array of object an object right.

65

00:04:01,740  -->  00:04:04,440
You see the square brackets at the end.

66

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:11,210
And then the curly brackets indicate it is an object is in an empty class that we king Xs properties

67

00:04:11,910  -->  00:04:13,570
just like we do in an object right.

68

00:04:13,580  -->  00:04:15,000
Look at that.

69

00:04:15,260  -->  00:04:20,520
Is separated by the call and that's when you find out that this is related to an object.

70

00:04:21,000  -->  00:04:21,730
OK.

71

00:04:22,080  -->  00:04:24,670
Now you can also do var dumb.

72

00:04:24,690  -->  00:04:32,030
All right so you're going to ward them and do all results.

73

00:04:32,380  -->  00:04:38,870
OK answer and you can see clearly what it is.

74

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:48,590
All right you see array 1 and then each key 0 he has an object and then it is on to the class even with

75

00:04:48,590  -->  00:04:57,330
a number 1 16 and now it starts having the ID and that title is a string 16 characters and so on and

76

00:04:57,330  -->  00:04:58,650
so on and so on.

77

00:04:58,650  -->  00:04:59,710
All right.

78

00:04:59,850  -->  00:05:02,870
So anyway thank you so much.

79

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:06,300
Ladies and gentlemen and I'll see you in at the lecture
