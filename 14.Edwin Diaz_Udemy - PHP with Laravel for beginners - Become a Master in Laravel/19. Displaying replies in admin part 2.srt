1

00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:08,130
All right welcome back I'm a student so we had our application here taking a lot more form than what

2

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:10,980
it was in the beginning.

3

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:12,660
We have our comments here.

4

00:00:12,660  -->  00:00:16,670
We can view the polls where we can actually view their replies here.

5

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:21,030
So let's put a link right here so that we can see the replies of this comment.

6

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:22,990
Here we still have to complete.

7

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:23,970
All right.

8

00:00:24,030  -->  00:00:29,260
Our replies shil page.

9

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:29,960
All right.

10

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:31,680
I don't think he's 100 percent yet.

11

00:00:31,680  -->  00:00:33,590
We'll find out.

12

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:36,060
But right now

13

00:00:39,240  -->  00:00:44,860
he has to end it here for their replies.

14

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:53,460
But I think it's better that we would do it in the show.

15

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:53,910
All right.

16

00:00:53,910  -->  00:00:56,510
Actually the in the test not in there is just a show.

17

00:00:56,580  -->  00:00:57,680
OK.

18

00:00:57,750  -->  00:01:00,980
All right do we have the end it's all right.

19

00:01:01,300  -->  00:01:02,090
Cool.

20

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:09,690
So let's go to comment and it's in here let's put it and make sure link here to see.

21

00:01:09,760  -->  00:01:14,700
And that's what we're going to put out after you pause to see the replies and then we take it from there

22

00:01:14,700  -->  00:01:14,720
.

23

00:01:14,720  -->  00:01:15,490
OK.

24

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:22,470
So this is going to be after the view polls and this is it right here.

25

00:01:22,550  -->  00:01:28,340
Let's just say link route.

26

00:01:29,430  -->  00:01:30,240
And

27

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:33,870
if I remember correctly.

28

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:35,750
Add in that

29

00:01:39,330  -->  00:01:41,790
let's go back and just verify that

30

00:01:44,590  -->  00:01:48,560
men come and replies.

31

00:01:49,950  -->  00:01:51,030
All right.

32

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:52,240
So

33

00:01:56,640  -->  00:02:03,480
let's go back here again to our show to end it ng comments.

34

00:02:03,480  -->  00:02:04,460
OK.

35

00:02:04,950  -->  00:02:07,070
Let's put this guy right here we lose him.

36

00:02:07,200  -->  00:02:11,850
The guy is the reason why not doing shortcuts with BHP storm here because I can do this and look for

37

00:02:11,850  -->  00:02:16,840
the class because I know some of you have not said set that up yet so I don't want to leave you behind

38

00:02:16,840  -->  00:02:16,860
.

39

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:17,550
OK.

40

00:02:18,030  -->  00:02:23,130
But that would be nice for you to set that up that way you can look for the files instead of you know

41

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:27,110
search for the files instead of going all over the place.

42

00:02:27,120  -->  00:02:28,910
And I do this when iMac was shift.

43

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:29,590
OK.

44

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:30,890
A tab on the sheet.

45

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:36,630
Click it twice so I know for Windows I think I had a Windows machine.

46

00:02:36,630  -->  00:02:37,990
I tried it doesn't work.

47

00:02:38,010  -->  00:02:41,120
You have to look for that short keyboard shortcut.

48

00:02:41,250  -->  00:02:48,990
All right admen comments replies that show.

49

00:02:49,620  -->  00:02:50,350
I think yes

50

00:02:54,400  -->  00:02:55,680
it's one.

51

00:02:56,100  -->  00:03:03,230
And then we have to take in the comment ID.

52

00:03:04,830  -->  00:03:10,050
Because we have to find the comment and then from there we find the replies.

53

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:12,300
All right let's close this a little bit.

54

00:03:12,330  -->  00:03:15,270
Actually let's look at this one more time.

55

00:03:15,370  -->  00:03:19,380
He has one of those who have a Nesse.

56

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:20,610
All right.

57

00:03:22,200  -->  00:03:34,110
So right here and let's call that few replies.

58

00:03:34,230  -->  00:03:36,720
Look at it real quick.

59

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:40,240
All right.

60

00:03:41,930  -->  00:03:43,830
And let's go and work on it

61

00:03:53,990  -->  00:04:00,120
and let's return something just to make sure that it is working.

62

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:02,840
And let's put this boy right here.

63

00:04:03,020  -->  00:04:06,830
Return it works.

64

00:04:07,830  -->  00:04:08,460
OK.

65

00:04:08,510  -->  00:04:11,520
Let's see.

66

00:04:11,520  -->  00:04:12,180
All right.

67

00:04:12,540  -->  00:04:17,840
It's working.

68

00:04:17,840  -->  00:04:19,030
All right so how are we going to do this.

69

00:04:19,030  -->  00:04:21,820
Well we first have to find the comment right.

70

00:04:22,530  -->  00:04:29,050
So we find the comment that's all we get and we get in the coming ID or fail

71

00:04:34,440  -->  00:04:37,710
and then we find its relationship.

72

00:04:37,710  -->  00:04:47,040
So for that we're going to call replies and when I say comment replies and we're going to return the

73

00:04:47,040  -->  00:04:47,640
view

74

00:04:50,580  -->  00:05:02,670
men that comment that replies that show us a long compact

75

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:12,300
and replies do do do.

76

00:05:12,450  -->  00:05:14,310
All righty.

77

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:15,750
All right.

78

00:05:15,910  -->  00:05:17,890
Less tested less debug it.

79

00:05:18,060  -->  00:05:21,470
Cool.

80

00:05:21,470  -->  00:05:25,540
All right class controller common not found and come in replies.

81

00:05:25,560  -->  00:05:26,400
Eighty nine

82

00:05:29,560  -->  00:05:34,970
men sure enough found.

83

00:05:34,980  -->  00:05:36,010
All right.

84

00:05:36,370  -->  00:05:38,880
Let's check those routes again.

85

00:05:38,950  -->  00:05:43,630
Men come in replies.

86

00:05:43,650  -->  00:05:45,300
Men come and replies.

87

00:05:45,300  -->  00:05:49,970
Let's check our BHP route

88

00:05:53,440  -->  00:05:56,280
.

89

00:05:56,730  -->  00:06:03,830
This was even my editors taking notes freezing me one too.

90

00:06:03,840  -->  00:06:04,500
There we go

91

00:06:04,500  -->  00:06:13,460
.

92

00:06:15,030  -->  00:06:19,200
I don't know about you but it's playing games with me

93

00:06:22,050  -->  00:06:23,200
or I'm misspelling

94

00:06:23,600  -->  00:06:28,620
.

95

00:06:40,110  -->  00:06:49,290
The show admin come in reply show and called me replies Oh and that's I'm doing and it's what am I doing

96

00:06:49,310  -->  00:06:50,900
.

97

00:06:52,580  -->  00:06:54,040
All right let's check in again.

98

00:06:54,040  -->  00:06:54,900
Let's do this

99

00:07:01,580  -->  00:07:05,820
all ties these guys

100

00:07:11,190  -->  00:07:19,370
.

101

00:07:19,370  -->  00:07:21,310
That's OK.

102

00:07:22,440  -->  00:07:24,910
You are either we're looking for.

103

00:07:24,990  -->  00:07:27,970
Remember that with an s.

104

00:07:28,080  -->  00:07:30,740
And then on the fine very well and that's OK.

105

00:07:31,080  -->  00:07:33,420
We'll fix that in the show.

106

00:07:34,110  -->  00:07:34,800
So

107

00:07:37,680  -->  00:07:40,020
I was actually copying the wrong thing guys.

108

00:07:40,020  -->  00:07:46,320
I was called Beyond name route instead of copying the from here.

109

00:07:46,470  -->  00:07:48,230
So recopying they you or I.

110

00:07:48,660  -->  00:07:50,050
All right.

111

00:07:50,880  -->  00:07:51,120
All right.

112

00:07:51,120  -->  00:07:55,620
So we have in the show let's go to the show area

113

00:07:55,620  -->  00:08:08,610
.

114

00:08:08,610  -->  00:08:12,580
There we go.

115

00:08:13,110  -->  00:08:17,690
We have a common day is not defined.

116

00:08:18,660  -->  00:08:23,420
And he's on line eighty nine.

117

00:08:23,760  -->  00:08:24,740
So

118

00:08:28,370  -->  00:08:30,810
could it be this little guy right here.

119

00:08:31,080  -->  00:08:33,040
Maybe they would miss him.

120

00:08:33,510  -->  00:08:35,870
Yeah we missed him.

121

00:08:35,880  -->  00:08:37,890
All right cool.

122

00:08:37,890  -->  00:08:38,960
There we go.

123

00:08:39,000  -->  00:08:40,230
We got it working.

124

00:08:41,100  -->  00:08:45,830
And of course that's not working yet but you get my point.

125

00:08:45,840  -->  00:08:46,400
All right.

126

00:08:46,410  -->  00:08:52,190
So we're are seeing the replies on the next lecture we're going to work on the update and the lead and

127

00:08:52,220  -->  00:08:55,680
all that and Apple and all everything we got to work on here.

128

00:08:55,680  -->  00:08:57,200
