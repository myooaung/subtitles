00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:05.140
All right welcome back I'm a student so I'm just seeing a little booboo here.

2

00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:07.540
But that's OK.

3

00:00:08.140  -->  00:00:13.790
On this lecture by the way we are going to be actually creating the own approved and approved by in

4

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:14.700
the lead of all that.

5

00:00:14.740  -->  00:00:17.610
And we're going to try to get this done in this lecture.

6

00:00:17.610  -->  00:00:18.210
All right.

7

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:25.170
So if you have things to do make sure that you plan them for 10 or 15 minutes after because this video

8

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:28.700
is going to take all these lectures is going to take a couple of minutes to do OK.

9

00:00:28.710  -->  00:00:29.620
All right cool.

10

00:00:29.670  -->  00:00:30.980
Let's get it done.

11

00:00:31.050  -->  00:00:35.030
Let's go to that comment.

12

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:36.680
We are actually there.

13

00:00:37.170  -->  00:00:39.320
And this is functionality right here.

14

00:00:39.360  -->  00:00:45.750
So right at the end we can date if we want later on but I want some space for this or approve or not

15

00:00:45.750  -->  00:00:48.750
approve by ends here.

16

00:00:49.350  -->  00:00:51.160
And this is where I'm going to do it.

17

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:51.690
All right.

18

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:52.490
OK.

19

00:00:53.040  -->  00:00:54.460
So we have the comment.

20

00:00:54.550  -->  00:01:03.020
We have to do is create some type of a condition here and say if that coming is active.

21

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:04.470
All right.

22

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:06.720
That means we have to walk.

23

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:15.210
If he's active we can approve it but we say end if here first.

24

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:18.710
All right.

25

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:24.300
But actually we just have to make sure it's like this here

26

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:30.210
.

27

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:31.420
All right.

28

00:01:31.890  -->  00:01:34.510
Let's create a form real quick.

29

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:37.800
Actually we don't have to create it from scratch.

30

00:01:38.910  -->  00:01:40.100
We go.

31

00:01:41.580  -->  00:01:55.690
And this is going to go to those comments controller and that post his post.

32

00:01:56.520  -->  00:01:57.970
I remember that now.

33

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:01.140
And we're going to take this to the update method

34

00:02:04.800  -->  00:02:08.900
and we are going to be needing an array here.

35

00:02:08.910  -->  00:02:14.130
So let's just put that right away.

36

00:02:16.880  -->  00:02:17.310
OK.

37

00:02:17.340  -->  00:02:20.350
Let's enclose that in the curly brackets.

38

00:02:20.350  -->  00:02:25.940
I mean square brackets and let's change the method to patch.

39

00:02:27.180  -->  00:02:31.520
And we're not going to be sending a tie.

40

00:02:31.530  -->  00:02:33.480
We're not going to be sending anything except

41

00:02:37.770  -->  00:02:42.420
some type of input hitting input.

42

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:42.900
All right.

43

00:02:42.900  -->  00:02:44.210
We're of value.

44

00:02:44.250  -->  00:02:48.300
So is active

45

00:02:51.720  -->  00:02:54.320
and the value.

46

00:02:54.810  -->  00:03:02.520
So if it's active We're going to make sure there is not that we send a on a pool of value.

47

00:03:02.600  -->  00:03:04.100
And that would be zero.

48

00:03:04.680  -->  00:03:05.780
All right.

49

00:03:06.360  -->  00:03:08.460
We could do an else statement here real quick

50

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:20.160
and we can just copy this form right here.

51

00:03:21.390  -->  00:03:29.640
But let's just make sure that we say something like on a pool

52

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:35.610
something like that.

53

00:03:35.730  -->  00:03:36.540
And

54

00:03:39.150  -->  00:03:43.920
that looks good there.

55

00:03:44.340  -->  00:03:47.930
This one the value would be one.

56

00:03:47.990  -->  00:03:53.360
Let's check it to see if it works.

57

00:03:53.390  -->  00:03:54.730
All right.

58

00:03:55.420  -->  00:04:00.050
Folks enter as you can see as on the proof here.

59

00:04:00.330  -->  00:04:02.960
And this was cute says cripple's.

60

00:04:03.360  -->  00:04:07.350
We've got to make sure that these answers are approved for something

61

00:04:11.290  -->  00:04:16.080
proof.

62

00:04:16.080  -->  00:04:18.270
All right.

63

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:21.980
Why don't we check the caller on this right.

64

00:04:23.640  -->  00:04:24.630
This will be green.

65

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:28.780
This was actually red or something my dad.

66

00:04:29.220  -->  00:04:32.220
So no proof

67

00:04:35.370  -->  00:04:37.970
or proof.

68

00:04:39.680  -->  00:04:41.790
Yeah I agree and there's no proof Green.

69

00:04:41.850  -->  00:04:46.130
Actually you guys can make it any color you want.

70

00:04:46.140  -->  00:04:54.590
I'm just suggesting here and this one is just going to make a weird color of Imphal.

71

00:04:54.830  -->  00:04:56.760
All right there we go.

72

00:04:56.760  -->  00:04:58.350
I didn't realize that it was good.

73

00:04:58.350  -->  00:04:59.140
Right.

74

00:04:59.640  -->  00:05:02.280
Let's create the lead form to

75

00:05:05.210  -->  00:05:07.030
copy that.

76

00:05:08.520  -->  00:05:10.500
And that's going to be right below here

77

00:05:17.320  -->  00:05:19.140
is our the lead

78

00:05:30.030  -->  00:05:31.040
destroy actually.

79

00:05:31.070  -->  00:05:31.870
Whoops.

80

00:05:32.370  -->  00:05:42.720
So many frameworks so many different names and that's for that.

81

00:05:44.860  -->  00:05:53.440
The lead makes sure there is danger here.

82

00:05:57.450  -->  00:05:58.140
Cool.

83

00:05:58.140  -->  00:06:00.140
Starting to look a little better.

84

00:06:00.150  -->  00:06:02.890
All right we have a couple of more things to do.

85

00:06:03.060  -->  00:06:10.400
We're going to finish a controllers in the next lecture of the controller and the lead or destroy the

86

00:06:10.770  -->  00:06:13.480
of the metal end of the short method and the next lecture.

87

00:06:13.530  -->  00:06:16.790
Take care guys as being a pleasure See you in the next lecture.
