00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.860
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.860  -->  00:00:04.200
So I am in the post controller.

3

00:00:04.200  -->  00:00:06.020
We're going to be using this file post control.

4

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:08.470
We're going to be using and it's OK for this lecture.

5

00:00:08.590  -->  00:00:13.350
We're going to be learning about Querrey scopes and you can find out more into the communication if

6

00:00:13.470  -->  00:00:15.790
after this lecture is not clearer to you.

7

00:00:15.930  -->  00:00:24.480
Basically what we call where scope's allow us to kind of create shortcuts for really complex operations

8

00:00:24.490  -->  00:00:24.770
.

9

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:28.370
Let me show you what I mean with shortcuts.

10

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:28.840
OK.

11

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:36.510
And the way I like to explain is that we can have a Laubach of really complex piece of cold here that

12

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:44.040
requires a lot of lines and we can convert that into a small function then use that in our controller

13

00:00:44.060  -->  00:00:44.200
.

14

00:00:44.340  -->  00:00:45.120
OK.

15

00:00:45.450  -->  00:00:47.940
And we'll be working with the model.

16

00:00:48.000  -->  00:00:49.140
As a matter of fact OK.

17

00:00:49.260  -->  00:00:56.200
So let's say lxi right now this functionality in that is right in the fool's controller.

18

00:00:56.260  -->  00:01:00.720
This functionality is displaying this bull's eye here right.

19

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:08.110
If we wanted to let's say display the latest polls Larabee has a really cool functionality.

20

00:01:08.220  -->  00:01:14.190
What we say latest but we need to type in to get to get that collection so that way we can look to it

21

00:01:14.190  -->  00:01:14.750
right.

22

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:18.660
So we can this is the latest on top.

23

00:01:18.720  -->  00:01:22.690
So really cool stuff right.

24

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:27.790
We can also do this we can say order.

25

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:28.940
This is a long way.

26

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:34.890
Order by id descending.

27

00:01:35.130  -->  00:01:36.380
Right.

28

00:01:37.050  -->  00:01:44.080
And we just get the requests you get again to get that collection.

29

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:50.520
And then we should see a change here because it's the same thing right now if we do ascending it would

30

00:01:50.530  -->  00:01:56.700
show us the oldest first right sending and we go back and we refresh.

31

00:01:56.700  -->  00:01:58.380
All right cool.

32

00:01:58.380  -->  00:01:59.300
All right so we know that.

33

00:01:59.310  -->  00:02:02.170
But this is just a very small sample.

34

00:02:02.220  -->  00:02:08.550
If we had a big line here like a lot of code here this would really look really ugly right.

35

00:02:08.580  -->  00:02:09.740
It would not be nice.

36

00:02:09.750  -->  00:02:13.170
So we work we schools where we can do is we can minimize that.

37

00:02:13.240  -->  00:02:21.180
Why are we going to do is I'm going on to I'm going to take this out command and control it and just

38

00:02:21.180  -->  00:02:22.470
going to leave it like this for now.

39

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:25.500
And I have it in my clipboard OK.

40

00:02:25.930  -->  00:02:28.390
And that's basically my mouse memory right.

41

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:32.520
My computer memory that way I can paste it again that's what I mean with clipboard.

42

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:37.470
But anyway you guys know that I'm going to go to the pulse controller here and I'm going to create a

43

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:38.900
square with scope.

44

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:41.070
So what we're going to do is we're going to see a public

45

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:46.620
static function.

46

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:48.450
And this is the convention.

47

00:02:48.450  -->  00:02:48.870
OK.

48

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:54.320
The first thing that you use is the word scope and then whatever name you want to give it.

49

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:57.350
All right we've got to call ours the latest.

50

00:02:57.380  -->  00:02:58.670
I'm going to use camel case.

51

00:02:58.710  -->  00:03:01.090
That's the way the convention.

52

00:03:01.120  -->  00:03:02.220
All right.

53

00:03:02.380  -->  00:03:04.360
You create your scope.

54

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:07.190
So if you're Kosko was name.

55

00:03:08.070  -->  00:03:14.660
As a column you would put add a column because you will have to put everything in camel case every word

56

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:15.710
separate it right.

57

00:03:15.900  -->  00:03:22.340
So scope latest and I'm going to do a Querrey here.

58

00:03:22.830  -->  00:03:26.470
Let's make sure we have a T here now.

59

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:27.930
BHB storm is happy.

60

00:03:28.110  -->  00:03:29.180
Ok cool.

61

00:03:29.190  -->  00:03:35.560
So here I'm going to piece that call that I had in my clipboard that I have and I'm going to do.

62

00:03:35.610  -->  00:03:40.130
I'm going to take the Querrey and I do it like this.

63

00:03:40.170  -->  00:03:42.960
Now what I want to do is return it.

64

00:03:42.990  -->  00:03:46.870
Now let's just go back here and see that this is not working right now.

65

00:03:47.130  -->  00:03:48.300
OK.

66

00:03:48.300  -->  00:03:52.070
So I refresh that if I go to Paul's controller which is not working right.

67

00:03:52.380  -->  00:03:57.270
Let's go back here to for post.

68

00:03:57.300  -->  00:04:03.900
All right so when I returned this squares scope and let's go back to Apple's controller in here I'm

69

00:04:03.900  -->  00:04:09.510
going to find I'm going can actually call my static method.

70

00:04:09.840  -->  00:04:11.300
Watch this.

71

00:04:11.340  -->  00:04:13.770
Let's go back enter.

72

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:17.380
And as you can see look at this.

73

00:04:17.430  -->  00:04:19.440
It's working beautifully.

74

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:20.060
All right.

75

00:04:20.220  -->  00:04:26.520
So you see we made a really you know it wasn't a really complex piece of code but it was we clean that

76

00:04:26.520  -->  00:04:27.210
up a little bit.

77

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:31.630
You see that now remember the Meribel has one that works like this with a get.

78

00:04:31.650  -->  00:04:34.130
So OK.

79

00:04:34.410  -->  00:04:35.810
We also do that.

80

00:04:36.060  -->  00:04:43.580
But of course it's not working because we have a it's called there and it doesn't work like this.

81

00:04:44.250  -->  00:04:53.070
But anyway so now you see how we can make it very complex called super easy work with quite scopes.

82

00:04:53.070  -->  00:04:59.640
All right so you can minimize the line of code and your controllers very easily by doing this method

83

00:04:59.670  -->  00:04:59.720
.

84

00:04:59.730  -->  00:05:00.190
OK.

85

00:05:00.270  -->  00:05:01.430
Techniques.

86

00:05:01.500  -->  00:05:08.820
Anyway I hope this was you know something that you learned from that that you liked and you like more

87

00:05:08.880  -->  00:05:15.000
to find the if you want to find out more about where was Kolbe's because we just basically learn the

88

00:05:15.000  -->  00:05:21.270
tip of the iceberg here with goes you can there's a lot more to it but I wanted to introduce you to

89

00:05:21.270  -->  00:05:21.410
it.

90

00:05:21.450  -->  00:05:21.900
OK.

91

00:05:21.930  -->  00:05:26.010
Just in case you want to dig deeper into this.

92

00:05:26.010  -->  00:05:30.720
So anyway if you are happy with this and you want to find out more go to the mentation go to the next

93

00:05:30.720  -->  00:05:31.970
lecture or whatever you want to do.

94

00:05:32.010  -->  00:05:35.020
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures
