00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.540
All right.

2

00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:02.250
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:06.990
So now that we have our validations in place we can submit anything here.

4

00:00:07.420  -->  00:00:10.550
It gets redirected it's time for us to display the arrows right.

5

00:00:10.710  -->  00:00:14.920
I think it's a good place for us to do that.

6

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:20.740
So let's go here to our create form and users and let's start doing this.

7

00:00:20.790  -->  00:00:27.930
So now we don't want to display errors unless they are available to us and we know that they are available

8

00:00:27.930  -->  00:00:29.420
to us globally right.

9

00:00:29.740  -->  00:00:30.700
OK.

10

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:38.200
So let's just make sure that we have any errors so let's do a count here.

11

00:00:38.280  -->  00:00:41.990
These are native predefined function from BHB count.

12

00:00:42.080  -->  00:00:43.380
You action already.

13

00:00:43.740  -->  00:00:46.590
If the errors has something right.

14

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:53.400
If it's bigger than zero we have something and we're going to display it.

15

00:00:53.490  -->  00:00:54.400
All right.

16

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:57.210
So what I want to do is create a diff.

17

00:00:57.300  -->  00:01:01.900
With a class so that way we can see something happening something red.

18

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:09.750
So I think as a class if I remember correctly called alert I think I've got to do alert danger.

19

00:01:09.750  -->  00:01:10.450
All right.

20

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:12.400
I usually have a template for this.

21

00:01:12.400  -->  00:01:15.400
I like the template guys and I said yes you get one.

22

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:16.990
It's very useful.

23

00:01:17.010  -->  00:01:24.030
All my other user on this computer I have in my copy in my other copy of BHB story of how a template

24

00:01:24.030  -->  00:01:24.960
for this.

25

00:01:25.020  -->  00:01:27.130
So I don't type it all the time.

26

00:01:27.990  -->  00:01:38.190
And let's do a UL for each errors or error.

27

00:01:40.750  -->  00:01:48.770
And for each and I don't the indentation.

28

00:01:48.850  -->  00:01:50.030
All right.

29

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:54.160
And we're going to do this error.

30

00:01:54.760  -->  00:02:00.830
OK let's look at and see if it works.

31

00:02:00.990  -->  00:02:05.390
We can also use an include here guys just to do this.

32

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:09.520
It makes sense to do includes especially for stuff like this.

33

00:02:09.520  -->  00:02:10.140
Right.

34

00:02:10.440  -->  00:02:16.300
So let's go ahead and refresh year and let's submit this.

35

00:02:16.300  -->  00:02:18.570
Now you can see all the arrows down here.

36

00:02:18.570  -->  00:02:19.390
All right.

37

00:02:20.040  -->  00:02:25.230
So guys it's very easy to do includes with blade.

38

00:02:25.260  -->  00:02:27.450
Or you have to do is do this include

39

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:35.280
like that and you give it a name where you want that to be found.

40

00:02:35.280  -->  00:02:37.130
So let's actually do it right now.

41

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:42.150
Let's actually take this out.

42

00:02:44.060  -->  00:02:45.050
All right.

43

00:02:45.690  -->  00:02:47.100
And that's two

44

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:52.310
resources views.

45

00:02:52.680  -->  00:02:56.570
Call this file includes if you want to.

46

00:02:59.040  -->  00:03:13.890
And when we do this we're just sitting here actually now that should be a four not a 5 guys.

47

00:03:13.890  -->  00:03:14.250
All right.

48

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:15.740
Taking a little bit to delete.

49

00:03:15.820  -->  00:03:17.000
That's OK.

50

00:03:17.250  -->  00:03:27.090
Let's create a father let's call this includes from people called Parshall's or you know militias do

51

00:03:27.110  -->  00:03:33.780
form create a form form error or something form

52

00:03:37.620  -->  00:03:41.000
you can call it whatever you want.

53

00:03:41.130  -->  00:03:42.400
I'm just going to call it form error.

54

00:03:42.420  -->  00:03:44.490
That's OK.

55

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:53.400
So here you come into do this and make sure that you go to the user here and here you're going to be

56

00:03:53.400  -->  00:04:00.700
typing in includes that form error.

57

00:04:01.260  -->  00:04:02.570
All right.

58

00:04:03.360  -->  00:04:04.630
OK.

59

00:04:05.490  -->  00:04:09.470
Let's go to this form and see if it still works.

60

00:04:09.550  -->  00:04:09.980
Antar.

61

00:04:09.990  -->  00:04:12.120
And as you can see it still works.

62

00:04:12.120  -->  00:04:12.870
All right.

63

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:16.950
So that way you can minimize your code a little bit and then start including stuff all over.

64

00:04:17.070  -->  00:04:18.880
Which sometimes makes sense right.

65

00:04:19.050  -->  00:04:23.890
And I think that I also why I recommend to use that you create a live template for this.

66

00:04:23.910  -->  00:04:24.300
All right.

67

00:04:24.330  -->  00:04:29.950
So that way you can you know how to you know write this over and over and over again.

68

00:04:30.060  -->  00:04:33.390
Thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you on the next lecture which is going to be pretty

69

00:04:33.390  -->  00:04:34.350
exciting.

70

00:04:34.350  -->  00:04:34.850
All right.

71

00:04:34.920  -->  00:04:35.790
Take care.
