00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:04,540
All right welcome back my students I hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

2

00:00:04,560  -->  00:00:06,060
I know this is pretty exciting.

3

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:11,490
When I was first learning it I was reading it really excited because you know I'm sure it just opened

4

00:00:11,490  -->  00:00:19,010
doors to a whole new world of building applications and focusing on your creativity focusing on the

5

00:00:19,020  -->  00:00:24,480
actually on the application itself instead of all the functionalities right instead of the complexity

6

00:00:24,720  -->  00:00:26,390
because Lero makes it really easy.

7

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:29,830
But anyway on this lecture we're learn how to delete data.

8

00:00:29,850  -->  00:00:30,240
All right.

9

00:00:30,240  -->  00:00:31,940
So we already know how to do that.

10

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:34,870
Well let's actually do it with a form which is different.

11

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:41,250
OK so you're if you're taking any of my courses or some of the courses on line with procedural BHB and

12

00:00:41,250  -->  00:00:47,590
some of the other applications within the stuff sometimes we put the idea on top right.

13

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:49,440
That's not a very good idea.

14

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:50,090
All right.

15

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:58,050
So in this time in this case we're going to do this as a post met requests actually delete requests

16

00:00:58,460  -->  00:00:59,160
with Claribel.

17

00:00:59,160  -->  00:01:06,120
So as you can see right here on your route list when we destroy an object or destroy a record we use

18

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:07,460
that the lead method.

19

00:01:07,620  -->  00:01:12,220
And this uses of course post but we get to hit him feel as well.

20

00:01:12,230  -->  00:01:14,020
Clarabell said delete.

21

00:01:14,190  -->  00:01:15,930
So that way we can send that data securely.

22

00:01:15,930  -->  00:01:16,510
OK.

23

00:01:16,800  -->  00:01:26,190
So let's go back to our controller real quick and the Destroy is very similar to the edit and update

24

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:28,000
we find the record.

25

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:32,830
So we just find it and don't be lazy like me like I do right now.

26

00:01:33,330  -->  00:01:33,830
All right.

27

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:35,330
Just write it down.

28

00:01:36,040  -->  00:01:36,660
OK.

29

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:40,510
And once we find that we just go ahead and delete it.

30

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:41,470
Simple as that.

31

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:46,380
And if you have if you want to just delete certain things of course you can put the where method in

32

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:46,900
here.

33

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:47,700
OK.

34

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:52,620
And then you should return the redirect is super simple.

35

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:55,850
I don't have to even tell you how to do that one.

36

00:01:56,740  -->  00:01:57,180
OK.

37

00:01:57,180  -->  00:01:59,300
And we're going to delete two posts.

38

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:01,130
I mean redirect.

39

00:02:01,460  -->  00:02:02,790
OK.

40

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:04,590
You can also do this here.

41

00:02:04,910  -->  00:02:13,610
OK you can do this where Id calls this you just delete it.

42

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:14,700
That's it.

43

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:18,470
So you can save a couple of lines of code there.

44

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:20,900
All right cool stuff.

45

00:02:20,900  -->  00:02:23,610
And you can also chain that up here as well.

46

00:02:23,610  -->  00:02:24,420
OK.

47

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:30,230
You can make this very you know not many lines.

48

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:31,670
OK.

49

00:02:31,920  -->  00:02:32,770
All right cool.

50

00:02:32,880  -->  00:02:35,750
So let's go and try to update this.

51

00:02:35,790  -->  00:02:39,240
Delete this all by the way we need to create a form I almost forgot.

52

00:02:39,240  -->  00:02:51,520
So let's go to our edit form and just leave it like does this create another form right here.

53

00:02:51,560  -->  00:02:52,930
All right.

54

00:02:53,490  -->  00:02:58,520
And this is going to have an action of let's just check it out real quick.

55

00:02:58,530  -->  00:02:58,900
All right.

56

00:02:58,900  -->  00:02:59,830
They destroy.

57

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:03,900
Same thing as we have the edit.

58

00:03:03,900  -->  00:03:09,480
So we're going to have less use take this out of here.

59

00:03:09,510  -->  00:03:15,770
This small resolution here is killing me guys skilly me suppose.

60

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:19,620
And then we will pass the I.D. here.

61

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:23,880
All right.

62

00:03:23,880  -->  00:03:25,610
We'll have an input.

63

00:03:25,890  -->  00:03:30,570
Very similar to the one we have on tap because we need to tell a lot about that this is going to be

64

00:03:30,630  -->  00:03:34,660
the least mad method instead.

65

00:03:35,280  -->  00:03:46,160
The name is going to be method and the value is where we put the delete like this.

66

00:03:47,000  -->  00:03:47,940
All right.

67

00:03:48,330  -->  00:03:52,640
And we need our input submit.

68

00:03:53,010  -->  00:04:00,330
And let's just create a value here that we say like delete so that what we know is deleting and let's

69

00:04:00,330  -->  00:04:02,120
change the value on this and submit.

70

00:04:02,130  -->  00:04:08,220
Here to say something like that.

71

00:04:08,250  -->  00:04:09,150
All right cool.

72

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:13,930
So I think we're making progress here let's check it out real quick and see if it works.

73

00:04:13,990  -->  00:04:20,790
OK let's click there of data BHB Let's update it.

74

00:04:21,110  -->  00:04:21,750
It's updated.

75

00:04:21,750  -->  00:04:23,930
Let's go back and delete it.

76

00:04:24,780  -->  00:04:25,870
Oops.

77

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:27,880
OK.

78

00:04:27,900  -->  00:04:31,850
Make sure that your form array has the method.

79

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:32,770
Pause here.

80

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:39,640
If it doesn't it's going to think that is a get request and we don't want to write a post.

81

00:04:39,840  -->  00:04:43,880
Even though you still declaring this an alarm bell here.

82

00:04:43,890  -->  00:04:44,220
All right.

83

00:04:44,230  -->  00:04:45,200
As delete.

84

00:04:45,210  -->  00:04:49,440
You still have to send the post because this is what a backup browser recognizes.

85

00:04:49,440  -->  00:04:50,080
OK.

86

00:04:50,100  -->  00:04:52,930
That's the only thing the browser recognizes the post and the get.

87

00:04:53,130  -->  00:04:55,620
So let's go back here.

88

00:04:55,620  -->  00:04:59,550
Refresh let's leave it as you can see is deleted.

89

00:04:59,770  -->  00:05:02,410
Let's delete this one to delete it.

90

00:05:02,880  -->  00:05:04,300
OK.

91

00:05:05,070  -->  00:05:17,170
Of course we can created java of the Java to enter it go.

92

00:05:17,760  -->  00:05:18,640
The IT.

93

00:05:18,690  -->  00:05:19,950
Beautiful.

94

00:05:19,950  -->  00:05:20,880
All right.

95

00:05:20,970  -->  00:05:24,450
So anyway thank you so much I hope you learn a lot on this.

96

00:05:24,450  -->  00:05:28,920
Couple lectures with the forms we're going to continue with some other forms functionality so that where

97

00:05:28,920  -->  00:05:33,600
you learn how to validate and and create more advanced stuff.

98

00:05:33,600  -->  00:05:37,300
It was a pleasure like always and I see you in the next lecture.
