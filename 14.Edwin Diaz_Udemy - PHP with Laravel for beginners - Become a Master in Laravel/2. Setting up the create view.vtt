00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:00.660
All right.

2

00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:02.010
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02.040  -->  00:00:04.500
You stood and so in the last lecture we get an error on the page.

4

00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:05.190
I got an error.

5

00:00:05.190  -->  00:00:10.830
I don't know if you did just because I wanted to create a little bit of Kasmir station here for you

6

00:00:10.830  -->  00:00:15.680
or to say overload but in reality we just making our life a little harder there.

7

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:17.560
We could however do it.

8

00:00:18.010  -->  00:00:29.970
But actually if we take all this out here OK we take all this out and then we can do this like this

9

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:30.370
.

10

00:00:30.660  -->  00:00:32.370
And we do this.

11

00:00:33.320  -->  00:00:33.950
OK.

12

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:42.240
And then we give it and whatever the man media overload.

13

00:00:42.290  -->  00:00:43.540
All right.

14

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:47.190
And then we could give it a function and just like we did in the beginning.

15

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:47.830
OK.

16

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:48.940
Send stuff.

17

00:00:48.960  -->  00:00:51.870
We could do that.

18

00:00:52.380  -->  00:00:54.180
But I'm not going to do that.

19

00:00:54.630  -->  00:00:57.510
All right what I want to do is just simplify this stuff would do me.

20

00:00:57.530  -->  00:00:59.190
You wouldn't need to make it complicated.

21

00:00:59.370  -->  00:01:02.670
If you guys want to know how to do this you're ready.

22

00:01:02.680  -->  00:01:06.060
I mean to give it a different name route.

23

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:09.910
I'm already showing you how to do it all you have to do is just create a function.

24

00:01:09.910  -->  00:01:10.880
All right.

25

00:01:11.400  -->  00:01:14.340
And like we did in the beginning of the course.

26

00:01:14.590  -->  00:01:15.580
And that's it.

27

00:01:15.600  -->  00:01:18.870
But we're complicating ourselves too much here for this.

28

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:21.030
Let's just leave it that way it is.

29

00:01:21.030  -->  00:01:22.590
Why change it.

30

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:22.990
Right.

31

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:26.640
Unless you want to you or I to say overload.

32

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:28.210
That's a different story.

33

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:29.520
I don't really care about that.

34

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:31.360
I just care about the functionality right.

35

00:01:31.590  -->  00:01:38.300
So let's go there lay out our admin and let's change this to say create.

36

00:01:38.340  -->  00:01:40.280
All right.

37

00:01:40.930  -->  00:01:44.180
Now we go back to it.

38

00:01:46.020  -->  00:01:55.950
Let's go back to controllers media controller and let's create they create method that sounds really

39

00:01:55.950  -->  00:01:56.660
nice right.

40

00:01:56.680  -->  00:02:01.630
This create the Create myth and now we've just returned the view

41

00:02:04.400  -->  00:02:05.930
men that

42

00:02:09.320  -->  00:02:10.260
Wolf went blank.

43

00:02:10.270  -->  00:02:15.470
Therefore many guys create lets make sure that we have that create somewhere.

44

00:02:16.720  -->  00:02:18.720
OK.

45

00:02:20.130  -->  00:02:24.660
Resources views make sure that you have your media file out here.

46

00:02:24.660  -->  00:02:30.630
I don't know if I already discussed that here but I read it I had it out here and my routes were working

47

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:31.280
.

48

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:34.060
So make sure it is in say admin right.

49

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:38.280
I don't know if I went over the video where I changed that I think I did.

50

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:45.720
All right so since I admin and its called Media remember that we have etting routes that way.

51

00:02:45.720  -->  00:02:48.720
All right let's just create to create Man-Thing.

52

00:02:49.020  -->  00:02:51.420
I mean the page is just added there.

53

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:57.640
Thats OK.

54

00:02:59.040  -->  00:03:02.490
Even though this is going to be different friend actually we don't need this

55

00:03:08.340  -->  00:03:09.800
array.

56

00:03:10.470  -->  00:03:17.010
Let's check in now of course this is going to be create that way.

57

00:03:17.010  -->  00:03:20.630
Beautiful.

58

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:22.920
All right cool.

59

00:03:22.920  -->  00:03:23.370
All right.

60

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:28.790
Now we have to work on that and functionality to all the files here.

61

00:03:28.950  -->  00:03:31.670
All right so we do that in the next lecture.

62

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:32.770
Take care.
