00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:02,710
All right welcome back to the students.

2

00:00:02,730  -->  00:00:07,920
So you guys know me I'm mad when the S and on this lecture I'm going to actually describe to you what

3

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:10,760
Larabee is and why NBC really is.

4

00:00:10,760  -->  00:00:14,850
Because I really don't know who's taking this course right you might be it might be your first time

5

00:00:14,850  -->  00:00:20,160
taking this course and you're very new to NBC or are you very new to framework's So you really need

6

00:00:20,160  -->  00:00:24,360
to get a foundation on why really we are actually teaching this course right.

7

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:27,270
So let's start with what is Claribel.

8

00:00:27,290  -->  00:00:32,670
Well Lavell if you look it up on search engines out there you're going to find a very similar definition

9

00:00:32,670  -->  00:00:38,090
to this Largo's a b b framework who uses the NBC architecture.

10

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:39,330
Now what is a framework.

11

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:45,060
Well a framework is the underlying system is the methods the classes or the files that makes up for

12

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:46,530
that install.

13

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:50,620
All right now what is NBC what we're going to get to that in a minute.

14

00:00:50,730  -->  00:00:51,820
What is architecture.

15

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:57,610
Architecture is the design pattern that has specific framework Hass.

16

00:00:57,660  -->  00:01:01,430
So in this case Lero those following the design of MVC.

17

00:01:01,440  -->  00:01:04,840
Now let's go ahead and find out why NBC actually is.

18

00:01:04,980  -->  00:01:12,360
Let's break it down is break down the M the M stands for model divvies stands for view and the C stands

19

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:13,140
for controller.

20

00:01:13,140  -->  00:01:20,670
This class is the models are going to be classes their views are going to be methods and we are also

21

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:22,760
going to have some classes depending on what we're doing.

22

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:28,440
But mintage right so most of the stuff composed compulsive classes guys every time we talk every time

23

00:01:28,440  -->  00:01:34,110
we talk about framework we were talking about the data classes for a lot of things.

24

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:37,960
Remember this is O.P. object oriented programming.

25

00:01:37,980  -->  00:01:38,470
Right.

26

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:41,730
So the controller is actually our classes as well.

27

00:01:41,730  -->  00:01:44,760
All right so now let's break it down a little more.

28

00:01:44,760  -->  00:01:46,870
So what is a model.

29

00:01:46,880  -->  00:01:49,260
All right a model deals with database.

30

00:01:49,260  -->  00:01:50,700
It's a class right.

31

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:52,520
In this class let me just give you an example.

32

00:01:52,520  -->  00:01:58,440
If we have users in our application we can have a users model right we can have a user model that deals

33

00:01:58,440  -->  00:02:05,400
with everything that has to do with wearing that database for that specific table of users so that we

34

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:08,160
have a users model and we also have a users table.

35

00:02:08,250  -->  00:02:13,890
Every time we have a model we always most of the time we always going to have a table for that specific

36

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:14,730
model.

37

00:02:14,730  -->  00:02:21,790
So we have users we have a users model and we have our user stable if we have posts we have a post model

38

00:02:22,080  -->  00:02:24,170
and we have polls table.

39

00:02:24,190  -->  00:02:24,770
All right.

40

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:26,270
So what is the view.

41

00:02:26,340  -->  00:02:29,370
The view deals with the e-mail.

42

00:02:29,550  -->  00:02:36,480
So we got everything that you see on your application in the browser is going to be a view that is going

43

00:02:36,480  -->  00:02:42,720
to be the representation right over our application the view controller they control is the middleman

44

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:46,060
that control it deals with the views and the model.

45

00:02:46,400  -->  00:02:46,790
All right.

46

00:02:46,800  -->  00:02:53,760
The controller talks to the model and says Listen Moto I need you to pull all the last names of the

47

00:02:53,760  -->  00:02:56,250
users table give me the last names of the users.

48

00:02:56,430  -->  00:02:59,820
And then once you give it to me I'm going to give it to the view.

49

00:02:59,850  -->  00:03:05,610
That's why the controller does right in a very in a nutshell this is what Larabee is.

50

00:03:05,640  -->  00:03:08,020
And this is why NBC stands for.

51

00:03:08,030  -->  00:03:08,720
All right.

52

00:03:08,790  -->  00:03:09,950
So there you have it.

53

00:03:10,050  -->  00:03:12,560
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

54

00:03:12,590  -->  00:03:14,460
You're going to get this down a little more.

55

00:03:14,460  -->  00:03:21,040
When you're going to be able to digest a little more and actually find out exactly how you know we call

56

00:03:21,090  -->  00:03:26,960
Laro then why allowable really is once you start coding you won't find how and why NBC really is right

57

00:03:26,960  -->  00:03:27,110
.

58

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:28,680
Anyway thank you so much.

59

00:03:28,680  -->  00:03:29,510
Hopefully this.

60

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:35,430
It's pollination pronation here we make your your mind at ease We'll make everything more clear for

61

00:03:35,430  -->  00:03:36,090
you OK.

62

00:03:36,180  -->  00:03:36,650
Thank you.

63

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:38,280
And I'll see you in the next lectures.
