1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:07,010
All right welcome back my students so it's time for us to start you know converting the other form.

2

00:00:07,010  -->  00:00:10,090
We have that added for form.

3

00:00:10,090  -->  00:00:10,400
OK.

4

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:14,580
So let's go to our edit form and that's what we got here.

5

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:15,090
OK.

6

00:00:15,210  -->  00:00:25,700
So now if you want you can go ahead and bring this whole thing from over there here and pasted in there

7

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:27,560
and you can do the rest.

8

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:33,000
Just to get an idea right guys and it's here.

9

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:35,120
OK.

10

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:38,700
And you can do that if you want.

11

00:00:38,790  -->  00:00:42,270
Now you don't need this anymore.

12

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:44,380
All right.

13

00:00:45,450  -->  00:00:46,500
Because we can do that

14

00:00:50,660  -->  00:00:52,560
up here.

15

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:53,090
All right.

16

00:00:53,100  -->  00:00:54,000
So cool.

17

00:00:54,000  -->  00:00:57,030
So now we have the title when we can take that off

18

00:01:00,360  -->  00:01:02,730
and the submit button.

19

00:01:03,040  -->  00:01:05,000
Let's go get the one from here.

20

00:01:05,010  -->  00:01:09,420
Now I'm going to show you another way of actually not having to do this all the time guys this is a

21

00:01:09,420  -->  00:01:15,480
simpler way by using templates from PH B-story if you already have BHB storm you can use a little command

22

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:18,000
on your keyboard and produce this whole thing right away.

23

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:19,400
So that way you know you don't have to do that.

24

00:01:19,400  -->  00:01:21,040
I'll show you in a minute how to do that.

25

00:01:21,430  -->  00:01:23,420
Let's go back here and take.

26

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:26,190
Get rid of this and

27

00:01:29,180  -->  00:01:32,700
let me see what OK we have this.

28

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:33,000
All right.

29

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:35,350
So let's actually start it in this.

30

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:42,150
Let's do it manually or over here and whoops and let's do form

31

00:01:45,300  -->  00:01:54,220
submit that's first parameter is this submit the name whatever name you want.

32

00:01:55,170  -->  00:01:56,070
We can give it

33

00:01:59,180  -->  00:02:01,110
up the post.

34

00:02:01,110  -->  00:02:05,280
That's what it says on the bottom there of that post.

35

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:11,460
And the second parameter could be the class and we're going to name this class

36

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:25,160
and it's going to be a BT and VTM primary or in full.

37

00:02:26,040  -->  00:02:26,630
OK.

38

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:28,610
Make sure that you have your little arrow here.

39

00:02:28,820  -->  00:02:30,120
Ok cool.

40

00:02:30,150  -->  00:02:33,660
So I think that's that's good enough for that.

41

00:02:33,660  -->  00:02:35,190
All right.

42

00:02:35,480  -->  00:02:42,880
And we can take this off but what happens every time I take that off I get this error.

43

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:45,030
For some reason

44

00:02:53,460  -->  00:02:56,340
that's weird.

45

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:03,400
I mean you see remove extra closing tag.

46

00:03:04,290  -->  00:03:05,580
We have another tag

47

00:03:07,130  -->  00:03:11,630
.

48

00:03:14,610  -->  00:03:17,210
OK let's use.

49

00:03:18,600  -->  00:03:21,080
Oh I see we have this.

50

00:03:21,630  -->  00:03:22,220
No we don't.

51

00:03:22,260  -->  00:03:32,280
Let's go back here and get the form closing tag pasted in there and that way we can take that off.

52

00:03:32,280  -->  00:03:33,750
Ok cool.

53

00:03:34,530  -->  00:03:37,640
All right so we have the same form almost.

54

00:03:37,650  -->  00:03:39,230
We have to edit it a little bit.

55

00:03:39,300  -->  00:03:41,590
And this one here.

56

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:42,490
OK.

57

00:03:42,540  -->  00:03:45,790
We've got to make this cold patch.

58

00:03:45,790  -->  00:03:46,620
All right.

59

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:56,190
And the action is going to be instead a store is going to be of the OK same controller because that's

60

00:03:56,190  -->  00:03:58,210
what we're using now.

61

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:05,850
We got to do something really nice in this lecture you're going to show you a bow form binding model

62

00:04:05,850  -->  00:04:06,370
binding.

63

00:04:06,400  -->  00:04:07,560
Right.

64

00:04:09,030  -->  00:04:14,780
And I'll show you that in a minute how to do that let's go back to edit and see how that changed.

65

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:15,900
All right.

66

00:04:16,350  -->  00:04:18,590
So I'm going to click here.

67

00:04:18,980  -->  00:04:25,460
And all right we've got a mistake there and now I can't see where the mistake is.

68

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:27,230
I thought it was going to give me the form.

69

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:32,220
And so I was I was going to be able to show you what was wrong with it but I'm going to have to do it

70

00:04:32,220  -->  00:04:32,780
anyway.

71

00:04:32,930  -->  00:04:40,710
So what we're going to do here is I'll just do the model by name right away guys so that will you know

72

00:04:40,730  -->  00:04:40,760
.

73

00:04:40,770  -->  00:04:41,560
OK.

74

00:04:41,850  -->  00:04:48,330
So for model binding one model is going to do is going to give us the ability to read populate the form

75

00:04:48,750  -->  00:04:49,980
with the data from the database.

76

00:04:49,980  -->  00:04:50,580
OK.

77

00:04:50,880  -->  00:05:00,300
So if I do a model here and I'm going to pass post Colma because that's the object right.

78

00:05:00,900  -->  00:05:06,430
So I passed that and I come here to this action.

79

00:05:06,600  -->  00:05:09,260
I'm going to create another array here.

80

00:05:10,220  -->  00:05:17,370
Now array and inside here I'm going to pass in the post ID.

81

00:05:17,370  -->  00:05:20,050
Now you work here.

82

00:05:20,730  -->  00:05:21,330
Antar.

83

00:05:21,340  -->  00:05:23,480
Now you can see that the form works ok.

84

00:05:23,730  -->  00:05:28,890
I thought it was going to let me show it to you without actually putting all that information but he

85

00:05:28,890  -->  00:05:33,300
won't let me since I had to put some time since I changed the method.

86

00:05:33,510  -->  00:05:35,270
OK.

87

00:05:35,400  -->  00:05:36,060
All right cool.

88

00:05:36,060  -->  00:05:42,630
So as you can see we were able to repopulate the form All right and if I do this update the form you

89

00:05:42,630  -->  00:05:45,450
can see that it's updating nicely.

90

00:05:45,450  -->  00:05:50,990
All right let's go back to the post.

91

00:05:51,000  -->  00:05:55,840
All right so I hope you see what he's doing and we changed a function from open tomorrow.

92

00:05:56,020  -->  00:05:56,630
All right.

93

00:05:56,730  -->  00:06:00,780
And then we pass it as a first parameter object.

94

00:06:00,800  -->  00:06:01,500
All right.

95

00:06:01,500  -->  00:06:05,720
The second parameter was an array with another a sigh.

96

00:06:05,760  -->  00:06:08,610
That way we can actually put the ID there.

97

00:06:08,610  -->  00:06:15,870
So all this information this data is being sent basically very secure is now being sent in the you Arel

98

00:06:15,870  -->  00:06:16,780
.

99

00:06:16,800  -->  00:06:21,980
All right so when you edit stuff all right we click update post.

100

00:06:21,990  -->  00:06:22,960
All right.

101

00:06:23,250  -->  00:06:25,780
It's updating to patch.

102

00:06:26,350  -->  00:06:27,770
OK.

103

00:06:28,060  -->  00:06:35,080
Clarabell is actually preventing as I inject showing anything that you think could hurt or is from outside

104

00:06:35,240  -->  00:06:35,610
right.

105

00:06:35,730  -->  00:06:37,270
Anything allowable.

106

00:06:37,290  -->  00:06:38,680
It's very secure.

107

00:06:38,680  -->  00:06:40,960
We don't have to do any scaping anything at all.

108

00:06:40,980  -->  00:06:43,100
Everything is being done for us.

109

00:06:43,110  -->  00:06:47,930
All right so that where we can focus on building the applications set of you know worrying about if

110

00:06:47,930  -->  00:06:51,060
somebody is going to hack our application or anything like that.

111

00:06:51,320  -->  00:06:51,840
Cool.

112

00:06:51,990  -->  00:06:56,370
So now let's let's do this all of us well we have the lead here for the lead.

113

00:06:56,380  -->  00:07:01,390
We're going to do something very similar song going to copy this whole thing right here.

114

00:07:01,450  -->  00:07:01,860
All right.

115

00:07:01,860  -->  00:07:11,930
The only thing with the lead is that we don't need open we don't need to pass anything in here sucking

116

00:07:11,930  -->  00:07:15,470
or Ray or anything like that so we're going to delete all of that.

117

00:07:16,680  -->  00:07:19,640
And here we're just going to say destroy.

118

00:07:20,330  -->  00:07:21,060
OK.

119

00:07:21,450  -->  00:07:29,640
And for patch instead of patch we just going to say delete like this and we don't need this.

120

00:07:30,030  -->  00:07:34,210
We need a cement bind so I'm going to copy this little guy right here.

121

00:07:34,350  -->  00:07:37,800
We need a form by closing tags for form.

122

00:07:37,800  -->  00:07:38,750
Copy that.

123

00:07:39,120  -->  00:07:44,920
And this is just going to delete it.

124

00:07:45,930  -->  00:07:52,360
And just for future reference we're going to change the class to danger.

125

00:07:52,440  -->  00:07:53,540
Ok cool.

126

00:07:53,540  -->  00:07:55,110
Let's go and check it out real quick.

127

00:07:55,140  -->  00:07:58,110
Antar allergy Yes.

128

00:07:58,260  -->  00:07:58,670
All right.

129

00:07:58,740  -->  00:08:08,520
We forgot something as a matter of fact we do need to pass in the second array right here because we

130

00:08:08,520  -->  00:08:09,300
need the I.D..

131

00:08:09,320  -->  00:08:10,790
I almost forgot.

132

00:08:11,580  -->  00:08:14,140
Ok folks.

133

00:08:14,220  -->  00:08:15,740
All right cool.

134

00:08:16,470  -->  00:08:20,670
So post ID.

135

00:08:20,670  -->  00:08:21,960
All right.

136

00:08:22,700  -->  00:08:28,100
All right let's check it out real quick answer.

137

00:08:28,120  -->  00:08:29,270
There we go.

138

00:08:29,680  -->  00:08:33,040
Yes gone example gone nuts.

139

00:08:33,050  -->  00:08:36,720
Well so is everything's working working really good.

140

00:08:36,720  -->  00:08:42,150
All right guys thank you so much for watching this as being a really good session for you to get your

141

00:08:42,150  -->  00:08:44,460
hands dirty with forms.

142

00:08:44,820  -->  00:08:46,060
And we're going to continue.

143

00:08:46,110  -->  00:08:49,140
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
