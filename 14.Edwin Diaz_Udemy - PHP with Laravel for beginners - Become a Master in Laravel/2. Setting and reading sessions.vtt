00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:05.400
All right welcome back my students so I opened up middleware and that's where I want you to be because

2

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:12.450
that's where we're going to be learning about sessions and I have gone to home controller and I have

3

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:16.700
inserted requests in this request variable.

4

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:21.350
So when you go to Home controller are going to find this method empty like this.

5

00:00:21.370  -->  00:00:22.040
Right.

6

00:00:22.060  -->  00:00:24.300
It's parameters.

7

00:00:24.300  -->  00:00:25.020
All right.

8

00:00:25.020  -->  00:00:29.550
So insert requests in the requests variable.

9

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:30.700
All right.

10

00:00:30.720  -->  00:00:31.820
We're going to do some depend.

11

00:00:31.860  -->  00:00:33.680
So in some injection there.

12

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:34.460
Cool.

13

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:41.760
All right so the way that we're going to access our sessions or the way we're going to create them or

14

00:00:41.760  -->  00:00:50.810
set them is by using the one of these ways is by using the requests so we could say request session

15

00:00:51.360  -->  00:00:57.600
because that's a method of that class and now we can set it and I'm going to set this one and I say

16

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:04.110
Edwyn and I'm going to give it a value of instructor.

17

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:04.790
All right.

18

00:01:05.050  -->  00:01:08.730
Or let's give it a little better value.

19

00:01:09.020  -->  00:01:10.290
Instructor.

20

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:11.850
All right cool.

21

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:17.160
So let's go to our home for Slash home.

22

00:01:17.160  -->  00:01:19.480
All right enter.

23

00:01:19.850  -->  00:01:20.220
All right.

24

00:01:20.240  -->  00:01:23.650
Going to take is there because we cannot be there unless we are logged in.

25

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:26.290
But as a matter of fact.

26

00:01:27.420  -->  00:01:28.130
Yeah that's fine.

27

00:01:28.130  -->  00:01:28.890
It's Logan.

28

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:29.960
That's OK.

29

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:32.560
We will again.

30

00:01:33.370  -->  00:01:34.550
Right.

31

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:36.300
And so there we go.

32

00:01:36.840  -->  00:01:44.380
All right so now automatically we have set a session and we turn to view.

33

00:01:44.790  -->  00:01:48.900
So let's actually make all this blank and return and reading.

34

00:01:48.900  -->  00:01:50.260
All right so we're going to read it now.

35

00:01:50.340  -->  00:01:53.810
So we're going to create We're going to follow the crowd create read of they in the league.

36

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:54.580
All right.

37

00:01:54.720  -->  00:01:57.560
So let's read it now.

38

00:01:57.570  -->  00:02:01.320
So I'm going to come in this now and I'm going to read it.

39

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:05.920
So I'm going to add this again session.

40

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:14.020
And we're going to use another mentor called get and we're going to get Ed doing when the ad says is

41

00:02:14.010  -->  00:02:16.680
by the quay going to Ecuador right away.

42

00:02:17.040  -->  00:02:18.460
All right cool.

43

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:19.540
So

44

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:28.800
all right then

45

00:02:34.390  -->  00:02:35.720
right.

46

00:02:36.490  -->  00:02:41.430
That should have gave me the one unless I have this backwards.

47

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:42.420
The shooter gave me that.

48

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:49.840
And the value will be because I gave it a key of Edwin here request session.

49

00:02:51.030  -->  00:02:57.000
If I gave it a value is not going to give me the key that's not going to happen.

50

00:02:57.010  -->  00:02:58.110
No no.

51

00:02:58.320  -->  00:02:59.100
I was right.

52

00:02:59.260  -->  00:03:01.990
Uncorrect actually but for some reason.

53

00:03:02.400  -->  00:03:03.710
Let's see something else.

54

00:03:03.720  -->  00:03:11.940
Let's return all of them request session and let's return all session.

55

00:03:13.160  -->  00:03:16.250
All right and let's see what's going on.

56

00:03:17.520  -->  00:03:18.120
All right.

57

00:03:18.210  -->  00:03:24.730
As you can see it has not been set in this sessions are done automatically.

58

00:03:24.730  -->  00:03:26.070
All right.

59

00:03:26.820  -->  00:03:33.240
You see our logon web here we have our talking here as well.

60

00:03:33.240  -->  00:03:38.900
All right so we got some sessions going on we have our logging system sessions.

61

00:03:38.970  -->  00:03:44.480
They're already set with the talking with remember me functionality.

62

00:03:44.730  -->  00:03:45.610
But anyway.

63

00:03:46.140  -->  00:03:49.670
So our session was not set here.

64

00:03:49.700  -->  00:03:56.900
And the reason why this is not said because we can't satellite is we need to use the put method.

65

00:03:56.940  -->  00:03:57.500
All right.

66

00:03:57.580  -->  00:04:02.260
So moves my bad guys.

67

00:04:02.280  -->  00:04:04.220
It's a lot of stuff to remember guys.

68

00:04:04.290  -->  00:04:05.160
A lot of stuff.

69

00:04:05.160  -->  00:04:07.290
Plus I don't use as much or less.

70

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:14.460
I'm really building something with you know a lot of stuff.

71

00:04:14.490  -->  00:04:16.870
But anyway as you can see there it was set.

72

00:04:16.920  -->  00:04:18.080
All right cool.

73

00:04:18.090  -->  00:04:26.400
So the reason why I forgot to use the put is because we also have a session a global search function

74

00:04:26.400  -->  00:04:28.000
that we use called session.

75

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:32.340
Without this like this.

76

00:04:32.340  -->  00:04:33.160
All right.

77

00:04:33.420  -->  00:04:37.290
I'll show you right now Peter.

78

00:04:40.830  -->  00:04:44.220
And this is the one that I use most of the time.

79

00:04:44.440  -->  00:04:47.360
Student.

80

00:04:49.840  -->  00:04:56.600
But does there we go is easier as you can see.

81

00:04:56.610  -->  00:05:02.710
Peter student Okay so this is a global function is available all over the place.

82

00:05:02.800  -->  00:05:05.770
You don't have to have the request to to use this one.

83

00:05:05.790  -->  00:05:08.170
So that's why most of the time I use this one.

84

00:05:08.640  -->  00:05:11.420
All right.

85

00:05:12.150  -->  00:05:12.960
All right cool.

86

00:05:12.960  -->  00:05:16.290
So in this lecture here you learn how to.

87

00:05:17.100  -->  00:05:18.410
And let me just fix that.

88

00:05:18.590  -->  00:05:22.690
It's a really cool for you guys.

89

00:05:25.080  -->  00:05:31.080
We can get that and we can use this one here for to put.

90

00:05:31.080  -->  00:05:37.380
All right guys on this lecture you learn how to create sessions right in how to read them.

91

00:05:37.440  -->  00:05:39.770
All right and also how to debug them just in case.

92

00:05:39.930  -->  00:05:42.570
For some reason you didn't set it correctly.

93

00:05:42.570  -->  00:05:46.440
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next lecture where we're going to be learning

94

00:05:46.440  -->  00:05:48.120
a little bit more about sessions
