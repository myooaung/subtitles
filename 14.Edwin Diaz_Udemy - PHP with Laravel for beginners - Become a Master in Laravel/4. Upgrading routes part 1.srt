1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:04,470
All right welcome back Amanda stood and so in this lecture here we're going to be playing her a little

2

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:05,950
bit with route's right.

3

00:00:06,090  -->  00:00:09,060
So we've got admin you're working with.

4

00:00:09,060  -->  00:00:11,380
That's fine it's working is giving us the.

5

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:13,880
But I got a feeling that I know what it is.

6

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:19,920
But let's try to start from the beginning with the routes.

7

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:24,000
All right we have a group here middleware group.

8

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:25,790
So let's let's actually do that.

9

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:27,690
Let's create that group.

10

00:00:27,690  -->  00:00:28,760
Let's copy this.

11

00:00:28,800  -->  00:00:31,790
Why don't we just copy it.

12

00:00:33,240  -->  00:00:39,840
All right let's just copy this group here and let's call back here.

13

00:00:40,740  -->  00:00:44,430
And OK we got two oddments you a deadly one.

14

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:45,700
All right.

15

00:00:46,950  -->  00:00:48,040
So let's try that.

16

00:00:48,050  -->  00:00:49,230
Let's see what happens.

17

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:49,650
All right.

18

00:00:49,790  -->  00:00:53,460
And I'm going arrow by Arrow because I want you guys to understand this.

19

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:56,970
You know what the problem is so that you can double your application better when you're doing these

20

00:00:56,970  -->  00:00:57,830
upgrades.

21

00:00:58,050  -->  00:00:58,380
All right.

22

00:00:58,380  -->  00:01:06,450
So we get that and we know that fits in a minute but we go to outman it redirects us back so it looks

23

00:01:06,450  -->  00:01:08,760
like our middleware is working.

24

00:01:08,870  -->  00:01:16,460
All right and we get back there but what we need to do here is return the view for welcome right.

25

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:23,010
So let's say welcome.

26

00:01:23,010  -->  00:01:23,820
All right.

27

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:26,860
It looks like his work welcome here.

28

00:01:26,860  -->  00:01:33,890
So one reason we always left like that but let's go back here.

29

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:36,080
All right cool.

30

00:01:36,320  -->  00:01:38,510
Logan page does not exist.

31

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:38,920
OK.

32

00:01:38,940  -->  00:01:40,050
That's fine.

33

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:41,460
We'll fix that.

34

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:46,100
So what else.

35

00:01:46,110  -->  00:01:53,930
One thing that I wanted to show you here is let's go to BHB routes to the routes.

36

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:56,030
So let's go to Beechfield is send

37

00:01:59,120  -->  00:02:00,730
out a list.

38

00:02:00,840  -->  00:02:01,790
Let's do this.

39

00:02:01,800  -->  00:02:04,070
And OK we have a problem here.

40

00:02:04,080  -->  00:02:12,000
We can see the route less because we need to take care of this guy right here and this guy that trade

41

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:14,990
is founding.

42

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:17,540
Let's see if I remember who

43

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:23,820
HTP controllers in the controller.

44

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:24,790
BHB.

45

00:02:24,930  -->  00:02:26,300
There we go.

46

00:02:26,310  -->  00:02:27,010
All right.

47

00:02:27,600  -->  00:02:28,740
Let's take that out.

48

00:02:28,740  -->  00:02:31,420
This is one thing that we have to take our I think fire.

49

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:34,690
I saw this somewhere in the documentation.

50

00:02:34,740  -->  00:02:36,370
Let's do this again.

51

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:40,430
BHB artisan I mean route list.

52

00:02:40,440  -->  00:02:41,080
And there we go.

53

00:02:41,190  -->  00:02:42,480
All right.

54

00:02:42,480  -->  00:02:45,790
So this is going to shaughs our routes.

55

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:51,900
I immediately see something that I don't like and I just going to cause a little bit of trouble with

56

00:02:51,900  -->  00:02:56,240
us is that our admin routes usually.

57

00:02:56,290  -->  00:03:01,890
They were supposed to be I mean categories that store in categories that create suppose to have the

58

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:03,630
admin in front of a dozen.

59

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:12,990
So he's omitting the first value here of this string right here is omitting all of this in your eye

60

00:03:13,000  -->  00:03:13,750
.

61

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:19,580
So now what we need to do is we need to fix this because if not this is not going to work right.

62

00:03:20,070  -->  00:03:22,370
So how do we fix this was.

63

00:03:22,410  -->  00:03:26,460
Well we we've got to go and create.

64

00:03:26,460  -->  00:03:32,250
Now the good thing about Florida before I get into that is that you see now we have a problem with our

65

00:03:32,250  -->  00:03:33,880
routes right.

66

00:03:33,990  -->  00:03:36,870
We have a big problem because the routes are not going to work now.

67

00:03:36,870  -->  00:03:38,610
The routes are different.

68

00:03:38,610  -->  00:03:49,160
So remember back when resources arrive we go to views and layouts I mean Bley Let's go down another

69

00:03:49,150  -->  00:03:49,620
layer.

70

00:03:49,650  -->  00:03:51,020
This is a good one.

71

00:03:51,390  -->  00:03:57,510
If we go here you can see that we are using a function here called route and this function is actually

72

00:03:57,510  -->  00:03:58,590
routing.

73

00:03:58,590  -->  00:04:05,470
This links this link to widening the users that index to the router name.

74

00:04:05,460  -->  00:04:11,190
So when we can we did it this way because if we had a problem with routes in the future we wanted to

75

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:16,990
be able to change it there and make it available throughout the whole application just like this.

76

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:26,340
If we would if have created some type of route like this here we would have been a lot of trouble because

77

00:04:26,370  -->  00:04:30,720
we would have to go to each of these files and change this individually.

78

00:04:30,750  -->  00:04:34,940
So this is why the is so great about doing this dynamically like this.

79

00:04:34,970  -->  00:04:36,130
Right.

80

00:04:36,330  -->  00:04:42,930
Anyway so let's go back to the web that BHB page and here are the resources we need to start changing

81

00:04:42,930  -->  00:04:43,960
takes.

82

00:04:44,040  -->  00:04:45,300
All right.

83

00:04:45,300  -->  00:04:52,210
We need to start making sure that these routes they take us where we want to go.

84

00:04:52,220  -->  00:04:52,510
All right.

85

00:04:52,510  -->  00:04:55,330
But let's go first and

86

00:04:58,140  -->  00:05:02,950
all I mean you get three direct that we need to work on the slogan.

87

00:05:02,970  -->  00:05:04,290
OK.

88

00:05:05,040  -->  00:05:06,430
So we're going to do this.

89

00:05:06,480  -->  00:05:08,980
We're going to work on this logging on the net lecture.

90

00:05:09,020  -->  00:05:09,990
It's going to be pretty fun.

91

00:05:09,990  -->  00:05:10,660
All right.

92

00:05:10,950  -->  00:05:13,620
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.

93

00:05:13,620  -->  00:05:14,310
Bye bye.
