00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:05,730
Write welcome back my students in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to download it I'm going

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:09,150
to give you all the project files in this lecture as well.

3

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:10,970
So I want you to know that now.

4

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:11,600
All right.

5

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:17,810
So go somewhere here on the left side believe for the top of the Raiola bottom go somewhere and download

6

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:19,440
your files right now for the project.

7

00:00:19,440  -->  00:00:23,630
Now I want you to use these files just for reference.

8

00:00:23,640  -->  00:00:24,080
All right.

9

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:25,910
Even though I'm going to show you how to install them.

10

00:00:26,040  -->  00:00:30,000
But I want you to use and useful reference because I want you to learn how to do this stuff if you don't

11

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:32,310
really jump into the cold with me.

12

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:36,360
You're not going to learn this if you look at it from the beginning and you install it from the beginning

13

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:39,420
by just looking at the files you're not going to learn it.

14

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:44,530
The only way that you are going to learn this is by making mistakes right and doing it yourself.

15

00:00:44,580  -->  00:00:46,170
So jumping through the code and doing with me.

16

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:52,260
But anyway once you download the files that I got for this course and I'll show you right now very simple

17

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:52,290
.

18

00:00:52,290  -->  00:00:55,800
We can use composer to regenerate some of this stuff.

19

00:00:55,830  -->  00:00:58,300
So for example I'm going to give you.

20

00:00:59,460  -->  00:01:00,650
I'm going to give you this files.

21

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:04,330
All of them except this vendor folder I'm going to show you right now.

22

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:05,370
Really quick.

23

00:01:05,370  -->  00:01:07,000
I'm going to move this to trash.

24

00:01:07,020  -->  00:01:10,380
I know I know it's crazy because if I move that's a trash.

25

00:01:10,390  -->  00:01:12,250
No my project will work.

26

00:01:12,270  -->  00:01:13,260
So another vendor for this.

27

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:19,260
Now here I'm going to synchronizes are refreshing and it's not here.

28

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:25,240
All right so when you download your file if you want to have the vendue folder back or you have to do

29

00:01:25,240  -->  00:01:27,160
is do a composer update.

30

00:01:27,320  -->  00:01:27,650
Right.

31

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:31,210
And this is going to bring that vendor folder back.

32

00:01:31,350  -->  00:01:32,110
Right.

33

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:35,960
So you don't see a here but you're going to see that in a little minute.

34

00:01:36,120  -->  00:01:36,730
All right.

35

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:38,700
But anyway so there you go.

36

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:40,550
You see it is just appear there.

37

00:01:40,560  -->  00:01:42,720
So that's that's perfect.

38

00:01:42,720  -->  00:01:46,710
Now it's going to take a little bit for some of you to get that file and the reason why they're giving

39

00:01:46,710  -->  00:01:52,170
you that vendor for this just because it takes more space is a lot of folders in here in a lot of files

40

00:01:52,560  -->  00:01:56,790
and it's just not necessary for you to go down there you know for me to give you all those files all

41

00:01:56,790  -->  00:02:01,350
you have to wait more time to download all this to your computer.

42

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:05,700
Some of you are already using a laptop for somewhere or a very weak internet connection.

43

00:02:05,750  -->  00:02:08,970
And if I give you more files it's going to take you more time.

44

00:02:08,970  -->  00:02:09,390
All right.

45

00:02:09,450  -->  00:02:14,070
So here you have all your files they all all the things that were going to be doing in this project

46

00:02:14,070  -->  00:02:14,920
are right.

47

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:19,800
So I'm going to try to keep this updated you know as when I update the chords I try to put some files

48

00:02:19,800  -->  00:02:23,110
back in here so that way you always have a fresh copy.

49

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:28,560
But anyway to here you probably your files if you need to look at them look at them for reference only

50

00:02:28,560  -->  00:02:28,590
.

51

00:02:28,600  -->  00:02:29,460
All right.

52

00:02:29,790  -->  00:02:34,080
So thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you in the next lectures
