00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome was a student.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.280
This is Edwin from the future.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.290
Every time you hear I'm from the future know that I'm just coming back to update the course.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.480
So I want to make you aware of something when I started this cause I started this course in lower version

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.410
version 5.2 right now about the time I'm recording this very video is on seven point something or seven

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.500
so things have changed a little bit.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.750
So you're about to learn about ROUTE ROUTES is how we route that request on our application and routes

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.910
are locating the route folder in the web that BHP now in the following lectures you're gonna see Edwin

9
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000
from the past go into a different folder.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.840
Do not listen to him.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.610
Just listen to what I'm telling you right now.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.100
OK.

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.250
So every time you see Edwin from the past going to AB H DCP routes which does not exist anymore Don't

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590
go there.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.970
OK.

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.460
You're gonna go to the routes and the web that BHP is the magical file.

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.350
This is where all your routes are going to be.

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.400
This is the same thing as routes that BHP before when La Lobo was older.

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.840
OK.

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
I'm going to put this in writing in the next lecture is gonna be the same thing that I'm telling you

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.010
right now would a little bit more information but just keep in mind that that's where you need to go

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.260
on the routes to web that BHP in the routes for that which is in the route.

23
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.570
OK.

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
In the same level as app same levels.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.190
OK.

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.370
So I hope this was clear enough for you if you have any questions here.

27
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.510
Sorry about that but I'm just keeping I'm just updating the course and this is a long course and I'm

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.890
going to keep updating the course and you're gonna keep getting more value for your time and your money.

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.690
Don't worry I got your back.

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.950
I'll see you in the next lectures.
