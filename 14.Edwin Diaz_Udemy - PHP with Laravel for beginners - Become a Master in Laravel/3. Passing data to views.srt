1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:05,300
All right welcome back my students so now that we know how to create views right.

2

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:13,320
It's time for us to learn how to pass data interviews super simple guys I show you a way to do it but

3

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:19,680
I'm going to show you and show you what to do with routes this way is very similar.

4

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:20,150
All right.

5

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:23,820
So let's actually create what we're going to be doing here is going to do with it.

6

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:24,910
We're going to do a couple of things.

7

00:00:24,960  -->  00:00:28,420
First we're going to create a custom method.

8

00:00:28,450  -->  00:00:29,010
All right.

9

00:00:29,190  -->  00:00:30,980
And then we're going to create a view as well.

10

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:35,090
So let's actually also create a custom route.

11

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:38,840
So a lot of customization here right.

12

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:48,210
So let's say for example I'm going to come in this hour of quick we want our users to go to our post

13

00:00:50,190  -->  00:01:00,810
and we're going to say Id here Colma and then is going to be in the post controller Porsche's controller

14

00:01:01,070  -->  00:01:01,840
.

15

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:03,880
Conan.

16

00:01:04,740  -->  00:01:09,920
And then we're going to create a custom method called Show post.

17

00:01:10,810  -->  00:01:18,240
All right even though we already have one in the resource show meant that we're going to create a custom

18

00:01:18,240  -->  00:01:19,420
one called Show post.

19

00:01:19,440  -->  00:01:27,540
So now that we have our routing place right let's go and go to a post controller here and create that

20

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:28,400
method.

21

00:01:28,490  -->  00:01:31,150
It's a public function.

22

00:01:31,590  -->  00:01:36,920
Show pulls out.

23

00:01:38,300  -->  00:01:38,720
Right.

24

00:01:38,760  -->  00:01:43,650
And we're going to return what we're eating we're going to return and return a view that we haven't

25

00:01:43,650  -->  00:01:48,160
created yet but we are going to call it post.

26

00:01:48,510  -->  00:01:57,370
So this function automatically was search for any files with this name inside the views folder.

27

00:01:57,460  -->  00:01:58,430
Joe's the views for that.

28

00:01:58,440  -->  00:02:02,670
Now the sub folders so you don't have to put a folder if you already have one there.

29

00:02:02,720  -->  00:02:07,870
So I'm going to create this file going to call it post that belayed that BHB.

30

00:02:07,890  -->  00:02:12,200
Now you might be thinking why in the world the teachers do.

31

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:17,130
Well we created these Dadley file very similar to the contact page.

32

00:02:17,130  -->  00:02:18,360
Everything has to be done.

33

00:02:18,390  -->  00:02:23,370
But I'm going to show you in a minute how we can use this.

34

00:02:23,970  -->  00:02:25,880
Real quick.

35

00:02:26,550  -->  00:02:28,140
So let's do a

36

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:34,300
post here.

37

00:02:34,320  -->  00:02:36,540
All right.

38

00:02:37,860  -->  00:02:41,400
So now I talked a little bit about the Bley engine right.

39

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:43,350
Did I say anything about the Bley engine.

40

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:52,000
I said that the Bley engine is a templating engine while the blade function is a templating engine that

41

00:02:52,360  -->  00:03:02,100
Laura Bell uses to show BHB to execute BHP in a very very simple way instead of actually writing out

42

00:03:02,100  -->  00:03:07,860
the BHB tax we can just put curly brackets around it and there are all the mentors that we can use.

43

00:03:07,920  -->  00:03:10,510
But let's actually do this right here.

44

00:03:10,560  -->  00:03:18,510
So if I wanted to echo something out here I would just do curly brackets and the name of that variable

45

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:18,870
.

46

00:03:18,870  -->  00:03:19,710
All right.

47

00:03:20,040  -->  00:03:26,490
But let's go back to our post controller here make sure that we are passing some data right.

48

00:03:26,670  -->  00:03:33,570
So we're going to take in a ID here and this idea is going to come from routes from right here.

49

00:03:33,600  -->  00:03:34,550
All right.

50

00:03:35,590  -->  00:03:37,410
And now we're going to pass it into The View.

51

00:03:37,420  -->  00:03:39,630
So there are a couple of ways of doing it.

52

00:03:39,660  -->  00:03:45,450
There is a function that we can change this code chaining right here.

53

00:03:45,450  -->  00:03:49,320
We can change this function or method with this one here.

54

00:03:49,410  -->  00:03:55,740
So we're going to say with is going to take two parameters the name of the variable and the variable

55

00:03:55,740  -->  00:03:57,350
itself.

56

00:03:57,360  -->  00:03:57,840
All right.

57

00:03:58,080  -->  00:04:04,740
So now this idea very well that's going to come from there you are well because this is a GET requests

58

00:04:06,150  -->  00:04:14,410
and you Arel is going to be available in this post view.

59

00:04:14,430  -->  00:04:16,100
Why.

60

00:04:16,110  -->  00:04:23,130
Because a pulse controller right here is opening a file and is passing in that data.

61

00:04:23,130  -->  00:04:26,840
That's why this view function is doing all right.

62

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:31,150
So now we got to display here because we don't have it here yet.

63

00:04:31,380  -->  00:04:36,660
So we're going to use the Shift key impeach the store and we're going to type in twice the left bracket

64

00:04:36,840  -->  00:04:43,530
curly bracket and that's going to create this second curly brackets right curly brackets and we're going

65

00:04:43,530  -->  00:04:46,640
to type in the name of that variable which is ID.

66

00:04:46,670  -->  00:04:48,110
All right.

67

00:04:49,050  -->  00:04:57,570
So now if we want to see this thing actually we got to do is come back here and say whoops enter.

68

00:04:57,950  -->  00:05:00,000
There we go.

69

00:05:00,390  -->  00:05:07,630
Post one as you can see we're passing data beautiful for up enter.

70

00:05:07,640  -->  00:05:10,540
Haha that is beautiful isn't it guys.

71

00:05:10,560  -->  00:05:14,250
We're going to have a lot of fun with this anyway.

72

00:05:14,670  -->  00:05:21,530
So now there is a better way of actually doing this that I use my cell phone.

73

00:05:21,540  -->  00:05:24,160
You want to pass multiple parameters.

74

00:05:24,180  -->  00:05:29,690
All right this gets very ugly when you want to pass multiple parameters so instead of doing this and

75

00:05:29,790  -->  00:05:32,270
let me just come in this hour real quick.

76

00:05:32,280  -->  00:05:35,870
Copy it and comment it out so I can use a new one.

77

00:05:36,240  -->  00:05:44,680
And I take all these out there is of a native function called Compact.

78

00:05:44,700  -->  00:05:52,510
All right dot grabs the upper arm as you can pass as many parameters as you want.

79

00:05:52,710  -->  00:05:59,340
But if I pass a parameter that has the same name as a variable that I have up here it will convert this

80

00:05:59,340  -->  00:06:00,360
into a variable.

81

00:06:00,480  -->  00:06:07,700
It will convert it into this variable right here and then we can pass it into the view this way.

82

00:06:07,710  -->  00:06:13,730
All right so now if I go back you say does the same thing again.

83

00:06:14,440  -->  00:06:16,080
Even though I changed it.

84

00:06:16,350  -->  00:06:17,160
All right.

85

00:06:17,610  -->  00:06:19,110
Why use that.

86

00:06:19,110  -->  00:06:25,320
Why use this function over the with function because with it with this compact function I can do this

87

00:06:27,450  -->  00:06:34,580
name and password or something like that of course you're not going past the password through that you

88

00:06:34,590  -->  00:06:34,970
are now.

89

00:06:34,980  -->  00:06:48,780
But you can let's go to routes and here we can say for Slash and this name and the past four you never

90

00:06:48,780  -->  00:06:49,370
want to do that.

91

00:06:49,380  -->  00:06:51,140
Right guys never do that.

92

00:06:51,470  -->  00:06:52,640
And password.

93

00:06:53,130  -->  00:06:58,670
All right and now we go to our view and we can say name

94

00:07:01,930  -->  00:07:06,910
best for all right.

95

00:07:07,110  -->  00:07:08,930
Forward should be good.

96

00:07:09,300  -->  00:07:13,370
Let's go to our application.

97

00:07:13,380  -->  00:07:18,990
Let's just write whatever here let's just write whatever undefined constant.

98

00:07:19,000  -->  00:07:24,480
OK we have a problem in our pose controller.

99

00:07:24,840  -->  00:07:29,500
That's because we forgot oh we didn't we didn't pass it in here.

100

00:07:29,580  -->  00:07:37,580
We forgot this little detail name and password.

101

00:07:37,590  -->  00:07:38,160
All right.

102

00:07:38,220  -->  00:07:40,800
Now we go back and we refresh

103

00:07:43,930  -->  00:07:47,410
view became pools that believe we have a problem.

104

00:07:47,550  -->  00:07:49,530
Let's try this out

105

00:07:51,540  -->  00:07:53,660
.

106

00:07:54,930  -->  00:08:00,780
So Id name password this looks about right maybe a misspelled there or something.

107

00:08:00,780  -->  00:08:03,410
I think it probably misspelled it.

108

00:08:03,550  -->  00:08:13,060
Let's go to Paul's blade and oh we forgot the little dollar sign symbols there.

109

00:08:13,080  -->  00:08:16,590
We can't forget about that.

110

00:08:16,590  -->  00:08:17,460
There we go.

111

00:08:17,640  -->  00:08:22,700
See that are three parameters.

112

00:08:23,190  -->  00:08:28,730
So doing password one two and three.

113

00:08:28,740  -->  00:08:29,710
All right.

114

00:08:29,790  -->  00:08:30,990
Beautiful.

115

00:08:31,680  -->  00:08:32,900
So that's how you passed data.

116

00:08:32,900  -->  00:08:35,520
Two views using Clarabell which is pretty cool guys.

117

00:08:35,520  -->  00:08:36,430
Right.

118

00:08:37,050  -->  00:08:42,940
And we are also using the blade templating engine the larva use is called Blade.

119

00:08:42,960  -->  00:08:43,670
Right.

120

00:08:44,010  -->  00:08:47,640
Thank you and I'll see you next lecture's keep having fun keep playing around.

121

00:08:47,640  -->  00:08:55,110
Practice practice practice makes perfection the more you write this stuff the more it is engraved in

122

00:08:55,110  -->  00:08:55,930
your head.

123

00:08:55,940  -->  00:08:56,580
All right.

124

00:08:56,850  -->  00:08:57,770
Take care.

125

00:08:57,780  -->  00:08:58,040
Bye
