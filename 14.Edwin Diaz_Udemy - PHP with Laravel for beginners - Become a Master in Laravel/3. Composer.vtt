00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.780
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.860  -->  00:00:07.240
So it's tough for us to install a composer so that we can create a new Larabee project.

3

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:10.400
Things are about to get really exciting.

4

00:00:10.410  -->  00:00:14.850
All right so I want you to keep the energy I want you to keep you know thinking that this is going to

5

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:16.710
benefit you so much.

6

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:20.700
You're going to learn so much in this course that you are going to be thanking me for the rest of your

7

00:00:20.700  -->  00:00:21.080
life.

8

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:21.480
Right.

9

00:00:21.540  -->  00:00:23.290
But anyway let's get going.

10

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:29.090
So composer is composer for those of you that don't know well composer he's other pendency manager.

11

00:00:29.200  -->  00:00:30.750
Do we know that right.

12

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:32.190
Edlund can you tell us something else.

13

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:33.750
Yes I can.

14

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:44.670
Composer will allow us to download BHB pre-made code from the Internet code that has been written from

15

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:49.380
for us from people that have nothing else to do a book called all day.

16

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:51.230
These people don't have a life.

17

00:00:51.300  -->  00:00:57.600
I don't understand it but believe it they just drink a lot of coffee and they just called all day and

18

00:00:57.600  -->  00:00:59.980
they put cold out there so we can use it.

19

00:01:00.240  -->  00:01:02.280
I mean what's wrong with these people right for free.

20

00:01:02.280  -->  00:01:02.900
Come on.

21

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:04.590
Well that's what it is.

22

00:01:04.590  -->  00:01:10.440
So if you want to find out where to download this pre-made call for BHB.

23

00:01:10.440  -->  00:01:19.460
I'm going to tell you right now package out there we go my google my best friend let's click on it and

24

00:01:19.470  -->  00:01:21.370
now we go to this Web site.

25

00:01:21.690  -->  00:01:28.170
This is up BHB package a repository meaning that people come here and they just drop in call that they

26

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:32.530
that took months for them to write so we can use it for free.

27

00:01:32.640  -->  00:01:35.370
I know that sounds crazy but it is true.

28

00:01:35.590  -->  00:01:36.900
Right.

29

00:01:36.930  -->  00:01:39.610
They just feel they want to help humankind.

30

00:01:39.630  -->  00:01:40.450
You know why not.

31

00:01:40.550  -->  00:01:41.200
Right.

32

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:47.790
So let's say for example I want to create this out indication system and I don't want to write it from

33

00:01:47.790  -->  00:01:48.530
scratch.

34

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:49.640
What can I do.

35

00:01:49.980  -->  00:01:56.240
Well we can come in packages and we can say our dainty cation t shirt.

36

00:01:56.560  -->  00:01:57.980
All right.

37

00:01:58.170  -->  00:02:04.460
So if I come here I can see that this has a major that's included here.

38

00:02:04.470  -->  00:02:11.490
When I type in you get this result I can see that it says a basic user authentication class for Logan

39

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:11.550
.

40

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:16.560
Look at that somebody wrote something that I can use right out of the box.

41

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:22.750
I click on it and then I look at everything that he has to offer.

42

00:02:23.220  -->  00:02:24.660
And I read a.

43

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:31.300
Whom I can use is really cool stuff how do I use it.

44

00:02:31.470  -->  00:02:37.210
And you start reading you start reading and you say oh man this thing has no documentation of or what

45

00:02:37.250  -->  00:02:38.550
he's done this sucks.

46

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:41.530
You go back and you say I want a logging system.

47

00:02:41.700  -->  00:02:47.410
You click on this and now you go back here and then you start seeing that.

48

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:48.220
OK.

49

00:02:48.240  -->  00:02:48.750
Good.

50

00:02:48.780  -->  00:02:49.780
OK I like it.

51

00:02:49.800  -->  00:02:51.950
And then you say ok cool.

52

00:02:52.050  -->  00:02:55.650
This has the documentation that I can use.

53

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:56.270
All right.

54

00:02:56.280  -->  00:02:59.250
Or we have an example application.

55

00:02:59.580  -->  00:03:00.010
Cool.

56

00:03:00.030  -->  00:03:01.210
I want this.

57

00:03:01.350  -->  00:03:07.710
You go grab the command line or you use typesetting composer require in whatever application you are

58

00:03:07.710  -->  00:03:08.160
creating.

59

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:13.000
So let's say you bring HD docs and you are using.

60

00:03:13.090  -->  00:03:18.960
And then you have a let's say for example a CMOS folder where you have your application there and I

61

00:03:18.960  -->  00:03:27.600
see a mess for you you can typing compose or require this anywhere require that specific plug in or

62

00:03:27.600  -->  00:03:33.720
code in your project and then you will go ahead and require it require that file that I create and then

63

00:03:33.720  -->  00:03:39.360
you can start using its methods and properties and all of a sudden you have this logging system already

64

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:42.630
created for you that you can use whenever you want.

65

00:03:42.630  -->  00:03:45.200
That's what composure allow us to do.

66

00:03:45.510  -->  00:03:45.950
Right.

67

00:03:46.020  -->  00:03:54.690
So now without further ado let's actually download a composer really simple click on download and now

68

00:03:54.720  -->  00:03:56.870
tell us to use ph be to download.

69

00:03:56.880  -->  00:04:01.660
Most Macs out there already have BHP being installed.

70

00:04:01.830  -->  00:04:04.210
If you don't have a you can use it with curls.

71

00:04:04.270  -->  00:04:09.870
You can look it up on line and say How can I download composer if I don't have BHB for all reason.

72

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:15.110
If you don't have it it's going to tell us to use it is going to give you an advice and tell you a listen

73

00:04:15.120  -->  00:04:16.900
you can use Kerl to do that.

74

00:04:17.250  -->  00:04:25.240
But most Macs have BHP So we're going to use that when I'd say command C to copy that and let's go to

75

00:04:25.240  -->  00:04:33.180
termino phase that anywhere because we're going to be reading this file from here I enter it's going

76

00:04:33.180  -->  00:04:38.480
to take a little bit like a couple of seconds and that's first lines done.

77

00:04:38.550  -->  00:04:47.490
So we download the installer to the current directory and we come here and we verify the installer which

78

00:04:47.550  -->  00:04:50.220
can also cross check here.

79

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:55.760
But let's use download verify the installer.

80

00:04:55.760  -->  00:04:56.440
All right.

81

00:04:56.520  -->  00:05:04.530
Copy this comeback to enter and now installer is verify we're good to go there.

82

00:05:04.560  -->  00:05:05.660
Now let's run it.

83

00:05:05.850  -->  00:05:11.000
Let's say BHB composer is pasted in there.

84

00:05:11.060  -->  00:05:11.780
Antar.

85

00:05:12.030  -->  00:05:16.310
And as you can see he's downloading it and voila.

86

00:05:16.620  -->  00:05:26.130
All right so now we have this filed called composer that far end users and the user name and that's

87

00:05:26.120  -->  00:05:26.970
where it's located.

88

00:05:27.000  -->  00:05:28.830
As a matter of fact we are there now.

89

00:05:29.000  -->  00:05:35.300
If I type in L as for listing that I rectories we can see that file right here.

90

00:05:35.340  -->  00:05:38.290
We also have this set up that we need to remove.

91

00:05:38.340  -->  00:05:43.080
So if you go back you can see that we are we can delete that file right.

92

00:05:43.070  -->  00:05:45.540
We can only link it.

93

00:05:45.560  -->  00:05:50.340
Let's go back and this and that and now type less.

94

00:05:50.450  -->  00:05:52.670
We don't have that composers set up.

95

00:05:52.680  -->  00:05:54.740
We have only composer that far.

96

00:05:54.870  -->  00:06:04.980
So now to verify that this has been stold we type in THP composer died at the age they are enter.

97

00:06:05.000  -->  00:06:11.870
And now if you get this retro composer and all of these options your composer is installed.

98

00:06:12.090  -->  00:06:16.830
Now the problem is that if you want to use a composer you need to be on this file.

99

00:06:16.820  -->  00:06:20.410
You need to have this composer that far will be in this directory all the time.

100

00:06:20.420  -->  00:06:21.210
We don't want to do that.

101

00:06:21.190  -->  00:06:26.280
We don't want to be on this directory all the time on users will we're.

102

00:06:26.390  -->  00:06:33.520
What we need to do is set up a global access to these files so we can tap in composer anywhere.

103

00:06:33.540  -->  00:06:37.780
All right we don't have to type in BHB composer whatever that far.

104

00:06:37.800  -->  00:06:39.160
Right.

105

00:06:39.260  -->  00:06:39.740
All right.

106

00:06:39.870  -->  00:06:44.880
So how do we do that what are we going to do that by creating a bash profile and this bash profile is

107

00:06:44.880  -->  00:06:46.540
going to be very useful for us.

108

00:06:46.590  -->  00:06:48.230
So I want you to hang with me there.

109

00:06:48.380  -->  00:06:55.150
So now we know that we say our last two listed directories are there are the files and we can say as

110

00:06:55.150  -->  00:07:03.980
a hi fi L.A. to actually get that hit in system files so we can see them.

111

00:07:04.190  -->  00:07:07.070
All right so that's a flag high thing layer right.

112

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:08.090
All right.

113

00:07:08.610  -->  00:07:13.220
So let's create this bash underscore profile file.

114

00:07:13.230  -->  00:07:13.750
All right.

115

00:07:13.880  -->  00:07:15.300
So we're going to do this like this.

116

00:07:15.360  -->  00:07:25.140
Let's say nano dot Bash on the score profile Arayan has to be written exactly like this.

117

00:07:25.130  -->  00:07:26.970
And then enter.

118

00:07:27.020  -->  00:07:27.860
All right.

119

00:07:28.130  -->  00:07:35.500
So now here we're going to write some code that is going to allow us to use composer everywhere.

120

00:07:35.690  -->  00:07:36.630
All right.

121

00:07:36.620  -->  00:07:37.210
All right.

122

00:07:37.400  -->  00:07:40.760
So export.

123

00:07:40.750  -->  00:07:41.340
All right.

124

00:07:41.340  -->  00:07:50.930
And then all capital their path equals symbol and then quotes two quotes all semi-colon that we do in

125

00:07:50.940  -->  00:07:52.360
PH We don't worry about that.

126

00:07:52.590  -->  00:07:55.140
And now in between here we're going to say all right.

127

00:07:55.830  -->  00:08:00.870
I want you to export composer from the root directory.

128

00:08:00.930  -->  00:08:04.140
Is there a way forward slash dot.

129

00:08:04.500  -->  00:08:18.960
And then you type in composer and then vendor and then bin and then Kallen and then dollar symbol and

130

00:08:18.960  -->  00:08:21.540
then path or capital again.

131

00:08:21.530  -->  00:08:25.520
All right so whatever path we want in whatever path we are.

132

00:08:25.830  -->  00:08:30.070
All right so once you do that you should have composer available.

133

00:08:30.090  -->  00:08:33.840
Now you need to save this file for this to work.

134

00:08:33.870  -->  00:08:41.590
All right so control X and then Y enter.

135

00:08:41.880  -->  00:08:42.270
All right.

136

00:08:42.260  -->  00:08:46.470
Now you can refresh this by saying source.

137

00:08:46.500  -->  00:08:47.430
All right.

138

00:08:47.930  -->  00:08:54.280
And then the name of the file that the hash profile and then enter.

139

00:08:54.300  -->  00:08:55.850
So now you refreshed it.

140

00:08:56.260  -->  00:08:56.830
All right.

141

00:08:56.900  -->  00:09:04.910
Now this bash profile file is super useful because we can write aliases for our command.

142

00:09:04.980  -->  00:09:07.440
So we have this vague command like this.

143

00:09:07.670  -->  00:09:11.400
And we you know instead of typing this all the time we can write a shortcut.

144

00:09:11.930  -->  00:09:23.460
We can say okay desk in desk would take us to the desktop instead of s.c the you know users and the

145

00:09:23.460  -->  00:09:27.490
name or the user and then they're stopping all of this instead of doing that.

146

00:09:27.570  -->  00:09:29.880
We can just type in desk and we take us there.

147

00:09:29.880  -->  00:09:34.110
Let me show you how that's done because that's very useful and I use it all the time.

148

00:09:34.110  -->  00:09:37.450
I think this information is going to be very very good for you.

149

00:09:37.470  -->  00:09:39.840
So let's go back to nano.

150

00:09:40.160  -->  00:09:47.660
Well in nano by the way is a native editor Araya I know it sounds it sounds difficult to pronounce.

151

00:09:47.660  -->  00:09:49.740
I'm going to show you another editor that he has.

152

00:09:49.800  -->  00:09:51.320
We can say venta V.

153

00:09:51.330  -->  00:09:56.770
I m enter and this is a different editor right.

154

00:09:57.500  -->  00:10:00.470
And now to get out of here very simple scape key.

155

00:10:01.050  -->  00:10:05.580
And then the symbol the colon.

156

00:10:06.260  -->  00:10:11.550
So you hit the scape and then colon and then the cue and then enter India is going to take you out of

157

00:10:11.550  -->  00:10:11.780
there.

158

00:10:11.820  -->  00:10:12.390
Right.

159

00:10:12.440  -->  00:10:14.200
That's how you get out of the Vendy tour.

160

00:10:14.220  -->  00:10:18.810
I don't like to use a vintage as much but I use a once in a while I like to use nano.

161

00:10:18.950  -->  00:10:19.770
All right.

162

00:10:19.860  -->  00:10:26.730
So anyway nano Let's go back to bash profil enter.

163

00:10:27.000  -->  00:10:29.170
All right we only have one line of code here.

164

00:10:29.160  -->  00:10:30.840
Let's create another one.

165

00:10:30.850  -->  00:10:31.240
All right.

166

00:10:31.290  -->  00:10:37.960
So let's make an alias alias and I'll show you right now how simple this is Alias and then call it desk

167

00:10:38.130  -->  00:10:42.130
for desktop equal to quotes.

168

00:10:42.420  -->  00:10:45.680
And then here we're going to type in.

169

00:10:45.730  -->  00:10:54.510
Where did the command line that the command to go to desktop because I won this key word desk to take

170

00:10:54.510  -->  00:10:56.630
me to desktop every time I typed it right.

171

00:10:56.940  -->  00:11:03.580
So I'm going to say see the you're going to go to users then you're going to go to the user name and

172

00:11:03.610  -->  00:11:05.750
my case is coding faculty.

173

00:11:06.720  -->  00:11:07.380
Oops.

174

00:11:07.380  -->  00:11:09.270
Faculty.

175

00:11:10.330  -->  00:11:10.830
All right.

176

00:11:10.840  -->  00:11:13.900
And Dand desktop capital D.

177

00:11:14.040  -->  00:11:15.880
Desk top.

178

00:11:15.880  -->  00:11:18.770
All right so every time I type in desk you're going to take me there.

179

00:11:18.780  -->  00:11:19.640
That's what I wonder.

180

00:11:19.690  -->  00:11:26.950
Non-ABS so control X ups control ads for to save.

181

00:11:26.970  -->  00:11:31.810
And so I'm going to hit Y and it says file name to write bash for file enter.

182

00:11:31.890  -->  00:11:38.770
Now if for some reason you have issues saving those files you need to become a super user in the way

183

00:11:38.760  -->  00:11:52.900
you do that is by typing in superuser do right so Su's deal and then Neno that bash Profar enter and

184

00:11:52.920  -->  00:11:57.220
is going to ask you for password you type it in and then enter.

185

00:11:57.490  -->  00:12:03.000
And now you are looking at this file as a super user sometimes that would not let you edit the file

186

00:12:03.010  -->  00:12:03.320
.

187

00:12:03.630  -->  00:12:04.630
All right.

188

00:12:04.990  -->  00:12:07.950
And then you can do whatever and then click control.

189

00:12:08.110  -->  00:12:15.750
That's if you this something would ask you to save it around because you're a super user it would allow

190

00:12:15.750  -->  00:12:21.130
you to do that and some files were asked you you know for the super user permission but anyway.

191

00:12:21.780  -->  00:12:28.320
Now if you want to have super user permission all the time all you have to do is say sudo su.

192

00:12:28.680  -->  00:12:32.790
And that's going to convert you to a super use all the time so you don't have to type in sudo every

193

00:12:32.790  -->  00:12:34.140
time.

194

00:12:34.140  -->  00:12:35.080
All right.

195

00:12:35.550  -->  00:12:38.820
We don't want to do that we want to make sure that we type sudo because sometimes you can mess things

196

00:12:38.830  -->  00:12:45.280
up in the operating system by just being a super user all the time you want to be able to to be Sudol

197

00:12:45.300  -->  00:12:50.260
so that way when you're doing some type of crazy edit in the system we ask you Are you sure you want

198

00:12:50.250  -->  00:12:51.000
to do that.

199

00:12:51.340  -->  00:12:54.950
But if you are a super user I wouldn't ask you for that right.

200

00:12:55.500  -->  00:13:01.230
So now in order for this to work because right now we would try to do this desk and enter is going to

201

00:13:01.240  -->  00:13:03.830
tell us that command is now found.

202

00:13:04.200  -->  00:13:06.550
That's because we need to refresh the file.

203

00:13:06.610  -->  00:13:08.860
We need to refresh that profile.

204

00:13:08.890  -->  00:13:09.370
All right.

205

00:13:09.540  -->  00:13:18.600
So we're going to say a source the bash profile enter and now we refreshed it.

206

00:13:18.960  -->  00:13:28.350
And now if we Taiping desk and then as you can see we are in desktop already so we can say less and

207

00:13:28.360  -->  00:13:34.540
you can see that we have the docs and we have some tatts and some screen shot there and desktop aof

208

00:13:34.570  -->  00:13:36.560
we type in p w d.

209

00:13:36.900  -->  00:13:43.690
You can see that we are in desktop users courting faculty desktop so it's working right now I don't

210

00:13:43.680  -->  00:13:45.660
want to have to refresh bash all the time.

211

00:13:45.660  -->  00:13:49.220
I hate refresh that why don't we create an alias for that right.

212

00:13:49.440  -->  00:13:55.210
So and another thing is that we have to go to route again.

213

00:13:55.330  -->  00:13:56.680
So see the till.

214

00:13:56.680  -->  00:14:03.990
If we are rude Let's go to the file and nano dot bash profile.

215

00:14:04.090  -->  00:14:07.110
Remember if it doesn't work for you typing sudo.

216

00:14:07.350  -->  00:14:08.660
All right.

217

00:14:09.610  -->  00:14:10.090
All right.

218

00:14:10.330  -->  00:14:14.750
So enter let's do an alias for that for refreshing.

219

00:14:14.880  -->  00:14:17.200
So alias refresh.

220

00:14:17.320  -->  00:14:20.620
So I'm going to say refresh reave Bash.

221

00:14:20.820  -->  00:14:23.740
All right because I want to refresh on other files later.

222

00:14:23.940  -->  00:14:31.390
So now we say sors and then here what we need to do is put the to that.

223

00:14:31.850  -->  00:14:32.290
All right.

224

00:14:32.320  -->  00:14:33.810
And then the name of the file.

225

00:14:33.820  -->  00:14:39.140
BASH profile arises always going to refresh that.

226

00:14:39.150  -->  00:14:42.930
BASH no matter where we are because it's going to go straight there.

227

00:14:42.960  -->  00:14:43.570
All right.

228

00:14:43.770  -->  00:14:52.240
Now control Etz and yes and Whyfor Yes Antar and now we can say source and this is the last time we

229

00:14:52.240  -->  00:14:56.710
need to write this bash profile.

230

00:14:56.760  -->  00:15:03.510
So now we can just say refresh the bash and we refresh our profile abash profile file.

231

00:15:03.690  -->  00:15:04.360
All right.

232

00:15:04.360  -->  00:15:10.930
I know these might be a little lot to take in right now but just know that you were good to go.

233

00:15:10.930  -->  00:15:19.330
All right so now let's go to a bash profile real quick and let's go in there and let's do something

234

00:15:19.330  -->  00:15:20.760
else.

235

00:15:20.760  -->  00:15:25.470
So now we have this alias for we are exporting this.

236

00:15:25.470  -->  00:15:29.110
And you can find more information about that in their Lavell Web site.

237

00:15:29.110  -->  00:15:38.310
So let's go to Lavell real quick and documentation and you can see that he's telling us to make sure

238

00:15:38.320  -->  00:15:41.000
that is composed of bin directory.

239

00:15:41.320  -->  00:15:41.550
All right.

240

00:15:41.740  -->  00:15:44.680
Is in the path and we have that in the path.

241

00:15:45.100  -->  00:15:46.140
All right.

242

00:15:46.140  -->  00:15:49.180
So now you can come in.

243

00:15:49.570  -->  00:15:52.370
Let's do something else before we check to see if this works.

244

00:15:52.410  -->  00:15:54.980
I going to typing an alias to go to bash all the time.

245

00:15:55.000  -->  00:15:59.070
So if I type in Bash I want to go there.

246

00:15:59.080  -->  00:16:08.990
So see the till then that bash as a matter of fact I'm going to say Nan or their

247

00:16:14.190  -->  00:16:17.710
cash profile.

248

00:16:17.720  -->  00:16:19.030
All right.

249

00:16:19.120  -->  00:16:23.400
And as a matter of fact and then open it up with permissions like this.

250

00:16:23.500  -->  00:16:28.960
So I don't have a problem Suro national bash profile SoCal man.

251

00:16:29.130  -->  00:16:31.250
And then I mean control it's.

252

00:16:31.340  -->  00:16:32.880
And then why for years.

253

00:16:32.970  -->  00:16:38.460
So now let's refresh the bash Antar.

254

00:16:38.560  -->  00:16:39.030
All right.

255

00:16:39.120  -->  00:16:47.830
Now we can say let's go to our desktop desk enter Let's check it real quick.

256

00:16:47.830  -->  00:16:48.920
We are in desktop.

257

00:16:49.060  -->  00:16:50.930
Let's go to bash and.

258

00:16:51.310  -->  00:16:56.800
And now you can see that he takes a takes us straight there we don't even have to do anything else.

259

00:16:56.810  -->  00:16:59.770
C'mon let's see how beautiful that is.

260

00:16:59.760  -->  00:17:01.870
BASH enter.

261

00:17:02.250  -->  00:17:02.550
All right.

262

00:17:02.560  -->  00:17:08.190
We don't have to type in all that path in the file name because he's already done for us in his alias

263

00:17:08.190  -->  00:17:08.520
.

264

00:17:08.530  -->  00:17:10.280
So this is super useful.

265

00:17:10.280  -->  00:17:10.870
All right.

266

00:17:11.080  -->  00:17:17.900
So if you want to go to the docs all the time all you have to do is is age the dogs right.

267

00:17:19.090  -->  00:17:25.890
We create an alias for this and then we say See the users.

268

00:17:26.010  -->  00:17:31.760
They use your username and desktop.

269

00:17:31.780  -->  00:17:32.380
All right.

270

00:17:32.400  -->  00:17:45.260
Or actually this is applications for God since Ray and then zap the ducks array.

271

00:17:46.510  -->  00:17:48.890
And that's going to take you there all that time.

272

00:17:48.960  -->  00:17:58.320
Now control x to come in rooi fresh bash and then we say it's the dogs and the WD.

273

00:17:58.360  -->  00:18:01.360
And as you can see we are seeing RHC dogs right there.

274

00:18:01.570  -->  00:18:04.860
Alas beautiful.

275

00:18:04.920  -->  00:18:06.660
Go ahead and keep playing around with it.

276

00:18:06.850  -->  00:18:14.140
But before you go if we Taiping composer we can see that we have composer working for awls globally

277

00:18:14.140  -->  00:18:14.590
.

278

00:18:14.990  -->  00:18:15.720
All right.

279

00:18:16.090  -->  00:18:20.300
If you can't get that to work let me know and I'll put it on the discussion we'll fix it.

280

00:18:20.490  -->  00:18:23.430
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

281

00:18:23.430  -->  00:18:25.500
Hopefully this will save you all.

282

00:18:25.600  -->  00:18:27.380
You learn a lot on this lecture.

283

00:18:27.780  -->  00:18:29.780
And this will save you a lot of time.

284

00:18:29.800  -->  00:18:30.500
I'm pretty sure.

285

00:18:30.510  -->  00:18:31.260
Thank you.

286

00:18:31.440  -->  00:18:33.810
And I know this was wrong but it was worth it.

287

00:18:33.820  -->  00:18:37.130
Take care and I'll see you in the next lectures.
