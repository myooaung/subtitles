1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,740
All right.

2

00:00:00,750  -->  00:00:02,270
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02,270  -->  00:00:10,230
Muddiest student in this section here we are going to be upgrading our application to 5.3 version 5.3

4

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:11,210
or Lero bell.

5

00:00:11,220  -->  00:00:15,960
Now in this lecture here that you're watching right now just going to give you a little bit a little

6

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:20,500
overview on what's new and what a find this information right now.

7

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:27,180
We're now going to cover most of this stuff because we do not apply this in our application here.

8

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:28,020
All right.

9

00:00:28,020  -->  00:00:32,220
Most of this stuff or a little bit more advanced that is beginner's course so I'm going to create another

10

00:00:32,220  -->  00:00:33,980
course for this.

11

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:34,580
All right.

12

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:36,870
So just pay attention to that.

13

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:41,370
Stay tuned for that news because I'm going to create another more advanced course too just to cover

14

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:43,030
some of those aspects of Larabee.

15

00:00:43,050  -->  00:00:45,030
But right now in is beginner's course.

16

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:49,860
I'm going to show you exactly how to upgrade to the next version.

17

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:55,470
And I'm just going to go over a little bit of the changes that the biggest changes that are actually

18

00:00:56,250  -->  00:00:57,660
affecting our application.

19

00:00:57,870  -->  00:01:02,380
Because right now we've got a couple of changes that are breaking our application entirely if we try

20

00:01:02,380  -->  00:01:04,260
to upgrade right now.

21

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:04,700
All right.

22

00:01:04,830  -->  00:01:08,070
So let me just open this.

23

00:01:08,550  -->  00:01:14,250
I got this page here that I found on the river News.com which is I think I recommended a lot if you

24

00:01:14,250  -->  00:01:16,220
guys are intolerable.

25

00:01:16,230  -->  00:01:16,920
All right.

26

00:01:16,980  -->  00:01:20,490
To subscribe to the news where you can find out.

27

00:01:20,790  -->  00:01:25,330
So some of the things that are new.

28

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:26,200
All right.

29

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:27,790
This is this is the page.

30

00:01:27,810  -->  00:01:32,290
A lot of the news out common you can see it.

31

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:39,330
We got the mailable that's a big thing here because now we don't have to send an e-mail the long way

32

00:01:39,540  -->  00:01:41,660
like we did before we all do this.

33

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:49,830
We can just create a class with the artist in command and then inside that class we can find the from

34

00:01:49,830  -->  00:01:55,950
in and in some more parameters even the view in this build Mantid are right inside that class which

35

00:01:55,950  -->  00:01:57,390
is pretty cool.

36

00:01:57,390  -->  00:02:00,300
All right so now you can send the mail like this.

37

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:02,370
All right so the is a big thing.

38

00:02:02,370  -->  00:02:07,240
Notifications are making it easier for US passport that's a little bit more advanced.

39

00:02:07,240  -->  00:02:07,950
All right.

40

00:02:08,310  -->  00:02:10,410
So it's just a package.

41

00:02:10,590  -->  00:02:12,670
We can roll back migrations.

42

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:16,220
Instead of doing the whole batch we can just do one instead.

43

00:02:16,700  -->  00:02:24,990
Bley for each array has the loop variable now that we can you know like say for example here is saying

44

00:02:24,990  -->  00:02:28,470
OK if loop first I want you to do this.

45

00:02:28,470  -->  00:02:30,490
Basically if the first iteration.

46

00:02:30,490  -->  00:02:33,740
Now it's actually they included some more features into this.

47

00:02:33,750  -->  00:02:35,350
Right.

48

00:02:35,610  -->  00:02:40,380
So this loop is just you know detecting the iteration.

49

00:02:40,920  -->  00:02:46,500
So he has like the first iteration the last iteration has some more mentors that you can use more properties

50

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:46,860
.

51

00:02:46,860  -->  00:02:56,410
So collections have change a little bit and this is just stuff that we are not culverin entirely guys

52

00:02:57,240  -->  00:02:58,910
but I want you to be aware of them all right.

53

00:02:58,920  -->  00:03:02,450
So I wanted to go over a really quick about it right.

54

00:03:03,030  -->  00:03:07,260
So this is stuff that you can actually come and look out of yourself right.

55

00:03:07,310  -->  00:03:11,700
Look at can you cash helper would not cover in cash either in this course.

56

00:03:11,700  -->  00:03:17,940
But anyway I wanted to show you give you a little bit overview some of the big changes and show you

57

00:03:17,940  -->  00:03:19,300
where to get them.

58

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:20,340
All right.

59

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:27,580
So that's one place where are what actually they he describes I think is arrogant self.

60

00:03:27,600  -->  00:03:28,910
Yes.

61

00:03:29,160  -->  00:03:34,720
He described some of the changes in self in day here in this website Scotch Dyo.

62

00:03:34,910  -->  00:03:43,440
I know you can go actually go in deep really dig deep really deep into that or dive like they call it

63

00:03:43,570  -->  00:03:46,200
right into the features.

64

00:03:46,200  -->  00:03:47,020
Each of them.

65

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:51,180
All right so this is going to describe the features entirely up to you.

66

00:03:51,210  -->  00:03:55,740
I mean Charlie said look they're talking about the loop variable here.

67

00:03:55,740  -->  00:03:59,300
All right showing you the structure and telling you some of the methods here.

68

00:03:59,310  -->  00:04:02,620
Look at this are the properties I mean you're right.

69

00:04:03,210  -->  00:04:04,480
Pretty cool stuff.

70

00:04:04,500  -->  00:04:08,390
I think this is the best Web site to actually get all this information from.

71

00:04:08,490  -->  00:04:12,940
So anyways stuff that you can actually get yourself and you can take your time with it.

72

00:04:12,950  -->  00:04:13,710
All right.

73

00:04:13,740  -->  00:04:17,070
My job here in this section is to help you upgrade to 5.3.

74

00:04:17,070  -->  00:04:17,590
All right.

75

00:04:17,760  -->  00:04:20,370
So we started doing that in a net lecture
