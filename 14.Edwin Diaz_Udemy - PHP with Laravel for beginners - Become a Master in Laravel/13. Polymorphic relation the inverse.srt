00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:02,000
All right welcome back male student.

2

00:00:02,010  -->  00:00:07,590
This is going to be a very short lecture because I want to show you how to pool the owner the owner

3

00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:08,700
of the image.

4

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:09,540
All right.

5

00:00:09,550  -->  00:00:13,100
So let's go let's get to it.

6

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:18,770
Let's create a raÃºl real quick and it's come in this out.

7

00:00:19,100  -->  00:00:23,780
This created a really cool round here or root.

8

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:29,080
Some people call it root I call it round but it's up to you to call it whatever you want.

9

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:29,800
All right.

10

00:00:29,820  -->  00:00:31,890
As long as it makes sense.

11

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:42,720
All right so for it all and let's just say the IDs there will we'll put an ID on the browser.

12

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:47,190
That's fine let's just do this and.

13

00:00:47,870  -->  00:00:48,520
OK.

14

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:50,950
And that's a matter of fact this photo.

15

00:00:51,660  -->  00:00:57,120
And let's just call this user actually post has to.

16

00:00:57,210  -->  00:01:00,960
So we can pull all of that.

17

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:02,810
All right.

18

00:01:03,390  -->  00:01:10,010
So here what we need to do is we need to loop well not loop but we need to go ahead and Querrey the

19

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:18,150
the photo and we need to say find and it's better that you use this fine or fail.

20

00:01:18,300  -->  00:01:19,170
OK.

21

00:01:19,220  -->  00:01:21,720
That way you can kind of throw a four or four or there.

22

00:01:21,710  -->  00:01:27,300
So file fail ID and I haven't been using that much but when we started building our application we are

23

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:28,630
going to be using this all the time.

24

00:01:28,630  -->  00:01:29,540
All right.

25

00:01:30,030  -->  00:01:32,910
So fine or fail ID.

26

00:01:33,690  -->  00:01:34,410
All right.

27

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:37,820
So we're going to find that.

28

00:01:37,890  -->  00:01:40,750
And as a matter of fact I'm going to play a variable to it.

29

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:43,500
So that's going to be the photo.

30

00:01:44,930  -->  00:01:46,070
OK.

31

00:01:46,800  -->  00:01:52,410
As a matter of fact we need to import as well so I'm going to put this on top import the class.

32

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:57,260
And for those of you that are happy it is to make sure that you have this on top.

33

00:01:57,300  -->  00:01:58,030
All right.

34

00:01:58,190  -->  00:02:06,930
In the name space they're beautiful so once we find the photo we will pulao the owner.

35

00:02:06,960  -->  00:02:11,450
So we will say Forteo Orner or something like that.

36

00:02:11,510  -->  00:02:12,400
OK.

37

00:02:12,690  -->  00:02:18,260
Mitch you can write it however you want.

38

00:02:18,900  -->  00:02:28,350
You can write for all you can write photo owner 4:2 ideal owner or whatever you want but I mean not

39

00:02:28,350  -->  00:02:32,250
here but when you find this you can do it in your column Serai.

40

00:02:32,270  -->  00:02:37,100
I'm just following conventions what they have in the documentation and that's it.

41

00:02:37,140  -->  00:02:38,740
As a matter of fact I don't even need this.

42

00:02:38,740  -->  00:02:41,630
I'm just going to return.

43

00:02:41,960  -->  00:02:47,070
Return Ramsey returned with the ID which is going to return like this.

44

00:02:47,070  -->  00:02:50,240
We need the name of that method.

45

00:02:50,250  -->  00:02:52,600
All right let me see if I got this correctly.

46

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:59,970
Ok return photo image image table.

47

00:03:00,030  -->  00:03:01,440
All right.

48

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:04,310
Each piece Tony is telling me has a new version.

49

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:07,800
But anyway let's go and try to see if this works.

50

00:03:07,800  -->  00:03:09,180
If not we'll debug it.

51

00:03:09,480  -->  00:03:10,560
That's OK.

52

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:12,000
So we'll

53

00:03:15,330  -->  00:03:24,270
come here and say photo ID number one for user oops was a user.

54

00:03:24,280  -->  00:03:29,970
Now I suppose I believe all right there we go.

55

00:03:29,970  -->  00:03:33,530
All right so we found the owner of the photo I.D. number one.

56

00:03:33,540  -->  00:03:34,620
Cool.

57

00:03:34,650  -->  00:03:36,520
What about the owner for ID number two.

58

00:03:36,520  -->  00:03:38,420
Who is that.

59

00:03:39,730  -->  00:03:41,530
Ha.

60

00:03:42,350  -->  00:03:46,140
We've fallen for number two here.

61

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:49,190
She says he has that.

62

00:03:49,920  -->  00:03:51,070
And there we go.

63

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:55,940
See that beautiful.

64

00:03:56,040  -->  00:03:57,180
All right.

65

00:03:57,630  -->  00:04:02,070
So anyway Guys thank you so much for watching this lecture I tell you is going to be short and sweet

66

00:04:02,070  -->  00:04:02,540
.

67

00:04:02,640  -->  00:04:07,260
So as you can see we were able to find the photo.

68

00:04:07,620  -->  00:04:08,360
All right.

69

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:12,460
Number one for a number two owner.

70

00:04:12,750  -->  00:04:20,970
So we can see that number two is the owner is a post and the full four are number one the owner is a

71

00:04:21,180  -->  00:04:22,350
user.

72

00:04:22,350  -->  00:04:25,220
We just got this confusing you are all here.

73

00:04:25,230  -->  00:04:26,850
But don't worry about that.

74

00:04:26,880  -->  00:04:27,760
All right.

75

00:04:27,930  -->  00:04:32,700
Thank you so much for watching guys and ladies and I'll see you in the next lecture.

76

00:04:32,700  -->  00:04:33,150
Keep it up.

77

00:04:33,150  -->  00:04:35,160
You're doing a great job if you're following me.

78

00:04:35,160  -->  00:04:36,200
Very good.
