00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:02.170
Welcome back among these students.

2

00:00:02.280  -->  00:00:08.400
So on this section here we are going to be learning about it just because this is an awesome course

3

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:09.670
I think right.

4

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:12.260
And just because we're building an awesome application.

5

00:00:12.380  -->  00:00:13.120
All right.

6

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:15.470
I decided to include it here in this course.

7

00:00:15.470  -->  00:00:17.470
All right so we're going to be learning about good.

8

00:00:17.580  -->  00:00:19.320
And for those of you that don't know what good is.

9

00:00:19.320  -->  00:00:24.540
Give me just a few seconds to explain for those of you that already know what good is feel.

10

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:25.880
Welcome to.

11

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:30.390
You're welcome to go and skip this whole section and go to the next one where we build the application

12

00:00:30.390  -->  00:00:30.780
.

13

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:31.220
All right.

14

00:00:31.380  -->  00:00:32.720
So for those of you that don't know.

15

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:33.320
Here goes.

16

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:33.970
Good.

17

00:00:34.140  -->  00:00:39.010
It's a version control software we already stole good for Windows.

18

00:00:39.020  -->  00:00:43.920
We got to get a little give bash the little Schale though where were we right our commands for Windows

19

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:44.640
.

20

00:00:44.640  -->  00:00:45.530
That's fine.

21

00:00:45.830  -->  00:00:47.580
Boogity so much more than that.

22

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:48.060
All right.

23

00:00:48.060  -->  00:00:52.970
A lot more than that we can what we can do is we can save our project say.

24

00:00:53.040  -->  00:00:54.530
Let me just give you an example.

25

00:00:54.660  -->  00:01:00.910
We'll building this application and we include the categories features for our application.

26

00:01:00.910  -->  00:01:04.890
Right we are able to see categories now display them and do all kinds of stuff with categories.

27

00:01:04.890  -->  00:01:05.820
Cool.

28

00:01:05.940  -->  00:01:11.070
Then we write another feature for I don't know for online users and then we write another feature for

29

00:01:11.370  -->  00:01:12.290
something else.

30

00:01:12.330  -->  00:01:12.770
Right.

31

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:18.660
And then next week we do other upgrades to our application what happens.

32

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:24.230
The whole thing breaks and then you know we spend 10 hours 15 hours and we can't fix it.

33

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:28.500
And we say to ourselves oh my god what am I going to do or am I going to go back and redo the whole

34

00:01:28.500  -->  00:01:29.230
thing.

35

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:29.580
Right.

36

00:01:29.580  -->  00:01:33.330
That's an option that you got unless you already save your project.

37

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:35.330
That duplicate folder or something like that.

38

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:43.200
Well we get what you can do is you can actually go back in time to where you actually put each of those

39

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:49.050
upgrades in your application so for example if you put the old gray for categories and you know your

40

00:01:49.110  -->  00:01:56.100
application was working when you put categories you can go back to the category time frame and start

41

00:01:56.100  -->  00:01:57.620
from there again.

42

00:01:57.630  -->  00:01:58.730
So basically we get.

43

00:01:58.730  -->  00:02:05.280
You can go back in time to specific places in your applications where your code was working and restore

44

00:02:05.280  -->  00:02:06.710
your whole project.

45

00:02:06.720  -->  00:02:07.340
All right.

46

00:02:07.470  -->  00:02:13.560
So is version control software just like we have been doing with migrations right with migration.

47

00:02:13.560  -->  00:02:15.060
You can roll back right.

48

00:02:15.120  -->  00:02:18.710
We get we do something very similar but it's a lot more powerful than that.

49

00:02:18.960  -->  00:02:24.090
I decided to actually put this in this course because I know that some of you are going to invest a

50

00:02:24.090  -->  00:02:25.750
lot of time in that project.

51

00:02:25.800  -->  00:02:30.210
Some of you are going to invest a lot of time in some other projects and I want to save you some time

52

00:02:30.210  -->  00:02:30.420
.

53

00:02:30.450  -->  00:02:34.770
Plus I want to show you the most I can in every lecture in every course I make.

54

00:02:34.770  -->  00:02:39.710
Just because you guys trusted me with your time and money to join this course a more milder.

55

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:43.480
So I hope you enjoy the section and I wish you the best.

56

00:02:43.590  -->  00:02:47.460
And if you have any questions I'm here for you and I'll see you in the next lectures.

57

00:02:47.490  -->  00:02:49.770
Take care.
