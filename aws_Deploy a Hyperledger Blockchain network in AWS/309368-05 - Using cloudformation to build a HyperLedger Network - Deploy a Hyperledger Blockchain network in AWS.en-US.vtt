00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hi,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.700
everybody.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.140
And welcome to this lesson on provisioning are for a type of letter.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.960
Fabric network through aws is claw information stack.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.140
So in this demonstration,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.530
we're going to use the blocking template created using the AWS Cloud formacion,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
which is provided by AWS in order provisioned nodes in our hyper larger fabric network.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.560
Now,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.780
in order to get Stehr started,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.100
I'm gonna go ahead and navigate to aws dot amazon dot com slash Blockchain now.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.290
Ah,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.580
very good thing about AWS is is they have provided us templates a claw information template

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.480
to provision our entire hyper ledger fabric network,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.840
which has made a life a lot easier and a lot simpler in order to get our network up and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.160
running,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.570
I guess.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.980
And see this page gives a basic overview about the different products.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.560
Ah,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.240
block seem that LBS has started to offer and is going to offer in the in the upcoming

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.750
future.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.690
What we are interested in is the AWS Blockchain templates.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.760
Once we go want to get into the blocked in top plays give this page gives and basic

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.620
overview about what Blockchain templates are and the two main ones that are offered by AWS

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.620
.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.240
At this point,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.130
time are one for Ethereum and one for the hyper leisure fabric.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270
And for the purposes of this course in this demonstration,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.910
what we are interested in is the high privilege of fabric one.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.660
And here gives a business or view off how the templates basically work you.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.550
We choose a template,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.100
we choose our platform and then we go ahead and build our networks.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.040
We're gonna go ahead and click on get started with a Blockchain template and take us to a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.450
page where you can select our templates which ones you want to use.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.260
Like I mentioned,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.590
the two ones are ethereum,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.850
or high poser fabric.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.620
And on the bottom of that list,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.550
the different regions that currently offers the hyper older fabric Blockchain templates.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.080
Right now there are three regions that are it's offered in northern Virginia,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.360
Ohio and Oregon.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.220
And if you remember the VPC that I created in one of the prettiest lessons,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.590
I made sure that it was hosted in northern Virginia.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.860
Do you want to make sure that the VPC and the subject that you guys create are hosted in

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.290
one of these three regions?

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.470
Because if they're hosted in another region,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.570
you will have issues launching your hyper laser Blockchain template.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.140
So I'm gonna go and click on the Northern Virginia tow launch the Cloud Formacion stack of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.150
this American configure,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.520
our hyper legend network.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.770
Now,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.220
a stack on it'll be a simply refers to a logical group of resource is on the AWS cloud that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.480
you can administer together.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060
So at the very top,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.270
we can see that there's some basic information about the template on description of the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.280
fabric network that were going to build for the rest of this course.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.640
Now we're gonna go ahead and start filling out some of the basic information.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.750
We require a name for the stack.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.880
After I give ah,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.780
basic name,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.880
we're gonna move on to configuring the specific parameters off our fabric network are the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.500
first is the name of the Public Channel on our fabric network.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.140
Now,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.730
by default,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.800
it's called my channel.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.530
You can refer to another name and if you are going to be using this for a production

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.000
environment,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.590
you want to make sure that you use it.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.970
You use something meaningful that will help identify this public channel on the fabric

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.520
network.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.150
But I'm just gonna go ahead and leave it by default to my channel.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.180
I'm actually gets and see that there's three different organizations that are created as

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.050
part of this fabric network.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.350
Now let's see if this network is associated with a set of companies.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.710
You might want to have a domain name for this consortium or the set of companies,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.320
and that's what you specify and then in terms of the organization.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.290
So if high protein fiber network is to be used within different teams or different

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900
departments and your organizations,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.480
you will specify the organization domain name here,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.950
such as Qasim dot com or amazon dot com.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.610
Now the network will automatically be imprisoned with three piers from three different

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.450
organizations,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.840
and you can specify the names of the organizations and this text box that you guys see or

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.040
Guan two and three now by default there,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.310
named or Guan to 13 week and specify your own specific names here.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.740
Now the names will represent the sub domains for each organization,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.210
for example,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.730
or guan dot amazon dot com Or,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.190
as you guys see here organ dot example dot com of these three,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.900
but dont means will form pure nodes off Ah,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.250
High brother Fabric network.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.860
I was his girl on down.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.590
You can specify the idea of the VPC to which are a C two is going to be connected.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.670
And this is going to be the VPC that we created in one of the previous labs before we go on

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.170
to easy to the sub net that associated with that bpc And again,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.620
this is the sudden that we also created and made sure we allow it a couple of protocols,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.840
the S S H and the TCP port 80 et into the suddenness.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.060
You want to make sure that we specify both of those here specifically and not the default

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.550
ones.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.360
Now,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.800
this is a case between central run the containers forming the nodes off our fabric at work

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.800
.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.380
So this is the to set the idea of the network that will have created area earlier.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.230
And this is the security group that we just created in the previous lab.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.420
And here is the air end that I asked you to copy on keeping your node pants.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.580
You want to make sure that because we paste that same air and for the sea to instance,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.910
profile this way it will have the specific access and specific permissions to access.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.950
The different resource is within the AWS network.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.540
And here's some of the other parameters in terms off the hardware or the type of easy to

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.950
instance,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.800
we want a launch.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.980
I'm gonna go ahead and just keep it the default,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.070
which is in the free tier.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.700
But you can choose specific instances depending on how intensive off work you are going to

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.100
be doing with this specific.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.340
Easy to instance,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.470
here's a couple of different template versions.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.900
The version one or you want to use the latest We're gonna go.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.180
It's like the latest because,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.740
ah,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.370
in case they made AWS amazing changes or updates,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.470
we want to make sure that we use the latest version for our fabric template.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.540
And the last thing that we do is we acknowledge some of the resource is,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.040
and the required capabilities for this formation stack that is going to be utilizing the I

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.790
am resource is and it's going to be using the resource is within your AWS account.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.590
You want to make sure that we acknowledge that before we go ahead and launch it just to

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.900
make sure that you are aware that certain resources will be spun up,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.450
such as an easy to instance,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.050
which,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.390
if you're not in every tear,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.020
will start incurring charges.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.130
So once we go ahead and specify all this,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.510
we're going to go ahead and click on Create Stack.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.140
I just keep in mind that the question of a stack might take a few minutes.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.150
Um,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.970
so we can go ahead and grab a cup of coffee or a cup of tea,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.600
Um,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.300
and wait for it to finish.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.010
You can watch the logs to see how are things progressing.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.860
Click on the link to view the additional log events that come in and you'll see how the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.780
stacks are being provisioned and are being created because you can click on the refresh and

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.370
we'll take you through the progress off.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.860
What's going on if it's currently in progress.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.370
If is currently in created,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.410
the different events different resource is,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.810
and the different outputs,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.840
all of them will be populated on.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.300
Once this stack,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.280
the stack creation is complete,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.910
and the template just takes you through the claw information template.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.440
If you guys want to go ahead and brush through it.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.980
You can see all of the different resources that are part of this cloud formation template

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.800
now defining Clark Krishna places.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.450
Ah,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.150
the outside the scope of this course,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.170
But you are also able to customize your own cloud.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.060
Formacion templates,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.650
tow launch.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.150
Any resource within AWS or an entire network in AWS can belongs to a confirmation template

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.150
.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.790
So this hyper ledger one that's been created by 80 BS does exactly that,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.250
but specifically to launching a hyper ledger fabric network in an easy to instance.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.540
So essentially they have automated an entire task of launching a hyper alleged network for

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.560
us in terms off quoting it.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.640
And all we have to do is click a few buttons and the entire network will be launched for us

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.460
automatically.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.080
So it's as simple as that.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.280
Just wait for a few minutes for it to complete,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.130
and there you have it.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.060
We have are the first hyper ledge or our first hyper leisure fabric network,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.620
launched in AWS
