00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
everybody.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.430
So now that we have our chain code created and saved on are easy to Winston's.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.230
Now we're going to install.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.390
And instead,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.050
she ate our chain called on appear node in the fabric network.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.310
We're going to then use the chain called to query the current state of ledger and and walk

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.440
a few transactions.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.110
And then finally,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.270
go ahead and monitor those transactions to the Blockchain Explorer So you guys can see I'm

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.740
already logged into our my easy to instance Through s s H I already installed this chain

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.920
called on appear node.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.260
We want to copy the chain court file onto a directory in the cli container,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.770
which will,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.170
which is what we were going to do using the Doctor CP Command CP standing for a copy,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.650
obviously.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.430
Now we're gonna specify the file name that we want to copy,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.900
over which is the car registry dot Go.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.690
And if you save it as anything else,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.920
just make sure you specify that here and make sure it's the prefixes.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.950
Cli colon.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.130
Now,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.560
what this is going to indicate is that the container into which we want to copy this chain

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.660
court is the command line interface and within the interface,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
the chain court should live under the Goal Path Source directory.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.610
Now,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.970
in order to communicate with the pier on the fabric network,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
we're going to use the doctor Exactamente log into our command line interface.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.160
And once we log into the container,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.650
we're going to execute the bash cell.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.480
I want you do that.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.560
You can see that the command prompt changes which lets you know that you successfully

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.470
logged in.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.340
We're gonna go ahead and head over to the director where we copied our our chain called

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.100
file had ensured that it actually there and that it was copied properly.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.140
We don't we don't want to go ahead and try to.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.560
Instead,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.910
she ate something where the copy didn't work or the file was in the wrong directory and so

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.190
on.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.590
So it's always good practice to make sure that want to copy it over just to verify that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.140
it's copied all the way.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.610
It is copied correctly.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.290
Once you wear for that,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.200
let's go ahead and navigate back to our sub folder where we were before and one for their

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.490
that.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.910
This is where we're going to execute the command to install this chain code on appear in

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.650
our hyper leisure fabric network.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.240
If you remember from the poorest lesson when we explored the CLI container,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.460
all the variables pointed toward one.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.060
So if you left that as default,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.240
this is where they're pointing to.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.060
If you change that,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.130
just make sure you remember where you change the two others or going to war and three or

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.720
whatever name you have specified.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.170
So when you use the pier chain called install commanding or install a tanker and appear the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.680
organ,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.180
Pierre is what's going to be chosen by default.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.170
Now we use the dash and to specify the name of our chain court smart contract and we call

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.450
it,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750
I'm gonna call it my DAP.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.420
Now we can specify a specific version for this change code using the Dash V flag.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.300
As you can see,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.530
this is version one point.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.080
Oh,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.430
but you can also specify a different version if one is available,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.350
and then we can specify the path to the chain quote file where it resides.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.360
I want to read Hunter.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.770
This is going to install the chain code in the or Guan Pierre Node,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.930
and you can see from the from the messages here that the chain called uses the default E s

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.650
E C and V sec.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.220
Now,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.200
this is a default endorsement system chain code and the validation system Chain coat has

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.330
three e s c and the V s C.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.890
Now,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.990
this busy means that any any peer from the organization can endorse the transaction.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.060
And V A C C Miska stays at all piers on the network will validate and commit transactions

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.840
executed using this specific chain cord.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.290
Now,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.460
once we've been installed,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.920
we're gonna go ahead and check to see the installed chain cause using the pier Kinkel list

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.420
installed command And this was then this should,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.060
if it's done,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.190
probably show that the my dad version one has been successfully installed on the organ one

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.750
peer.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.030
So what we've done up to this point is we've installed our chain coat,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.500
but we also need to instance she ate our chain called also because simply installing it is

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.400
not enough in the Highbridge or fabric environment now before.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.790
Instead,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.490
she ating it.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.260
You need to set up a transport layer security,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.040
or TLS on our network,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.850
which will encrypt all of the messages that the peer nodes exchange with the order.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.670
Ah,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.330
and just keep in mind that I mean,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.500
the main point off a Blockchain network is security.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.840
So you wanna make sure it is as secure as possible and a century?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.790
This is what this transport layer security Command is doing.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.500
So once we do that now,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.060
right to run the pier command used in Stan,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.290
she ate our chain coat.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.860
We're gonna call the pier chain called Inst Enshi eight.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.380
And we're gonna explicitly inst enshi eight are specific chain called which we created the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.790
dash old flag points to the order on our network,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.260
which is again a docker container named order dot example dot com or whatever dot com you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.090
specified.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:19.550
And it is available on port 7050 What you had entered the chain court is now going to be in

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.130
Stan sheeted.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.550
So now we have installed a chain court and we have also inst enshi ated the chain court.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.620
Now,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.200
if we head back over to our AWS console and into our hyper allergic exporter and if you've

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.810
closed that,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.760
you can go ahead and go back into the cloud formation and into the outputs and you can find

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.720
that hyperlink explorer you are.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.850
They're gonna go ahead and click on the URL or bring up the APP Rose Explorer and just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.720
click on Refresh.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.220
If you're already there and and then once you're there,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.480
the first thing you'll notice is that one additional block has been added to the

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.590
transaction to now there are there should be four blocks and five transactions.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.620
And if you head over to the block stab,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.850
You noticed that a new block has been added corresponding to the transaction I d.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.650
And this was the first transaction of that was instance she ated using our chain coat.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.030
And if you click on the transactions tell,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.860
you will see that the additional transaction listed here as well.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.140
And this time there is a specific time stamp with the specific transaction I d.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.460
So here,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.710
basically what we've done is we've installed our chain code.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.100
We've in Stan Shih ated our chain code on Weaken Monitor that using our hyper ledger

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.910
explorer
