00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
Not that our fabric network on a club for information template has launched and provisioned

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.820
our network altogether.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.660
You guys can see everything has been completed.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.990
We can use the hyper let's explore to view the current status off our network.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.530
Now,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
this is basically a monitoring tools that allows you to view the blocks and transaction

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.260
transactions on the network.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.180
At this point in time,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.040
I wants me and I want you observe the log messages.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.880
You can see that the formation is complete and want to do that.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
If you click on the output section,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.770
it's going to hold certain pieces of information and key value pairs that resulted from the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.950
creation of the stack.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.340
Now there's several different ones.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.840
Several compares available in the output sections.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.120
The one that we are concerned with is the U.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.470
R L.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.560
For our hyper ledger.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.250
Explorer.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.660
Explorer is basically a browser based application that allows you to visualize parts of

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.380
your network,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.510
your Blockchain network,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.770
the transactions that have been executed,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.840
the blocks that have been created and so on.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.460
So we're gonna go ahead and click on the U R L to launch the Explorer A Z goods could see

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.100
that the Explorer is running on Port 80 80 of the EEC two instance.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.980
And if you remember,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.060
this is one of the Pacific ports that we allowed when we created the security groups.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.790
If you did not allow this port,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550
this clicking on this link will not work for you.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.690
So you have to make sure that this is why we allowed that specific Lincoln.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.760
I'm trying to bring everything together for you just to make you aware off wide those

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.890
prerequisites steps are required in order to launch the hyper alleged network.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.160
Now this is the Explorer,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.790
the high projects poorer and by default,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.000
it's gonna open up to into the main dashboard that gives you the basic information about

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.070
your Blockchain network.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.230
You can see it there.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.880
Three nodes in the network which refer to the or the three org's when we're creating the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.580
stack and three per appears belong to the tree from organizations and in essence,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.160
three blocks have been created.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.140
You can also see that there are four transactions that have been created are that have been

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.270
conducted for this high policy network of these blocks,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.410
and transactions were added as we provisioned the network if you And if you see on the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.740
bottom,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.370
you can see the few graphs that contain some analytics or some basic analytics at this

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.650
point in time for your network.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.490
And obviously,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.490
as you use the network,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.090
these analytics will be populated with more meaningful information.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.510
Now blocks per hour,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.520
the blocks permitted.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.000
As you can see,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.050
everything is basically empty,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.450
since nothing's been done other than provisioning on this specific network.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.930
There's also a pie chart you guys can see on the right hand of the screen,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.390
which shows you how many transactions have been initiated and executed by each organization

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.350
in the network.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.700
Then you can also see the first few blocks that were added when this network was was

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.520
provisioned.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.430
There's also a paragraph and all other information that gives you a basic overview about

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.750
your Blockchain network.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.980
Now,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.600
if you click on the network on the top,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.520
you can see that each of the piers air connected to the other two and you see that the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.220
names of the piers here now they all have a prefix off Pier zero,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.660
and the peers belong to either either one of those three organizations now the request.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.810
You,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.430
Earl off to the right of each pier gives you the port numbers at which each periods

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.150
listening and they're either 70518051 or 9051 And if you click on the blocks stack on the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.330
top to view the blocks that make up the block chain,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.570
you can see that we're exploring the Hyperloop Explorer,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.700
and additional block has been added.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.930
And if you click on the transactions tab,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.070
you'll see all the transactions that have been executed so far.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.730
And you see if the network itself has executed four transactions on the public Network,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.880
which is referred to as my channel because I left it as the default and there is no creator

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.970
or transaction idea associated with with any of these transactions.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.640
So there we have it.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.140
Um,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.170
this is basically the hyper let's explore that we can use to monitor the basics off the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.550
Blockchain network in terms of what's going on,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.390
what transaction I've been conducted and who have there been conducted with
