00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
technology is moving at a real fast pace and you're still committed to the acute code of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.200
Java.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.850
They're not living in the current world.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.420
Change is a rule of life,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.180
so take a step ahead and move into a revolutionary new world where block chain technology

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.380
is one of the leading technologies of the world.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.600
Surely will take some time to learn how the technology works,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.050
but it's the technology of the future.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.380
Hi,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.950
everybody.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.390
Welcome to building block chains with hyper ledger fabric and composer.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330
My name is Kasim Pasha,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.130
and I've been involved in the world of artificial intelligence for a course of time.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.350
Now,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.830
working with enterprise organizations across the globe and digitizing their operations,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.100
I've been able to utilize my skills to empower organizations by using the benefits of AI,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.250
including Black Jake.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.950
Now PWC,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.140
a large consulting firm,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.310
did a recent survey with leading organizations across the globe,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.930
and a whopping 84% of the respondents said they're involved with Blockchain in one form or

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.300
another,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.750
and now is the time to get involved with this technology.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.760
According to another research on Lee,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.110
half a percent of the population is using Blockchain,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.820
but the interest that is,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.890
about 50% are using the Internet due to the popularity of Bitcoin.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.300
Blockchain has witnessed a great boom in the past few years,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.640
and this is the perfect force for you to get started in learning Blockchain and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.580
specifically learning through the use of hyper ledger.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.690
Now they're two men from's in black.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.550
Check it William and Hyper lecture.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.850
Let me walk you through the brief course agenda.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.690
So atrium is the most widely used because Bitcoin is based on this particular platform.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.510
But as you will see,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.700
hyper Ledger is gaining momentum in today's Blockchain technology because it is being

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.290
adopted by organizations and not just crypto currencies.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.530
So if you were in a business environment,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.900
Piper Ledger is the way to go now.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.560
During the duration of this course,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.120
we're going to look at what our block chains and give you a solid introduction to the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.900
technology to the components and what makes the technology work.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.510
Next part of our course agenda is that we'll take a look at the hyper leisure and the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.640
framework it offers.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.750
On top of the block chain technology.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.860
We look at the tools that are available for us to create black 10 networks and how simple

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.770
it is to create a basic Blockchain application.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.580
Now demonstrate that all hands on lastly,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.360
as a bonus,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.530
have included for you guys a riel demonstration on how we can deploy Blockchain application

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.950
into the real world by using Blockchain technology provided by Microsoft or through

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.990
Microsoft Azure.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.440
So by the end of this course,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.440
you'll be comfortable with Blockchain technology as it is done through the hyper ledger

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.910
framework.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.470
And most importantly,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.390
you will know how to deploy an application into the real world using technology.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.810
So the time to learn Blockchain is now and the time to learning who hyper ledger is just

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.260
the beginning.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.530
So be at the forefront of the Blockchain wave and capitalize on your knowledge.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.020
Increase your skill set.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.650
I value your feedback.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.960
You have any questions?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.110
I'll be delighted to answer and walk you through this new technology.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.950
So what are you waiting for?
