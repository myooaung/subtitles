00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
everybody.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.070
So at this point time we have a VPC created.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.560
We have our security group created,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.740
and we also have a keys.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.500
The next step before launching our hyper other template,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.120
is creating policies and rolls.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.620
So that's what we're going to go ahead and do.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.050
Policy is basically what holds the set off permissions that the rule allows.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.470
We're going to use the role to give the easy to instance that's gonna host are hyper ledger

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.490
that's gonna always or hyper ledger access to other AWS services that it might need to use

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.630
now,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
in order to create roles and attach policies to those roles,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.270
we're gonna go ahead.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.740
Do is go is navigate to our I am,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.300
which is identity and access management link from the services menu and on the left hand

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.740
aside,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.630
you guys can see that there's an option for policies.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.840
We're gonna go ahead and click on the policies.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.860
Policy on AWS is basically a set of permissions and permissions.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.670
Make up a policy policies air then associated with roles,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.900
and those roles are what we assigned to specific resource is such as easy to instances.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.490
So I'm gonna go ahead and create a new policy,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.120
and this will take us to the policy editor.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.490
Now we can specify the contents are far policy about using a nice visual editor,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.350
Or we can use a simple Jason.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.370
No,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.410
it depends on your preference.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.330
You can use a visual editor or Jason.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.090
I'm not Gordon and use Jason Option and specified policies using that.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.410
Now,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.170
keep in mind if you do use a Jason,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.500
you have to follow the formatting and specifications that Jason allows us.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.950
If you're not familiar with the Jason Formatting and the specs,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.250
then I would suggest taking with the visual editor for most of your policies.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.070
The permissions that make up this specific policy are also available in a W.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.680
You can always copy and paste from from there also,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.890
or you can use your own.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.620
If you take a look at the Jason Policy,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.640
you can see that it grants permissions to the CCR,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.420
which is the elastic container registry,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.670
which which is gonna hold Steve Docker containers,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.350
which we're going to use to provisioned the fabric network.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.690
Now the permissions also give the instance access to ask three buckets Now,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.310
once you have the policy set up we're gonna go ahead and click on their view button,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.780
and this will take us to the page where we can specify I name for our policies as we can

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.150
keep it differentiated.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.190
And if you scroll to the bottom,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.780
you can see the summary of the permissions that are associated with this policy.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.050
Once we're happy with that,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.360
we're gonna go and click on create and then we can see that are easy to policy or for the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.690
fabric has been created.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.920
And the next step is going to be to create a role that is associated with this specific

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.620
policy.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.520
Now,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.590
an AWS role is basically a set of policies on.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.930
Then,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.680
like I mentioned,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500
policies are the ones that contain permissions,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.970
which is what we just assigned.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.780
So gonna click on rules on the left hand side and we're gonna click on,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.840
create a role,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.780
and we're going to create a brand new rule here.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.490
And we need to specify what kind of service will use this role.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.280
And for us,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.240
it's going to be an easy two instance.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.610
Now,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.540
if you're married forever,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.640
that are Blockchain template is going to spin up a single easy to instance that's gonna

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.640
hold the containers for hosting the nose off our fabric network.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.640
I'm gonna go and click next,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.880
and this will take us to where I can set up permissions that are going to associate it with

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.730
this role and permissions are specified as policies,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.780
and we can use the search to search for a specific policies that we want to grant and which

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.660
is we're going to serve the policy that we just created.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.660
Don't you do that when I go and click on next and will take us to a page where we can

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.550
review the role that we just set up to make sure we're happy with it,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.510
and then we can go ahead and click on finish,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.290
others going to create a new rule for us.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.070
And then you can also see all the details by our this robot clicking.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.190
By clicking on it,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.900
you can see what is specifically associated with it,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.080
what is linked with it,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.100
And one thing that you want to do is in the summary.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.600
You want to make sure you copy the instance profile RN and keep it in a safe place because

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.870
we're going to need this when we're provisioning are hyper alleged network.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.800
And when we're provisioning,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.410
our template will need to refer to this air.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.740
And because it will need to use a role to spin up that easy to instance and granted

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.430
permissions to make sure you copy this air and in a note peb and because we will use it for

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.250
our upcoming A lab.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.250
There's so you don't have to go back and find it all over again.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.960
So that's it,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.320
eh?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.280
So just to recap,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.150
what we basically did is we created a role and to create a policy and we attested toe are

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.500
easy to instance.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.000
Now just keep in mind that we need to do this in order for the high profile template,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.970
which we're going to be spending up to have sufficient permissions to interact with.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.020
The resource is within AWS
