00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
Hi,

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.070
everybody,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.870
and welcome to this lesson on hyper ledger.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.390
So when we talk about Blockchain,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.660
it's a wonder talk or Blockchain technology as a whole,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.730
the framework that's most widely used and more on most familiar to everybody's ethereum

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.710
because that's the one that's used for Bitcoin.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.000
But high pledge of frameworks are gaining popularity very quickly amongst a lot of users.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.680
Sunday's lesson will look at what century is hyper ledger.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.190
We'll talk about a collaborative project that it entails,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.590
and we'll look at the different frameworks and tools that hyper ledger offers.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.490
So what is hyper ledger?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.120
Essentially,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.020
Hyper ledger,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.550
according to its own website,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.920
isn't is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross industry Blockchain

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.850
Technologies.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.240
It's a global collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.440
including organization leaders from finance banking i O.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.030
T.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.970
Supply chain manufacturing technology and someone.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.820
So it's not a single framework.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.050
It's not a Cryptocurrency,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.750
and it's and it's not a single company,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.280
basically a collaborative framework that offered and developed by the Linux Foundation,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.200
to be used in the Blockchain technology as a whole.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.620
Not simply put,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.600
high pillagers is essentially an umbrella project off open source Blockchain platforms and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.540
tools toe work with Blockchain technology.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.510
The Learning Foundation started the Heiple as a project back in 2015 and it became a

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.670
collaborative umbrella project containing many blocking frameworks.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.620
It brings together developers who are experts in the Blockchain technology that come from

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.080
various industries.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.320
So the really understand how to use the Blockchain technology specific to their industry.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.240
And I think of hype,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.380
alleges a project where communities off software developers and companies from different

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.020
industries come together,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.990
coordinate and built Blockchain frameworks and tools to be used across the High Plaza

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.550
Project.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.680
As far as a Blockchain is concerned,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.170
there's no one size fits.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
All different industries have different requirements from the Blockchain,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.170
which means it requires different frameworks for different use cases such as finance i o.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.570
T.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.150
Manufacturing and so on.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.920
The developers working on the hyper leisure open source are specialists in their industries

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.920
,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.860
and they build Blockchain and tools Pacific to their use case because that's what they

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.680
understand well,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.450
and that's what they know how to do well.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.400
Now there are over 100 different companies that essentially part off the hyper alleged

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.030
project,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.350
so it was a huge Global Collaborative project.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.310
The high blood offers an umbrella off Blockchain framers that you can pick and choose based

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.650
on your use case.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.700
As you see here,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.790
it offers five main framers say you can use to build your enterprise applications.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.240
There's a high polyester fabric,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.490
which is an enterprise grade permission to framework with low latency and high throughput

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.560
of transactions,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.750
and all nodes participating in the fabric network are known and identified.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.570
So at this point in time,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.320
fabric is probably the most widely used and stable out of the hyper ledger framework.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.670
You specifically to mitigate many of the concerns our own earthy um,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.450
it's a permission list platform,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.720
which uses a very computational intensive proof of work a longer than for consensus,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.130
which we talked about consensus in the previous module.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.310
Next is a sawtooth platform,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.890
which not this platform is used on large networks and for fast conversions of contents is a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.670
long rhythms.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.230
It has a clear separation off system and APP development,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.650
which makes buildings decentralized APs a lot easier.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.120
It's specifically targeted for large enterprises because it has modular design that allow

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.470
users to choose transaction processing rules,

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.450
permanent permission ing and consensus a longer them based on their use.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.070
Kate maybe also Arrojo,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.750
which is a fast and performance Blockchain network with a focus on building,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.700
perhaps for mobile use cases.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.300
There's also the borough,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.560
which,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.700
which is a modular Blockchain client.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.450
It's developed on a special version off Ethereum Virtual Machines or E V M for short.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.970
Then we have Indy,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.860
which is which specializes in identity management.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.550
It provides tools,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.070
libraries and reusable components to construct independent digital identities for

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.890
participants of the network.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.120
So those are the basic frameworks that are offered by hyper Ledger.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.090
Along with his framer Come a bunch of tools that we can use to develop our maps and make

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.970
our lives but easier Now I'll just talk about a few of from that that we will look at and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.260
throughout the duration of this course.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.870
1st 1 is the composer,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.100
which offers a U I based development tools to make developing Blockchain APs lot easier.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.820
It's basically a G Y interface,

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.880
click and goal where you can fill out forms in a very easy to use ur interface to model

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.030
resource is transactions and participants in your network it uses the hyper ledger fabric

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.050
as the execution run time to build decentralized APS.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.110
Then we have the cello,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.380
which offers deployment as a service facility to make it easier for you to create,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.730
manage and terminate Blockchain networks.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.550
It's a commander on either on a cloud or on your local network or local data center.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.270
And lastly,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.950
the Caliber,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.100
which offers a Siris of benchmark tests that allow you to measure the performance of a

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.250
specific Blockchain implementation.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.920
It's a set of pre defined use cases that caliber will run against your Blockchain network

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.420
to test its performance.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.350
So all of these tools coming in very handy when you're developing a Blockchain network or

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.620
when you're developing APS hosted on a Blockchain network,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.490
they've made life a lot easier for us.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.670
So thank you for joining me on this on this Oreo off what hyper leisure technology is and

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.770
how it came about.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.220
I hope you guys got a good Oreo off the different frameworks and tools that hyper ledger

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.120
has to offer.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.340
So let's go ahead and look at how we can implement and develop APS using hyper ledger
