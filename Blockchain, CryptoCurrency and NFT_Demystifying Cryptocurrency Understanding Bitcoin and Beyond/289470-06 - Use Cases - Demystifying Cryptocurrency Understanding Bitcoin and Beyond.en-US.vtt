00:00.000 --> 00:03.330
Let's dive right into some of the use cases of

00:03.330 --> 00:06.855
how this technology and how these assets are being applied.

00:06.855 --> 00:10.110
Because I love frameworks and because I love numbering things,

00:10.110 --> 00:13.260
we're going to talk about three primary use cases today.

00:13.260 --> 00:16.860
Number one is the store of value use case.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.745
Number two is the medium of exchange or payments use case.

00:20.745 --> 00:26.070
Number three is the distributed ledger or technology use case. Sound good?

00:26.070 --> 00:30.445
Let's dive in. The first use case is store of value.

00:30.445 --> 00:32.150
Now, throughout human history,

00:32.150 --> 00:35.845
people have used all sorts of things to denote value.

00:35.845 --> 00:38.350
Some of them are interesting cases.

00:38.350 --> 00:40.005
On the island of Yap,

00:40.005 --> 00:44.210
people used really large stones called Rai stones to denote value.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.520
People use shells, salt, furs,

00:47.520 --> 00:52.220
silk, spices and things like gold to store value.

00:52.220 --> 00:58.700
Now, the idea underlying bitcoin and digital currencies is the idea that something like

00:58.700 --> 01:01.460
bitcoin is an equivalent of digital gold or

01:01.460 --> 01:05.435
maybe even the equivalent of having a Swiss bank account in your pocket.

01:05.435 --> 01:11.464
The idea that you can own money that isn't controlled by any government or state,

01:11.464 --> 01:14.645
that has limited supply, is highly fungible,

01:14.645 --> 01:16.940
it's divisible and easy to transport,

01:16.940 --> 01:19.400
all you need is a cell phone or

01:19.400 --> 01:23.930
hardware wallets makes it really compelling as a digital store of value.

01:23.930 --> 01:28.865
We see this expressed not only with bitcoin but with other digital currencies like Zcash,

01:28.865 --> 01:32.495
Monero and Dash that focus on user privacy.

01:32.495 --> 01:36.920
There are also new implementations of store value that take

01:36.920 --> 01:42.620
real physical assets and make them digital representations using blockchain technology.

01:42.620 --> 01:46.850
One interesting example that I find entertaining is the idea of taking

01:46.850 --> 01:52.965
physical gold and digitizing its ownership through a blockchain-based smart contract.

01:52.965 --> 01:55.880
There's been a lot of discussion how to implement this,

01:55.880 --> 02:01.215
and there are a lot of interesting ways the digitization of other stores of value,

02:01.215 --> 02:03.920
physical stores of value can start to create

02:03.920 --> 02:07.385
interesting opportunities for how people store,

02:07.385 --> 02:12.290
manage, transact and trade and otherwise deal with these assets.

02:12.290 --> 02:18.740
The next use case is medium of exchange or basically a fancy way of saying payments.

02:18.740 --> 02:22.160
One of the things we talked about earlier is that one of the shortcomings

02:22.160 --> 02:25.600
of the Internet is that it never had a native payment currency.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.220
What this means is there have been a number of companies that have

02:28.220 --> 02:30.800
sprung up starting with PayPal and

02:30.800 --> 02:35.600
extending to many other companies such as Zoom and TransferWise that have all the time to

02:35.600 --> 02:38.000
resolve some of the fundamental challenges of

02:38.000 --> 02:40.720
the different payment networks that exist in our world today.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.755
Now, banks use something called the correspondent banking system or SWIFT,

02:45.755 --> 02:47.720
where they have an actual network where they

02:47.720 --> 02:50.755
communicate with one another and send of value to one another.

02:50.755 --> 02:54.950
However, one of the fundamental challenges that I have if I use PayPal and

02:54.950 --> 02:59.270
my friend uses Venmo is that one of us has to join the other person's network.

02:59.270 --> 03:02.000
It's very difficult for people to transact on

03:02.000 --> 03:05.435
a day-to-day basis if they're not part of the same payment network.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.900
Payments in our world are still very complicated,

03:08.900 --> 03:11.680
not just for individuals but also for companies.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.400
Companies spend billions, if not trillions,

03:14.400 --> 03:15.630
of dollars every year,

03:15.630 --> 03:19.220
moving money around the world between not only themselves and

03:19.220 --> 03:21.810
the different affiliate entities they have in different countries

03:21.810 --> 03:25.010
but between their suppliers and their end customers.

03:25.010 --> 03:27.530
There are a lot of opportunities that people are exploring to

03:27.530 --> 03:30.440
use both blockchain technology and

03:30.440 --> 03:33.620
digital currencies to make it easier to move money around

03:33.620 --> 03:37.370
the world and to remit money from one country to another.

03:37.370 --> 03:40.940
The last use case I'll talk about is the distributed ledger,

03:40.940 --> 03:44.105
really focusing on the core technology innovation

03:44.105 --> 03:47.500
and less so the digital asset or digital currency itself.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.875
If we think about changing business models,

03:49.875 --> 03:52.665
one of the things we talked about in one of the prior lessons,

03:52.665 --> 03:54.510
there are a lot of opportunities to use

03:54.510 --> 03:57.830
blockchain technology to change the way that companies operate.

03:57.830 --> 04:01.925
At its core, there are two things that companies try to do when they innovate.

04:01.925 --> 04:06.895
Number one is to drive new business lines or create new sources of revenue,

04:06.895 --> 04:08.990
which is increasing the top line.

04:08.990 --> 04:12.880
The second is to cut costs and find ways to be more efficient,

04:12.880 --> 04:17.855
which is optimizing the bottom line or what's leftover after you take revenues,

04:17.855 --> 04:20.570
subtract out expenses you're left with the bottom line.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.850
So, what are the ways that companies are leveraging

04:22.850 --> 04:25.880
blockchain technology to try to do those two things?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.980
First of all, there are a lot of opportunities to

04:27.980 --> 04:30.290
use blockchain technology or the idea of

04:30.290 --> 04:33.260
distributed ledgers or one source of the truth to

04:33.260 --> 04:37.250
optimize the way that companies manage their back-office and their reporting.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.625
If we think about all of the different functions in a business,

04:40.625 --> 04:44.620
a lot of what people in a business do is ticking and tying accounting,

04:44.620 --> 04:48.255
making sure that everything adds up and records the way it should.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.720
This is why we have triple entry accounting and

04:50.720 --> 04:53.270
a lot of really complex bookkeeping systems,

04:53.270 --> 04:57.025
enterprise data management systems and so on and so forth.

04:57.025 --> 05:00.560
A number of entrepreneurs are building new technology tools typically

05:00.560 --> 05:03.860
deployed as enterprise software to try to leverage some

05:03.860 --> 05:07.070
of the features of a blockchain to bring efficiency to all of

05:07.070 --> 05:11.495
the processes that a corporation has in its back and middle office.

05:11.495 --> 05:13.939
There also is that companies are using

05:13.939 --> 05:16.820
blockchain technology to create new business lines.

05:16.820 --> 05:20.150
For example, by offering new types of software to users,

05:20.150 --> 05:24.050
by creating new types of products and services and by thinking about ways that

05:24.050 --> 05:28.525
they could leverage blockchain technology to create new opportunities.

05:28.525 --> 05:33.020
So, what types of companies are actually using blockchain technology?

05:33.020 --> 05:34.730
Well, I'm going to focus on

05:34.730 --> 05:38.905
just the crypto asset component because that's what I'm passionate about.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.540
Let's look at some of the brand names here that are

05:41.540 --> 05:44.750
using crypto assets as a store of value,

05:44.750 --> 05:49.625
as a medium of exchange and as a core innovation in business processes.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.375
Let's look at the company Square for example.

05:52.375 --> 05:55.490
Square is a company that's focused on payment space.

05:55.490 --> 05:59.210
What Square did is they launched the ability for users of their platform to

05:59.210 --> 06:03.070
trade bitcoin in their cash app in November of 2017.

06:03.070 --> 06:06.110
The company's stated that it supports bitcoin as part of

06:06.110 --> 06:09.305
a long-term push towards providing more financial access.

06:09.305 --> 06:13.010
The impact of this is the stock price of Square has gone through the roof.

06:13.010 --> 06:17.270
It's up 90 percent year to date and Square generated $70 million

06:17.270 --> 06:21.680
in revenue from its crypto business alone in the second quarter of 2018.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.140
As a result, Square is growing three times

06:24.140 --> 06:27.160
faster than one of its largest competitors Venmo,

06:27.160 --> 06:28.715
which is owned by PayPal.

06:28.715 --> 06:32.330
Let's talk about new investment opportunities and the ability to take

06:32.330 --> 06:37.235
physical assets and digitize them using digital currencies and blockchain technology.

06:37.235 --> 06:42.320
The St. Regis Hotel chain recently did a security token offering,

06:42.320 --> 06:45.800
where they offered shares of common stock in

06:45.800 --> 06:50.015
their Aspen property using a digital currency or a token.

06:50.015 --> 06:53.420
Each token represents one share of common stock in the property and

06:53.420 --> 06:57.070
these tokens can be purchased with either US dollars or with bitcoin.

06:57.070 --> 06:59.280
Now, while this is still an early experiment,

06:59.280 --> 07:01.100
what will be interesting to observe is

07:01.100 --> 07:04.340
how many investors will actually be able to participate in this offering.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.130
The idea being that a wider group of investors will now

07:07.130 --> 07:10.105
be able to participate in opportunities like these.

07:10.105 --> 07:15.020
There's also the idea that shares will be more liquid if they're tradeable as tokens.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.410
The idea is that ownership in this property, hopefully over time,

07:18.410 --> 07:21.320
will become more widely distributed because the asset is

07:21.320 --> 07:24.680
easier to access and there's an active secondary market for it.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.130
The idea is that security offerings like these that are

07:28.130 --> 07:31.565
regulated and issued through regulated exchanges in platforms

07:31.565 --> 07:34.385
will create new investment opportunities and take

07:34.385 --> 07:39.040
some currently liquid asset classes and make them more liquid or more investable.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.295
Let's look at payments and remittance or the medium of exchange use case.

07:43.295 --> 07:47.960
There's a company called Coins.ph based in the Philippines that's actually

07:47.960 --> 07:50.300
using digital currency as the back-end for

07:50.300 --> 07:53.125
their digital payments service in Southeast Asia.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.760
They actually received the first digital money license

07:55.760 --> 07:57.770
in the Philippines and have been working closely with

07:57.770 --> 08:00.260
regulators to bring this technology to users in

08:00.260 --> 08:03.080
the region and the impact is pretty compelling.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.720
The company has over five million users in

08:05.720 --> 08:10.970
Southeast Asia and in 2018 saw tripling of its user base,

08:10.970 --> 08:13.295
which is quite impressive for any company.

08:13.295 --> 08:16.940
They have over 10,000 partner locations in Southeast Asia,

08:16.940 --> 08:22.850
where users can go and deposit cash-in or get cash-out in exchange for digital tokens.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.520
What's really interesting as well is that when users

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
see when they use the platform it's not cryptocurrency.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.155
They see their local currency.

08:30.155 --> 08:34.720
This is an important example of how user experience will impact adoption.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.270
By making these products and platforms easy to use,

08:38.270 --> 08:40.970
we may actually see digital currencies being used by

08:40.970 --> 08:44.960
consumers who don't even know that it's powering some of the applications they're using.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.850
The last concepts we talked about are

08:46.850 --> 08:50.480
the digitization of business models is another interesting one.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.980
I want to talk briefly about Rakuten which is a Japanese e-commerce company that

08:54.980 --> 08:59.665
owns a wide range of businesses all focused on online marketplaces.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.350
Rakuten has announced their plans to create something called Rakuten

09:03.350 --> 09:07.715
coin that's going to be used as part of the company's points-based reward system.

09:07.715 --> 09:12.290
These coins will be usable within and across each of Rakutens' many businesses.

09:12.290 --> 09:16.250
What's interesting to note here from an impact perspective is that Rakuten has over

09:16.250 --> 09:20.690
1.1 billion members across a 190 countries.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.720
That's a massive target audience and could speed

09:23.720 --> 09:27.485
the adoption of digital currencies with such a wide user base.

09:27.485 --> 09:30.200
They also had global gross transaction volume of

09:30.200 --> 09:33.605
96 billion across their businesses in 2016.

09:33.605 --> 09:36.800
So, digitizing some or all of that flow molecularly

09:36.800 --> 09:40.640
results to material savings and new opportunities for this business.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.600
In concept, what they're trying to do is focus on extending

09:44.600 --> 09:49.340
the edges of the Rakuten network and keeping more value within parts of that network.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.250
We're seeing this across a number of businesses that have

09:52.250 --> 09:55.350
traditionally had ecosystems that are connected say,

09:55.350 --> 09:57.890
for example, the Apple ecosystem but have

09:57.890 --> 10:02.060
payment systems that are decoupled or specific to each application.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.580
By creating a unified payment experience or

10:04.580 --> 10:09.035
an embedded payment experience that's native to all of these applications and ecosystems,

10:09.035 --> 10:12.110
companies can think of new ways to extend their business model,

10:12.110 --> 10:15.305
reach new users or keep more users on their platform.

10:15.305 --> 10:21.275
It's important to recognize that technology itself isn't moral or ethical in any way.

10:21.275 --> 10:24.010
Technology isn't inherently good or bad,

10:24.010 --> 10:27.320
but it is important to note that there are ways that this technology

10:27.320 --> 10:31.310
can be used to do things that maybe take rights away from people.

10:31.310 --> 10:35.450
Therefore, the ethics of how we create and implement this technology is

10:35.450 --> 10:39.530
very important to ensuring it's used in ways that benefit people.

10:39.530 --> 10:42.170
One of the things that we can do in order to

10:42.170 --> 10:45.590
ensure we actually understand how we're participating in and

10:45.590 --> 10:48.830
contributing to some of these projects is to examine some of

10:48.830 --> 10:52.475
the incentives at play when we support specific digital currencies,

10:52.475 --> 10:55.670
protocols, networks or blockchain products.

10:55.670 --> 10:59.899
It's important to understand how the project or product makes money,

10:59.899 --> 11:03.775
who benefits from that flow of money and how that money is being used.

11:03.775 --> 11:06.425
Now, again these things are difficult to untangle

11:06.425 --> 11:09.470
but understanding some of the relationships between the flows

11:09.470 --> 11:11.780
of money and who has control to make

11:11.780 --> 11:15.110
what changes are important to ensuring that the assets we

11:15.110 --> 11:18.350
hold and the technologies we use don't support

11:18.350 --> 11:21.815
projects that may not actually align with our ideologies.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.690
This also goes back to the concept of

11:23.690 --> 11:27.460
social scalability that we mentioned at the beginning of this class.

11:27.460 --> 11:30.680
Next, we'll be talking about the life-cycle of

11:30.680 --> 11:35.610
a crypto asset and how new cryptocurrencies are born or created.
