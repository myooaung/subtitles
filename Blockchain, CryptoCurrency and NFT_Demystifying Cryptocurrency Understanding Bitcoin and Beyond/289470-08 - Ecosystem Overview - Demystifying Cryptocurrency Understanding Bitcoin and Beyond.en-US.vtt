00:00.000 --> 00:04.515
So, how does the cryptoasset ecosystem actually work?

00:04.515 --> 00:07.530
Who are the people that are actually building these things,

00:07.530 --> 00:10.110
buying these things, investing in them,

00:10.110 --> 00:12.720
regulating them, and using them?

00:12.720 --> 00:18.180
What impact is all this going to have on your life today? Let's talk about it.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.750
As we talked about in the last segment on the cryptoasset life cycle,

00:21.750 --> 00:24.225
there are a lot of people who are focused on creating

00:24.225 --> 00:26.820
blockchain technology and cryptoassets.

00:26.820 --> 00:30.875
Typically, the people who are creating these things are developers.

00:30.875 --> 00:33.965
In some cases, protocol developers might also be

00:33.965 --> 00:38.600
asset issuers if their protocol happens to have a native cryptoasset.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.460
These are often organized as

00:40.460 --> 00:45.185
nonprofit foundations companies or loosely organized communities.

00:45.185 --> 00:47.015
For example, in bitcoin,

00:47.015 --> 00:49.730
a lot of protocol development work is done by

00:49.730 --> 00:53.965
a core group of five or so individuals create a lot of the code base.

00:53.965 --> 00:56.585
There is also a public online process

00:56.585 --> 00:59.840
called the BIP process or the Bitcoin Improvement Process,

00:59.840 --> 01:02.750
whereby anyone can submit changes to the protocol,

01:02.750 --> 01:04.025
have them peer reviewed,

01:04.025 --> 01:06.035
and if approved, actually have that code

01:06.035 --> 01:09.190
integrated into the core bitcoin code repository.

01:09.190 --> 01:13.415
Next, as we move from the protocol layer up to the network layer,

01:13.415 --> 01:15.770
there are network service providers.

01:15.770 --> 01:17.510
So, for example, in bitcoin,

01:17.510 --> 01:18.650
these are called miners,

01:18.650 --> 01:21.215
because they engaged in a process called mining,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.870
whereby they provide computational services to

01:23.870 --> 01:26.980
the network to process bitcoin transactions.

01:26.980 --> 01:31.130
In other protocols, there are different services like staking pools,

01:31.130 --> 01:33.980
validation services, and so on and so forth.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.330
But really what this means,

01:35.330 --> 01:38.164
there are different service providers that enable

01:38.164 --> 01:41.890
the network tag to be created in physical compute space.

01:41.890 --> 01:46.080
Next, the application layer or the last layer of the blockchain stack,

01:46.080 --> 01:49.730
we have entrepreneurs and companies for building applications.

01:49.730 --> 01:54.590
Now, a lot of these applications that are consumer-facing happened to be phone-based,

01:54.590 --> 01:56.690
meaning that I can go on my phone and interact with

01:56.690 --> 01:59.480
blockchain technologies or cryptoassets directly.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.420
But there are also applications that are enterprise-facing,

02:02.420 --> 02:05.195
where people are selling their services to businesses.

02:05.195 --> 02:09.200
There are also businesses that are being built that are focused

02:09.200 --> 02:13.155
on providing services to other cryptoassets-focused businesses,

02:13.155 --> 02:15.960
say PR companies, consulting firms,

02:15.960 --> 02:18.470
tax advisers, and so on and so forth.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.810
As you can imagine, there are a number of aspects of

02:20.810 --> 02:23.915
this ecosystem that are really unique and really experimental,

02:23.915 --> 02:26.450
and therefore require highly specialized expertise

02:26.450 --> 02:28.955
and knowledge from a group of industry professionals.

02:28.955 --> 02:32.600
There are a lot of service models that are focused on providing these types of

02:32.600 --> 02:36.620
advisory services and professional services to the crypto ecosystem,

02:36.620 --> 02:39.830
as well as more traditional businesses that are trying to understand

02:39.830 --> 02:43.820
how they might apply and leverage this business within their own organization.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.650
We have protocol developers,

02:46.650 --> 02:50.415
network maintainers, and we have application builders.

02:50.415 --> 02:54.185
But how is this stuff actually getting built and who's paying for it all?

02:54.185 --> 02:55.625
Well, first and foremost,

02:55.625 --> 02:57.890
they're venture investors or VCs who have

02:57.890 --> 03:00.365
typically funded a lot of entrepreneurial activity,

03:00.365 --> 03:02.050
especially here in the United States.

03:02.050 --> 03:07.040
A lot of the early work in the crypto community was funded by VC firms and VCs

03:07.040 --> 03:09.230
themselves as individual investors who

03:09.230 --> 03:12.410
supported the development of these early protocols and projects.

03:12.410 --> 03:16.580
There is also a large part of the cryptoasset community that actually participates in

03:16.580 --> 03:20.630
funding new protocol work by taking the existing cryptoassets they have,

03:20.630 --> 03:22.370
say bitcoin and ethereum,

03:22.370 --> 03:27.365
and reinvesting it into research and development on new protocols themselves.

03:27.365 --> 03:30.350
These are typically not traditional investors,

03:30.350 --> 03:34.090
but they're individual investors who are supporting these networks and services,

03:34.090 --> 03:37.475
Or they can also be called stakeholders in some of these protocols.

03:37.475 --> 03:40.790
There are a lot of new types of investors that are emerging as well.

03:40.790 --> 03:43.520
There are a number of venture funds that are specifically focused on

03:43.520 --> 03:46.595
just investing in cryptoasset and blockchain technology.

03:46.595 --> 03:50.660
There are also new types of investors that resemble more traditional hedge funds and make

03:50.660 --> 03:52.190
more speculative investments on

03:52.190 --> 03:55.625
just the cryptoassets and not the underlying technology itself.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.930
These new models are called crypto funds,

03:57.930 --> 04:00.010
and there's a lot of experimentation being done

04:00.010 --> 04:02.500
with how this asset management model might evolve.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.525
The next important part of this ecosystem is the press.

04:05.525 --> 04:08.090
The press has played a critical role in helping

04:08.090 --> 04:10.130
the general public understand and learn

04:10.130 --> 04:12.545
more about cryptoassets and blockchain technology,

04:12.545 --> 04:14.180
and also to share news of what

04:14.180 --> 04:16.885
enterprises and individuals are doing with this technology.

04:16.885 --> 04:19.185
Now, there has been a lot of bad reporting

04:19.185 --> 04:21.745
on digital currencies and blockchain technology,

04:21.745 --> 04:24.590
mostly because as you can hopefully gather from this course,

04:24.590 --> 04:27.260
there are a lot of complexities of this technology that are not that

04:27.260 --> 04:30.350
easy to understand or easy to communicate in a short article.

04:30.350 --> 04:34.640
However, there are a number of specialized news outlets that focus just on

04:34.640 --> 04:36.829
covering this particular industry

04:36.829 --> 04:39.695
and that's been a really interesting development to watch.

04:39.695 --> 04:43.095
There's also advocators, promoters, and educators.

04:43.095 --> 04:47.240
You may say that I'm an advocate for cryptocurrencies because I'm sitting here

04:47.240 --> 04:51.605
recording this class to help you learn about cryptoassets and blockchain technology.

04:51.605 --> 04:56.210
But there are a number of individuals in the ecosystem who spend their time on education,

04:56.210 --> 05:00.080
advocacy, and promoting the use and adoption of this technology.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.905
Some of them are compensated for their role and some of them are not.

05:03.905 --> 05:08.270
As I've mentioned, you can go to the resources section to see what projects

05:08.270 --> 05:12.710
I'm involved with and if I'm compensated for any promotional activity.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.540
Typically, I've shied away from this,

05:14.540 --> 05:17.330
but there are many people who play an important role in helping speed

05:17.330 --> 05:21.260
the adoption and awareness of these technologies through these types of rules.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.895
The next important category of the ecosystem is academia and the research community.

05:25.895 --> 05:28.250
As we've mentioned, there are a lot of the aspects of

05:28.250 --> 05:31.160
this technology that are still highly experimental,

05:31.160 --> 05:33.755
and this isn't just about technology itself.

05:33.755 --> 05:37.235
There are also profound implications on social, political,

05:37.235 --> 05:40.010
and economic structures in our world that are happening

05:40.010 --> 05:43.000
as a result of cryptoassets and blockchain technology.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.850
Therefore, it's important to take a multidisciplinary approach to really study,

05:47.850 --> 05:50.690
evaluating, and generating more data about

05:50.690 --> 05:54.110
the actual impacts this technology can have on systems in our world.

05:54.110 --> 05:58.160
That's where the academic community plays an important role in ensuring that

05:58.160 --> 06:00.860
rigorous peer-reviewed research is done on some of

06:00.860 --> 06:05.240
this technology and it's published in peer-reviewed academic journals.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.680
While historically the coverage of cryptoassets and blockchain technology in

06:09.680 --> 06:14.320
the research community has traditionally focused on computer science and cryptography,

06:14.320 --> 06:18.905
we're starting to see the emergence of new disciplines such as economics,

06:18.905 --> 06:24.505
behavioral ethics, and others being reflected in how this topic is covered by academia.

06:24.505 --> 06:28.310
Lastly, arguably the most important part of this ecosystem at

06:28.310 --> 06:32.975
this specific point in time is regulators and governments.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.005
Regulators and governments also play an important role

06:36.005 --> 06:38.990
in the developing cryptoasset and blockchain ecosystem.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.760
The financial system is one of

06:40.760 --> 06:44.275
the most regulated parts of our economy and for good reason.

06:44.275 --> 06:46.460
Finance and our relationships with

06:46.460 --> 06:49.610
financial firms play a very important role in our lives.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.550
As we witnessed from the 2008 financial crisis,

06:52.550 --> 06:55.550
having prudent regulation that protects consumers and

06:55.550 --> 06:59.600
markets is very important to maintaining a healthy market economy.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.600
Therefore, regulators are really paying attention

07:02.600 --> 07:05.405
to what's happening particularly around cryptoassets,

07:05.405 --> 07:08.045
which represents a new type of capital formation,

07:08.045 --> 07:09.470
and as I've already mentioned,

07:09.470 --> 07:11.480
a very high-risk speculative

07:11.480 --> 07:15.245
investment that could harm consumers if not carefully managed.

07:15.245 --> 07:17.870
In addition, governments are actively looking at

07:17.870 --> 07:20.270
ways to leverage blockchain technology and

07:20.270 --> 07:22.820
cryptoassets to improve their own processes

07:22.820 --> 07:25.540
and perhaps make their own governance more transparent.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.845
Or, in the case of Venezuela, as we've explored,

07:28.845 --> 07:30.629
and potentially other governments,

07:30.629 --> 07:33.110
blockchain technology can be leveraged to

07:33.110 --> 07:35.720
help the government exert more power over its citizens.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.355
It's very important to keep track of how regulators and governments in particular,

07:40.355 --> 07:45.160
are viewing this technology because they could have profound impacts on its development.

07:45.160 --> 07:50.960
Lastly, the most critical part of the blockchain ecosystem is you,

07:50.960 --> 07:56.120
the actual user, and the ultimate stakeholder in many of these systems.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.165
The fundamental idea underlying the idea

07:59.165 --> 08:02.180
of many of these cryptoassets we've spoken about and much of

08:02.180 --> 08:05.870
this blockchain technology concepts we've discussed is bringing

08:05.870 --> 08:10.240
self-sovereignty or bringing rights back to the individual user.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.190
Therefore, for this to actually work and for us to

08:13.190 --> 08:16.654
understand whether or not these experiments are actually productive,

08:16.654 --> 08:18.440
we need real people,

08:18.440 --> 08:20.995
you, to start using these things.

08:20.995 --> 08:23.690
Today, a lot of these products and services are still

08:23.690 --> 08:26.750
highly experimental and they're not that easy to use.

08:26.750 --> 08:30.470
This is a problem that's been discussed at length in the crypto ecosystem,

08:30.470 --> 08:33.320
and there is an increasing recognition that design and

08:33.320 --> 08:36.940
user behavior are really important fields to start focusing on.

08:36.940 --> 08:41.210
However, for us to understand how these things might work in the future,

08:41.210 --> 08:43.670
it's very important that they're actively used.

08:43.670 --> 08:48.350
Therefore, I would highly encourage you to try actually using some of these products,

08:48.350 --> 08:50.990
to try actually using some of these tools,

08:50.990 --> 08:54.350
and to provide real feedback as to whether or not they're useful.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.755
In a lot of cases,

08:55.755 --> 08:57.540
they may not yet be today,

08:57.540 --> 08:58.705
but in the future,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.800
it's impossible to develop these things to

09:00.800 --> 09:03.340
a point of maturity if there's no real feedback loop.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.670
Next, we'll discuss how you can get involved and stay

09:06.670 --> 09:11.520
up-to-date on all the interesting things that are happening in the crypto ecosystem.
