00:00.000 --> 00:07.290
Hi, my name is Meltem Demirors and I'm a cryptocurrency investor, advisor, and advocate.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.270
Part of my role in the crypto ecosystem is traveling around the world,

00:11.270 --> 00:15.885
speaking at conferences, speaking on TV, conducting interviews,

00:15.885 --> 00:19.225
and meeting with companies, governments, regulators,

00:19.225 --> 00:23.159
and investors to help them untangle some of the strange,

00:23.159 --> 00:27.255
interesting, and complex ideas that are being worked on in my industry.

00:27.255 --> 00:30.750
That's one of the most important things we can be learning about because it has

00:30.750 --> 00:35.625
a tremendous opportunity to impact numerous aspects of our world today,

00:35.625 --> 00:39.075
including economics, politics, markets,

00:39.075 --> 00:40.455
and society as a whole.

00:40.455 --> 00:43.220
This class is not an investment seminar,

00:43.220 --> 00:46.625
and it's definitely not a comprehensive deep dive into

00:46.625 --> 00:50.945
every facet of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology.

00:50.945 --> 00:55.805
What it is intended to be is a comprehensive overview of the technology,

00:55.805 --> 00:59.090
the use cases, the participants in the ecosystem,

00:59.090 --> 01:02.795
some of the particulars of how cryptoassets are created, distributed,

01:02.795 --> 01:07.265
and managed and why cryptoassets and blockchain technology matter.

01:07.265 --> 01:09.050
Along with all of that information,

01:09.050 --> 01:12.770
we'll try to give you some practical resources along the way to further your learning

01:12.770 --> 01:16.745
and to help you explore particular aspects of the class that you find interesting.

01:16.745 --> 01:19.925
Note that this course is based on one person's perspective,

01:19.925 --> 01:24.485
mine, and that I'm an investor in multiple companies in this industry.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.695
I disclose all of my investments, holdings,

01:27.695 --> 01:30.679
and relationships with companies on my personal website,

01:30.679 --> 01:34.025
which is also linked in the resources section of this course.

01:34.025 --> 01:36.830
None of my comments in this course are intended to promote or

01:36.830 --> 01:40.100
prioritize one asset or one technology over another.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.070
My goal in creating this class is simply to

01:43.070 --> 01:47.660
demystify cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for you.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.950
Hopefully, you'll go out into the world and feel much more confident that you are able to

01:51.950 --> 01:56.555
understand some of the basic concepts of how this technology works and why it matters,

01:56.555 --> 01:59.240
and to cut through a lot of the jargon and hype that make it

01:59.240 --> 02:02.390
difficult to get to the core of the issues people discuss.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.820
I'm glad you joined the class. Let's get started.
