00:00.000 --> 00:03.195
A blockchain, as the name implies,

00:03.195 --> 00:06.255
is a chain of blocks of information.

00:06.255 --> 00:10.410
These blocks can contain information about a number of different things.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.990
But in the Bitcoin network for example,

00:12.990 --> 00:16.560
blocks contain information about Bitcoin transactions.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.980
You can also embed other types of data into these blocks.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.040
But really, at the heart of the Bitcoin blockchain,

00:23.040 --> 00:29.880
the mechanism at work is a chronological and timestamped distributed ledger,

00:29.880 --> 00:34.740
meaning everyone in the network has a copy of that information that

00:34.740 --> 00:37.800
attests to the state of the network and

00:37.800 --> 00:41.300
the history of transactions that have happened in that network.

00:41.300 --> 00:45.245
The reason this matters is trust and truth.

00:45.245 --> 00:49.400
If you think about the way that we keep track of financial information today,

00:49.400 --> 00:53.130
it's typically very difficult to identify where money moved,

00:53.130 --> 00:57.560
when it moved and how it moved because you have to rely on an intermediaries,

00:57.560 --> 01:02.620
say a bank or a credit card company to tell you what the truth should be.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.390
In the Bitcoin blockchain,

01:04.390 --> 01:08.000
what happens instead is every single person or

01:08.000 --> 01:11.765
entity in the world that runs a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain,

01:11.765 --> 01:14.135
which really is just a data repository,

01:14.135 --> 01:19.220
has a complete history of every transaction that's occurred since the beginning of time.

01:19.220 --> 01:22.120
Now, it's very difficult to change that history,

01:22.120 --> 01:23.560
I will get to that in a moment,

01:23.560 --> 01:28.785
it's one of the key security features of a distributed ledger or a blockchain.

01:28.785 --> 01:33.649
But it's very important because it provides all participants in the network,

01:33.649 --> 01:36.115
trusted source of information.

01:36.115 --> 01:37.995
Now, as I mentioned earlier,

01:37.995 --> 01:42.440
the Bitcoin blockchain is likely the best known protocol but there are a lot of

01:42.440 --> 01:44.210
different protocols out there that people in

01:44.210 --> 01:47.485
the blockchain ecosystem are building and experimenting with.

01:47.485 --> 01:49.845
At the core of experimentation,

01:49.845 --> 01:51.770
what we're doing is we're exploring

01:51.770 --> 01:56.285
three fundamental variables that can change how a blockchain works.

01:56.285 --> 01:58.765
Number one is scalability.

01:58.765 --> 02:01.140
Number two is security.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.055
Number three is decentralization.

02:04.055 --> 02:08.990
Now, these are all words that at their surface are likely fairly meaningless.

02:08.990 --> 02:12.965
So, let's delve into why these three features really matter.

02:12.965 --> 02:16.265
Number one, let's talk about security.

02:16.265 --> 02:21.165
A blockchain is often defined by something called its consensus mechanism.

02:21.165 --> 02:23.465
Now, that's a lot of jargon.

02:23.465 --> 02:25.730
Consensus means agreement.

02:25.730 --> 02:31.850
So, the consensus mechanism for a blockchain is how participants in the network come to

02:31.850 --> 02:34.850
agreement about the truth or the record that

02:34.850 --> 02:38.530
should be recorded in that particular block of the blockchain.

02:38.530 --> 02:43.310
In Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is something called Proof of Work.

02:43.310 --> 02:44.870
What that means is,

02:44.870 --> 02:49.820
computers have to do a lot of work called mining in order

02:49.820 --> 02:55.390
to prove that they have the right history or the right data in the blockchain.

02:55.390 --> 02:58.070
There are other forms of consensus that are being

02:58.070 --> 03:00.830
created like Proof of Stake where people

03:00.830 --> 03:03.350
put up risk capital that they lose if

03:03.350 --> 03:06.020
they're lying about the state of truth of the network,

03:06.020 --> 03:10.720
and there are many other forms of consensus that are being experimented with,

03:10.720 --> 03:13.420
proof of space and time and so on and so forth.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.160
As you go on in your studies after this course,

03:16.160 --> 03:18.890
you can look into some of these consensus algorithms and how they

03:18.890 --> 03:22.445
work and we'll provide some links in the resources section as well.

03:22.445 --> 03:24.540
But when we talk about consensus,

03:24.540 --> 03:29.225
what's interesting to know is really what we're talking about is security.

03:29.225 --> 03:32.749
The security model of a blockchain defines

03:32.749 --> 03:37.810
the ledger's ability to maintain its integrity against malicious attacks.

03:37.810 --> 03:43.810
Say for example, that I'm a bad actor and I want to steal money from someone,

03:43.810 --> 03:46.970
if it's easy to attack a blockchain because it's

03:46.970 --> 03:52.090
consensus mechanism doesn't require a lot of energy or a lot of money,

03:52.090 --> 03:54.290
then it would be easy to attack and I would

03:54.290 --> 03:56.975
likely not have high security on that blockchain.

03:56.975 --> 04:00.110
By making blockchains highly resilient,

04:00.110 --> 04:02.930
we ensure that we're comfortable storing large amounts of

04:02.930 --> 04:07.045
value or very trusted information on these networks.

04:07.045 --> 04:13.865
Now, some blockchains that aren't open and usable by anyone are called permissioned.

04:13.865 --> 04:16.460
This is typically used in enterprise settings where

04:16.460 --> 04:19.070
companies may already have a business relationship with one

04:19.070 --> 04:21.770
another or in places where known entities are

04:21.770 --> 04:25.385
transacting with one another and already have arrangements in place.

04:25.385 --> 04:29.275
A permissioned blockchain basically means that only known entities,

04:29.275 --> 04:30.649
people who have permission,

04:30.649 --> 04:33.985
are allowed to read and write data to the ledger.

04:33.985 --> 04:39.120
Now, this is one interesting way to approach a block chain model,

04:39.120 --> 04:40.490
but note that in this case,

04:40.490 --> 04:46.675
you are sacrificing security for the sake of other factors like scalability and speed.

04:46.675 --> 04:50.180
One of the interesting innovations of the Bitcoin blockchain

04:50.180 --> 04:53.900
is that Bitcoin's model is inherently adversarial,

04:53.900 --> 04:57.195
meaning no one trusts anyone.

04:57.195 --> 05:04.130
Proof of work is a highly secure and very expensive and computationally intensive process

05:04.130 --> 05:05.600
for reaching consensus.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.579
This is why I personally,

05:07.579 --> 05:12.410
I'm very excited about the Bitcoin network and the innovations of the Bitcoin blockchain.

05:12.410 --> 05:17.105
It's very difficult to attack this particular network and alter its history.

05:17.105 --> 05:22.535
The challenge that new blockchain networks and new protocols have to overcome is building

05:22.535 --> 05:25.180
a long enough transaction history and building

05:25.180 --> 05:29.195
a security mechanism that is resilient enough to stand up to attack,

05:29.195 --> 05:32.065
particularly if there's a lot of money at stake.

05:32.065 --> 05:36.265
The second aspect of a blockchain that's really critical is scalability.

05:36.265 --> 05:38.645
Now, there are two aspects to scalability.

05:38.645 --> 05:41.030
One is technical scalability,

05:41.030 --> 05:44.255
which means how many transactions you put through the network,

05:44.255 --> 05:45.980
how much data can you store on it,

05:45.980 --> 05:49.940
how big can the network get and how many people can it reach.

05:49.940 --> 05:52.490
This is very important because it dictates

05:52.490 --> 05:56.690
how much activity that particular blockchain network will be able to support.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.060
However, there's also a second element of

05:59.060 --> 06:01.750
scalability that doesn't get talked about very often,

06:01.750 --> 06:03.545
which is social scalability.

06:03.545 --> 06:06.960
Social scalability refers to the philosophy,

06:06.960 --> 06:11.900
the economic, political and social philosophy underlying many blockchain protocols.

06:11.900 --> 06:16.640
Because blockchain technology represents not just the technology innovation,

06:16.640 --> 06:19.190
but also a social innovation,

06:19.190 --> 06:23.360
it's important that there are a group of people who share the same beliefs and that share

06:23.360 --> 06:27.709
the same desires in terms of ensuring blockchain remains open,

06:27.709 --> 06:29.860
permissionless and so on and so forth.

06:29.860 --> 06:33.125
That's very important in ensuring the development of the protocol,

06:33.125 --> 06:35.645
particularly since it's open source technology,

06:35.645 --> 06:37.370
continues to move forward.

06:37.370 --> 06:41.540
Therefore, it's important to look into social scalability and we provided

06:41.540 --> 06:45.710
more information in the resources section that should help you on that journey.

06:45.710 --> 06:49.340
The third aspect of the blockchain that really matters is decentralization.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.290
Now, decentralization is an esoteric and poorly defined word,

06:53.290 --> 06:56.755
and we could teach several classes just on that topic alone.

06:56.755 --> 06:59.625
However, if we wanted to define decentralization,

06:59.625 --> 07:00.890
it's helpful to go back to

07:00.890 --> 07:03.785
the initial diagram that we shared at the start of this course.

07:03.785 --> 07:06.980
At the protocol layer, decentralization means that anyone

07:06.980 --> 07:10.005
can openly see the code that they're running;

07:10.005 --> 07:11.265
what's in the protocol,

07:11.265 --> 07:14.810
what it means and that people can suggest changes to the protocol.

07:14.810 --> 07:19.385
Most projects have a specific process for how changes and upgrades occur,

07:19.385 --> 07:22.010
and most of these processes are open and

07:22.010 --> 07:25.085
follow the principles of open source software development.

07:25.085 --> 07:27.190
At the next layer, the network layer,

07:27.190 --> 07:33.395
decentralization means that people who want to are able to easily and cheaply run nodes,

07:33.395 --> 07:38.705
put their transactions onto the network and validate transactions of others.

07:38.705 --> 07:41.510
There are a number of new innovations being worked on to make it

07:41.510 --> 07:44.150
easier for people to participate in consensus in

07:44.150 --> 07:47.660
the blockchain networks and it's an important area of research that will

07:47.660 --> 07:51.850
continue to impact how far and wide these networks are able to proliferate.

07:51.850 --> 07:54.355
Lastly, at the application layer,

07:54.355 --> 07:58.195
it should be easy for anyone who wants to enter and leave the network,

07:58.195 --> 08:00.590
there should be a degree of censorship resistance,

08:00.590 --> 08:05.540
meaning there's no ability for anyone to control what anyone else does on the network.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.070
Another way of saying this,

08:07.070 --> 08:09.110
is that the network should be permissionless,

08:09.110 --> 08:11.000
meaning anyone who wants to is able to build

08:11.000 --> 08:13.915
an application and commercialize it however they like.

08:13.915 --> 08:17.840
Lastly, transparency is key to all of this.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.250
One of the core ideas that we're exploring with digital currencies in

08:21.250 --> 08:23.600
blockchain technology is the idea that

08:23.600 --> 08:27.020
the relationship with money and power should be uncoupled.

08:27.020 --> 08:31.444
Transparency and how decisions are made, how changes propagate,

08:31.444 --> 08:33.215
what's happening on these networks,

08:33.215 --> 08:36.460
who's behind these networks is an important component of that.

08:36.460 --> 08:39.620
Therefore, arguably, the most important component of

08:39.620 --> 08:42.680
decentralization is really understanding what

08:42.680 --> 08:46.010
the word decentralization means and where it matters and being

08:46.010 --> 08:49.530
able to track how decentralized something actually is,

08:49.530 --> 08:51.500
which again, as we've just defined,

08:51.500 --> 08:53.255
can mean a lot of different things.

08:53.255 --> 08:57.880
We'll close this segment by talking briefly about an important distinction here.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.470
There's two things that are often talked about when we talk about

09:00.470 --> 09:04.805
blockchain technology: First is the actual technology itself.

09:04.805 --> 09:08.630
A lot of the technology underlying blockchains is not new,

09:08.630 --> 09:10.565
but it's helpful to understand.

09:10.565 --> 09:13.820
Ideas like public private key cryptography have

09:13.820 --> 09:16.880
existed for a long time and the cryptography that

09:16.880 --> 09:19.550
most blockchains are built on has existed for

09:19.550 --> 09:23.320
decades and has been formally documented in academic research.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.320
However, the unique aspect of blockchains today is

09:27.320 --> 09:31.790
the combination of technology with game theory and incentives,

09:31.790 --> 09:35.895
which is done through something called a cryptocurrency or crypto asset.

09:35.895 --> 09:38.270
The design of these governance systems;

09:38.270 --> 09:43.445
how the money in the system interacts with governance and the technology,

09:43.445 --> 09:46.700
is an important aspect of what makes this so unique.

09:46.700 --> 09:50.600
Likely, there should be a governance layer right above the network layer in

09:50.600 --> 09:52.550
the stack because it's really important to

09:52.550 --> 09:55.385
define how these systems are going to be governed,

09:55.385 --> 09:58.300
their aspects of ethics, political design,

09:58.300 --> 10:00.080
behavioral design and behavioral

10:00.080 --> 10:03.425
economics that are just starting to emerge in this community.

10:03.425 --> 10:07.715
However, I'd encourage you to think about incentives as we go through this course.

10:07.715 --> 10:09.020
I will try to highlight some of

10:09.020 --> 10:13.095
the interesting incentive structures at play between blockchain technology,

10:13.095 --> 10:15.110
the cryptocurrencies that live on

10:15.110 --> 10:19.055
these blockchain networks and the people building projects on top of them.

10:19.055 --> 10:22.345
Next, we'll be talking about why blockchains matter,

10:22.345 --> 10:25.580
understanding some of the important changes happening in our world,

10:25.580 --> 10:29.010
and how they might impact blockchain technology.
