00:00.000 --> 00:02.355
Let's start by answering the question,

00:02.355 --> 00:03.510
what is a block chain?

00:03.510 --> 00:05.055
What is digital currency?

00:05.055 --> 00:07.545
And how exactly does it all work?

00:07.545 --> 00:10.335
In order to understand digital currencies,

00:10.335 --> 00:12.930
I want to go back to another technology that we all

00:12.930 --> 00:15.990
use and that we all love, the Internet.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.690
What I'm sharing with you is a view of what I

00:18.690 --> 00:21.705
like to call the blockchain infrastructure stack.

00:21.705 --> 00:23.355
On the left side you'll see

00:23.355 --> 00:25.740
the Internet infrastructure stack and on

00:25.740 --> 00:29.115
the right side you'll see the blockchain infrastructure stack.

00:29.115 --> 00:31.130
The early stages of the Internet were

00:31.130 --> 00:33.470
really defined by groups of people who were building

00:33.470 --> 00:38.615
this technology trying to come together on the rules and languages of the system.

00:38.615 --> 00:42.650
These rules and languages of a system are often called protocols.

00:42.650 --> 00:46.820
One example is FTP or File Transfer Protocol which

00:46.820 --> 00:50.975
created a common language for how people would enable file-sharing.

00:50.975 --> 00:55.880
This meant that one person sharing a file through one application can be sure that

00:55.880 --> 00:58.820
their file-sharing would interact well with someone using

00:58.820 --> 01:01.940
another application or platform entirely.

01:01.940 --> 01:03.530
We see the same thing in

01:03.530 --> 01:06.920
the blockchain infrastructure stack where a lot of the work being done

01:06.920 --> 01:09.590
today is around protocols or developing

01:09.590 --> 01:13.190
common rules and languages for how these systems should work.

01:13.190 --> 01:16.760
The second layer of the stack is taking this code,

01:16.760 --> 01:21.425
these protocols and implementing them in physical space and time.

01:21.425 --> 01:24.160
This is called the networking layer.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.120
Now, in the Internet days,

01:26.120 --> 01:30.770
the Internet network itself was developed by companies who spent billions of

01:30.770 --> 01:36.340
$ putting cable into the ground in the form of ISPs or Internet Service Providers.

01:36.340 --> 01:39.790
These ISPs is provide the backbone for the Internet that we use

01:39.790 --> 01:44.270
then and continue to provide the backbone for the Internet that we use today.

01:44.270 --> 01:48.040
Now, the best-known network layer is the bitcoin network.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.340
The bitcoin network relies on a group of individuals and companies known as

01:52.340 --> 01:56.960
miners who provide computational services to bitcoin network.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.470
If these terms are confusing to you don't worry you

02:00.470 --> 02:03.770
don't need to really delve into the details of how these things work.

02:03.770 --> 02:09.020
Just know that it's very important to understand the relationship between how protocols

02:09.020 --> 02:11.780
designed and what the implications are for

02:11.780 --> 02:15.400
how the network runs and gets implemented in real time.

02:15.400 --> 02:21.410
Now, a lot of these network providers are paid in cryptocurrencies themselves.

02:21.410 --> 02:25.280
So, in bitcoin, if you provide computational resources to

02:25.280 --> 02:30.175
the network by validating transactions and enabling the bitcoin network to run,

02:30.175 --> 02:34.230
you're paid in new Bitcoin that are "mined".

02:34.230 --> 02:36.380
This is important because this provides

02:36.380 --> 02:40.280
an economic incentive for people to actually provide,

02:40.280 --> 02:43.540
compute resources in order to support these networks.

02:43.540 --> 02:47.060
So, we've talked about the protocol layer and we talked about the network layer.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.970
Now, what's really interesting is that in every technology,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.565
there's a tipping point where there's

02:52.565 --> 02:56.495
more awareness of how this technology might actually be transformative.

02:56.495 --> 03:00.515
Up until that tipping point things feel very immature.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.660
It feels like there's a lot of jargon and there's

03:02.660 --> 03:05.300
typically not a lot of attention on what's happening.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.189
Now, in the Internet world,

03:07.189 --> 03:10.310
that tipping point really was email or

03:10.310 --> 03:14.380
the ability to instantly communicate for little to no cost.

03:14.380 --> 03:17.840
In crypto world and then block chain world it's my belief that

03:17.840 --> 03:22.370
the first real killer application for a blockchains was bitcoin or the

03:22.370 --> 03:27.290
idea that you could have a system of money that was not tied to any central authority or

03:27.290 --> 03:30.410
entity that enabled people to transact peer

03:30.410 --> 03:33.680
to peer without intermediaries for the first time.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.330
Now, that doesn't mean that bitcoin is the only blockchain application that we have.

03:38.330 --> 03:42.540
Just like email wasn't the only application develops on top of the Internet,

03:42.540 --> 03:46.310
there are a lot of new and innovative applications coming to the world of blockchain.

03:46.310 --> 03:52.060
However, it's important to remember that from the time we had email in the early 1990's,

03:52.060 --> 03:56.780
really mass email that anyone could use to the time we're in now where we have

03:56.780 --> 03:59.630
super computers in our pocket and access the Internet

03:59.630 --> 04:02.660
to variety of things from talking via video,

04:02.660 --> 04:05.615
sharing files and doing a whole host of other things,

04:05.615 --> 04:10.655
a lot of time, energy and effort went into building these different applications.

04:10.655 --> 04:14.000
The blockchain ecosystem is still in its very early stages.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.070
So, many of the applications that are being built

04:16.070 --> 04:18.950
today are still very experimental and it's important

04:18.950 --> 04:21.110
to remember that a lot of the protocols and

04:21.110 --> 04:24.470
the networks that they rely on are also under development.

04:24.470 --> 04:27.515
So, while it may feel like the blockchain ecosystem

04:27.515 --> 04:31.205
is very mature and there are a lot of different applications.

04:31.205 --> 04:36.455
In reality, I think you have to accept that many of these applications are experimental.

04:36.455 --> 04:38.000
They're difficult to use.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.780
They may rely on other components that aren't fully complete yet,

04:41.780 --> 04:44.930
and there's still a lot of exploration beings on and how we

04:44.930 --> 04:48.270
can actually leverage this technology in meaningful ways.

04:48.270 --> 04:51.110
Interestingly, there were numerous efforts in

04:51.110 --> 04:55.835
the Internet days to build online payment systems and cash equivalents.

04:55.835 --> 05:01.010
In fact, there were a lot of efforts to build money that would be native to the Internet.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.370
Now, a lot of those efforts didn't really work out

05:04.370 --> 05:07.820
and many of the people who worked on those early efforts to create

05:07.820 --> 05:11.270
"digital currency" now are actually working on

05:11.270 --> 05:16.205
various components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem particularly bitcoin.

05:16.205 --> 05:22.150
For example, PayPal which to us may not necessarily be super innovative company,

05:22.150 --> 05:26.240
that was one of the first innovation companies that enabled transactions on

05:26.240 --> 05:30.440
the Internet by enabling people that were part of various payment networks,

05:30.440 --> 05:35.200
banks, and maybe separated by borders to transact in a unified way.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.395
Just like PayPal enabled people anywhere on the Internet working in

05:39.395 --> 05:43.750
any financial system to interact with one another and transact with one another,

05:43.750 --> 05:48.410
there's a lot of work happening in the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that people who are

05:48.410 --> 05:50.990
working on one blockchain or another will be able

05:50.990 --> 05:53.855
to transact and operate across these chains.

05:53.855 --> 05:57.080
This idea is called interoperability and it's one of

05:57.080 --> 05:59.450
the many exciting research areas that people

05:59.450 --> 06:02.020
in the blockchain ecosystem are spending time on.

06:02.020 --> 06:05.085
Now, that we've explored the blockchain stack a little bit,

06:05.085 --> 06:10.860
let's talk about how a blockchain actually works and why it's called the blockchain.
