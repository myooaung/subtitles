00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
So far, we've talked a lot about blockchain technology and

00:03.300 --> 00:07.455
digital currencies as though they're one broad group of ideas.

00:07.455 --> 00:08.640
In this part of the class,

00:08.640 --> 00:12.450
we're going to hone in on one very specific component of

00:12.450 --> 00:17.445
blockchain technology which is digital currencies or Crypto Assets themselves.

00:17.445 --> 00:19.170
The reason I want to talk about this one of

00:19.170 --> 00:23.640
the more interesting aspects for me of this new technology ecosystem.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.115
I think there's still a lot of confusion about how digital currencies actually work.

00:29.115 --> 00:32.895
So, let's start right into the lifecycle of these assets.

00:32.895 --> 00:35.640
How they're created, how they're distributed,

00:35.640 --> 00:37.830
how they're managed, and what might happen

00:37.830 --> 00:40.545
to one of these assets at the end of its lifecycle.

00:40.545 --> 00:42.740
Let's start with Bitcoin.

00:42.740 --> 00:47.329
Bitcoin is an asset that we've been hearing about for the last five years,

00:47.329 --> 00:51.155
and it's a project that's pretty easy to explain and understand.

00:51.155 --> 00:55.490
In 2008, there was an anonymous individual or group who

00:55.490 --> 00:59.735
called themselves Satoshi Nakamoto who released something called a whitepaper,

00:59.735 --> 01:04.940
nine page PDF, outlining idea for digital money system they called Bitcoin.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.240
Now, this paper was released and sent around on

01:08.240 --> 01:11.840
an email chat and no one really paid much attention to it.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.900
The Bitcoin network was first deployed in 2009,

01:14.900 --> 01:20.475
meaning the protocol or code was taken and actually run on computers.

01:20.475 --> 01:22.820
In the early days of the Bitcoin network is really

01:22.820 --> 01:25.145
easy to run the Bitcoin code on your computer,

01:25.145 --> 01:29.075
and overtime it became much harder and required more specialized hardware.

01:29.075 --> 01:33.700
Now, most users didn't really interact with Bitcoin for a very long time,

01:33.700 --> 01:38.525
even though Bitcoin came into existence technologically in 2009.

01:38.525 --> 01:41.480
I didn't interact with Bitcoin until 2012,

01:41.480 --> 01:45.860
and many people are just now beginning to interact with Bitcoin 10 years later.

01:45.860 --> 01:52.310
As I mentioned earlier the innovation and adoption lifecycle often takes a long time,

01:52.310 --> 01:54.880
because most people may not have heard about Bitcoin,

01:54.880 --> 01:57.640
and may not have had any practical way to access it,

01:57.640 --> 02:00.310
and may not even have understood what it was.

02:00.310 --> 02:03.740
So the first phase of the Crypto lifecycle is

02:03.740 --> 02:07.580
creating a new protocol and creating a new network.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.940
Now the Bitcoin network has been around for ten years as I mentioned,

02:10.940 --> 02:12.895
and not only was the network created,

02:12.895 --> 02:17.300
but bitcoins were actually distributed to individuals through process known as mining.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.550
What this means is every time that

02:19.550 --> 02:23.140
a new block is added to the blockchain more Bitcoin is created.

02:23.140 --> 02:27.170
Now, in Bitcoin the model is the distribution of Bitcoin goes

02:27.170 --> 02:31.205
down over time and there's a limited number of Bitcoin that will ever exist.

02:31.205 --> 02:35.180
One of the reasons that Bitcoin is often compared to the idea of digital gold,

02:35.180 --> 02:39.005
because it's limited and scarce in supply just like physical gold.

02:39.005 --> 02:43.340
Now, once Bitcoin been distributed through this process known as mining,

02:43.340 --> 02:45.590
there's an entire phase that begins where people

02:45.590 --> 02:48.545
speculate on the value of Bitcoin through trading,

02:48.545 --> 02:52.430
where people actually use Bitcoin for applications like sending

02:52.430 --> 02:56.540
payments or cross-border remittances or variety of other applications.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.300
We're starting to see people use other features of

02:59.300 --> 03:02.990
the Bitcoin network to deploy a number of other applications such as

03:02.990 --> 03:06.410
storing or anchoring data to the Bitcoin blockchain or leveraging

03:06.410 --> 03:10.330
Bitcoin security model to do other things that could create value.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.240
So, if we look at Bitcoin,

03:12.240 --> 03:13.935
it's gone through the creation phase,

03:13.935 --> 03:15.840
scan through the distribution phase,

03:15.840 --> 03:20.705
and as a result this network has accrued over a $100 billion of value,

03:20.705 --> 03:23.330
and also has a number of different applications deployed

03:23.330 --> 03:25.925
on top of it that are easy for people to use.

03:25.925 --> 03:30.440
One such application that you may be familiar with is an application called Coinbase.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.240
Coinbase is a phone and computer-based application that allows people to

03:35.240 --> 03:40.435
easily buy Bitcoin using their bank account or credit card and then store that Bitcoin.

03:40.435 --> 03:43.190
There are also applications from traditional companies like

03:43.190 --> 03:46.235
Square that allow people to do the same thing.

03:46.235 --> 03:50.390
These are all pointing to the fact that Bitcoin as an asset,

03:50.390 --> 03:52.610
isn't a later stage of maturity of many of

03:52.610 --> 03:55.450
the new Crypto assets that are just beginning to emerge.

03:55.450 --> 03:58.710
Let's go to a second example, Ethereum.

03:58.710 --> 04:03.830
Now, the Ethereum network came into existence two years later in 2015.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.300
The way that the Ethereum network came into existence,

04:06.300 --> 04:09.785
well a little bit different than how the Bitcoin network came into existence.

04:09.785 --> 04:12.560
The Ethereum network raised money through something

04:12.560 --> 04:15.440
called an ICO or Initial Coin Offering.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.570
Where the developers that created the protocol sold a block of Ether

04:20.570 --> 04:21.920
or the token that's native to

04:21.920 --> 04:25.895
the Ethereum network in something called Initial Coin Offering.

04:25.895 --> 04:28.034
People could contribute Bitcoin,

04:28.034 --> 04:30.920
the other digital currency that existed at the time.

04:30.920 --> 04:35.545
In exchange for Ether they would be given when the network first launched.

04:35.545 --> 04:37.755
So, a bunch of people participated,

04:37.755 --> 04:43.075
and the Ethereum Foundation which oversaw the process raised $18 million Bitcoin.

04:43.075 --> 04:46.290
When the Ethereum network finally launched in 2015,

04:46.290 --> 04:48.680
all the people who'd contributed Bitcoins to

04:48.680 --> 04:50.900
the Initial Coin Offering received Ether

04:50.900 --> 04:53.485
in exchange for their contribution to the project.

04:53.485 --> 04:58.640
This model of raising capital for new cryptocurrency protocols called

04:58.640 --> 05:01.580
Initial Coin Offering was popularized by

05:01.580 --> 05:04.850
Ethereum and has since been used by a number of different projects.

05:04.850 --> 05:10.985
Now, we've also seen other models used to create and deploy new cryptocurrency projects.

05:10.985 --> 05:13.670
What's interesting to note here is there a lot of

05:13.670 --> 05:17.330
different ways that a protocol can come into existence,

05:17.330 --> 05:21.920
but it's important to evaluate some of the incentives that play for why developer,

05:21.920 --> 05:25.310
group of developers might create a protocol and how they choose

05:25.310 --> 05:28.910
to monetize or fund the development of that protocol overtime.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.590
It's important to evaluate

05:30.590 --> 05:34.670
how these models impacts the ecosystem around these cryptocurrencies,

05:34.670 --> 05:38.060
particularly when it comes to moving beyond the speculative phase.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.210
If we look at this graphic of all of the different businesses that have

05:41.210 --> 05:44.285
been built to support the Crypto Asset lifecycle.

05:44.285 --> 05:46.640
We can see that it's still very early.

05:46.640 --> 05:52.010
There are a lot of companies focused on helping teams create Crypto Assets.

05:52.010 --> 05:55.700
There are also a lot of different models being experimented with on how these assets

05:55.700 --> 05:59.240
are distributed whether it's through an Initial Coin Offering,

05:59.240 --> 06:04.505
a new regulated model called a Security Token Offering, and hybrid thereof.

06:04.505 --> 06:07.820
There are a lot of different platforms like exchanges that can be

06:07.820 --> 06:11.335
used to speculate on the value of these different Crypto Assets.

06:11.335 --> 06:15.050
However, overtime for these things to actually have value,

06:15.050 --> 06:19.010
they have to be utilized by people to perform different activities.

06:19.010 --> 06:22.130
We've talked about some of these used cases like store of value,

06:22.130 --> 06:25.505
medium of exchange, and distributed ledger applications.

06:25.505 --> 06:28.460
But ultimately, it's up to these developers

06:28.460 --> 06:31.340
and the communities of people using these Crypto Assets to

06:31.340 --> 06:34.040
ensure that we evolve beyond the speculative phase into

06:34.040 --> 06:37.370
actually utilize in Crypto Assets for meaningful purposes,

06:37.370 --> 06:40.340
and then beginning to specify how these assets are

06:40.340 --> 06:43.745
uniquely enable to perform specific functions.

06:43.745 --> 06:48.890
The market needs robust new infrastructure to enable these assets to exist and

06:48.890 --> 06:54.140
to enable these assets to create utility that will be functional in a market economy.

06:54.140 --> 06:57.020
The last thing I mentioned before we end this section on

06:57.020 --> 07:00.080
Crypto Assets is that what we're seeing

07:00.080 --> 07:03.064
at its core is an evolution in how capital

07:03.064 --> 07:06.445
is formed and how people raise money for new ideas.

07:06.445 --> 07:09.120
We've seen their eyes at the internet stocks also

07:09.120 --> 07:12.360
called the Fangs are Facebook, Amazon, Netflix,

07:12.360 --> 07:15.290
Google, were companies who reached public markets

07:15.290 --> 07:18.635
through traditional IPO or Initial Public Offerings.

07:18.635 --> 07:21.040
These are traded on the stock market today.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.475
With Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Crypto Assets,

07:24.475 --> 07:27.455
we saw an entirely new model be experimented with

07:27.455 --> 07:31.480
which has its shortcomings but also opportunities.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.590
We're now seeing a new form of

07:33.590 --> 07:37.580
capital creation through Initial Coin Offerings be experimented with,

07:37.580 --> 07:39.920
and through that process we're uncovering some of

07:39.920 --> 07:42.380
the challenges with these incentive models,

07:42.380 --> 07:45.815
and some of the challenges associated with raising money in this way.

07:45.815 --> 07:48.740
None of these structures are perfect by any means,

07:48.740 --> 07:51.350
but it's important to note the fact that these are

07:51.350 --> 07:54.995
important experiments and they're exciting to keep track of.

07:54.995 --> 07:57.980
A new model we're seeing as one we talked about briefly with

07:57.980 --> 08:01.135
the same regions offering which is a security token or

08:01.135 --> 08:05.990
a registered security that complies with financial regulations that raises

08:05.990 --> 08:08.480
money through more traditional means there might be reserved for

08:08.480 --> 08:11.555
hedge funds or other private investment opportunities,

08:11.555 --> 08:14.065
but this is by no means the end of the story.

08:14.065 --> 08:16.240
There are a lot of new ways that we'll start to see

08:16.240 --> 08:18.970
Crypto Assets being issued by individuals,

08:18.970 --> 08:21.679
projects, firms, and other entities,

08:21.679 --> 08:23.845
maybe even governments themselves.

08:23.845 --> 08:26.620
While it's still very early and difficult to

08:26.620 --> 08:29.890
determine what methods are best for long-term success.

08:29.890 --> 08:33.040
It's exciting to note that this new technologies

08:33.040 --> 08:37.030
creating new ways for people to form capital that haven't existed before.

08:37.030 --> 08:40.945
There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Crypto Asset lifecycle,

08:40.945 --> 08:45.805
but hopefully thinking through this framework of how assets are created, distributed,

08:45.805 --> 08:48.370
and then manage over their lifecycle provides you with

08:48.370 --> 08:51.670
some new contexts through which to evaluate opportunities

08:51.670 --> 08:54.890
to not only use these assets but to invest in

08:54.890 --> 08:58.070
them and to hold them as long term investment opportunities.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.730
Also note that it's very high risk to invest in Crypto Assets.

09:01.730 --> 09:05.240
I've always advised that you should never invest more money than you're willing to

09:05.240 --> 09:09.350
lose because there's a high probability that these assets will be worth nothing.

09:09.350 --> 09:12.230
This is not investment advice nor should you take

09:12.230 --> 09:16.835
investment advice from anyone on the internet on Twitter or anywhere else.

09:16.835 --> 09:19.970
Now you may be asking yourself why we're even talking about

09:19.970 --> 09:24.570
the retirement or the end of life for some of these assets so early in their development.

09:24.570 --> 09:28.880
But it's still far away and maybe decades or multiple decades in

09:28.880 --> 09:33.260
some cases that some of these assets actually start to reach the end of their life.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.475
It's important to think about what happens to some of these assets.

09:36.475 --> 09:40.070
Can a digital asset trade and perpetuity even if there's

09:40.070 --> 09:42.590
no underlying network to support it or even if

09:42.590 --> 09:45.410
there are no real users or holders of the asset.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.170
These are all interesting and unique questions

09:48.170 --> 09:51.110
that this new innovation and technology represents.

09:51.110 --> 09:54.760
This is not as simple as a Myspace situation where accompanies

09:54.760 --> 09:58.425
ceasing to exist means the platform itself ceases to exist,

09:58.425 --> 10:00.565
because these networks are distributed,

10:00.565 --> 10:04.505
and because their development can be very decentralized in some cases,

10:04.505 --> 10:07.880
there are a lot of interesting wrinkles to explore when we talk about what it

10:07.880 --> 10:12.850
actually means for the lifecycle of Crypto Asset to end.
