00:00:01.405  -->  00:00:02.293
<v Instructor>Hello everyone</v>
2

2

00:00:02.293  -->  00:00:06.096
and welcome to the Git and GitHub overview lecture.
3

3

00:00:06.096  -->  00:00:07.982
So in this lecture we'll just get a quick overview
4

4

00:00:07.982  -->  00:00:10.832
on Git and GitHub in general.
5

5

00:00:10.832  -->  00:00:13.655
So what is Git, G-I-T?
6

6

00:00:13.655  -->  00:00:15.924
Git is a free and open source distributed
7

7

00:00:15.924  -->  00:00:17.676
version control system,
8

8

00:00:17.676  -->  00:00:19.877
and it can handle everything from just a small project
9

9

00:00:19.877  -->  00:00:22.715
to a really large one pretty well.
10

10

00:00:22.715  -->  00:00:26.598
So you can go ahead and go to git-scm.com
11

11

00:00:26.598  -->  00:00:28.222
to learn more about Git.
12

12

00:00:28.222  -->  00:00:30.412
And you can try it in your browser for free
13

13

00:00:30.412  -->  00:00:34.712
by clicking this Try Git link on the the Git page here
14

14

00:00:34.712  -->  00:00:38.183
and it'll take you to this link at try.github.io,
15

15

00:00:38.183  -->  00:00:42.384
and it'll teach you Git pretty quickly in your browser.
16

16

00:00:42.384  -->  00:00:44.491
So it's actually a really useful tool.
17

17

00:00:44.491  -->  00:00:46.294
So what kind of companies are using Git,
18

18

00:00:46.294  -->  00:00:48.004
this version control system?
19

19

00:00:48.004  -->  00:00:50.014
Pretty much all major companies, such as Google,
20

20

00:00:50.014  -->  00:00:52.754
Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, et cetara.
21

21

00:00:52.754  -->  00:00:54.041
There's a whole list of companies,
22

22

00:00:54.041  -->  00:00:56.280
many, many companies use Git.
23

23

00:00:56.280  -->  00:00:58.710
And you might be wondering what's the difference
24

24

00:00:58.710  -->  00:01:00.627
between Git and GitHub.
25

25

00:01:01.763  -->  00:01:06.202
So GitHub is a web page where you can publish
26

26

00:01:06.202  -->  00:01:09.795
your Git repositories and collaborate with other people.
27

27

00:01:09.795  -->  00:01:12.418
So as I mentioned before, Git's a version control system,
28

28

00:01:12.418  -->  00:01:16.496
so it basically has a series of snapshots of your code
29

29

00:01:16.496  -->  00:01:18.242
which are known as commits,
30

30

00:01:18.242  -->  00:01:21.728
and as you see the path of the snapshots,
31

31

00:01:21.728  -->  00:01:24.537
you can check what order they're created in.
32

32

00:01:24.537  -->  00:01:27.738
So can you use Git without GitHub,
33

33

00:01:27.738  -->  00:01:29.334
is another question people ask.
34

34

00:01:29.334  -->  00:01:30.167
And yes.
35

35

00:01:30.167  -->  00:01:32.638
So Git runs locally if you don't use GitHub.
36

36

00:01:32.638  -->  00:01:36.254
An alternative to GitHub might be using Gits
37

37

00:01:36.254  -->  00:01:38.869
with your files and the hosting them on Dropbox.
38

38

00:01:38.869  -->  00:01:41.363
But GitHub is the de facto, most popular
39

39

00:01:41.363  -->  00:01:45.658
streamlined service designed especially for Git.
40

40

00:01:45.658  -->  00:01:47.531
So I encourage you to make your own GitHub account
41

41

00:01:47.531  -->  00:01:48.745
and check it out.
42

42

00:01:48.745  -->  00:01:50.141
I have my own GitHub account
43

43

00:01:50.141  -->  00:01:51.954
and that's where I commit the repositories
44

44

00:01:51.954  -->  00:01:53.487
for the notebooks,
45

45

00:01:53.487  -->  00:01:55.159
and that's how you're able to view them,
46

46

00:01:55.159  -->  00:01:58.488
it's because I'm pushing them to GitHub.
47

47

00:01:58.488  -->  00:02:00.603
If you're interested in working how GitHub works,
48

48

00:02:00.603  -->  00:02:04.537
you can go to guides.github.com/activities/hello-world.
49

49

00:02:04.537  -->  00:02:08.073
Again, this link is in the lecture text.
50

50

00:02:08.073  -->  00:02:10.173
And you can check out their hello world document.
51

51

00:02:10.173  -->  00:02:11.424
It's all in browser.
52

52

00:02:11.424  -->  00:02:13.046
So again, you don't need to download anything.
53

53

00:02:13.046  -->  00:02:14.903
You can just check it out all there.
54

54

00:02:14.903  -->  00:02:16.867
And then another great website for learning Git
55

55

00:02:16.867  -->  00:02:21.096
in general, just G-I-T Git, is gitimmersion.com.
56

56

00:02:21.096  -->  00:02:24.055
And it works for both Mac and Windows.
57

57

00:02:24.055  -->  00:02:26.772
Okay, so that's just a brief overview on Gits
58

58

00:02:26.772  -->  00:02:28.391
and version control in general,
59

59

00:02:28.391  -->  00:02:30.896
the links and resources you need to learn more about them.
60

60

00:02:30.896  -->  00:02:32.875
Don't worry if you don't want to check that out right now.
61

61

00:02:32.875  -->  00:02:34.661
Later on in the lecture, we'll touch again
62

62

00:02:34.661  -->  00:02:37.399
on this topic when we talk about modules and importing
63

63

00:02:37.399  -->  00:02:39.905
and creating your own libraries.
64

64

00:02:39.905  -->  00:02:42.072
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
65

65

00:02:42.072  -->  00:02:43.633
Up next, we'll finally get started with
66

66

00:02:43.633  -->  00:02:46.242
Python object and data structure basics.
67

67

00:02:46.242  -->  00:02:49.385
Thanks, and I'll see you at the next lecture.
