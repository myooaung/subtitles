00:00:01,620  -->  00:00:03,623
<v Narrator>Hello everyone, and welcome to this quick</v>
2

2

00:00:03,623  -->  00:00:06,252
introduction to Python statements.
3

3

00:00:06,252  -->  00:00:08,615
As always there's a Jupiter notebook that is associated
4

4

00:00:08,615  -->  00:00:10,359
with this lecture, and it's also called
5

5

00:00:10,359  -->  00:00:13,163
Introduction to Python Statements.
6

6

00:00:13,163  -->  00:00:15,851
So what are we gonna do in this lecture?
7

7

00:00:15,851  -->  00:00:17,025
In this lecture we are gonna get
8

8

00:00:17,025  -->  00:00:19,267
a quick overview of Python Statements.
9

9

00:00:19,267  -->  00:00:21,109
And what we're really gonna try to do is emphasise
10

10

00:00:21,109  -->  00:00:23,233
differences between and Python and other languages,
11

11

00:00:23,233  -->  00:00:24,997
such as C++.
12

12

00:00:24,997  -->  00:00:27,930
And there's two main reasons for taking this approach,
13

13

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:29,320
this comparison approach.
14

14

00:00:29,320  -->  00:00:31,704
And that's because, reason number one if you're
15

15

00:00:31,704  -->  00:00:33,337
coming from a different language,
16

16

00:00:33,337  -->  00:00:34,927
this is going to really rapidly accelerate
17

17

00:00:34,927  -->  00:00:37,225
your understand of Python.
18

18

00:00:37,225  -->  00:00:39,742
And then number two if Python is your first language
19

19

00:00:39,742  -->  00:00:41,919
learning statements in this fashion will allow you
20

20

00:00:41,919  -->  00:00:45,305
to read other languages more easily in the future.
21

21

00:00:45,305  -->  00:00:47,535
So, you'll be able to jump from Python
22

22

00:00:47,535  -->  00:00:51,227
into Java, or C++, or another language much quicker
23

23

00:00:51,227  -->  00:00:53,395
if you learn about Python statements
24

24

00:00:53,395  -->  00:00:56,333
through this comparison context.
25

25

00:00:56,333  -->  00:01:00,120
So, let's look at Python verses other languages.
26

26

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:01,901
What we're gonna do is create a simple statement that
27

27

00:01:01,901  -->  00:01:04,715
says if a is greater than b,
28

28

00:01:04,715  -->  00:01:07,914
so if a variable a is greater than a variable b,
29

29

00:01:07,914  -->  00:01:11,600
assign the number 2 a and the number 4 to b.
30

30

00:01:11,600  -->  00:01:14,223
So let's take a look at what this would normally
31

31

00:01:14,223  -->  00:01:16,300
look like in another language.
32

32

00:01:16,300  -->  00:01:18,686
So, a lot of times the syntax for other languages
33

33

00:01:18,686  -->  00:01:19,791
would look something like this.
34

34

00:01:19,791  -->  00:01:23,597
It would say if, and then you'd have your check case
35

35

00:01:23,597  -->  00:01:25,088
a greater than b within some sort
36

36

00:01:25,088  -->  00:01:27,441
of parenthesis or brackets.
37

37

00:01:27,441  -->  00:01:28,813
And then you'll have curly brackets
38

38

00:01:28,813  -->  00:01:30,662
with statements on what to do.
39

39

00:01:30,662  -->  00:01:33,859
So if in parenthesis this case is true,
40

40

00:01:33,859  -->  00:01:35,429
you might have a bracket here,
41

41

00:01:35,429  -->  00:01:39,403
and then you'd have lines with semicolons afterwards,
42

42

00:01:39,403  -->  00:01:41,400
separating each statement.
43

43

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:43,220
What does this look like in Python?
44

44

00:01:43,220  -->  00:01:44,974
You'll notice this syntax is a lot cleaner
45

45

00:01:44,974  -->  00:01:46,085
and a lot simpler.
46

46

00:01:46,085  -->  00:01:47,837
This is one of the main beauties, and what people
47

47

00:01:47,837  -->  00:01:49,849
really enjoy about Python.
48

48

00:01:49,849  -->  00:01:51,820
So, you'll notice here we just have a direct statement.
49

49

00:01:51,820  -->  00:01:54,454
If a is greater than b, colon.
50

50

00:01:54,454  -->  00:01:57,031
You'll notice some white space here which we'll make
51

51

00:01:57,031  -->  00:02:01,186
clear in a couple mores slides in the future.
52

52

00:02:01,186  -->  00:02:03,209
You'll see it resents a is equal to 2,
53

53

00:02:03,209  -->  00:02:05,403
and b is equal to 4.
54

54

00:02:05,403  -->  00:02:06,622
So, what are the differences here,
55

55

00:02:06,622  -->  00:02:08,007
let's go ahead and compare them.
56

56

00:02:08,007  -->  00:02:10,527
What Python does is it gets rid of these parenthesis
57

57

00:02:10,527  -->  00:02:12,665
and these curly brackets by incorporating
58

58

00:02:12,665  -->  00:02:16,888
two main factors: a colon, and white space.
59

59

00:02:16,888  -->  00:02:20,493
So, in Python your statements are ended with a colon here.
60

60

00:02:20,493  -->  00:02:23,153
So if a is greater than b, colon.
61

61

00:02:23,153  -->  00:02:26,244
And then white space is used, this indentation here,
62

62

00:02:26,244  -->  00:02:30,189
to describe what takes place in case of the statement.
63

63

00:02:30,189  -->  00:02:32,549
So in Python you'll notice white space is extremely
64

64

00:02:32,549  -->  00:02:35,264
important, and it's fundamental to your code.
65

65

00:02:35,264  -->  00:02:37,320
And as we learn about statements throughout this section
66

66

00:02:37,320  -->  00:02:40,758
of the course, we'll really emphasise good practises
67

67

00:02:40,758  -->  00:02:43,603
and good indentation throughout your code.
68

68

00:02:43,603  -->  00:02:46,167
So what are the other differences here?
69

69

00:02:46,167  -->  00:02:47,887
Another major differences is the lack
70

70

00:02:47,887  -->  00:02:49,486
of semicolons in Python.
71

71

00:02:49,486  -->  00:02:51,513
So, a lot of times in other languages semicolons
72

72

00:02:51,513  -->  00:02:54,710
are used to note that a statement has ended,
73

73

00:02:54,710  -->  00:02:56,695
but in Python the end of a line,
74

74

00:02:56,695  -->  00:02:58,737
so once you stop typing on a line,
75

75

00:02:58,737  -->  00:03:00,653
is the same as the end of a statement.
76

76

00:03:00,653  -->  00:03:03,464
In other languages you're required to put in a semicolon,
77

77

00:03:03,464  -->  00:03:05,686
but in Python that's not the case.
78

78

00:03:05,686  -->  00:03:09,155
Another reason why Python is so nice and so clean.
79

79

00:03:09,155  -->  00:03:11,328
And lastly, just to end this brief overview of the
80

80

00:03:11,328  -->  00:03:14,367
differences, lets take a closer look at the indentation
81

81

00:03:14,367  -->  00:03:17,813
syntax in Python versus other languages.
82

82

00:03:17,813  -->  00:03:19,770
So, in other languages you might some syntax
83

83

00:03:19,770  -->  00:03:21,411
that looks like this.
84

84

00:03:21,411  -->  00:03:24,050
If you parenthesis x, if parenthesis y,
85

85

00:03:24,050  -->  00:03:26,366
you'll have a code-statement and a semicolon,
86

86

00:03:26,366  -->  00:03:30,035
else, another code code-statement, semicolon.
87

87

00:03:30,035  -->  00:03:34,564
But in Python, you have this very clear structure
88

88

00:03:34,564  -->  00:03:37,372
that's driven by code indentation,
89

89

00:03:37,372  -->  00:03:41,208
and the use of white space and these colons.
90

90

00:03:41,208  -->  00:03:44,267
So that means codeword ability is a really core part
91

91

00:03:44,267  -->  00:03:46,798
of the design of the the Python language.
92

92

00:03:46,798  -->  00:03:48,996
And that's why you'll feel that Python is a
93

93

00:03:48,996  -->  00:03:53,615
very easy language to learn in comparison to other languages
94

94

00:03:53,615  -->  00:03:56,825
because its readability is driven really at the core
95

95

00:03:56,825  -->  00:03:59,893
of Python, with white space and indentation
96

96

00:03:59,893  -->  00:04:02,911
and this sort of colon, Python statement syntax.
97

97

00:04:02,911  -->  00:04:07,295
Okay, so that's it for this quick introduction to
98

98

00:04:07,295  -->  00:04:10,572
Python statement and how they compare to other languages.
99

99

00:04:10,572  -->  00:04:13,147
What we're gonna do now is start coding out
100

100

00:04:13,147  -->  00:04:14,227
different Python statements
101

101

00:04:14,227  -->  00:04:17,413
and learning about various statements we can do.
102

102

00:04:17,413  -->  00:04:20,191
And we'll get a better understand that way.
103

103

00:04:20,191  -->  00:04:23,250
Okay, so thanks, I will see you at the next lecture
104

104

00:04:23,250  -->  00:04:26,041
where we'll start coding some Python statements.
105

105

00:04:26,041  -->  00:04:27,624
I'll see you there.
