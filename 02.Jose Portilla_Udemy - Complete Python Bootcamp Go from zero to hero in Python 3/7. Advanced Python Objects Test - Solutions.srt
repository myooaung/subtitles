<v Instructor>Hello everyone, in this lecture we're gonna</v>
2

2

00:00:03,382  -->  00:00:05,451
go quickly through the solutions of the
3

3

00:00:05,451  -->  00:00:08,191
Advanced Python Objects Test.
4

4

00:00:08,191  -->  00:00:12,144
Okay, so first one you had to do is use bin and hex
5

5

00:00:12,144  -->  00:00:15,145
functions in order to do these conversions.
6

6

00:00:15,145  -->  00:00:16,925
After that you had to use the round function,
7

7

00:00:16,925  -->  00:00:18,628
in order to round.
8

8

00:00:18,628  -->  00:00:22,451
Problem three I was expecting you to use the is lower method
9

9

00:00:22,451  -->  00:00:25,757
and then similarly in problem four it was another method,
10

10

00:00:25,757  -->  00:00:28,257
first string count and then w.
11

11

00:00:29,948  -->  00:00:32,839
Advanced sets, the methods here were difference
12

12

00:00:32,839  -->  00:00:36,506
for problem five, and union for problem six.
13

13

00:00:37,664  -->  00:00:39,764
Advanced dictionaries, this one might have been tough if
14

14

00:00:39,764  -->  00:00:41,546
you didn't see the pattern.
15

15

00:00:41,546  -->  00:00:43,393
And also dictionary comprehension in general is
16

16

00:00:43,393  -->  00:00:45,498
a little strange, but this was the solution for the
17

17

00:00:45,498  -->  00:00:47,670
dictionary comprehension, it was just cubing all
18

18

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:50,011
those numbers, and the key was the number,
19

19

00:00:50,011  -->  00:00:53,153
the value was the number cubed.
20

20

00:00:53,153  -->  00:00:55,080
Okay, advanced lists hopefully these were pretty
21

21

00:00:55,080  -->  00:00:56,868
straightforward, should have been just
22

22

00:00:56,868  -->  00:00:59,132
from the problem itself,
23

23

00:00:59,132  -->  00:01:00,549
reverse and sort.
24

24

00:01:01,603  -->  00:01:03,276
Okay, so that's just quick overview,
25

25

00:01:03,276  -->  00:01:04,781
go ahead and check out the Jupiter notebook if
26

26

00:01:04,781  -->  00:01:06,963
you wanna see the code yourself.
27

27

00:01:06,963  -->  00:01:08,796
Okay, thanks everyone.
