<v Narrator>Hello everyone, and welcome to the lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:03.407  -->  00:00:05.608
on the complex built-in function,
3

3

00:00:05.608  -->  00:00:09.298
which returns complex numbers and can accept either a string
4

4

00:00:09.298  -->  00:00:11.486
or a pair of numbers as an input.
5

5

00:00:11.486  -->  00:00:13.786
And I'll show you what I mean by that in just a second.
6

6

00:00:13.786  -->  00:00:15.742
So, if you're familiar with complex numbers,
7

7

00:00:15.742  -->  00:00:17.297
they have a real portion to them
8

8

00:00:17.297  -->  00:00:19.068
and then an imaginary portion to them.
9

9

00:00:19.068  -->  00:00:21.374
So if you're coming from a math or a physics background
10

10

00:00:21.374  -->  00:00:23.690
where you need to use complex numbers in your code,
11

11

00:00:23.690  -->  00:00:25.436
complex is going to be your go-to function
12

12

00:00:25.436  -->  00:00:27.367
to make that happen.
13

13

00:00:27.367  -->  00:00:30.628
Okay, so here in the jupyter notebook, I've described
14

14

00:00:30.628  -->  00:00:34.125
the two ways of inputting into complex, so you can go ahead
15

15

00:00:34.125  -->  00:00:36.867
and read this first, but basically, if the first parameter
16

16

00:00:36.867  -->  00:00:40.778
is a string, then you don't call out the second parameter.
17

17

00:00:40.778  -->  00:00:42.798
And then the other way of calling it
18

18

00:00:42.798  -->  00:00:44.617
is with a pair of numbers.
19

19

00:00:44.617  -->  00:00:47.307
So let's just go ahead and jump straight into the live code.
20

20

00:00:47.307  -->  00:00:49.522
'Cause I think this is the easiest way to see
21

21

00:00:49.522  -->  00:00:51.211
what's actually going on.
22

22

00:00:51.211  -->  00:00:54.029
So, let's go ahead and go over the first way to use
23

23

00:00:54.029  -->  00:00:55.779
the complex function.
24

24

00:00:56.873  -->  00:00:59.223
Alright, so let's go ahead and get started.
25

25

00:00:59.223  -->  00:01:03.315
So there's two ways of inputting into the function complex,
26

26

00:01:03.315  -->  00:01:06.134
the first way is with two parameters, the numbers.
27

27

00:01:06.134  -->  00:01:09.101
So, you want to put in the real number, the real part
28

28

00:01:09.101  -->  00:01:12.768
of the number first, and then the imaginary.
29

29

00:01:13.939  -->  00:01:17.967
So in this case, I've created two plus three J,
30

30

00:01:17.967  -->  00:01:21.075
where three J is the imaginary part of the complex number.
31

31

00:01:21.075  -->  00:01:24.754
Just to show you another example, complex,
32

32

00:01:24.754  -->  00:01:29.198
let's do 10 and one, so your real part is 10, plus one J.
33

33

00:01:29.198  -->  00:01:32.054
What's really interesting about the complex function though
34

34

00:01:32.054  -->  00:01:34.647
is it can actually read strings as well.
35

35

00:01:34.647  -->  00:01:38.429
So I could've gone complex and pass a string that says
36

36

00:01:38.429  -->  00:01:40.846
something like 10 plus two J,
37

37

00:01:43.691  -->  00:01:45.664
and it will understand it as well.
38

38

00:01:45.664  -->  00:01:46.878
Now, like I mentioned before,
39

39

00:01:46.878  -->  00:01:48.379
if you're passing in the string,
40

40

00:01:48.379  -->  00:01:50.018
you don't pass any second parameter,
41

41

00:01:50.018  -->  00:01:51.929
since you're already including the imaginary part
42

42

00:01:51.929  -->  00:01:53.632
in that string.
43

43

00:01:53.632  -->  00:01:56.158
And that's really all there is to it, so,
44

44

00:01:56.158  -->  00:01:58.491
keeping this in mind if you're ever dealing with
45

45

00:01:58.491  -->  00:02:02.248
complex numbers in Python, just know that Python's already
46

46

00:02:02.248  -->  00:02:03.884
thought of this for you, and there's a whole
47

47

00:02:03.884  -->  00:02:06.756
complex function to give you additional functionality
48

48

00:02:06.756  -->  00:02:09.257
as you deal with complex numbers in your code.
49

49

00:02:09.257  -->  00:02:13.050
Okay, super-short lecture, but hopefully it should have been
50

50

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:15.739
really straightforward, remember, there's two ways,
51

51

00:02:15.739  -->  00:02:17.400
the first part's the real number,
52

52

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:19.495
second parameter is the imaginary part,
53

53

00:02:19.495  -->  00:02:22.835
or you just pass a string through the complex function.
54

54

00:02:22.835  -->  00:02:24.295
Okay, that's all there is to it,
55

55

00:02:24.295  -->  00:02:26.490
and I'll see you at the next lecture.
