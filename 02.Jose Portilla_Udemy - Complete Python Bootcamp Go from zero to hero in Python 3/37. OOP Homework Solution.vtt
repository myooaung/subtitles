<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.586  -->  00:00:04.130
and welcome to the solutions lecture
3

3

00:00:04.130  -->  00:00:07.024
for the object oriented programme homework assignment.
4

4

00:00:07.024  -->  00:00:08.723
So you had two problems,
5

5

00:00:08.723  -->  00:00:11.112
one was filling in this Line class method,
6

6

00:00:11.112  -->  00:00:13.438
and the other was filling in the Cylinder method.
7

7

00:00:13.438  -->  00:00:16.009
So I'll show you my own solutions to it.
8

8

00:00:16.009  -->  00:00:17.669
Yours may be a little different,
9

9

00:00:17.669  -->  00:00:20.067
but hopefully, the classes were simple enough
10

10

00:00:20.067  -->  00:00:22.410
that they should look pretty similar.
11

11

00:00:22.410  -->  00:00:26.404
So the first thing I had to do was assign these attributes
12

12

00:00:26.404  -->  00:00:28.104
using self.
13

13

00:00:28.104  -->  00:00:31.213
So I said self.coor for coordinate 1,
14

14

00:00:31.213  -->  00:00:32.964
set it equal to that input,
15

15

00:00:32.964  -->  00:00:34.875
and then self.coor2,
16

16

00:00:34.875  -->  00:00:37.256
set it equal to that second coordinate input.
17

17

00:00:37.256  -->  00:00:40.296
So that's how I initialised my class.
18

18

00:00:40.296  -->  00:00:42.938
After that, for the distance method,
19

19

00:00:42.938  -->  00:00:46.801
what I did was unpacked the tuple using x1 and y1.
20

20

00:00:46.801  -->  00:00:49.011
You may have used indexing to do that.
21

21

00:00:49.011  -->  00:00:52.147
And then I did the same thing for x2 and y2,
22

22

00:00:52.147  -->  00:00:54.399
unpacked that tuple.
23

23

00:00:54.399  -->  00:00:57.174
And then the other things I did here,
24

24

00:00:57.174  -->  00:00:59.203
for slope, I did the exact same thing.
25

25

00:00:59.203  -->  00:01:01.469
You may have had this unpacking or assignments
26

26

00:01:01.469  -->  00:01:03.259
in another part of your code,
27

27

00:01:03.259  -->  00:01:05.189
but I had 'em within each method,
28

28

00:01:05.189  -->  00:01:08.259
just duplicated for readability.
29

29

00:01:08.259  -->  00:01:10.489
And then here, I just returned the distance formula
30

30

00:01:10.489  -->  00:01:13.307
now that I have the x and y coordinates,
31

31

00:01:13.307  -->  00:01:17.487
so x2 minus x1 squared, y2 minus y1 squared,
32

32

00:01:17.487  -->  00:01:19.609
and then the square root of that whole thing.
33

33

00:01:19.609  -->  00:01:21.790
And then the slope is just rise over run
34

34

00:01:21.790  -->  00:01:24.492
and I casted it into a float to make sure
35

35

00:01:24.492  -->  00:01:26.960
there were no issues there.
36

36

00:01:26.960  -->  00:01:31.127
Okay, so moving along to the second problem for cylinder.
37

37

00:01:32.189  -->  00:01:36.172
Again, I just assigned the attributes height and radius
38

38

00:01:36.172  -->  00:01:38.251
with the inputs height and radius.
39

39

00:01:38.251  -->  00:01:42.850
And I also put in a volume and a surface_area method.
40

40

00:01:42.850  -->  00:01:45.887
So volume was just one line return,
41

41

00:01:45.887  -->  00:01:48.582
and it took the height, multiplied it by pi,
42

42

00:01:48.582  -->  00:01:51.464
I just used 3.14 as an estimate of pi,
43

43

00:01:51.464  -->  00:01:55.371
by the radius squared, so height times pi r squared.
44

44

00:01:55.371  -->  00:01:58.290
And for the surface area, to make it a little more readable,
45

45

00:01:58.290  -->  00:02:01.362
I defined the top as pi r squared,
46

46

00:02:01.362  -->  00:02:03.910
so that's the top of the cylinder,
47

47

00:02:03.910  -->  00:02:05.620
and then the total surface area is gonna be
48

48

00:02:05.620  -->  00:02:07.735
two times the surface area of the top,
49

49

00:02:07.735  -->  00:02:09.341
so the top and the bottom,
50

50

00:02:09.341  -->  00:02:13.508
and then two times pi times the radius times the height.
51

51

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:16.880
And you can go ahead and look up the surface area
52

52

00:02:16.880  -->  00:02:20.574
equation for a cylinder to make sure that's correct.
53

53

00:02:20.574  -->  00:02:22.588
And that's all there was to it.
54

54

00:02:22.588  -->  00:02:25.483
Okay, go ahead and review that in case
55

55

00:02:25.483  -->  00:02:27.431
you're having any confusion,
56

56

00:02:27.431  -->  00:02:29.245
but I hope it went well for you.
57

57

00:02:29.245  -->  00:02:32.597
Thanks, and I'll see you at the next lecture.
