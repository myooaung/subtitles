<v Narrator>Hello everyone, in this lecture we'll be</v>
2

2

00:00:02.847  -->  00:00:06.209
going over the Errors and Exceptions Homework assignment.
3

3

00:00:06.209  -->  00:00:08.582
Consists of a few problems, and I'm just gonna
4

4

00:00:08.582  -->  00:00:10.905
go over them so you understand them all.
5

5

00:00:10.905  -->  00:00:14.942
Problem one, you'll see I want you to handle the exception
6

6

00:00:14.942  -->  00:00:19.621
thrown by the code here by using try and except blocks.
7

7

00:00:19.621  -->  00:00:23.421
So you'll notice here I'm saying for I in this list,
8

8

00:00:23.421  -->  00:00:27.479
try to square the strings, but that's not going to work
9

9

00:00:27.479  -->  00:00:28.890
since they're not numbers,
10

10

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:30.712
so I get this type error.
11

11

00:00:30.712  -->  00:00:34.687
What I want you to do is use try and except blocks
12

12

00:00:34.687  -->  00:00:39.184
to try this and then except if you get an error
13

13

00:00:39.184  -->  00:00:41.184
do something else.
14

14

00:00:41.184  -->  00:00:44.701
Next up, for problem two, what I want you to do is handle
15

15

00:00:44.701  -->  00:00:48.193
the exception thrown by the code below, by using again
16

16

00:00:48.193  -->  00:00:49.823
try and except blocks.
17

17

00:00:49.823  -->  00:00:52.488
Then I also want you to add a finally block to
18

18

00:00:52.488  -->  00:00:54.655
print all done at the end.
19

19

00:00:56.016  -->  00:00:59.031
Problem three, what I want you to do is write a function
20

20

00:00:59.031  -->  00:01:03.899
that asks for an integer and prints the square of it.
21

21

00:01:03.899  -->  00:01:07.129
I want you to use a while loop with a try, except, else
22

22

00:01:07.129  -->  00:01:09.972
block to account for incorrect inputs.
23

23

00:01:09.972  -->  00:01:12.361
So we went over this topic in lectures, if you're trying
24

24

00:01:12.361  -->  00:01:14.354
to get input from a user,
25

25

00:01:14.354  -->  00:01:16.318
so it should look something like this.
26

26

00:01:16.318  -->  00:01:20.318
When you run ask, it'll output input an integer.
27

27

00:01:21.661  -->  00:01:24.353
Notice I put null, so it says an error occured,
28

28

00:01:24.353  -->  00:01:25.770
please try again,
29

29

00:01:25.770  -->  00:01:28.115
then I say, input an integer, I inputted two,
30

30

00:01:28.115  -->  00:01:30.449
it says thank you, your number squared is four.
31

31

00:01:30.449  -->  00:01:32.736
So remember we covered in how to use, how to do this
32

32

00:01:32.736  -->  00:01:37.456
using a while loop with a try, except and else statement,
33

33

00:01:37.456  -->  00:01:39.813
so make sure you do that, and that's actually it
34

34

00:01:39.813  -->  00:01:43.141
for the Errors and Exceptions Homework assignment.
35

35

00:01:43.141  -->  00:01:46.027
Okay, thank you and I'll see you at the next lecture,
36

36

00:01:46.027  -->  00:01:48.023
where we're going to go over the solutions
37

37

00:01:48.023  -->  00:01:49.601
to this assignment.
38

38

00:01:49.601  -->  00:01:50.434
Thank you.
