00:00:01.361  -->  00:00:02.194
<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.194  -->  00:00:05.204
and welcome to your first milestone project.
3

3

00:00:05.204  -->  00:00:06.546
In this lecture, we're just gonna discuss
4

4

00:00:06.546  -->  00:00:08.822
what your milestone project assignment is,
5

5

00:00:08.822  -->  00:00:10.982
and the various notebooks in the repository
6

6

00:00:10.982  -->  00:00:14.017
dedicated to your first milestone project.
7

7

00:00:14.017  -->  00:00:14.999
With that being said,
8

8

00:00:14.999  -->  00:00:16.979
let's go ahead and jump to the repository,
9

9

00:00:16.979  -->  00:00:18.597
and check out the assignment notebook
10

10

00:00:18.597  -->  00:00:20.764
for milestone project one.
11

11

00:00:22.216  -->  00:00:25.832
So here I am at the Complete-Python-Bootcamp repository.
12

12

00:00:25.832  -->  00:00:26.884
If we just zoom in here,
13

13

00:00:26.884  -->  00:00:28.711
you can scroll all the way down
14

14

00:00:28.711  -->  00:00:31.223
to the M section for Milestone.
15

15

00:00:31.223  -->  00:00:34.839
And you'll see a couple of Milestone Project notebooks.
16

16

00:00:34.839  -->  00:00:35.796
We're gonna go ahead and check out
17

17

00:00:35.796  -->  00:00:38.878
Milestone Project 1, Assignment notebook.
18

18

00:00:38.878  -->  00:00:41.505
That should take you to this notebook here.
19

19

00:00:41.505  -->  00:00:43.785
In this case, I actually have it open in GitHub
20

20

00:00:43.785  -->  00:00:45.408
not a nbviewer.
21

21

00:00:45.408  -->  00:00:48.129
So I can get the latest version.
22

22

00:00:48.129  -->  00:00:50.484
But their Milestone Project 1,
23

23

00:00:50.484  -->  00:00:52.116
first off, I just wanna congratulate you
24

24

00:00:52.116  -->  00:00:55.143
on making it to your first Milestone Project.
25

25

00:00:55.143  -->  00:00:56.109
You've already learned a tonne,
26

26

00:00:56.109  -->  00:00:59.008
and you're definitely ready to work on a real project.
27

27

00:00:59.008  -->  00:01:02.104
For this assignment you're gonna create a Tic Tac Toe game.
28

28

00:01:02.104  -->  00:01:03.096
You can feel free to use
29

29

00:01:03.096  -->  00:01:05.073
any development environment you want,
30

30

00:01:05.073  -->  00:01:07.152
but just keep in mind that the solutions presented
31

31

00:01:07.152  -->  00:01:10.385
are gonna be in the Jupyter notebook format.
32

32

00:01:10.385  -->  00:01:12.165
The requirements for this milestone project
33

33

00:01:12.165  -->  00:01:15.638
are two players should be able to play the game,
34

34

00:01:15.638  -->  00:01:17.699
both sitting at the same computer.
35

35

00:01:17.699  -->  00:01:18.769
The board should be printed out
36

36

00:01:18.769  -->  00:01:20.803
every time a player makes a move,
37

37

00:01:20.803  -->  00:01:22.405
and you should be able to accept the input
38

38

00:01:22.405  -->  00:01:23.504
of the player position
39

39

00:01:23.504  -->  00:01:25.695
and then place a symbol on the board.
40

40

00:01:25.695  -->  00:01:26.822
You can feel free to use Google
41

41

00:01:26.822  -->  00:01:28.615
to help you figure anything out,
42

42

00:01:28.615  -->  00:01:29.634
but what I don't want you to do
43

43

00:01:29.634  -->  00:01:31.556
is just Google Tic Tac Toe in Python,
44

44

00:01:31.556  -->  00:01:33.382
otherwise you won't learn anything
45

45

00:01:33.382  -->  00:01:35.979
cause you'll just find a bunch of solutions online.
46

46

00:01:35.979  -->  00:01:38.048
Keep in mind this project can take anywhere between
47

47

00:01:38.048  -->  00:01:41.752
a few hours, several hours, or several days.
48

48

00:01:41.752  -->  00:01:44.973
There's four Jupyter notebooks related to this assignment.
49

49

00:01:44.973  -->  00:01:46.206
There's the assignment notebook,
50

50

00:01:46.206  -->  00:01:48.331
which is the notebook we're looking at right now,
51

51

00:01:48.331  -->  00:01:51.407
there's a walkthrough steps workbook notebook,
52

52

00:01:51.407  -->  00:01:53.145
a walkthrough solution notebook,
53

53

00:01:53.145  -->  00:01:56.077
and then an advanced solution notebook.
54

54

00:01:56.077  -->  00:01:57.372
What I encourage you to do
55

55

00:01:57.372  -->  00:01:59.548
is just to try to start the project on your own
56

56

00:01:59.548  -->  00:02:03.456
right now without referencing any of those notebooks.
57

57

00:02:03.456  -->  00:02:05.823
I'll go over what these notebooks are in just a second.
58

58

00:02:05.823  -->  00:02:07.937
But what you should really try to do right now
59

59

00:02:07.937  -->  00:02:09.729
is just start from scratch.
60

60

00:02:09.729  -->  00:02:13.138
A fresh notebook and see if you can actually programme out,
61

61

00:02:13.138  -->  00:02:15.171
or see how far you can get programming out,
62

62

00:02:15.171  -->  00:02:17.583
a full Tic Tac Toe game.
63

63

00:02:17.583  -->  00:02:20.374
If you get stuck, you can check out the next lecture,
64

64

00:02:20.374  -->  00:02:22.163
which is a text lecture with helpful hints
65

65

00:02:22.163  -->  00:02:23.936
and steps to follow.
66

66

00:02:23.936  -->  00:02:25.475
If you're still stuck after that,
67

67

00:02:25.475  -->  00:02:28.226
then check out the walkthrough steps workbook,
68

68

00:02:28.226  -->  00:02:30.772
which breaks up the project in steps for you to solve.
69

69

00:02:30.772  -->  00:02:31.833
If you're still stuck,
70

70

00:02:31.833  -->  00:02:33.834
then check out the walkthrough solution videos
71

71

00:02:33.834  -->  00:02:36.838
for more help on approaching the project.
72

72

00:02:36.838  -->  00:02:38.315
You should note that there are parts of this
73

73

00:02:38.315  -->  00:02:40.569
that are gonna be a struggle and that's good.
74

74

00:02:40.569  -->  00:02:41.732
I have complete faith in you,
75

75

00:02:41.732  -->  00:02:43.641
that you've made it this far through the course,
76

76

00:02:43.641  -->  00:02:45.033
and you have all the tools and knowledge
77

77

00:02:45.033  -->  00:02:46.646
to tackle this project.
78

78

00:02:46.646  -->  00:02:48.130
Remember it's just totally open book,
79

79

00:02:48.130  -->  00:02:49.957
so take your time, do a little research,
80

80

00:02:49.957  -->  00:02:53.493
and remember most of all, have fun.
81

81

00:02:53.493  -->  00:02:55.257
With that being said let's go ahead and check out
82

82

00:02:55.257  -->  00:02:58.921
the walkthrough steps workbook notebook.
83

83

00:02:58.921  -->  00:03:02.696
So I jump back to my repository, Complete-Python-Bootcamp,
84

84

00:03:02.696  -->  00:03:06.027
and I'm gonna go through the complete,
85

85

00:03:06.027  -->  00:03:08.043
or excuse me, the walkthrough steps workbook
86

86

00:03:08.043  -->  00:03:10.834
milestone project one notebook.
87

87

00:03:10.834  -->  00:03:12.831
This one actually has the solutions.
88

88

00:03:12.831  -->  00:03:14.475
But let's say you got stuck,
89

89

00:03:14.475  -->  00:03:16.016
the helpful hints lecture,
90

90

00:03:16.016  -->  00:03:17.646
you're still stuck after that,
91

91

00:03:17.646  -->  00:03:20.639
you can check out this walkthrough steps workbook.
92

92

00:03:20.639  -->  00:03:22.251
And if you click it,
93

93

00:03:22.251  -->  00:03:23.951
it'll look something like this.
94

94

00:03:23.951  -->  00:03:24.959
It's called Milestone Project 1:
95

95

00:03:24.959  -->  00:03:26.774
Walkthrough Steps Workbook.
96

96

00:03:26.774  -->  00:03:29.528
And below here is a set of steps for you to follow
97

97

00:03:29.528  -->  00:03:32.695
to create the Tic Tac Toe milestone project game.
98

98

00:03:32.695  -->  00:03:34.216
So you'll see here there's a bunch of cells
99

99

00:03:34.216  -->  00:03:35.800
for you to fill out.
100

100

00:03:35.800  -->  00:03:37.259
And there's actually steps telling you
101

101

00:03:37.259  -->  00:03:39.097
what functions to make.
102

102

00:03:39.097  -->  00:03:40.478
So for example the first step is
103

103

00:03:40.478  -->  00:03:42.585
write a function that can print out a board.
104

104

00:03:42.585  -->  00:03:44.728
Set up your board as a list, et cetera.
105

105

00:03:44.728  -->  00:03:47.437
So as you follow these steps it will guide you
106

106

00:03:47.437  -->  00:03:49.433
in filling out the functions you need
107

107

00:03:49.433  -->  00:03:52.556
for actually creating a Tic Tac Toe project.
108

108

00:03:52.556  -->  00:03:55.212
If you're still stuck after this,
109

109

00:03:55.212  -->  00:03:57.913
then you can check out the full solution notebook
110

110

00:03:57.913  -->  00:03:59.696
and the videos for it.
111

111

00:03:59.696  -->  00:04:01.262
In which we're gonna actually walkthrough
112

112

00:04:01.262  -->  00:04:03.159
and solve all of these problems
113

113

00:04:03.159  -->  00:04:05.071
through a live coding session.
114

114

00:04:05.071  -->  00:04:07.872
Do all of the steps and teach you every step necessary
115

115

00:04:07.872  -->  00:04:11.327
to complete the Tic Tac Toe game.
116

116

00:04:11.327  -->  00:04:13.260
After that if you're interested in
117

117

00:04:13.260  -->  00:04:14.951
a more advanced solution,
118

118

00:04:14.951  -->  00:04:17.407
using a couple topics we haven't actually covered yet,
119

119

00:04:17.407  -->  00:04:20.272
you can go back to the Jupyter notebook viewer
120

120

00:04:20.272  -->  00:04:23.466
and click Milestone Project 1, Advanced Solution.
121

121

00:04:23.466  -->  00:04:25.578
There's the complete walkthrough solution
122

122

00:04:25.578  -->  00:04:27.720
which is the solution for all these functions
123

123

00:04:27.720  -->  00:04:29.310
to make a working game.
124

124

00:04:29.310  -->  00:04:31.020
And then there's the advanced solution,
125

125

00:04:31.020  -->  00:04:33.243
which uses some topics we haven't covered yet,
126

126

00:04:33.243  -->  00:04:34.700
but are still nice to know in the context
127

127

00:04:34.700  -->  00:04:36.644
of the Tic Tac Toe game.
128

128

00:04:36.644  -->  00:04:38.731
Okay, that's it for this lecture.
129

129

00:04:38.731  -->  00:04:40.640
Again if you want the actual assignment,
130

130

00:04:40.640  -->  00:04:42.682
click on the assignment notebook.
131

131

00:04:42.682  -->  00:04:44.749
If you want some more hints,
132

132

00:04:44.749  -->  00:04:47.772
check out the next lecture foe a text lecture,
133

133

00:04:47.772  -->  00:04:50.744
consisting of helpful hints.
134

134

00:04:50.744  -->  00:04:53.146
If you want even more hints in a notebook format,
135

135

00:04:53.146  -->  00:04:55.674
you can click the walkthrough steps workbook,
136

136

00:04:55.674  -->  00:04:58.491
and begin to fill out the functions defined here for you,
137

137

00:04:58.491  -->  00:05:00.030
and follow the instructions.
138

138

00:05:00.030  -->  00:05:02.274
Still stuck after that then check out the videos
139

139

00:05:02.274  -->  00:05:04.722
for the complete walkthrough solution.
140

140

00:05:04.722  -->  00:05:06.572
Okay, with that being said,
141

141

00:05:06.572  -->  00:05:08.739
best of luck and have fun.
