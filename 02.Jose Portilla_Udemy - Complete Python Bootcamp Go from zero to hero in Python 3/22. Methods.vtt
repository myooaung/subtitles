00:00:02.567  -->  00:00:04.393
<v Instructor>Hello everyone and</v>
2

2

00:00:04.393  -->  00:00:06.505
welcome to the methods lecture.
3

3

00:00:06.505  -->  00:00:09.601
So, in this lecture we're gonna be going briefly
4

4

00:00:09.601  -->  00:00:12.399
over methods and how methods are essentially
5

5

00:00:12.399  -->  00:00:15.555
functions built into objects.
6

6

00:00:15.555  -->  00:00:19.722
So let's go ahead and jump over to a quick presentation.
7

7

00:00:21.504  -->  00:00:25.341
Okay. So let's get a quick overview of methods.
8

8

00:00:25.341  -->  00:00:27.543
So methods are essentially functions
9

9

00:00:27.543  -->  00:00:29.716
that are built into objects.
10

10

00:00:29.716  -->  00:00:32.312
At least that's the way I like to think about them.
11

11

00:00:32.312  -->  00:00:34.025
And later on in the course, we're gonna learn
12

12

00:00:34.025  -->  00:00:36.761
about how to create our own objects and methods
13

13

00:00:36.761  -->  00:00:39.115
using something called Object Oriented Programming
14

14

00:00:39.115  -->  00:00:42.580
or otherwise known as OOP and we'll use classes
15

15

00:00:42.580  -->  00:00:44.415
in order to make that happen.
16

16

00:00:44.415  -->  00:00:47.060
But for now, let's just focus on methods
17

17

00:00:47.060  -->  00:00:49.052
on objects that we're already familiar with.
18

18

00:00:49.052  -->  00:00:52.811
So methods will perform specific actions on the object
19

19

00:00:52.811  -->  00:00:56.372
and can also take arguments, just like a function.
20

20

00:00:56.372  -->  00:00:59.723
This lecture it's gonna serve as just a brief introduction
21

21

00:00:59.723  -->  00:01:03.187
to methods and get you thinking about overall design methods
22

22

00:01:03.187  -->  00:01:05.882
that we'll touch back upon when we reach OOP
23

23

00:01:05.882  -->  00:01:09.376
or Object Oriented Programming in the course.
24

24

00:01:09.376  -->  00:01:12.868
So you've already used methods throughout the course,
25

25

00:01:12.868  -->  00:01:14.789
but now we're just actually formalising
26

26

00:01:14.789  -->  00:01:16.154
what we're actually doing.
27

27

00:01:16.154  -->  00:01:19.997
So methods are in the form of this syntax.
28

28

00:01:19.997  -->  00:01:22.731
Where you have the object or the variable
29

29

00:01:22.731  -->  00:01:24.951
that's referring to that object;
30

30

00:01:24.951  -->  00:01:28.206
a dot and then the method name,
31

31

00:01:28.206  -->  00:01:30.739
and then parenthesis an additional arguments.
32

32

00:01:30.739  -->  00:01:32.806
Sometimes you pass an argument, sometimes you don't.
33

33

00:01:32.806  -->  00:01:35.048
It depends on the method.
34

34

00:01:35.048  -->  00:01:37.317
So you'll see later that we can think of these methods
35

35

00:01:37.317  -->  00:01:40.231
as having an arguments called self that refers
36

36

00:01:40.231  -->  00:01:42.487
to the object itself.
37

37

00:01:42.487  -->  00:01:44.174
Don't worry if you don't understand that now
38

38

00:01:44.174  -->  00:01:46.382
but just keep that in the back of your mind
39

39

00:01:46.382  -->  00:01:49.376
and you'll see how that really comes into play
40

40

00:01:49.376  -->  00:01:52.649
when we learn about Object Oriented Programming.
41

41

00:01:52.649  -->  00:01:55.259
And now we're gonna jump over to the code.
42

42

00:01:55.259  -->  00:01:56.937
But the main purpose of this lecture,
43

43

00:01:56.937  -->  00:01:58.912
since you've already used methods,
44

44

00:01:58.912  -->  00:02:00.861
is just to plant a seed where you're thinking
45

45

00:02:00.861  -->  00:02:03.939
about methods and how they interact with objects.
46

46

00:02:03.939  -->  00:02:07.013
Because when we learn about Object Oriented Programming,
47

47

00:02:07.013  -->  00:02:09.922
then it's gonna click really well on
48

48

00:02:09.922  -->  00:02:12.552
what Object Oriented Programming is and
49

49

00:02:12.552  -->  00:02:14.899
how you're making your own methods and your own objects.
50

50

00:02:14.899  -->  00:02:17.237
So let's go and jump to some quick code
51

51

00:02:17.237  -->  00:02:19.746
in the Jupyter notebook.
52

52

00:02:19.746  -->  00:02:22.409
Okay. So here's the notebook that's already laid out.
53

53

00:02:22.409  -->  00:02:23.775
And we're gonna to through some
54

54

00:02:23.775  -->  00:02:25.736
pretty quick examples and you've probably already
55

55

00:02:25.736  -->  00:02:27.943
seen a lot of these before.
56

56

00:02:27.943  -->  00:02:29.398
So methods.
57

57

00:02:29.398  -->  00:02:33.565
Let's go ahead and see a quick example of methods on a list.
58

58

00:02:35.222  -->  00:02:36.461
So I'm gonna create a simple list;
59

59

00:02:36.461  -->  00:02:39.555
one, two, three, four, five,
60

60

00:02:39.555  -->  00:02:42.946
and fortunately with IPython in the Jupyter notebook,
61

61

00:02:42.946  -->  00:02:45.525
we can quickly see all the possible methods
62

62

00:02:45.525  -->  00:02:47.700
using the tab key.
63

63

00:02:47.700  -->  00:02:50.283
So I can hit L dot and then tab
64

64

00:02:51.932  -->  00:02:54.916
and here a have a list of all the available methods
65

65

00:02:54.916  -->  00:02:56.442
for a list.
66

66

00:02:56.442  -->  00:02:58.085
So let's go ahead and try out a few of them.
67

67

00:02:58.085  -->  00:02:59.911
Let's try out the one that we're already familiar with,
68

68

00:02:59.911  -->  00:03:00.744
append.
69

69

00:03:01.919  -->  00:03:06.226
And append allows us to add elements to the end of the list.
70

70

00:03:06.226  -->  00:03:09.056
So I'm going to say append,
71

71

00:03:09.056  -->  00:03:13.192
let's go ahead and add six to the end of that list.
72

72

00:03:13.192  -->  00:03:15.482
And now if I check that list,
73

73

00:03:15.482  -->  00:03:18.458
there I have one, two, three, four, five, six.
74

74

00:03:18.458  -->  00:03:22.483
Okay. So again in order to grab that list of methods,
75

75

00:03:22.483  -->  00:03:25.743
remember this only works with IPython Jupyter notebooks,
76

76

00:03:25.743  -->  00:03:29.288
I click tab and I get the list and click append.
77

77

00:03:29.288  -->  00:03:31.669
Or just hit enter and once it's highlighted,
78

78

00:03:31.669  -->  00:03:34.578
and then if I want to know more about the specific method,
79

79

00:03:34.578  -->  00:03:38.556
I can hold shift, tab, and then I get this little
80

80

00:03:38.556  -->  00:03:41.785
docstring pop up, and I can click the plus sign
81

81

00:03:41.785  -->  00:03:43.347
and it'll tell me what it does.
82

82

00:03:43.347  -->  00:03:47.518
So from the docstring it says it appends object to end.
83

83

00:03:47.518  -->  00:03:51.179
Okay. So let's go ahead and do another one.
84

84

00:03:51.179  -->  00:03:53.626
We'll hit tab and let's go ahead and move down one
85


85

00:03:53.626  -->  00:03:55.439
so we're at count.
86

86

00:03:55.439  -->  00:03:57.606
So now what does count do?
87

87

00:03:58.477  -->  00:04:00.619
Well let's go ahead and use the built in help.
88

88

00:04:00.619  -->  00:04:04.447
So I can say shift tab to the docstring.
89

89

00:04:04.447  -->  00:04:05.788
It's an L count.
90

90

00:04:05.788  -->  00:04:08.957
Takes in a value and return an integer.
91

91

00:04:08.957  -->  00:04:13.197
And it returns the number of occurrences of the value.
92

92

00:04:13.197  -->  00:04:14.030
So counts.
93

93

00:04:15.130  -->  00:04:20.048
Let's count how many times three appears in that list.
94

94

00:04:20.048  -->  00:04:22.070
And you'll notice it appears just once.
95

95

00:04:22.070  -->  00:04:26.526
Okay. So let's say you're using some sort of
96

96

00:04:26.526  -->  00:04:30.508
other IDE or some other coding environment
97

97

00:04:30.508  -->  00:04:33.659
that's not Jupyter or IPython based,
98

98

00:04:33.659  -->  00:04:35.889
how could you get the help on these built in methods
99

99

00:04:35.889  -->  00:04:37.391
or built in functions?
100

100

00:04:37.391  -->  00:04:40.815
You can actually just use the help function.
101

101

00:04:40.815  -->  00:04:43.565
So I can say help on that method.
102

102

00:04:46.500  -->  00:04:48.917
And it outputs the docstring.
103

103

00:04:50.841  -->  00:04:52.192
And hopefully that will help you.
104

104

00:04:52.192  -->  00:04:54.542
So what I want you to do now is feel free
105

105

00:04:54.542  -->  00:04:57.590
to play around with the rest of the methods for a list.
106

106

00:04:57.590  -->  00:05:00.513
And later on in this section in your quiz,
107

107

00:05:00.513  -->  00:05:02.605
it's going to involve using help and Google searching
108

108

00:05:02.605  -->  00:05:05.009
for the different methods on all the types
109

109

00:05:05.009  -->  00:05:08.402
of objects and data structures that we've learned about.
110

110

00:05:08.402  -->  00:05:10.210
So the only thing I want you
111

111

00:05:10.210  -->  00:05:11.978
to really get out of this lecture
112

112

00:05:11.978  -->  00:05:16.582
is to know if I want to find a method on an object.
113

113

00:05:16.582  -->  00:05:19.248
It's just a dot or a decimal point.
114

114

00:05:19.248  -->  00:05:22.650
I click tab and I have the list of methods.
115

115

00:05:22.650  -->  00:05:24.144
And then I can click shift tab
116

116

00:05:24.144  -->  00:05:26.446
to get some more information on it.
117

117

00:05:26.446  -->  00:05:27.279
Okay.
118

118

00:05:29.376  -->  00:05:30.991
So that's it for methods.
119

119

00:05:30.991  -->  00:05:32.129
It's just super basic.
120

120

00:05:32.129  -->  00:05:33.754
I want you to just feel comfortable calling them
121

121

00:05:33.754  -->  00:05:36.758
on the objects or data structures that you've made.
122

122

00:05:36.758  -->  00:05:39.977
And keep in mind just the syntax here
123

123

00:05:39.977  -->  00:05:41.480
and what it looks like.
124

124

00:05:41.480  -->  00:05:44.722
Because when we go into Object Oriented Programming,
125

125

00:05:44.722  -->  00:05:47.735
you're gonna feel the connexion with methods
126

126

00:05:47.735  -->  00:05:50.142
and how you're actually building them out.
127

127

00:05:50.142  -->  00:05:53.054
And a lot of times in other tutorials that I've seen,
128

128

00:05:53.054  -->  00:05:56.194
that connexion is lost on beginners.
129

129

00:05:56.194  -->  00:05:58.356
So keep in mind that you're calling a method
130

130

00:05:58.356  -->  00:06:00.353
on your object or data structure
131

131

00:06:00.353  -->  00:06:03.008
and then passing an arguments to it optionally.
132

132

00:06:03.008  -->  00:06:05.819
Okay. So that's it and feel free
133

133

00:06:05.819  -->  00:06:07.864
to read up on the Jupyter notebook
134

134

00:06:07.864  -->  00:06:09.446
if you want some more details on it.
135

135

00:06:09.446  -->  00:06:13.613
Okay. Great and I will see you in the next lecture.
