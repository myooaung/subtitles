<v Instructor>Hello everyone</v>
2

2

00:00:02.670  -->  00:00:05.118
and welcome to the next built-in function lecture.
3

3

00:00:05.118  -->  00:00:06.687
And we're gonna be going over the built-in
4

4

00:00:06.687  -->  00:00:08.520
functions all and any.
5

5

00:00:09.867  -->  00:00:12.944
And all and any are basically built-in functions
6

6

00:00:12.944  -->  00:00:14.724
that allow us to conveniently check
7

7

00:00:14.724  -->  00:00:18.196
for Booleans matching in an iterable.
8

8

00:00:18.196  -->  00:00:21.381
I've written out what you could actually type
9

9

00:00:21.381  -->  00:00:25.399
if you wanted to create your own all and any functions.
10

10

00:00:25.399  -->  00:00:27.412
So let's just zoom in and go over it.
11

11

00:00:27.412  -->  00:00:29.083
So what is all doing?
12

12

00:00:29.083  -->  00:00:33.052
all's gonna say that if all the elements
13

13

00:00:33.052  -->  00:00:37.298
in that iterable are true, then it returns True.
14

14

00:00:37.298  -->  00:00:40.782
So it says all takes an iterable
15

15

00:00:40.782  -->  00:00:44.048
for elements in the iterable, if not element,
16

16

00:00:44.048  -->  00:00:46.428
which is basically a way of saying
17

17

00:00:46.428  -->  00:00:48.854
if not true then return False,
18

18

00:00:48.854  -->  00:00:50.627
otherwise it returns True.
19

19

00:00:50.627  -->  00:00:53.578
So basically, as it's saying as a word
20

20

00:00:53.578  -->  00:00:56.586
if they're all true it returns True.
21

21

00:00:56.586  -->  00:00:58.556
any, as you might have guessed
22

22

00:00:58.556  -->  00:01:01.295
returns True if any them are true.
23

23

00:01:01.295  -->  00:01:03.693
So you could type it out so any
24

24

00:01:03.693  -->  00:01:07.050
put in your iterable, for element in iterable,
25

25

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:11.082
if element, so if one of them is true it will return True.
26

26

00:01:11.082  -->  00:01:13.708
If that if case never becomes true,
27

27

00:01:13.708  -->  00:01:14.541
then none of 'em are true,
28

28

00:01:14.541  -->  00:01:16.318
and it returns False.
29

29

00:01:16.318  -->  00:01:18.063
So hopefully, this will be pretty straightforward
30

30

00:01:18.063  -->  00:01:19.881
after seeing a few examples.
31

31

00:01:19.881  -->  00:01:22.944
Let's go ahead and get started with some live code.
32

32

00:01:22.944  -->  00:01:25.908
I'm gonna create a quick list, call it l,
33

33

00:01:25.908  -->  00:01:27.871
and it's gonna just be straight Booleans,
34

34

00:01:27.871  -->  00:01:29.954
True, True, False, False.
35

35

00:01:34.923  -->  00:01:39.231
Alright, so let's go ahead and check first all.
36

36

00:01:39.231  -->  00:01:42.530
So go ahead and guess what you think will happen here,
37

37

00:01:42.530  -->  00:01:44.629
whether it's gonna return True or False,
38

38

00:01:44.629  -->  00:01:46.786
before running this cell.
39

39

00:01:46.786  -->  00:01:50.056
Okay, so all will return True is all of 'em are true,
40

40

00:01:50.056  -->  00:01:52.396
so it should return then, False.
41

41

00:01:52.396  -->  00:01:53.879
So that makes sense, right?
42

42

00:01:53.879  -->  00:01:56.319
'cause not all the elements are true.
43

43

00:01:56.319  -->  00:01:59.182
Okay, so what will any return, then?
44

44

00:01:59.182  -->  00:02:02.564
So remember, any returns True if any of the elements
45

45

00:02:02.564  -->  00:02:04.706
in that iterable are true.
46

46

00:02:04.706  -->  00:02:07.544
And so in this case, it returns True.
47

47

00:02:07.544  -->  00:02:11.711
Okay, that's really all there is to it for all and any.
48

48

00:02:12.551  -->  00:02:15.428
So I will let you go ahead and explore them
49

49

00:02:15.428  -->  00:02:19.158
and see how you can use them or read them in your own code,
50

50

00:02:19.158  -->  00:02:21.292
but as far as their basic usage, it's really
51

51

00:02:21.292  -->  00:02:23.434
just that simple, all and any.
52

52

00:02:23.434  -->  00:02:25.915
And you can basically remember just by their names,
53

53

00:02:25.915  -->  00:02:28.141
if they're all true, this returns True,
54

54

00:02:28.141  -->  00:02:30.711
if any are true, that returns True,
55

55

00:02:30.711  -->  00:02:33.208
and then vice versa for the opposite of 'em.
56

56

00:02:33.208  -->  00:02:35.677
If they're not all true, it returns False,
57

57

00:02:35.677  -->  00:02:39.275
if any of 'em are true, it returns True.
58

58

00:02:39.275  -->  00:02:41.560
If that's not the case, then it returns False.
59

59

00:02:41.560  -->  00:02:45.110
So if they're all false, then any returns False.
60

60

00:02:45.110  -->  00:02:48.606
Okay, that's it for this quick built-in function lecture
61

61

00:02:48.606  -->  00:02:49.854
on all and any.
62

62

00:02:49.854  -->  00:02:52.031
I will see you at the next one.
63

63

00:02:52.031  -->  00:02:52.864
Thank you.
