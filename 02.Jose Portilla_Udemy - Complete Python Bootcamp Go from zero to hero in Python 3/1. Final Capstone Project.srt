00:00:01,783  -->  00:00:02,616
<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>
2

2

00:00:02,616  -->  00:00:05,460
and welcome to the Final Capstone Projects.
3

3

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:08,562
First of all, a huge congratulations to you
4

4

00:00:08,562  -->  00:00:10,627
for making it this far into the course.
5

5

00:00:10,627  -->  00:00:12,028
You should be super proud of yourself
6

6

00:00:12,028  -->  00:00:13,837
for everything you've learned.
7

7

00:00:13,837  -->  00:00:16,420
And now, what we're gonna do is take all your knowledge
8

8

00:00:16,420  -->  00:00:19,341
and put it into a final capstone project.
9

9

00:00:19,341  -->  00:00:20,579
So what you're gonna do,
10

10

00:00:20,579  -->  00:00:23,226
is click on the folder in nbviewer
11

11

00:00:23,226  -->  00:00:25,809
called final capstone projects.
12

12

00:00:26,946  -->  00:00:30,264
And then, click on final capstone project ideas,
13

13

00:00:30,264  -->  00:00:33,431
Ipython notebook, or Jupyter notebook.
14

14

00:00:34,625  -->  00:00:37,557
And here, you have a list of capstone project ideas.
15

15

00:00:37,557  -->  00:00:41,928
So, your capstone project is actually totally up to you,
16

16

00:00:41,928  -->  00:00:43,618
and what I want you to do is
17

17

00:00:43,618  -->  00:00:45,263
pick a simple project at first
18

18

00:00:45,263  -->  00:00:47,593
that you think you can finish in a day.
19

19

00:00:47,593  -->  00:00:50,639
So, here I have listed about a hundred project ideas,
20

20

00:00:50,639  -->  00:00:52,442
some of these we've actually already done
21

21

00:00:52,442  -->  00:00:56,314
such as a Fibonacci Sequence generator,
22

22

00:00:56,314  -->  00:01:00,005
or even the FizzBuzz problem is also in this list.
23

23

00:01:00,005  -->  00:01:02,312
So, I want you to choose one of these problems
24

24

00:01:02,312  -->  00:01:04,250
that you think you can finish in a day.
25

25

00:01:04,250  -->  00:01:06,613
They're organised by section,
26

26

00:01:06,613  -->  00:01:08,393
so there's a numbers section,
27

27

00:01:08,393  -->  00:01:11,014
there's the classic algorithm section,
28

28

00:01:11,014  -->  00:01:15,377
a graph section, data structures, text, networking,
29

29

00:01:15,377  -->  00:01:18,877
classes, threading, web, files, databases,
30

30

00:01:20,441  -->  00:01:22,911
graphs and multimedia, security.
31

31

00:01:22,911  -->  00:01:24,590
So there's a lot here.
32

32

00:01:24,590  -->  00:01:25,794
So choose one of these projects
33

33

00:01:25,794  -->  00:01:27,781
that you think you can do in one day.
34

34

00:01:27,781  -->  00:01:28,855
Once you're done with that,
35

35

00:01:28,855  -->  00:01:29,842
what I want you to do is
36

36

00:01:29,842  -->  00:01:32,290
either pick a project from this list,
37

37

00:01:32,290  -->  00:01:33,896
or think of your own project,
38

38

00:01:33,896  -->  00:01:35,990
something maybe at work,
39

39

00:01:35,990  -->  00:01:37,970
that you want to fix using Python.
40

40

00:01:37,970  -->  00:01:39,320
Or maybe you have a hobby
41

41

00:01:39,320  -->  00:01:40,865
you want to explore more with Python.
42

42

00:01:40,865  -->  00:01:42,024
Anything that you want,
43

43

00:01:42,024  -->  00:01:43,268
it's up to you.
44

44

00:01:43,268  -->  00:01:45,211
But try to make it so it's gonna take you more than a week
45

45

00:01:45,211  -->  00:01:46,573
to finish that project.
46

46

00:01:46,573  -->  00:01:48,859
Remember, just have fun with this.
47

47

00:01:48,859  -->  00:01:51,998
If you do decide to use one of these projects here
48

48

00:01:51,998  -->  00:01:53,237
as your capstone project,
49

49

00:01:53,237  -->  00:01:54,964
what I want you to be aware of,
50

50

00:01:54,964  -->  00:01:56,720
that if you go back to the folder
51

51

00:01:56,720  -->  00:01:58,125
Final Capstone Project,
52

52

00:01:58,125  -->  00:01:59,487
there's a folder within that folder
53

53

00:01:59,487  -->  00:02:01,749
called Projects Solutions.
54

54

00:02:01,749  -->  00:02:04,795
And there should be a Solution Links.md,
55

55

00:02:04,795  -->  00:02:05,909
and if you click that link,
56

56

00:02:05,909  -->  00:02:08,992
it'll take you to GitHub read me page
57

57

00:02:09,835  -->  00:02:13,650
where I have links to a bunch of other solutions here
58

58

00:02:13,650  -->  00:02:15,915
that other people have done in Python,
59

59

00:02:15,915  -->  00:02:17,743
to a lot of these problems.
60

60

00:02:17,743  -->  00:02:19,717
So you can click on any of these links,
61

61

00:02:19,717  -->  00:02:23,384
and it will take you to an example solution.
62

62

00:02:25,120  -->  00:02:26,116
So for example,
63

63

00:02:26,116  -->  00:02:29,998
if you were deciding to try to find Pi to the Nth digit,
64

64

00:02:29,998  -->  00:02:31,702
you've googled around,
65

65

00:02:31,702  -->  00:02:33,638
you want to make sure your program's right,
66

66

00:02:33,638  -->  00:02:36,069
you want to compare your code to someone else's,
67

67

00:02:36,069  -->  00:02:37,355
click any of these,
68

68

00:02:37,355  -->  00:02:39,823
I open the link in a new tab,
69

69

00:02:39,823  -->  00:02:42,783
and it will take you to an example solution by someone.
70

70

00:02:42,783  -->  00:02:44,955
Okay, so that's it.
71

71

00:02:44,955  -->  00:02:47,770
Remember these capstone projects are totally up to you.
72

72

00:02:47,770  -->  00:02:49,075
Do something that interests you,
73

73

00:02:49,075  -->  00:02:50,437
that you find fun.
74

74

00:02:50,437  -->  00:02:51,715
The only thing I suggest,
75

75

00:02:51,715  -->  00:02:53,236
is that you start off small,
76

76

00:02:53,236  -->  00:02:57,013
and then grow larger and larger with your code base.
77

77

00:02:57,013  -->  00:02:58,379
Alright, other than that,
78

78

00:02:58,379  -->  00:03:01,580
huge congratulations for making it so far in the course.
79

79

00:03:01,580  -->  00:03:03,426
I cannot stress this enough.
80

80

00:03:03,426  -->  00:03:05,661
You've learned so much if you've made it this far.
81

81

00:03:05,661  -->  00:03:06,648
Congrats.
82

82

00:03:06,648  -->  00:03:09,958
And make sure you have fun in your Python project.
83

83

00:03:09,958  -->  00:03:11,791
Okay, thanks everyone.
