00:00:02.052  -->  00:00:03.109
<v Instructor>Hello everyone.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.109  -->  00:00:04.437
This will be just a quick overview on
3

3

00:00:04.437  -->  00:00:06.476
the decorators homework.
4

4

00:00:06.476  -->  00:00:08.857
So decorators homework is actually totally optional,
5

5

00:00:08.857  -->  00:00:10.834
and you're not gonna be writing any code.
6

6

00:00:10.834  -->  00:00:12.615
What I want you to do is actually just check out
7

7

00:00:12.615  -->  00:00:14.021
some web frameworks.
8

8

00:00:14.021  -->  00:00:15.892
I don't expect you to be using decorators
9

9

00:00:15.892  -->  00:00:18.283
until much further in your coding career.
10

10

00:00:18.283  -->  00:00:21.387
So that's why this homework is optional.
11

11

00:00:21.387  -->  00:00:23.052
The first thing I want you to do
12

12

00:00:23.052  -->  00:00:25.634
is just check out the web framework Flask.
13

13

00:00:25.634  -->  00:00:28.119
So Flask is gonna allow you to create web pages in Python.
14

14

00:00:28.119  -->  00:00:30.674
So if you're interested in becoming more of a
15

15

00:00:30.674  -->  00:00:34.144
full stack developer, and that's kind of the path
16

16

00:00:34.144  -->  00:00:37.809
you want to take as far as your Python coding career,
17

17

00:00:37.809  -->  00:00:39.754
go ahead and check out Flask.
18

18

00:00:39.754  -->  00:00:42.760
It's a really fun way to make websites.
19

19

00:00:42.760  -->  00:00:45.280
But what's interesting about it, is that decorators
20

20

00:00:45.280  -->  00:00:49.299
are heavily integrated into the way the web framework works.
21

21

00:00:49.299  -->  00:00:51.066
So I want you to check that out,
22

22

00:00:51.066  -->  00:00:53.919
and then also click this link to learn about
23

23

00:00:53.919  -->  00:00:55.649
how to use view decorators.
24

24

00:00:55.649  -->  00:00:58.146
So they actually have a whole page kind of describing
25

25

00:00:58.146  -->  00:01:02.031
how they use these function decorators,
26

26

00:01:02.031  -->  00:01:05.141
and how they work in their own application.
27

27

00:01:05.141  -->  00:01:07.341
Okay, so this is a really nice way to see
28

28

00:01:07.341  -->  00:01:09.982
how decorators are used in real life.
29

29

00:01:09.982  -->  00:01:11.707
After that, if you're still really interested
30

30

00:01:11.707  -->  00:01:15.151
in web pages with Python, what I want you to do
31

31

00:01:15.151  -->  00:01:17.896
is check out Django, which is a more heavy-duty,
32

32

00:01:17.896  -->  00:01:21.443
and probably more popular web framework for Python.
33

33

00:01:21.443  -->  00:01:24.431
So you can check that out as well.
34

34

00:01:24.431  -->  00:01:26.604
And last but not least,
35

35

00:01:26.604  -->  00:01:29.230
in this decorators homework notebook,
36

36

00:01:29.230  -->  00:01:32.035
I have a few definitions for what a framework is
37

37

00:01:32.035  -->  00:01:34.284
and what an API is, in case you're wondering
38

38

00:01:34.284  -->  00:01:36.939
what I've been meaning by web framework.
39

39

00:01:36.939  -->  00:01:39.387
Okay, so again, this homework is optional.
40

40

00:01:39.387  -->  00:01:40.898
But I do encourage you to a least check out
41

41

00:01:40.898  -->  00:01:43.342
Flask and Django on view decorators,
42

42

00:01:43.342  -->  00:01:45.751
just those pages, 'cause it is a super interesting topic
43

43

00:01:45.751  -->  00:01:49.673
of how you're able to develop web pages with Python.
44

44

00:01:49.673  -->  00:01:51.732
A lot of interesting and famous web pages
45

45

00:01:51.732  -->  00:01:54.065
such as Reddit, or Pinterest, have been developed
46

46

00:01:54.065  -->  00:01:55.872
using Python.
47

47

00:01:55.872  -->  00:01:58.918
So it's important that you know at least that it's possible.
48

48

00:01:58.918  -->  00:02:01.456
Okay, so other than that, that's really it
49

49

00:02:01.456  -->  00:02:02.837
and thank you.
50

50

00:02:02.837  -->  00:02:05.587
I'll see you at the next lecture.
