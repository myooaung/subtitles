<v Instructor>Hello everyone.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,578  -->  00:00:03,734
In this video, we'll be going over
3

3

00:00:03,734  -->  00:00:07,686
the Errors and Exceptions Homework solutions.
4

4

00:00:07,686  -->  00:00:11,034
So Problem 1, all you had to do was take the code,
5

5

00:00:11,034  -->  00:00:13,629
indent it into a try block,
6

6

00:00:13,629  -->  00:00:15,112
and then add an except block,
7

7

00:00:15,112  -->  00:00:18,416
and here I said except print an error occurred.
8

8

00:00:18,416  -->  00:00:19,783
Pretty simple.
9

9

00:00:19,783  -->  00:00:21,719
Problem 2, very similar.
10

10

00:00:21,719  -->  00:00:25,882
Had to put try block with z = x/y.
11

11

00:00:25,882  -->  00:00:29,978
I actually put in the specific error, ZeroDivisionError.
12

12

00:00:29,978  -->  00:00:32,534
As always, you could have just said except,
13

13

00:00:32,534  -->  00:00:34,263
and for any error, it would have printed
14

14

00:00:34,263  -->  00:00:35,949
can't divide by zero.
15

15

00:00:35,949  -->  00:00:40,449
And the I added the finally block to print all done.
16

16

00:00:40,449  -->  00:00:43,666
Problem 3 should have been pretty familiar,
17

17

00:00:43,666  -->  00:00:45,515
given the lecture material.
18

18

00:00:45,515  -->  00:00:48,170
So for my function, I said while True,
19

19

00:00:48,170  -->  00:00:51,315
try to get an input that says input integer,
20

20

00:00:51,315  -->  00:00:53,640
and set it to variable N.
21

21

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:55,449
Except to some sort of error occurs,
22

22

00:00:55,449  -->  00:00:58,348
prints an error occurred, please try again.
23

23

00:00:58,348  -->  00:00:59,572
Then continue,
24

24

00:00:59,572  -->  00:01:00,572
else, break,
25

25

00:01:02,281  -->  00:01:03,926
and then I said print, Thank you,
26

26

00:01:03,926  -->  00:01:08,122
your number squared is N to the power of 2.
27

27

00:01:08,122  -->  00:01:09,150
And that was it.
28

28

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:10,305
Alright,
29

29

00:01:10,305  -->  00:01:11,417
hopefully that was pretty straightforward
30

30

00:01:11,417  -->  00:01:13,075
given the lecture material.
31

31

00:01:13,075  -->  00:01:14,467
Take your time and read through the code
32

32

00:01:14,467  -->  00:01:16,533
in case anything was confusing,
33

33

00:01:16,533  -->  00:01:17,519
and as always, feel free to
34

34

00:01:17,519  -->  00:01:19,911
post a discussion question if you
35

35

00:01:19,911  -->  00:01:21,458
are having any trouble.
36

36

00:01:21,458  -->  00:01:22,291
Thank you.
