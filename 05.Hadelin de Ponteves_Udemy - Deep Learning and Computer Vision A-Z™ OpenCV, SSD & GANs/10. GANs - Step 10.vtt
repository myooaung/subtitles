Hello and welcome to this new tutorial in the previous Statoil we tackled the first two steps steps

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.090
of the training of the discriminator.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.830
We trained it on real images and then on fake images.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.500
And so now it's almost over.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.850
We are ready for the third substate which is to get the total air as the sum of the to the R R D real

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.380
and b r d fake.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.260
So we'll get this some that will get as little error and then we'll back propagate the stall error back

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.050
into the new one that work at the discriminator to then update the weights through to get to Graylands

9
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.430
descent according to how much they're responsible for the error.

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.650
So very easy now.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.330
Let's start by getting the total error.

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160
We're going to call it the R R D.

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.140
It's the total error of the discriminator.

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:02.940
So e r d equals well R R D real which I am copying and pasting Plus R D fake again which I'm copying

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.670
and pasting.

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.760
And there we go we have all error.

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.840
So now let's back propagate it back into the new one that work of the discriminator and to do this.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.050
Thanks Supai torch.

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.850
It's really simple we just need to take the error the total error the R D and then dot and then we use

20
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.250
the back word function to back propagate it.

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.260
Perfect.

22
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.180
And now one final step of this first big step of the training we need to apply is to cast a grade in

23
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.660
the center of the weight and to do this guess what we're going to take right now.

24
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.480
We're going to take the optimizer of the discriminator.

25
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.170
And so I'm copying this I'm pasting it here and there we go almost over.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:57.030
We just need to add a dirt and apply the step function to step function applies the optimizer on the

27
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.110
neural network to discriminator to have they the weight of the discriminator according to how much they're

28
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.000
responsible for the total loss error which is the sum of the real error and the fake error.

29
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.410
And so now well done.

30
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.230
Good job.

31
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.370
You're ready to move on to the second step of the training and we'll take care of that in the next tutorial.

32
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.170
Until then enjoy computer vision.
