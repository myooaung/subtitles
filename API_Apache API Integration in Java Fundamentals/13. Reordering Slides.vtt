00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.540
Reorder Slides of the Existing Product Presentation.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
You'll be doing this on the already‑created product presentation.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.240
So first, open an InputStream to the PowerPoint presentation file.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.050
Next,

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.620
create a XMLSlideShow object, passing the

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.140
InputStream to represent the PowerPoint.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
Then, you can retrieve the slide to be reordered like this, passing in the

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.380
index number of the slide. The index is zero‑based. Then, reorder slides by

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.750
calling the setSlideOrder method on the ppt, passing in the slide to be

10
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.740
reordered, and the new index, once again,

11
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.840
zero‑based.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.000
Then open an OutputStream to the file. And finally, write the changes made to the slides to the OutputStream.
