00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.040
Let's get to work.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.040
As I told you before,

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.440
we are going to create the quotation as a Microsoft Word document,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.750
but taking one step at a time.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.110
First, we are going to create a blank Word document.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.440
That is an XWPFDocument.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.040
So what is it, and what does it do?

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.100
The XWPFDocument is the class in the Apache POI API that is capable

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.940
of creating an OOXML‑compliant MS Word document.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.630
It can be thought of as the high‑level class for working

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.220
with Word files with the .docx extension.

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.040
Let's take a quick look at the initial steps to create a .docx Word document.

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.340
First, create an empty MS Word document by instantiating the XWPFDocument class.

14
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.210
Next, open a file output stream,

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.340
specifying the path where the file needs to be saved in the file system

16
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.230
to write the content of the MS Word document into.

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.910
Finally, write the document to the output stream.

18
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:26.110
Open up the Maven Java project given in exercise files of this module.

19
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.200
You can see a class named WordQuotation,

20
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.940
and a few blank methods already added in it.

21
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.330
Go to the generateQuotation method.

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.040
Instantiate the XPFWDocument class.

23
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.540
Let's call the instance, document.

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.340
Open up a file output stream, specifying the location for the file to be saved.

25
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.940
Surround it with try with resources, and handle the exceptions.

26
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.670
Finally, write the document to the output stream.

27
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.010
Now, call the generateQuotation method in the main class like this.

28
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.240
Save and run the application.

29
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:26.440
You should see an MS Word document created like this with the .docx extension.

30
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:37.000
If you open it, it's still just a blank document. In the next clip, let's start adding content to it.
