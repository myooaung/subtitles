00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.940
We've come to an end of this module.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.140
So let's look back at what you've learned in this module.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.740
You learned how to work with a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.340
using the Apache POI API in a Java application.

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.360
You created a presentation and added slides to it, added content like images

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.640
and text to slides, formatted slide content by formatting text and image

7
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.150
content, as well as use different slide layouts as appropriate for the

8
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.410
presentation, added a few hyperlinks on slides, and finally, saw how to read

9
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.810
the existing presentation and do some modifications to it like reordering

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.290
and deleting slides.

11
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.100
Since we've come to an end of the course, Apache API Integration in Java,

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.040
let's do a quick recap. You learned about the main components of the Apache

13
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.210
PDFBox API like pdfbox, fontbox, xmpbox to create,

14
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
modify, and extract content from PDFs to work with

15
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.740
fonts and to work with XMP metadata, respectively.

16
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.470
You learned how to use the basic features of the library for creating,

17
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.610
modifying, and extracting content from PDF documents,

18
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.950
followed by some of the advanced features like using metadata,

19
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.590
different fonts, splitting, merging, and encrypting PDFs.

20
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.920
Then in the next half of the course,

21
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.130
you learned about the main components of the Apache POI library like

22
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.570
XSSF to work with all XML‑compliant MS Excel files, XWPF to work with

23
00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.080
all XML‑compliant MS Word documents, and XSLF to work with all

24
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.540
XML‑compliant MS PowerPoint files.

25
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.390
Next,

26
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.920
you used the API features to create MS Excel, Word, and

27
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.850
PowerPoint documents, and also did some modifications to those

28
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
documents using the available API features.

29
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.830
It should be noted that there are lots of different features available in

30
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.710
these APIs, and we looked at the most commonly used ones out of them in

31
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.760
this course. The APIs will keep evolving and more rich and new features

32
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140
will get added with its future releases.

33
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.240
So this is the journey that you've taken throughout this course,

34
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.360
and I really hope that this course helped you to get started with these two

35
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.640
Apache APIs for generating PDF and Microsoft documents.

36
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.590
I'm encouraging you to try out the other API features available as well

37
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.240
and make use of these APIs in your next Java project.

38
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.000
Thank you for taking this course. Good luck, and happy coding.
