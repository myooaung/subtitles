1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,140
Remove Slide from the Existing Product Presentation.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,440
To do this, simply follow these steps.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,680
Open a FileInputStream to the PowerPoint file, create a

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,190
XMLSlideShow, then call the removeSlide method, passing in

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,040
the index of the slide to be removed.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,640
Know that the index is zeroâ€‘based.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,400
This should remove the slide specified by the index. Then,

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:45,000
most importantly, the changes should be saved. For that, create a FileOutputStream and write the changes to the OutputStream.
