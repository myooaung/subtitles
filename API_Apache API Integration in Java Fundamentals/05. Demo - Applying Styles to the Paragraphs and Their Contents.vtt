00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.360
Now it's time to add some formatting to the paragraph

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.140
content that you added earlier.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.640
Let's align the title, format the title text to make it stand out, and

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.940
format the web and email address hyperlinks. For this,

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.440
you will be using these classes and methods.

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:30.300
XWPFParagraph class has a method setAlignment to align paragraphs as required.

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.640
The XWPFRun class,

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.210
has a method setText to add text to a region or a section; setBold and

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.890
setItalic methods to make the text bold and italic; the setColor and

10
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.110
setUnderline methods to color text and underline text, respectively; and

11
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.100
the setFontFamily method to set the font name.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.340
You'll see them in action in the demo.

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.120
First,

14
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.510
let's align the title to be centerâ€‘lined. In the generateQuotation method,

15
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.490
call the setAlignment method on the title paragraph like this. It accepts a

16
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.550
constant from the enum, ParagraphAlignment.

17
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.880
Let's also format the title text to be Bold, font to be Arial, and the

18
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.230
FontSize to be 20. Notice the methods that you saw earlier now in

19
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.670
action here. Now to format the hyperlinks,

20
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.110
go to the addCompanyDetails method and to the place where we

21
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.340
created the hyperlinks. To set the color of the link text to

22
00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.050
blue, call the setColor method on the Run object, passing in

23
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.240
the hex string of the color.

24
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.690
Then this line of code underlines the hyperlink text.

25
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
To it, pass in a constant value, for example,

26
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.540
SINGLE, available in the enum UnderLinePatterns.

27
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.230
You can follow the same steps to format the web hyperlink text as well. Now,

28
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.640
save the changes and run the application.

29
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:43.000
You should see the title text and the email and web links formatted and aligned like this.
