The next part of this demo is for merging multiple PDF

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
files into a single PDF document.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.540
To do that, add a method, mergePDFs, and inside,

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.440
first, you must load the two PDF files that you are going to merge.

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.210
So let's create 2 files, file1 for furniture.pdf and file2 for appliances.pdf.

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.530
To perform the merge, we use the PDFMergeUtility class.

7
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
So I'll create a new PDFMergeUtility object,

8
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.140
merger, and to it, set the destination file name,

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.220
or in other words,

10
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.440
the merged file name by calling the setDestinationFileName method.

11
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
Let's save the final document inside src,

12
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.010
main, resources, and name it merged.pdf.

13
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.640
Now, add the two source files to the merger utility object,

14
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.240
merger.addSource(file1) and merger.addSource(file2).

15
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.380
You will need to surround the code in a tryâ€‘catch block to handle

16
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.940
any checked exceptions thrown by these methods.

17
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.140
Finally,

18
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.480
call merger.mergeDocuments method, just pass null to

19
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.840
the memUsageSetting parameter.

20
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.380
For this example's sake, we are not worried about respecting memory

21
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.660
usage. But if you are supposed to, you will need to pass in a

22
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.540
memUsageSetting object to this method as an argument.

23
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.740
Now, if you call the mergePDFs method in the main class, as usual, and run it,

24
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.510
you should see a PDF with the name merged created under

25
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.710
resources, and it consists of both the contents of the

26
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:20.000
furniture.pdf and appliances.pdf files. Great! Now you know how to split and merge PDFs.
