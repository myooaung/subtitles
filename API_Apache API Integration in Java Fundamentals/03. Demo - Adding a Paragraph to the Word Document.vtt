00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.320
Now let's add some paragraphs of text to the quotation Microsoft Word document.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.600
First, you add a paragraph to display the title and set the text to it.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.830
Next, add another paragraph to it, add company details, add

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.850
the local image, and the quotation date, and customer

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.540
details in subsequent paragraphs.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.980
But before jumping into the demo,

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.660
let's look at the API classes and methods that you

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020
will be using during this demo.

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.560
The XWPFDocument class's createParagraph method will help you

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.690
create a new paragraph in the document.

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950
Then using the XWPFParagraph class,

12
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.140
you can create a new region of text by calling the createRun method.

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.350
Then,

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.310
in the XWPFRun class, there are a set of methods that you'll use

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.640
frequently to do things like adding text to the run,

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.540
adding pictures, line breaks, and tab spaces.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.920
Let's take a quick look at what's involved with adding

18
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.440
paragraphs and content to the document.

19
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.610
You'll already have a document created.

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.800
Then add a new paragraph to the document by calling the

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.950
createParagraph method on the document.

22
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.550
Next, to start adding content to the paragraph,

23
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.000
you need to add something called as a new region to the

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.110
paragraph. For that, call createRun method on the paragraph.

25
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.540
It will create a new XWPFRun object.

26
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.800
The run marks a new region or section in the paragraph where you can add text

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.740
and other content like pictures to. And most importantly,

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.840
add styling to them.

29
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.500
You can create separate runs in a paragraph and style them in

30
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.490
different ways like applying different colors, font types,

31
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.900
sizes, setting to bold and italic, and etc.

32
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.550
Now you can set text to the region you created. Add a picture

33
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.220
by calling the addPicture method on the run.

34
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.070
If you need to add tabs,

35
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.050
call the addTab method to place a tab at the current location in the

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.870
run. To add line breaks, call the addBreak method to place an explicit

37
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.790
line break at the current location in the run.

38
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.990
This method call will cause overriding of the normal line

39
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.820
breaking that would happen at the end of a line and let you

40
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.540
break at the desired point.

41
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.270
Now to start adding content in your Word document, back in the code,

42
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.600
go to your generateQuotation method and add this line of code

43
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.730
to create a new paragraph in the document.

44
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.590
This is the title paragraph,

45
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.840
and it's going to be the very first paragraph in the quotation document.

46
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.240
Then, in the next line, create a run on the title paragraph.

47
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.040
It will return XWPFRun object.

48
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.870
A run is like a new region or section in the paragraph where you can

49
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.920
add text and other content like pictures to. Next,

50
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.940
set this text, "Product Quote" to the run.

51
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.740
Now, at this point, you can save and run the application.

52
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:55.000
When you open the created Word document, you can see that the text Product Quote is added to the document.
