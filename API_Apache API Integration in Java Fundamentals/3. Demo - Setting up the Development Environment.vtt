00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.240
Now, let's go ahead and do the configuration.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.420
This demo will show you how to configure the

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.840
development environment in both ways, by setting up JARs as external libraries,

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.160
as well as using the Maven pom.xml.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.420
If you are configuring using the first method,

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.840
which is downloading and setting up the JARs as external libraries,

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.930
go to Apache POI website, poi.apache.org,

8
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.220
and then to the Download page.

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.640
You will be able to see the latest available release like this.

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.000
If you click on it,

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.400
it will take you to the place where you can download the package.

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.740
Let's go ahead and download the binaries.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.960
Click on the ZIP file over here.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.540
Then, click on this link to download it from the suggested mirror site.

15
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.550
The download should start soon.

16
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.060
Once it's downloaded, unzip it,

17
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.440
and you should see a bunch of JAR files like this.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.120
Now, open up your Java project in the ID.

19
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.160
Rightâ€‘click on the project.

20
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.740
Open Module Settings, click on Libraries,

21
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.440
click on the plus mark over here, select Java.

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.890
Now, browse to the JAR files that you downloaded.

23
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.520
Add them one by one.

24
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.570
And finally, click Apply and OK.

25
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.340
Now, when you expand External Libraries,

26
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.240
you can see that the JARs are added to the project.

27
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.540
Now, let's see how to set up using the pom.xml.

28
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.260
This is the Maven project that we've been working with before.

29
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.450
You can get it from the exercise files of this module.

30
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.640
Open the pom.xml, and add this dependency.

31
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.090
Specify the version here.

32
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.250
I'm giving 4.1.2,

33
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.640
which is the latest version at the time of recording this course.

34
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.840
You should specify whatever the latest available version number here.

35
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.640
Now, when you load Maven changes,

36
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.140
it's going to automatically download the dependencies for you.

37
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.840
And when you expand the Libraries folder, you can see the JARs added like this.

38
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.000
Now you're all set to start working with Microsoft Office documents in the next module.
