00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.340
Now it's time to add text content on the product slides.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.110
To do this, first,

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.840
create a text box on the slide by calling the createTextBox method.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.940
Then add a new paragraph inside the text box,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.240
followed by your run of text within the paragraph.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.490
This is quite similar to what you did to add text

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.140
inside a Microsoft Word document.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.440
Now it's possible to set text to the text run by calling the setText method.

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.540
Finally,

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.410
position the textbox on the slide in the desired location by calling the

11
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.140
setAncho method, passing in x, y, width, and height.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.530
This is how the slide will look like once you add the text content to it.

13
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.040
You will display the product name and the feature list.

14
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.650
The name and features will be positioned to the

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.000
right‑hand side of the product image, and the price at the bottom‑left of the product image.
