In the final demo of this module, you will display the product price in a box.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,640
To do this,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,400
you will draw a rectangular box and write the product price

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,540
within that box. To add a rectangle to the PDF,

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:26,040
you can call the addRect method on the content stream.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,580
You have to pass in the X and Y coordinates as usual,

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,300
and the width and the height of the rectangular box.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,340
Let's give a value of 300 for the X coordinate,

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,970
and since it should be placed a little bit higher than the

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,260
starting point Y coordinate of the image,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:58,240
which is imageY, let's add 125 units to eat and set 50 and 25 as its dimensions.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,740
Now the box should be filled with black color.

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,770
Whenever you want to specify a fill color,

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,840
you should set the non‑stroking color.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,590
So let's say content.setNon StrokingColor to Color.BLACK, and

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,740
then color it by calling the fill method.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,440
This should draw a black box below the product features.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,140
We need to display the price of the product within this box.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,440
For that, we should start adding text to the stream.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,920
So, add another beginText and endText call, and in between,

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,140
set the font. You can set the font and the size to a different one if you wish.

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm just setting it to be the same. But I want to set the text color to white.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,040
So the way to do that is to set the non‑stroking color to white.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Then to position the text, call the newLineAtOffset method.

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,090
I'm setting X to be 300 + 10 more units, and Y to be

26
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,510
imageY + 133 units to be precise.

27
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,370
You will need to play around a bit with these

28
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,390
coordinates to get the exact positioning,

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,770
Then the text to display inside the box is the product price rounded and

30
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:42,040
prepended with the dollar symbol. Done. Now save and run.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,940
Here's the PDF that we wanted to create.

32
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,050
Congratulations! You just created the product catalog PDF document using

33
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,480
PDFBox. Just a thing for you to try, if you would like the rectangular box

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,140
to have no fill color, but just an outline color,

35
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,050
instead of setting non‑stroking color,

36
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:19,000
set the stroking color. Set to red, and then call the stroke method instead of fill method and see what happens.
