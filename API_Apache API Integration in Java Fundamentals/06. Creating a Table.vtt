00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.040
Now it's time to add the product details to the quotation document.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.540
In this process, you will be using most of these API classes and their methods.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.840
The XWPFTable class has some significant methods like createRow, addRow,

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.170
addNewCol, then getRow,

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.560
setTableAlignment, and setWidth. The XWPFTableRow class has

6
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.140
these significant methods like addNewTableCell,

7
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.090
createCell, and getCell. How these methods work is

8
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.040
somewhat confusing to the users.

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.270
So let me show you how they behave when using code. When you

10
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.500
call the createTable method on a Word document,

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.710
it creates an empty table with one row and one column

12
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.140
added by default that looks like this.

13
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.880
You can access this default row by calling the getRow method, passing in 0

14
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.540
as the index and access the default cell in that row,

15
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.170
calling the getCell method, passing in 0 as the index. Call

16
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.540
addNewTableCell or createCell methods on an existing table row

17
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.640
to add a new table cell to that row.

18
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.920
Call createRow method on a table that has columns already added on

19
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.460
it, and it will create a new row with as many cells as the number

20
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.840
of columns defined in that moment.

21
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.590
The addRow method adds a new row on an existing table when a

22
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.540
row is passed in as a XWPFTableRow object.

23
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.040
Then the addNewCol method,

24
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.190
when called on an existing table, adds a new column

25
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.440
for each row in the table like this.

26
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.710
In addition,

27
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.940
the XWPFTableCell class has some important methods like setText,

28
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.160
setWidth, and a collection of methods to work with paragraphs inside of a

29
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.850
table cell like these. We will see the usages of some of these. To have a

30
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.740
quick look at the basic steps involved,

31
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.540
call the createTable method of the document to create a table in the document.

32
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.090
The createTable method creates an empty table with one row and

33
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.580
one column already added to it by default. You can align the

34
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.750
table on the document like this.

35
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.140
The table width can be set like this. To access the very first row,

36
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.630
which was created by default at the time of creating the empty

37
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.780
table, call the getRow method on the table, passing 0 as the index.

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.340
To access the very first cell in the row,

39
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.940
which was created by default,

40
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.660
call the getCell method on the row, passing in the index 0. To set

41
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.640
text directly in the cell, call the setText method on the cell, and

42
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.910
you can set the cell width like this.

43
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.240
You can add a paragraph inside a cell like this and add a

44
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.730
text run and place text in it so that you will be able to do

45
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.540
some formatting to the cell text.

46
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.550
If you want to add more cells in the first row,

47
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:55.000
you can call the addNewTableCell method on the row. And to add more rows in the table, you can call createRow method on the table.
