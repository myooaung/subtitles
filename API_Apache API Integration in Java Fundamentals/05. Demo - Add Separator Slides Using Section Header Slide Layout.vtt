00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.240
Now to add separator slides separating each product category and

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.710
type. You'll see how to use another slide layout,

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.340
which is the section header.

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.020
You'll see how to set heading text to these section headers slides as well.

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.640
To do this, back in the code, inside this method addSectionHeaderSlide,

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.740
get the slide masters of the PowerPoint presentation and the default slide

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.480
master. And call the getLayout method on it, passing in

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.440
SlideLayout.SECTION_HEADER enum constant this time.

9
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.440
Then on the PowerPoint, create a new slide, passing in the section header layout.

10
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.400
Now with this layout applied,

11
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.360
the slide will have two headings. Access the first one by

12
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.340
calling the getPlaceholder method, passing in 0.

13
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:14.240
To this, set the titleTxt that's passed into the addSectionHeaderSlide method.

14
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.140
Access the second one by passing 1 to getPlaceholder method.

15
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.560
Set its text with the subTitleTxt that's passed into

16
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.240
the addSectionHeaderSlide method.

17
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.000
Now, you've done what's required to create section

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
header slides in the presentation. You can see these applied after a few more clips.
