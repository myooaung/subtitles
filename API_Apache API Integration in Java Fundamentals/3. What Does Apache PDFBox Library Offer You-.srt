What are the capabilities of Apache PDFBox?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,540
Let's take a look at its features.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,640
It has some basic features, as well as more advanced features,

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,070
meaning we can use it to create, modify,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,490
and extract content from a PDF document,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,320
and to do more things like splitting a PDF into pages

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,430
and merging many PDFs together,

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,480
encrypting or password protecting confidential documents,

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,150
and even validating a PDF document to see if it is ISO 19005

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:47,570
compliant. Using PDFBox, you can also convert text into PDF and PDF to

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,940
images, and also create forms in a PDF document.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,940
PDFBox also comes with these capabilities.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,310
It has Unicode support,

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,050
which means we can use the Unicode forms in PDF documents. It is possible

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,080
to create interactive forms in PDF documents using the concept of AcroForms

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,040
that allow UI components in a PDF document.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
It also comes with a set of common line tools to perform things

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,940
like encryption and decryption; overlaying,

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,880
which means covering the content of one PDF document with

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:43,000
another PDF document; merging PDFs; debugging; and a converting text to PDF and PDF to an image.
