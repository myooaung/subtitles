1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,370
Now let's go ahead and add more content.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,640
In the addCompanyDetails method here,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,140
create another paragraph followed by your Run point.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,310
Now we need to display the company name at this location in the paragraph.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,240
For that, we need to add tab spaces.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,330
Let's call the addTab method on this run 10 times,

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,190
for example, and then set the text, The Furniture Store,

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,340
to the Run.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,540
We also should display the logo image at this location,

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,840
so, once again, add some tab spaces.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:56,340
Then, as usual, create an InputStream to the logo image file,

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,340
and you can call the addPicture method on the Run object,

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,590
passing in the InputStream, the PICTURE_TYPE as JPEG,

14
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:16,640
the filename as a string, then the image with an image height.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:26,240
Now, talking about width and height, 140 and 64 are in pixels,

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,250
the measurement unit used to specify sizes in Open XML is EMU,

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,700
which stands for English Metric Units.

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,940
In the org.apache.poi.util package, there is a utility class Units,

19
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,780
and by calling its pixelToEMU method, you can convert the pixel amounts to EMU,

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,030
so that's what we are doing here to specify the width and height.

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,620
You can give them in other units as well,

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,640
as long as they are passed in as int values to the method.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,020
Next, in this demo, we add some more details to the Quotation.

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,090
You will basically be following the same process that

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,940
you saw before to add those details.

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,940
First, the Contact No.

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,280
Leave some tab spaces to display the date on the

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,700
rightâ€‘hand side corner of the same paragraph.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,200
Then display the Date.

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,240
You'll need to format the Date.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,140
You can simply use the SimpleDateFormat to do that,

32
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,330
and apply it to the Date value.

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,370
Then break the line at that point.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,570
In the next line of the same paragraph, display the email address.

35
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,250
For that, you can create a HyperLinkRun on the paragraph.

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,870
To that, you can pass in the uri like this.

37
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,570
Then, set the text to be displayed.

38
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,840
Add another break,

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,230
and follow the same steps to add web address in the same paragraph.

40
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,250
And finally, add another line break.

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,840
Then to add customer details to the Quotation document,

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
you can simply add this code.

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,140
There's nothing new here, just the same steps to be followed.

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,440
This code can be found in the exercise files.

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,650
Remember to call the addCompanyDetails and addCustomerDetails methods

46
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,840
inside generateQuotation method before you run.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:08,740
Then when you run the application, you should see the content that we added.

48
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:18,000
But the content isn't formatted as yet. Let's add some formatting in the next clip.
