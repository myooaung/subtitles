00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.320
Now let's play around with fonts in the Quotation Excel. You

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.140
will see how to change the title font,

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.310
then change the font color and style of the column headings of

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.410
the product details section, and the Sub Total,

5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.340
Total, and Tax labels.

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.840
You will be using the XSSFFont class to do all of this,

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.640
so you will need to create a new XSSFFont object.

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.150
Then if you want to set a different font type, call the

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.440
setFontName method, passing in the name of the font, for

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.470
example, Arial. If you want to make it bold,

11
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
call the setBold method, passing true to it.

12
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.330
If you want to make it italic, simply call the setItalic method,

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.780
passing in true once again. To set the font size to a different value,

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.430
you can call the setFontHeightInPoints method, passing in the size. To

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.700
set the font color, you can call the setColor method, passing in a

16
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:29.010
color. And finally, create a new XSSFCellStyle object if required, or

17
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.550
use an existing style object and set the font to it by calling the

18
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.440
setFont method.

19
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.140
Let's change the font of the title to Arial, Bold, and size 24.

20
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.540
So in here,

21
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.870
create an XSSFFont object, call the relevant methods

22
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.840
to set the values as required,

23
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.640
like this, setFontName, setBold, and setFontHeightInPoints.

24
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.130
Then create a new XSSFCellStyle object and set its font

25
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.740
to the new font that you created.

26
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.500
Also remember to set the CellStyle to the titleCell. Then in

27
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:30.330
the addQuoteDetails method, create a new font object, and make

28
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.840
it bold, and set its color to blue.

29
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.140
To do that, first create an XSSFColor object. You need to pass the

30
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.140
required color like this, and an IndexedColorMap.

31
00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.240
You can get the IndexedColorMap using this line of code.

32
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.530
Then pass the colorMap into the XSSFColor object. then set

33
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.940
the color to the font object.

34
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.140
Now you have a font that is bold and blue in color.

35
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
Next,

36
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.540
create a new CellStyle named headerRowCellStyle, set the font that you

37
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.440
created to this style, also align it to be center aligned.

38
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.740
We are going to apply this style to the product details column headings.

39
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:51.840
Let's create another font which is bold and italic.

40
00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.940
This code will create a bold and italic font. Create a new style,

41
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.310
and set its font to the bold and italic font. You will use it for

42
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.540
the Sub Total, Tax, and Total labels.

43
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:27.080
Now apply the bold and blue font to Qty, Description, Unit Price, and

44
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:37.340
Line Total column headings, and the bold and italic font to Sub Total,

45
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:47.240
Tax, and Total label cells. Once you apply them,

46
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:58.000
Save and Run, and you can see the font changes applied in the Quotation like this.
