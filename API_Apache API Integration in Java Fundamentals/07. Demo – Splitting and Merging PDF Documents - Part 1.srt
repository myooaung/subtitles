1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,840
Next up is splitting and merging PDF documents.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Suppose you want to split the product catalog PDF into separate documents,

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,910
for example,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,170
as furniture and appliances. It can be done simply by using the Splitter

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:27,740
class available in org.apache.pdfbox.multipdf package.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,290
Then,

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,440
in case you get a requirement to merge multiple product

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,640
catalog files into one single PDF document,

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,440
how can we do that?

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,540
Well, it can be achieved using the PDFMergerUtility class.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,940
Let's see how to do that.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,620
But before jumping into code, splitting means breaking down a single PDF

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,160
document into multiple PDF files, and on the other hand,

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,800
merging means combining separate PDF files into one single PDF document.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,440
Now, let's jump in and code. To get you quickly started,

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,710
I've added some code here to add some more product pages

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,040
to the product_catalog.pdf.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,350
You can simply copy this addPage method from the exercise file and add it

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,160
to your ProductCatalog class. And to the main class, copy this method,

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,540
loadMoreProducts, and inside the main method,

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,250
remember to add these three lines of code right after the last

22
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,710
line of code here, just like this. Then back in the

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,040
ProductCatalog class, here's the method splitPDF, where you're

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
going to add the splitting logic.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,250
The document is already loaded. By now, you already know how to write that code.

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,540
Provided that you added the code that I mentioned just now,

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,440
you should end up with a product catalog that looks like this.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,640
It has the Furniture page, a blank page, and two Appliance pages.

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,880
Now, suppose you want to split this so that you have one PDF file

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,240
for furniture and another PDF file for appliances.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,040
To do that, you will need to split at page number 2. So back in the code,

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,610
create a Splitter object, and then on it call the

33
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,540
setSplitAtPage method and pass in the value 2.

34
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,200
This will split the catalog PDF at page 2. Now call

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,440
splitter.split method, passing in the document catalog.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,740
This is going to return a list of PDDocuments.

37
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,130
If you just print the size of this list,

38
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,720
you will see that it is 2. You can now iterate through this list and

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,340
do whatever you want with the Splitter documents.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Let's just save them as separate PDF files, furniture.pdf and appliances.pdf.

41
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,340
For that, simply write this code. This code iterates through the list.

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,840
Get each PDDocument and save the first document as

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,340
furniture and the second one as appliances.

44
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,340
That's it. And now, call the splitPDF method in the main class.

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,590
Save and Run. You can see two separate PDF documents

46
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,540
created under the resources folder.

47
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,540
If you open furniture.pdf, you can see the Furniture page is in it.

48
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:22,000
And if you open the appliances.pdf, you can see the Appliances pages. So that's how you can split a single PDF into multiple PDF files.
