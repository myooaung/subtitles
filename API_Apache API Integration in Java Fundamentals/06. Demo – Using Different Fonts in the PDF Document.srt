00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,140
Next, we are going to look at how to work with different fonts in PDFBox.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,540
Let's use different fonts in the Product Catalog PDF.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,740
You will want the page heading to stand out,

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,120
so let's change its font by making it bold. Then the product name,

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,570
let's make it bold and italic and use a different font type for the

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:35,780
product price. As you saw in the module Creating a New PDF Document

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,850
and Adding Content to It, in PDFBox, there are 14 standard fonts that

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,740
you can use like Times, Helvetica, and Courier,

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,040
along with their bold and italic forms.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,550
Let's go back to the method, generateCatalog, that you've already

11
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,920
written, and right here, where you are setting the heading font, let's

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,060
change the font to HELVETICA_BOLD. Next, in this line of code where

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,840
you set the font for product name,

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,090
set the font to be HELVETICA_BOLD_OBLIQUE to make it

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,740
bold and italic at the same time.

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,840
Finally, change the font of the price to COURIER.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, when you save and run, you can see the fonts changed, like this. That looks pretty simple, right?
