00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.840
What is Apache POI library?

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.540
Well, maybe you know that it's a library to handle Microsoft documents.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.650
Microsoft Office documents, namely Excel spreadsheets,

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.040
Word documents,

5
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.490
and PowerPoint slides play a major role in our daily lives; therefore,

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.780
it's important to be able to handle them within our

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.940
software applications as well.

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.800
There are two main file formats used by Microsoft Office files.

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.440
OLE, which stands for object linking and embedding,

10
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.230
is a file format that uses compound files to hold content

11
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.940
where data is structured hierarchically,

12
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.770
organized into a single file.

13
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.000
It uses file extensions like XLS, DOC, and PPT,

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.860
respectively, for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

15
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.970
OOXML, which stands for Office Open XML file format,

16
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.540
uses a set of XML files to hold content,

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.030
and it uses file extensions like XLSX, DOCX,

18
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.490
and PPTX, respectively, for Excel, Word,

19
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.140
and PowerPoint.

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.780
Office documents have been supporting this file format

21
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.340
since Microsoft Office version 2007.

22
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.280
So how is it possible to create, modify,

23
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.540
and read these Microsoft Office documents from a Java application?

24
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.540
The Apache POI API from the Apache Software Foundation is a pure Java library,

25
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.120
which means that it is written in Java and can be used

26
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.860
with any JVM‑based language like Java, Scala,

27
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.940
Groovy, Kotlin, and etc.

28
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.040
It is open source and is available under the Apache license 2.0,

29
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.130
which is a free software license by the Apache

30
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.660
Software Foundation where users can use,

31
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.640
distribute, and modify the software without having to pay any royalties.

32
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.040
It also is a cross‑platform API,

33
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.070
meaning it can run on any operating system and manipulate various file

34
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.140
formats of Microsoft Office and also open Office documents.

35
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:55.000
The API is capable of handling Microsoft documents including creating, modifying, and displaying their content.
