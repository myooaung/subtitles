00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.380
Now let's reorder two of the product slides in the presentation,

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.210
first, by loading the presentation, and then changing the slide

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.240
order, and finally, save the changes.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.640
Go to the reorderSlides method in the ProductPresentation class.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.220
Follow the steps that you just saw. First, create the

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.940
FileInputStream to the already‑created PowerPoint .pptx file.

7
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.240
Create an XMLSlideShow, passing in the InputStream.

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.340
Let's say we want to swap the fourth slide with the third slide,

9
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.040
so get the fourth slide,

10
00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.120
then call the setSlideOrder method on the ppt, passing in slideFour

11
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.440
and the newIndex as 2, which is the third position.

12
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.040
Remember, indexes are zero‑based.

13
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.810
Now open a FileOutputStream to the file and write the ppt with the

14
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.240
changes to the OutputStream to save the changes.

15
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.440
Now, before checking this, let's see how the PPT looks like now.

16
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.940
As you can see, this is the fourth slide.

17
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.640
When we reorder, these two slides should swap their positions.

18
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.280
So let's check this out. Call the reorderSlides method in the main

19
00:01:49.280 --> 00:02:06.000
class like this. Save and run the application. Now you can see that the two slides are reordered, as expected.
