00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,040
Before we wind up, let's do a quick recap.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,650
You saw the dependencies required for Apache POI to work

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,700
with the OLE file format, in other words,

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:21,990
to work with XLS, DOC, and PPT file extensions, and also, the dependencies

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,780
required to work with the OOXML file format, that is, to work with MS Office

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:36,740
documents with file extensions XLSX, DOCX, and PPTX.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,780
Then you learned how to configure your Java

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,470
development environment in two ways, first,

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,320
by downloading and setting up the JAR files as external

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,240
libraries and then using the pom.xml in a Maven Java project.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:04,000
And now you completed the first step of the path to learning Apache POI API integration with Java.
