00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,170
In the final demo of this module,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,730
you are going to see how to extract content from the quotation

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,600
Word document by extracting text content,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,940
table data, and the image. The main API class used here is the

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,410
XWPFWordExtractor. That is specifically to extract text content using its

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,030
getText method. Back in the code inside the extractText method here,

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,740
the first step is to create a FileInputStream,

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,680
specifying the path to the document. Then create a new

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,740
XWPFDocument instance, passing in the InputStream.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,840
Next,

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,040
create an instance of the XWPFWordExtractor class,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,740
passing in the document object.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,110
Now you can call its getText method to retrieve the

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,640
entire document text content as a string.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:23,240
If you call this method in the main class, and run the application,

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,100
you should see the text content of the document

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,380
printed in the console like this.

18
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,360
Now if you want to extract data from the table in the

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,980
document, inside the extractTable method here,

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,440
simply follow the same initial steps as before.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,650
Then, on the document, call the getTables method to retrieve all the tables

22
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,600
in the document. It will return at list of XWPFTables.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,540
Since we just have one table in our document, you can simply get it like this.

24
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,800
Now, you can loop through the rows in the table like this, and the

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,730
cells in a row like this, and get cell text.

26
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,680
And if required,

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:35,340
display like this. If you call this method in the main class, and run,

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,140
you can see just the table data extracted like this.

29
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,340
Finally, if you want to extract an image from the Word document,

30
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,640
go to the extractImage method in our class.

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Follow the two initial steps. Then from the document, getAllPictures.

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,440
It will retrieve a list of XWPFPictureData objects.

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Since we have just a lower image our case, you can get it like this.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,440
Now get the picture data into a byte array,

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
then open a FileOutputStream, specifying the path for the image

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,180
file to be created, along with a name for it. And simply write

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,440
the byte data to the OutputStream.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,550
That's it.

39
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:40,040
And now, when you call this method in the main class, and run,

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,750
you can see an image file created by the name that was

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:55,000
given under resources, images like this. This is the extracted image from the quotation Word document.
