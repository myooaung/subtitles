00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.900
Now, let's see how to do what is called as outlining, to

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.840
group sections in the quotation document.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.540
We will do this to group company details and product details,

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.940
using the XSSFSheet classes groupRow method.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.640
Once done, it will look like this.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.670
That is,

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
the company details section will be one group, and the

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.040
product details section will be another group.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.730
They can be hidden and expanded as required. To do outlining, go to

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:52.850
the generateQuotation method, type in sheet.groupRow, and to this

11
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.840
method, pass in the starting row index, which is 0,

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.770
and the ending row index,

13
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.590
which is 4, to group the company details section. Add sheet.groupRow, and

14
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.640
pass in 9 and 14, to group the product details section.

15
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.840
If you run, and open the Excel document,

16
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:40.000
you can see these black lines on the edge. You can expand and close them like this.
