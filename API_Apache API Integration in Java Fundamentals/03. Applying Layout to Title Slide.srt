1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,420
Let's see what it takes to apply a layout to the

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,540
title slide of the presentation.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,240
So what API classes and methods should we use to do this?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,370
The XMLSlideShow class, that represents a PowerPoint presentation.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,440
It has a method getSlideMasters.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,840
This method gives us a list of slide masters.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,880
A slide master is the mechanism used in Microsoft

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,940
PowerPoint to create slide templates.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,940
These slide masters hold a bunch of slide layouts.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,180
So by getting the first element of this list,

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,040
you can retrieve the default slide master.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,200
So in the XSLFSlideMaster class there's the method getLayout that

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,610
can be used to retrieve a specific slide layout from the

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,540
available layouts for that slide master.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,510
Then the XMLSlideShow class has the method createSlide

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,040
that can accept a slide layout object.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,940
It will result in a slide created with the specified slide layout.

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,900
The resulting XSLFSlide has the method getPlaceholder,

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,640
using which you can get access to the available text shapes in the layout.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,940
Note that a slide can have placeholders to hold content other than text as well.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,840
These text shapes are represented by the XSLFTextShape class,

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:52,000
and it has a method setText. Using this method, you can set text inside those text shapes.
