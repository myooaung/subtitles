1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,840
Since the slides look boring,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,970
let's format the text content on the product slides by setting the font

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,940
type, font color, font size, and make some of the text bold.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,540
Doing that is pretty simple.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,080
Let's see how to do that. Back in the code, go to the place where

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,510
you added the product name in the addProductSlide method. That's

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:37,430
right here. Call the setFontColor method on the nameRun. You can

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,740
pass a java.awt.Color to it.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,760
Let's pass in BLUE, then set the font size.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,440
You need to pass it as a double literal.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Next, let's format the bulleted list to have red font.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,340
So here, set the font color to RED.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,640
One more thing to note here.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
If you want to change the bullet character to some

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
other character of your choice,

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
you can do that by calling the setBulletCharacter method,

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
passing in the required character as a string. Try giving

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,340
an asterisk, for example, and see how it looks like.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Then go to the price text.

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,090
Let's show the price in a different font. For that, call the

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:39,020
setFontFamily method on the run. Pass in the font family name as a

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,210
string, let's say Courier New. You can pass in any valid font name here

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,430
as a string, then the font color to MAGENTA.

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:58,530
Make it bold by calling setBold method and passing in true. And the

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,600
font size, set to 34 to make it a bit bigger. We need to do one more

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,040
thing to make our presentation look better.

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Remember,

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,060
you created a header slide earlier to be used as a separator. Separator

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,490
slides should be added before each new product category and type. For that,

30
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,050
let's set this code in the addContentSlides method right here inside the for

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:37,510
loop. What it does is it's checking for the product category and type, as we

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,230
have products belonging to two categories, FURNITURE and DECO. And under the

33
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,340
DECO category, there are product types, Lamp Shades and Wall Clocks.

34
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,710
So in the loop,

35
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,440
when it encounters a product that belongs to a new category and type,

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,420
call the addSectionHeaderSlide method like this to add a section

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,210
header slide. These flags are used simply to avoid the header slide

38
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,820
from being added after each slide,

39
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,840
but to add them to a group of slides as required instead.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,340
Now save and run the application.

41
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,260
You can see the product slides have the text formatted now with colors,

42
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,640
font sizes, and different font types.

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,270
Also,

44
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,840
you can see that the section header slides have been added before the slides,

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,640
displaying each category and type of products.

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,120
You can see the products sorted by category and type because of the code that

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:54,000
was added back in addContentSlides method when adding section header slides for products based on their category and type.
