00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,980
Coming to an end of another interesting module,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,340
let me summarize what you learned in this module.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,280
You learned why and how to use metadata properties in a PDF document by

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,040
setting metadata to the Product Catalog document.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,240
You also saw how to create variations in fonts by setting different

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,040
fonts in the catalog PDF document, next, about splitting and merging

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,170
PDF documents by splitting the Product Catalog PDF into two separate

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,990
PDF files and merging them back together to form one single PDF

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,970
document, and last, but not least,

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,770
about protecting a PDF by specifying access permissions

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,420
and adding passwords to the Product Catalog document using

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,940
standard protection policy.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,260
So those are some of the important advanced options that can

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,830
be used with the PDFBox API that could be of help to you

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,740
when working with PDF documents.

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,040
Where are we now in the learning journey?

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,640
As I said at the beginning of this module,

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,500
you have now reached a milestone where you've completed the

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,440
Apache PDFBox API part of the course.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,780
It would be beneficial to recap at this milestone. You started off by

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:36,490
learning the essential API features of the PDFBox API, configured the

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,940
development environment by setting up the required JAR files, and then

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:49,900
created your very first PDF document and added content to it. Thereafter,

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,530
you loaded the already created PDF,

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,300
modified and extracted content from it, and finally, used some of the

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,180
advanced features like metadata, splitting and merging a PDF, and

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,210
protecting a PDF document. That marks the end of this module. And stay

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,070
tuned for the next half of the course where you will be learning about

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:28,000
Apache POI API integration, starting with the module, Outlining the Essentials of Apache POI Library.
