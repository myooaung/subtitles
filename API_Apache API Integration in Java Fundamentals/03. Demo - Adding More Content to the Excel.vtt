00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's first add some more content to the quotation like the date,

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.740
customer details, and, of course, product details.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.440
Go back to the code in your Quotation class. There's the

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.010
addQuoteDetails method. Here, you're basically adding the customer

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.840
details, the date, followed by the product details.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.760
You'll simply need to follow what was done in the previous clip to

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.740
add more rows and cells into your worksheet.

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.540
So to save us quite a lot of time here,

9
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm going to paste these lines of code to this.

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.040
I highly recommend that you add them one by one in your code.

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.890
You can also get these lines of code from the exercise

12
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.360
files and paste them as per the instructions given inside

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.640
the text file related to the clip.

14
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.560
Once you add the content,

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.280
you can call the addQuoteDetails method inside

16
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.940
generateQuotation method. And then, as usual,

17
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.740
run the application and see the result.

18
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.920
You'll see the content added,

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.960
but without any formatting or styling in place. Back in the code, I need to

20
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.050
bring a few things to your attention. You can see here that a list of code

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.650
data is passed into this method from the generateQuotation method. And that

22
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.730
data is looped through here, and the lines are added as product details in

23
00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.970
the quotation document. The quantity, product name as the description, and

24
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:15.140
the price, then the subTotal, tax, and total is also set below it.

25
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.000
So now it's time to do some formatting and styling, and let's see how to do that in the next clip.
