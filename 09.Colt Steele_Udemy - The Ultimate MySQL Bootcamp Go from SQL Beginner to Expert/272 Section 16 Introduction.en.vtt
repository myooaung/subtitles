00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.170
It there.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.430
So this section is all about.

3
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.850
No.

4
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.400
No.

5
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.750
Yes.

6
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.530
And the core of it is how do we take a programming language any language ph.

7
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270
Ruby Noad Python.

8
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.890
Any of the other ones out there.

9
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.810
And how do we combine that with my as well so that we can do things like build web applications.

10
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.210
And in this section we're not getting to the Web just yet.

11
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.180
So for a lot of you I know that building a web app has sort of been like the whatever you call this

12
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.940
thing the catnip I guess or the the toy that has been dragging you through this course getting you through

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.100
the more dull parts knowing that you'll see how to make an app at the end.

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.380
But remember this is not a web application course this is a course on my ass.

15
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.400
Q So it's just a small part but if that's what it takes it's the light at the end of the tunnel.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.410
Well we're basically through the tunnel now.

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.190
And like I said in this section we're not building the web app just yet but we are seeing how to connect

18
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.930
my Eskew to another language.

19
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.790
In our case it's no yes.

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.340
And so what we're going to do here kind of it's a tricky situation for me because I don't have the luxury

21
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.120
of teaching everybody Noad and teaching all the basics that you need.

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.000
So we're kind of going to do a crash course the beginning then we're going to work with a file of javascript

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
and connected to a minuscule database so that we could do things like randomly generate 500 users and

24
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.210
insert all of them with one go so we can insert you know 500 users manually.

25
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
But how could we make 500 random users every time I run a file.

26
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.710
That's what we're doing.

27
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.870
And then in the next section we'll build a web app to connect to our database.

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.240
All right we're almost there.
