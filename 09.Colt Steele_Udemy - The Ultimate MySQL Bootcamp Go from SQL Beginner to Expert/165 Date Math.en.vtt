00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.690
It right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.900
So in this video we're going to talk about date math.

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.760
How do we add dates subtract them figure out how many days are between two dates for example or how

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.320
many minutes or take a current date and add you know 10 minutes into the future or something like that.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.940
It's a pretty common thing to do especially when you're dealing with comments or blog posts or some

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.310
sort of information where it makes sense to display how long ago something was created on Facebook.

8
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.440
I think I've been over this before but Facebook will tell you this.

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
You know you commented on this 10 minutes ago and then you come back the next day or say one day ago

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.170
and then a week later I'll say a week ago.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.880
And then at some point it transitions over just to the date you will say December 5th or something.

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.970
So you can accomplish that by using some of the tools I'm going to show you in this video.

13
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.890
Now we're not going to spend a ton of time on date math because it's not the most exciting thing.

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.620
Also date math sort of sounds like you know like at the end of a date.

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.890
Fighting for the check.

16
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.920
Figuring out who pays for what anyways.

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.370
You know it sounds like a bad name or something.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.390
Date math though in our context there's two main functions we're going to talk about.

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.610
And the first one is pretty simple.

20
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.980
It's called Dith no underscores just date diff stands for date difference.

21
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.740
And what it will do is it takes two dates.

22
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.580
So here's an example want a date time which I should highlight.

23
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.220
Pretty much everything in my as well that has a date in the name will also except date time.

24
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.110
So OK here's a date the date time excuse me and then here's a date and when you subtract them.

25
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.370
Turns out they're one day apart.

26
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.770
So this always tells you the number of days.

27
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.170
So it's not going to give you minutes or seconds or months or something gives you days.

28
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.720
And then if you wanted to you could turn that into months or something.

29
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.860
However it's just its primary purpose is to give you the number of days.

30
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.580
So let's try it.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.280
We could do something like this.

32
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.980
Let's work with our star from people let's work with that and let's figure out how many days ago each

33
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.380
one of these words each person here was born.

34
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.590
So it would be something like select date dif.

35
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.570
And then we want to take it now and subtract

36
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.890
hopefully that makes sense for taking.

37
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800
Now we could also do curred date.

38
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.070
It wouldn't make a difference because we're not working with the time part of now.

39
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.720
But I like now it's short easy to remember thing.

40
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.240
So so like date diff now or comma birth date.

41
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.090
So that will take current date subtract birth date find the number of days.

42
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.400
Let's try it.

43
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.900
OK.

44
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.980
So let's make this a little bit clearer.

45
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:22.490
Let's do so like date def And we'll also display name and birth date.

46
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.470
Here we go.

47
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.740
So padrÃ³n born in 1983 12000 215 days ago Larry.

48
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:41.110
For the longest to go 1943 is 26000 781 days old and then toaster was just born today is zero days old.

49
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.900
All right.

50
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.290
So that's all there is to date.

51
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.100
If the next thing we're going to take a look at is date add and there's a little bit more to discuss

52
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.020
there.

53
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.390
We just looked at the docs date and conveniently right below date death.

54
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.490
We get another table here like we did when we had a date format.

55
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.210
There's a bit to discuss.

56
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.840
So what this allows us to do it is kind of the bread and butter for date arithmetic.

57
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.820
So we specify a date so date add and there's also a date sub for subtract but we're just going to work

58
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.960
with date ad for now.

59
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.850
So we give it a date or date time and then a comma and then this sort of weird syntax it basically specifies

60
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.160
what we want to add.

61
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.700
Do we want to add 10 days one year four quarters or three quarters.

62
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.290
How about 18 months 10 microseconds whatever it is.

63
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.570
The way that we specify it is using that interval keyword and then we pair it with one of these units

64
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.830
and then put it all together it looks something like this.

65
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.260
So if we have this date time our actions take a look at this example here.

66
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.780
Here here's a date time and if you want to add one second to it.

67
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.240
You have to say interval and then second which is the unit and then how many seconds.

68
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.720
So it follows that forment interval one day and then it gets kinda weird when there's things like minute

69
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.660
second.

70
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.200
So this will do one minute one second.

71
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.140
Add that to this date time pretty nuanced thing.

72
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.600
I've never had to use these ever.

73
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.220
But good to know that they exist.

74
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.680
So let's give it a shot.

75
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.050
Let's work with let's do.

76
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.590
Why not let's do months.

77
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.490
So we'll go here.

78
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.030
We'll do a select and let's do date time this time.

79
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.350
So it's like birth date time from people.

80
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.570
Just take a look at what we have.

81
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.190
All right.

82
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:53.970
And now let's try also doing a date add birth date time and we want to add one month.

83
00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:04.790
So we have to say interval 1 and if you can't remember can go over here a month that's pretty straightforward.

84
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.020
OK.

85
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:18.630
So as you can see here we go from 1983 11 11 293 12 11 or here 1943 12:25.

86
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.750
Here's a significant month.

87
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:32.390
We went from Christmas of 43 to January 25th 44 so we can also change it over and do things like rather

88
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.460
than one month.

89
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.370
What about 10 seconds.

90
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.810
It was have to trust that works.

91
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.180
We can look at it but I won't spend time in the video doing that.

92
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.400
We could also do things like three quarter

93
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.120
and you might be wondering OK that's great but if I wanted to do multiple things like I wanted to add

94
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:05.280
one month and a year where I wanted to add I don't know 10 years and two seconds.

95
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.600
Well the easiest way to do that is with two separate date ads.

96
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.380
There's no you can't just chain them together like this.

97
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.440
You know two second thing that doesn't work.

98
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.170
However there's a nice shortcut that I'll show you right now which brings us to our third way of doing

99
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.400
date arithmetic which is just with the plus and minus sign.

100
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.940
So if we go back to the docks you can actually see that rather than using Date add or dates up which

101
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.980
I didn't go over but it works the same way as Date ad except it subtracts things.

102
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.610
You can just use a date and then the plus sign and then the interval expression and a date and a minus

103
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.070
sign.

104
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.600
So we could rewrite what we did as I go back here.

105
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.120
This one more we added one month.

106
00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:03.290
All I need to do if I get rid of the date add is just do birth date time plus sign interval 1 month

107
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.740
as you can see there it still works.

108
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.690
Or I could do that subtract five months

109
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.240
and this takes us back five months five months and five months

110
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.060
right.

111
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.480
So the only other thing that will show is that you can chain them together this way so that you could

112
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:44.930
do something like take a date time and add interval 15 month plus interval 10.

113
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.600
Let's do two hours.

114
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.670
And if you take a look we're not only adding 15 months but if you look at the time portion we went from

115
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.900
10 to twenty four to 14.

116
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.140
So we're adding 10 hours successfully.

117
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.920
So this is the end.

118
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.760
This is my preferred way for doing date math.

119
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.310
I will say though it's not that often that you're doing things like adding 15 months or adding 10 hours

120
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.260
often more often than not.

121
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:21.850
I'm actually using Date diff and finding how long ago things were relative to now relative to current

122
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.590
time.

123
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.340
Okay.

124
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.470
So that's pretty much it for date math at this point.

125
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.260
The thing that we're going to talk about in the next video is how we set up timestamps so a new topic.

126
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.600
How do we automatically store when a row is updated what time it was up to do that.

127
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.170
So we'll see that in just a sec.
