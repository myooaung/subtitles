1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,210
Right so hopefully you made it through those exercises or maybe you're just wanting to watch the solutions

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,360
or maybe you're curious to know how you got here.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,470
What I'm going to do in this video is go over the solutions to the previous video and that's about noise

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,510
that happened.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,190
All right.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,390
So the first one.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,970
Select All story collections that.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,390
So these are titles that contain the word stories in them somewhere.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,750
And we just want to print the title.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,330
So I'm going to go over here and make some space.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:41,550
And the first thing that I'll do is just make a new file and I'll just call it exercises as well and

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,850
then I'll open that up and we'll start off with this first one.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,450
Select title from books and we'll start there.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,300
Just make sure we're doing everything correctly.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:02,640
Source refining selections slash exercises that is to make sure that it's working.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,210
Selecting the titles.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,630
So now we only want the ones that contain stories.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,670
So that's going to be where and we're going to do title like.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,560
And this is you know we just do stories.

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,760
It's not going to work.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,750
That gives us exactly the stories we're going to want that wildcard character just like that.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,920
And now we get what we're looking for technically with our specific data we could leave that last percentage

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,850
sign off the last wildcard because all of the books that contain the word stories.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,990
It comes at the end but that may not always be the case.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,240
There might be a book out there called my favorite stories for kids or something like that.

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,340
And if we wanted this truly to just find all books that have stories in the title we need both of those

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,320
wild card characters.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,980
All right.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,080
So that's the first one.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,500
Next up find the longest book.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,020
So print out the title and the page count for the one longest book.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,860
So we'll go ahead and comment this line out and let's just do a select title and pages from books just

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,210
like that to start.

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,230
OK.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,300
So now we want to do is sort them we'll sort them by the pages.

36
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,510
So that's an order by pages.

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,250
And if we just do the default sort remember that we get ascending rather than descending which is what

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,390
we want what we're going to do is use a limit to give us the first result.

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,430
But right now if we do limit one it's going to give us the shortest book rather than the longest one.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,570
So we want to reverse that sort with the descending order.

41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,690
It's now the first one is the longest and then we just add our limit 1 and we run it again and again

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,310
and again and it always works.

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,460
And so whatever book has the longest page count will always be what is printed out here.

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,370
All right.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,750
So that's that one that's commented out and move on.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,860
Print out a summary of containing the title and year for the three most recent books.

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:25,230
So this one required you to not only use ORDER BY and limit or ordering by most recent year and then

48
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,590
limiting it to three but you also needed to use concatenate to concatenate the title the dash with a

49
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,490
year.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,370
So let's do that now let's just start by doing this select Concat.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,300
And it was title comma.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,770
Then we have a space and a dash and a space comma released here.

53
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,160
And we'll start with just that from books.

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,550
Save OK.

55
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,430
Oh the other thing we wanted to do is clean this up.

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
It says summary up there.

57
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,870
So this is also review.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,110
Say as summary.

59
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,840
OK.

60
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:12,950
So now we get that now now we want to order them by most recent and let's break this up on to some different

61
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,860
lines here.

62
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,000
From books.

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,660
Order by and we'll order by at least here.

64
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:31,120
And if we try that now we also see that it does work but it's in the opposite order that we want we

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,450
want most recent.

66
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:41,690
So we need to reverse that again with descending and then finally we want to limit it to the first three.

67
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:49,750
I met three or if you want to get fancy you could do this but I don't like doing that.

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,330
So that's much easier.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,920
Get.

70
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,620
So say give this link in the bardo Dasch 20:17 Norse mythology d'Este 2016.

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,660
10 percent happier dasht 2014 summary.

72
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,890
That's all good to go.

73
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,210
Next up find all the books that have an author last name containing a space.

74
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,160
Don't cheat by just doing Foster Wallace.

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,280
So that's come with this out first.

76
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,180
This one is actually pretty short and easy.

77
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:25,150
It's just a select and we're looking for a title and author name select title comma author name where

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:35,050
author name like and of course you can't just say space because that's only going to find authors whose

79
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,390
last name is exactly space and it looks like I'm forgetting from books.

80
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,430
Hopefully you caught that before I did.

81
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,030
But back to what are saying this isn't going to work because we don't have any authors whose last name

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,950
is space.

83
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,920
So what we want is that wildcard

84
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,040
on either side anything with a space and then anything afterwards.

85
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,130
Now we get Foster Wallace and that's it for that one.

86
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,660
Next up find three books with the lowest stock.

87
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,670
So we want the title released here and the stock quantity three books with the lowest stock.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,440
So let's start with commenting this out just like we've done with all the others.

89
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,590
It's like tidal.

90
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,400
What else was it released here in stock quantity.

91
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,100
OK.

92
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,280
Just like that.

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,680
And we have are from books.

94
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,280
We'll start there.

95
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,570
Make sure that works.

96
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,830
OK.

97
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,930
So now we want to do is sort them by stock quantity.

98
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,240
So that's just an order by stock quantity

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,140
and you can see that gives us the order we want we want them to be in ascending order this time rather

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,950
than descending because we are looking for the lowest stock quantity 12 all the way up to 1000.

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:06:59,910
Okay.

102
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,880
And then we want to limit it to 3.

103
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,530
I don't know why I picked three so many times in these exercises.

104
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,040
Let's try it.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,830
Now with that limit 3 and there we go.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,950
American Gods where I'm calling from what we talk about when we talk about love.

107
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,310
That's what we're looking for.

108
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,610
Then we've got this one print title and author last name sorted first by author last name and then by

109
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,560
title.

110
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:37,220
So let's get the title and author a last name to print first select title comma author name from books

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,070
just like that.

112
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,400
And at this point we all know what that does.

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,950
So now let's sort by the author last name.

114
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,220
So that's just a simple order by author Al name and that gives just the alphabetical order we're looking

115
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,500
for.

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,780
We don't need to use descending.

117
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,340
That's all right.

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,790
But then if you look over here we take Carver's books.

119
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:07,040
Notice that where I'm calling from comes before what we talked about when we talk about love even though

120
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,180
W H A comes before W h e.

121
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:17,260
So we want to now sort by title there and the way we do that is not by just changing that to be title

122
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,970
because then it purely starts by title and ignores.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,670
Author name rather we want to do this author name comma title

124
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,460
and there we go now you could also replace this whole thing with two comma one which I really don't

125
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,060
like just because it's not very semantic.

126
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,580
It's not meaningful to look at this but it is shorter.

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,580
And again that too is referring to author L name and one is referring to title it's just the order that

128
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,840
we're selecting them and so I'm going to change it back.

129
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:03,070
But I will also duplicate that fellow and change it to to come a one incumbent that out as well.

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,140
So we have both solutions.

131
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,540
Which brings us to the last problem.

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,450
Hopefully it's OK to make this happen.

133
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,430
So we want to yeah.

134
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,900
My favorite author is.

135
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,210
And then the uppercase first name of an author and then a space in uppercase last name of an author

136
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,490
and an exclamation point.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
He has kind of a lot.

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,970
OK so let's start with selecting and we know already that we can start with select from books.

139
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,620
Sure what we're going to want to do is concatenate.

140
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,330
My favorite author is.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,060
And then in upper case version of Raymond and space and then uppercase version for last name.

142
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,640
So an exclamation point to a lot of concatenation.

143
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,100
So we're going to have a concat and I'll just do this.

144
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,540
Well let's do this way.

145
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,300
Just like that.

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,730
What are we concatenating.

147
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,860
Well let's start with uppercase or without.

148
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:14,060
So let's just start with my favorite author is ideaspace comma and then we want Arthur F. name and then

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,340
we want another space.

150
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,630
This space here.

151
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,850
So they don't just run together.

152
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,560
Comma.

153
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,320
Author L name finally an exclamation point.

154
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,380
That's a lot.

155
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,550
So let me drag this down a bit so we can see the whole query.

156
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,870
Select the concatenation of my favorite author is space the first name of an author space the last name

157
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,620
of an author.

158
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,890
Exclamation point.

159
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,190
Let's save it and run it.

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
It's pretty long.

161
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,780
Oh and this is partially messed up because you see appear the column heading here is this entire thing

162
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,460
so let's add the as yet.

163
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,290
Now if I run it there we go.

164
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,360
OK.

165
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,480
So we're close.

166
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:09,120
The next thing we need to do is capitalize author f name and our author last name which is easy just

167
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,810
in Upper

168
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,860
like that save.

169
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,940
Rerun it.

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,490
OK it's all uppercase.

171
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,520
Now we have one last thing which is sorting alphabetically by the last name.

172
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,670
So from books.

173
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:33,090
By Author Elman one query here.

174
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,870
Let's try it.

175
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,930
Looks like it worked.

176
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,970
We got Raymond Carver all the way down to my favorite authors John Steinbeck and that's about as loud

177
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,870
as lot Yellin here.

178
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,010
Don't want to wake my neighbors.

179
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,880
All right.

180
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
So congratulations Hopefully you made it through this relatively unharmed.

181
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,760
It's a lot of exercises a lot of ordering by and limiting.

182
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,090
But the reality is we use those a lot.

183
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,740
It is very useful to be able to determine you know the I mean highest page count maybe not but the best

184
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,710
selling book.

185
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,920
Once we get to sales and users and stuff for the most active users are like it keep coming back to the

186
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:16,020
highest commented post or the most trafficked the most clicked on ad all those sorts of bits of data

187
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,410
are really useful.

188
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,640
And we use ORDER BY and limit all the time as well as other tools that we saw distinct and like they're

189
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,630
all very useful.

190
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,520
All right well I recommend you take a quick little break and then we'll move on.
