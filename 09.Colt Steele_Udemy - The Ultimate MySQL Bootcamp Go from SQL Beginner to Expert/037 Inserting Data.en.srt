1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,150
Next up we're going to focus our time on learning to create data.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,730
How do we add or insert data into the tables that we've already made.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,870
This is another one of the most important and most commonly used commands.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,310
When you're working with databases obviously it's really important to have a way to get your data in

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,560
the database.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,180
So we'll be using what we learn here throughout the rest of the course and you could say that for everything

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,400
else we've learned so far.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:36,930
But in particular this command insert her insert into the syntax here is insert into and then the name

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,530
of the table cats.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,670
In our case and then it gets a little weird after that.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,700
So let's just focus on that first insert into and then the table name.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,620
Then afterwards in parentheses we're specifying the columns that we are going to insert.

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,710
So I'm saying I'm going to give you a name comma.

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,890
I'm going to give you an age and then down here I have values which is another keyword specifying that.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,770
OK I told you and giving you a name and an age.

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,090
Here they are.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,840
The name is Jetson and the age is seven.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,050
So these do need to match names first Jetson age or second seven.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,430
Before we go try it out in cloud 9.

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,170
Just want to show you that I wrote it this way mainly because it looks best on a slide.

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,900
You can do it on one line so insert into cat's name and age the values Jetson and seven or you can do

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,590
it like this.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,010
And this is actually a lot of people's preferred way of writing it.

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,500
But this is a huge pain to enter into the shell this way where you have to you know space things manually.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,680
But when we start working with individual sequence files where we'll save our own code basically into

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,850
these separate files in a text editor and we can space them out how we want.

27
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,560
This is definitely the preferrable way but we're going to work with this.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,770
I just like this when I'm presenting and when I'm teaching it it's a mix of readability but also it's

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,800
not so laborious like this.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,790
Okay.

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,270
And just to hit this point home the order that we write these column names matters.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:19,410
So if I say insert into cats and I say age is coming first and then name I have to provide age first

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,900
and then name.

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,560
So it doesn't matter which order you use.

35
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,210
But whatever you establish appear you have to follow through with.

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,850
Otherwise it will try.

37
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,010
If you had this reversed it would try an aside.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,430
It was trying to sign Victoria to age and 12 to name and that's going to be a problem because we have

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,830
these strict data types where things are supposed to be numbers and strings and so if you mix them up

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,210
it's problematic not to mention that it makes no sense.

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,790
So let's give it a shot in cloud night.

42
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll make some space here.

43
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,210
And the first thing we need to do is actually recreate a table because right now I don't have a cat's

44
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,690
table.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
I deleted it because I showed you how the beat works.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,600
So let's recreate that create table cats and it's going to have a name.

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:19,310
So far char 50 comma age is going to be it just like that perfect.

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,640
So now we'll use the insert into command.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,580
We just learned.

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:33,880
So we will insert a new cat insert into cats and I'll start with name and then age and then I'll go

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,710
to a new line.

52
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,240
I don't have to but I like to values and the values will put in.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,890
Let's say for name.

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,610
Let's work with my cat.

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Blue comma and her age is somewhere between one and two were to leave it as one semi-colon will hit

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,170
enter.

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,150
We get our queery Okay.

58
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,400
This time it says one row affected.

59
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,830
He may have noticed that everything else we've done so far has said zero rows affected and I think that's

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,030
pretty self-explanatory.

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,880
We haven't had any rows of data yet so all of these commands have returned 0 rows affected.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,390
Now we actually have created something we've added data to a table and it says one row affected.

63
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,360
And before we move on let's insert one more cat here and this time will switch up the order.

64
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,470
Insert into cats and I'll do it on one line.

65
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,440
Age comma name and then are values.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:39,450
Let's say the age for this cat will be 11 and the name will be Draco.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,440
All right.

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,210
And we also get one row affected.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,310
So next logical question might be how do we see the data.

70
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,340
How do we know that it's in there correctly.

71
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,270
Basically the same thing that you might have asked when we saw how to create a table.

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,510
How do we check our work.

73
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,760
Well we've created data in a table.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,920
How do we check our work and we'll see that in the next video.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,870
Sorry for the cliffhanger.
