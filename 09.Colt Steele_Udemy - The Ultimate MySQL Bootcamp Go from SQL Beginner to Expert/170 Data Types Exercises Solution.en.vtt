1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.900
I'll get.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.460
So this is the solution video to our data types problem.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.600
That first one here what's a good use case for char.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.940
So there's not a ton of times that I end up using them but remember they are fixed length so we have

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
to specify exactly the length of the char that we want for that column.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.940
So we often only use it for text that we know 100 percent has a fixed length.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
So the one that I have use a couple of times the state abbreviations.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.490
If you're doing sex like AM or F.

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.600
Or perhaps you're working on a project where I don't know let's say you're working with companies and

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.260
you want an abbreviated name for every company that's only five characters or four characters long then

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.110
you could use char as well.

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.090
Hopefully you came up with something better than the something new and original.

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.850
Next up fill in the blanks of this schema.

14
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.610
OK.

15
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.070
So there's a couple of things to talk about.

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.160
Item Name is text.

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.880
It's gonna be something like I don't know Cabbage Patch doll or baseball hat.

18
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.360
And that should be a far Chaar most likely you could get away with using a char but there's no reason

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.280
to do that because it's not fixed length so it makes more sense to do Vardar and then quantity I'll

20
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.280
skip price for a moment.

21
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.950
Quantity makes sense to be an integer.

22
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.260
We are never going to have partial items in stock when I going to have 2.5.

23
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.470
Cabbage Patch dolls.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.550
Hopefully unless there is some sort of massacre with the Cabbage Patch dolls and the chainsaw.

25
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.470
Or hopefully I'm only going to have whole numbers of them so we'll use it.

26
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.700
But price is a little trickier.

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.370
And so I added this note.

28
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.970
Price is always less than 1 million dollars.

29
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.540
OK.

30
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.120
But price is not usually or not exclusively a whole number.

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.990
We want to allow for sense.

32
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.250
So we're going to want to use a decimal.

33
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.600
Now you could use a float or double but as we discussed decimals better for monetary stuff because it's

34
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.440
more precise.

35
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.070
You don't have to worry about losing precision as you get into longer numbers.

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.010
OK so then the question is what do we put here.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.360
It's not just decimal on it's own right we don't just do this.

38
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.900
We have to number three pass in and those two numbers if you can remember the names.

39
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.560
I believe the first one is precision and the second one is scale.

40
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.750
Don't quote me on that though.

41
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.040
But basically it's the total number of digits followed by the number of digits after the decimal.

42
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.090
So we can start with the number of digits after the decimal which when you're working with pricer monetary

43
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.710
information it's pretty much always two.

44
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.850
So then the question becomes how many total digits do we need.

45
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.180
And if I said It's always less than zero It's always less than 1 million.

46
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.090
That means that our highest price we could have is nine nine nine nine nine nine point ninety nine.

47
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.620
So if that's the maximum price then all we need to do is count up the total number of digits.

48
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.810
So that is 3 6 7 8 and that's her answer.

49
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.290
Decimal 8 comma 2.

50
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.560
Next up what's the difference between Date Time and time stamp.

51
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.060
So I have the documentation open for date date time and time stamp and the first thing I'll say is that

52
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.430
there's a couple of differences.

53
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.240
There are a few technical differences as far as how they're stored and the ranges that they support.

54
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.850
And then there's a big difference in how they're putting to use most of the time.

55
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.100
So both of them.

56
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.320
Let's start off.

57
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.480
They both store date and time information so they store the date and then the time.

58
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.910
However there is a big difference in the range that they support.

59
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.420
So time stamps have a much smaller range.

60
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.770
If you remember we went over this.

61
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.260
Where's that time stamp has a range from 1970 to 2038 versus date time goes from 1000 1000 up to year

62
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.370
nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine.

63
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.680
So that's one significant difference.

64
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.090
The other is the size of the memory they take up a date time is roughly twice as large as the time stamp.

65
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.640
Which brings us to the final difference which is how they're actually put into practice.

66
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.260
And typically time stamps are used at least in my experience exclusively when we are trying to add meta

67
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.310
data about when something is created or updated to a table.

68
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.620
Otherwise I use Date Time.

69
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.720
Now that doesn't mean that you can't use time stamp in you know if you wanted to use time stamps to

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.620
store birthdays you could but you could run into problems if you have people who are born before 1970.

71
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.920
So again the key differences really boil down to the ranges they support and then how much memory they

72
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.290
take up.

73
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.170
OK moving on.

74
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.950
Print out the current time.

75
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.360
Finally some code so to print out the current time.

76
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.630
It's just a matter of Kuhr time.

77
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.820
Me to select that.

78
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.090
Every go.

79
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.910
Sixteen oh eight 13.

80
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.690
Yours of course will differ.

81
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.590
Most likely print out the current date but not the time so that one you want to do.

82
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:36.390
Curr date and see April 22nd 2017.

83
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.180
Still my birthday print out the current day of the week.

84
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.140
OK so this one's a little bit different.

85
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.380
There's a couple ways of achieving this.

86
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:58.630
The first one is to use Select day of week and then we could either give it the date or date or we could

87
00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.670
use now.

88
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.550
So today is a Saturday so it gives us 7 just to show you.

89
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.960
And it can replace this with now which is a date time.

90
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.170
They also get 7 but there's another way we could do this which is to use date format and if we go to

91
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:22.560
the documentation here and refined this date format if we scroll down somewhere on here day that week

92
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.840
where is that.

93
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.580
Here we go.

94
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.290
Day of the week.

95
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.700
Percent w lowercase W.

96
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:37.200
We could use that use the like date format now or Khurd date comma and the string we want.

97
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.290
It's just percent lower case w and actually I didn't know this until now.

98
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.160
There is a difference.

99
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.670
That's kind of fascinating.

100
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.900
If we read this closely it says day the week zero is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.

101
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.570
So these are not equivalent Actually day of the week.

102
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.470
Sunday is 1 rather than zero and Saturday 7.

103
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:10.150
So I guess if we wanted DS to be equivalent we would need to do plus 1 and shift everything by one or

104
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.740
shift everything down one for use in the previous.

105
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.730
Interesting.

106
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.850
No idea why that's the case but it is what it is.

107
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.860
So the next thing is to print out the current day of the week but I want the date name day name.

108
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.720
Monday Tuesday Wednesday and so on.

109
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.490
I wouldn't expect you to remember this but there is a day name that we can use like that select day

110
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.170
name or we can do our format date or date format.

111
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:45.160
I always mix up the order there but its date underscore format for now and then we just have to figure

112
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.340
out how we get the day that week name.

113
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:55.550
If you go to the docs it's right above weekday name Sunday to Saturday percent upper case w.

114
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.870
So if we switch back just change it to an uppercase W..

115
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.180
Now we get Saturday OK.

116
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.860
Next up.

117
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:13.720
Print out the current date and time using this form in month month slash day day slash year year year

118
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.540
year.

119
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.570
OK so we need to use date format and we can just use Kuhr date or we can use now.

120
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.470
I like to use now typically but we were not actually using the time information.

121
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.110
So why don't we just use Kuhr date.

122
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.950
In this case just to show you we can and then the way we want to format it.

123
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.640
If we go to the docs we want first of all with the month.

124
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.690
So we want month Gnumeric which is present.

125
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:49.030
No that's not what we want what we want is done here this month.

126
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.740
Numeric 0 to 12.

127
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.430
So we get them lowercase M..

128
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.030
Percent lower case slash.

129
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:04.190
And then one day of the month numeric 0 0 to 31 years you want those two digits always.

130
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.570
So that's lowercase D.

131
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.210
So we have lowercase m slash or lower D.

132
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:15.170
And then for a year we want four digits so that's uppercase y.

133
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:25.230
So let's try that percent lower case M slash percent lower case D slash percent upper case Y.

134
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.140
OK.

135
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.700
So Michael when we go and that works.

136
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.200
Next up.

137
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:37.540
Print out the current day and time using this format a bit different month the month name and then Anglicize

138
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.790
day at and then hours in minutes.

139
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:48.730
So let's start off with what we know we're going to need to use date format and we need to use now because

140
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:57.130
we need date and time rather than date which gives us just the date then our format string.

141
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:03.100
First thing we want is the month name which is right where are you.

142
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.790
This is abbreviated month name.

143
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.220
Here we go month name uppercase m.

144
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:25.820
So we want uppercase space and then Anglicized version of the day and where where's that.

145
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.680
Here we go.

146
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.560
Day of the month with English suffix that's what I was trying to say.

147
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.570
So it's uppercase D.

148
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.470
OK let's just see if that works to start.

149
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.010
There we go.

150
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:48.300
April 22nd followed by at no years necessary so at and then hours and minutes.

151
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:58.450
So again hours we have upper or lower case H if we want and I guess I didn't specify if we wanted 24

152
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:04.810
hour time or 12 hours so either these will work I'm just going to do lowercase h colon.

153
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.800
And then for a minute it's lower case.

154
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.050
Well as I is going to get this.

155
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.660
There you go.

156
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.270
I'll work on a case I

157
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.070
so lowercase H.

158
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.550
Colon lowercase i There we go.

159
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.740
April 22nd at 4:15 great.

160
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:33.240
Now moving on to our final problem create tweets table that stores the tweet content a user name and

161
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.430
the time it was created.

162
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:41.670
So the tweet itself can vary in length so it should be of our are most likely a username could vary

163
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.820
in length as well.

164
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.840
And then the time it is created could be a date time.

165
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.900
I mean it could just be a time if you wanted it to.

166
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.120
But what makes the most sense as we've discussed already is to use time stamp and we want to set the

167
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.890
default to be now.

168
00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:07.110
So let's try top over here and the first thing we want is a create table tweets and then we're going

169
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.520
to have tweet content so we could call that whatever we want.

170
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.960
I'll just call it content.

171
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:22.620
Now we are char up to 140 characters and we have user name to also be of our char up to 20 characters.

172
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:28.620
And then finally we have created that or tweeted add or time or whatever you want to call it which will

173
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:38.370
be a time stamp and then the important part is default now or default current time stamp.

174
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.060
But I like to use now.

175
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.760
So let's try and see if it works.

176
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.590
Make sure you have the right commas in place.

177
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.830
Semi-colon.

178
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.340
And we tried it missing parentheses around.

179
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.210
Now the semi-colon in as well.

180
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.090
OK make some space.

181
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.230
Now we run it and it appears to work.

182
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.290
Let's just make sure by inserting one tweet

183
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.290
so will do content.

184
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.820
User name number we don't need to insert created out manually

185
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.690
and that the content will be.

186
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:26.610
This is my first tweet and username will be called kept OK.

187
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:34.980
Let's do a select star from tweets and you can see we have created that and there is a time stamp works

188
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.000
perfectly.

189
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.150
Just double checked by inserting something else.

190
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.510
Let's just change it slightly.

191
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.850
This is my second tweet.

192
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.610
Now if we select star two different time stamps just a couple of seconds later.

193
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.740
OK.

194
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.070
Now the hardest part.

195
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.480
Put yourself on the back.

196
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.190
You made it through.
