1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,740
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,850
Next up here.

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,510
This one will be nice and short.

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,550
Always trying to figure out is how many times the average user post.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,320
So we have a board or our investors want to know basically what our engagement is like just in general

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,110
for every user any user what how many times can we assume they've posted.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,540
So this is just across the board and really all we need to do is take the total number of posts photos

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,790
and divide it by the total number of users.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,320
And you could do that separately different lines or you could you know do a big joint statement between

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,740
users and photos and then use average and calculate average but you could just do it using subcommittee's

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,490
which is what I'm going to do.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,950
So something a little different.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,870
So we'll just to calculate average number of photos per user.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,810
So what we're looking for is total number of photos divided by total number of users.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,890
And the first part will each of those parts individually if we know how to do we can just do a select

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,350
count star from photos and that will give us the total number of photos.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,860
If I had a semi-colon 257.

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,710
And then for users who just need to change that to be users like to count from users and we get 100

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,670
now forget it mental math.

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,990
Even if you're not it's easy to figure out are average in your head.

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,080
But of course we're trying to do this dynamically so that if we have X you know ten thousand more users

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
tomorrow this still applies.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,490
So using stub queries basically what I can do is divide these two.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,880
So I can't just do this I'll get a syntax error.

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,370
What we need to do.

26
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,780
Like we've seen before was said purpose is add parentheses around these two things.

27
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,090
OK but even that won't be enough.

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,090
What are we missing.

29
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,480
Well it's just like we can't just say five plus five.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,060
We can't just do one divided by two.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
We have to say select one to about a right to in order to get anything.

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,890
So we need an extra Select up here.

33
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,740
Yeah it's kind of a mess.

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,200
You know we could do this on separate lines maybe I'm not actually sure how to best format this because

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,410
it's kind of a weird query but maybe something like this.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Well we can leave it at that for now.

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,880
Now get rid of all comment that out.

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,310
Now if we run this will we get this massive line here.

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:44,670
But 2.5 7 so every user has 2.5 on average every user has 2.5 7 posts that's thrown off significantly

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,250
for a couple of reasons we'll see later.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,080
There are lots of users who just don't post anything.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,920
And if we tried to get rid of the spot our efforts would change.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
So we'll get there in a moment.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,250
What we could do is just add in a simple alias we'll just call it as average KBG.

45
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,310
OK.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,050
And there we go.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
So that's the answer to that one.

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,910
If you came up with another way feel free to share it and we'll talk about it in the comments.

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,270
All right.

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,660
Moving on.
