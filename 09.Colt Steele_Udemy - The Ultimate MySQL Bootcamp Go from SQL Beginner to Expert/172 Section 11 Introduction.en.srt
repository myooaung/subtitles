1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,930
Theory can you can you say hello Hello It's me.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,320
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,240
They say that this is too much.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,320
Thank you Siri.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,520
Can you just say hello.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,510
Not singing it wants me to say hello and welcome to the next section.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,450
Thank you Sherry.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,350
So Siri said Hi welcome to the next section.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,160
This section is all about logical operators.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,240
So if you come from a programming language do you have any programming experience.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,280
You have probably stumbled across logical operators.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,200
Things like logical and logical or there's a bunch others but those are the primary two.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,980
If you haven't if you have no idea what I'm talking about don't panic.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,730
That's what this section is all about.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,790
So this will either serve as a review if you know how to program or if you know of logical operators

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,030
and it will serve as a way to show you how they work.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,350
In my ask you will or it will serve to both introduce them and to show you how they work.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,340
In my school.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,580
Either way they're really powerful.

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,070
I'm not going to say they're important they are important but I'm just over using that phrase in these

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,010
videos.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,550
Everything is important here but these allow us to string together different queries and make more complex

23
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,450
selections.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,560
So if I were to give you a really contrived idiotic example like cars and I want to select all cars

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,270
based off of a color right now all we could do is select all cars that have a color of exactly blue.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,920
Or a color that contains the word blue.

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,660
Like I don't know if Sky Blue or seashore blue or something like that.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,660
That's fine.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,770
But what if you also wanted to select all cars that were blue or that were red.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,990
Again I said contrived and silly but the idea is we can string things together.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,540
So rather than having to do 2 queries we could put them together or if we go to our books example which

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,930
by the way we're about to finish with this is the last of that section lots of our books data.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,750
We could make more complex selections like select all books that have a price below $20.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,510
And at the same time there I don't know we have 50 copies in stock or we could do something like select

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,660
all books written by a certain author before the year 1990.

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,660
So two different components right.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
We could select all books before 1990.

38
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,170
Select all books written by a certain author but put them together.

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,000
We need to use a logical operator.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,230
All right I'm rambling a little bit.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,480
Apologize.

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,420
This section is on logical operators.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,500
Lots of exercises of course like always.

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,090
Hopefully they're enjoyable.

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:43,150
If not well like I said it is of course I'm database's So I'm trying I really am yeah.

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,390
OK I'm going to stop.
