1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.570
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.090
So you probably guessed it either because in the last video I told you or because of this gigantic text

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.540
here it's your turn to try putting this into practice.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.240
So you get a couple of exercises.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.460
They range from trivial simple logic questions all the way up to more complex case statements.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.180
So I encourage you to go through all of them especially the case statements towards the end but hopefully

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.580
you don't lose interest before then.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.870
Oh and one thing.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390
This is the last time you have to work with those darn books.

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.100
Last time that books data unless you want to keep working with it you can definitely play around that.

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.660
But I'm getting pretty sick of it.

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.980
I imagine you are.

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.740
And the good news is we're now moving on to join tables which allows us to get much more complex and

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.510
real real life data things that are more accurate and realistic.

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.280
And that's really exciting.

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.860
So get excited.

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.250
If you're not all right there's the first couple evaluate the following.

18
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.400
Now try doing them don't just copy them and paste them in and hit enter actually walk through and evaluate

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.410
what you think the result is.

20
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.520
So the first one.

21
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.880
Select ten not equal to 10.

22
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.750
Is that true or false 0 or 1.

23
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.320
Next select 15 greater than 14 and 99 minus five.

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.620
Less than or equal to 94.

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.700
True or false.

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.520
0 1 finally select 1 in 5 come with 3 or 9 between 8 and 10.

27
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.440
True or false.

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.400
So do those and then move on to these code based challenges.

29
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.000
The first one here is select all books written before 1980 and that does not include 1980 so everything

30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.260
up to 1980 but not 1980.

31
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.000
Once you've done that move on.

32
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.220
A beautiful read text really expanding the color palette.

33
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.250
Select all books written by Eggers or siobhÃ¡n should know how you say his name.

34
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.170
Honestly that guy great author Well I just googled it and apparently it's pronounced Shaban.

35
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.240
So it's like all books written by Eggers or shavin.

36
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.470
Makes sense now I think about it.

37
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.770
Now onto the beautiful yellow select all books written by Lahiri published after 2000.

38
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.010
So books written by the here he released after 2000.

39
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.450
Then select all books where the page count is between 100 and 200 pages so are middle length or short

40
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.090
books those are pretty short between 100 and 200 pages.

41
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.530
Next select all books where the author last name starts with a C or an S.

42
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.370
So this one there's a couple of ways of approaching it.

43
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.810
I'll let you discover what works best.

44
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.190
You may want to use.

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.400
You'll need to use things that we've learned in the past especially when we're working with strings

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.910
so you may want to go back or just go to the string documentation to figure out how to do this.

47
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.560
Select all books where the author last name starts with a C or an S.

48
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.650
Those are my initials so maybe I'm crazy and I just want books that start with who are written by authors

49
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.910
who start with my initials I don't know.

50
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.210
Now moving on to the main event are wonderful case statements.

51
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.530
So here is another example.

52
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.070
This is done using a case statement and let me explain it.

53
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.380
So we've got title and the author's last name.

54
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.380
But then we've got to type over here what type of book is it.

55
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.570
Which I'm really bad at this.

56
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.670
This is just because a genre doesn't matter though.

57
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.390
Basically the way that it works.

58
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.420
If the title contains the word stories recalling it short stories so as you can see where I'm calling

59
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.650
from selected stories is categorized as short stories.

60
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.880
Well what we talk about when we talk about love great collection is categorized as short stories because

61
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.280
it contains stories.

62
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.290
Same thing with oblivian stories.

63
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.900
But then there's another part.

64
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.280
If the title is just kids or it's heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius which I didn't write all the

65
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.620
way I appear it's giant.

66
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.130
But basically if it's this book or if it's this book both are memoirs.

67
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.730
So we have these two exceptions.

68
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.220
You'll need to write in Finally everything else which hopefully sounds familiar.

69
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.690
Otherwise everything else at the end is called a novel.

70
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.520
And I know some of these aren't actually novels like considered the lobster.

71
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.790
It's more of an essay or a collection of essays 10 percent happier is like a self-help book but I don't

72
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.840
want to get too complex.

73
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.030
So just to reiterate the title contains stories type in short stories.

74
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.760
If the title is exactly just kids or exactly a heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius then it's memoir.

75
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.850
Both great memoirs by the way.

76
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.420
And then finally everything else is a novel.

77
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.150
OK.

78
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.810
One more this is a bit of a bonus.

79
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.960
It's more complex to put a few things together.

80
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.030
So we have title of a book and the author's last name once again.

81
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.920
But then there's this count section and count which we've already seen do is a little different.

82
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.750
It's not just saying two or one or three but it's actually doing we can ignore the title part.

83
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.250
Actually you don't need to do that.

84
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.080
Just focus on the last name of the author in the count.

85
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.470
It's saying how many books each author has.

86
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.560
How many they've written so Carver has two books Geymann has three books.

87
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.050
Harris Dan Harris or Frida Harris.

88
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.730
They each have one book jubilee here he has two books and so on.

89
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.810
But not only is it printing the number but there's also the properly pluralized books or book following

90
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.160
it.

91
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.050
So one book singular two books three books one book and so on.

92
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.330
So you'll need to use a couple things I can give you hints if you don't want the hints then stop right

93
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.720
now.

94
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.620
But the hints are you need to use group by Nietzsche also use a case statement to generate this right

95
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.300
here.

96
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.830
But it is a bonus because you do need to combine a couple of things to a decent amount of work.

97
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.710
OK so that's it.

98
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.940
Once you finish that burn all the books are done with them.

99
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.400
Whatever that means to you.

100
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.440
I don't actually condone burning books but if you to get rid of the database go ahead.

101
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.080
Although you may want to refer back to it.

102
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.660
This is more just me saying that we're done.

103
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.950
Done with the books.

104
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.890
This is a turning point.

105
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.170
We're moving on to bigger and better data and two pretty important section which is joint so I'd definitely

106
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.360
recommend you take a break.

107
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.630
But I will reiterate that in the solution video which is coming up next.
