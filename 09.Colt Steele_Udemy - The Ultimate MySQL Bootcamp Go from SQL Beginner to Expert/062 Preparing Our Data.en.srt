1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,520
OK so before we see any new code or new commands I want to clean up the data that we currently have.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,090
If you remember we kind of added a bunch of different cats databases of cats and cats 1 and Cat 2 and

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,840
Cat 3 and so on.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,810
But I want to do is delete the original catch table and then we're going to remake it.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,100
But with a few additions because our original cat's table was the most basic.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,220
It only had name and age.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,220
But I want to add some other data in like an ID that autoincrement and so on.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,910
So basically we're just going to remake the cat table and add new data in.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,900
So if you want to make a bit of an exercise out of this the first step would be to delete the catch

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,910
table.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,100
So do that now and the command if you want to see it is drop table cat.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,240
So let's do it.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,710
Drop table cats.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,820
There we go.

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,780
Now that we've dropped the table we want to recreate the table.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,560
So this is what we want here.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:08,710
We're going to have a cat ID integer not know autoincrement really have a name that Safar char a breed

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,080
that's our char as well and age that is an integer and cat ID is our primary key.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,550
So if you'd like go ahead and type that out or just copy paste it in perfect.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,480
Of course we could make sure it worked.

21
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,400
Describe cats.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,870
There we go.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,590
All right.

24
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,890
So the last step here is to add new data.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,330
And I would like for you to have this same data because we're going to use it throughout the section.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,660
There'll be a couple of activities and questions and it will be much easier if you have the same data

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,950
as me.

28
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,580
So we've got one two three four five six seven cats.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,110
Each one has a name breed and age.

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,990
Some of them there's a couple of Maine Coons couple of Tabby's and a couple that have the same age which

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,340
we will use in just a little bit.

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:07,310
So copy this or if you're a masochist you can type it out paste it in perfect.

33
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,290
And now we have seven cats in our database.

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,410
Seven rows.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,360
OK.

36
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,080
So now we've prepped our data.

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,960
We've deleted the original catch table remade new special cats table with some more interesting pieces

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,150
of data and then we've inserted data in there as well.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,940
Awesome.

40
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,640
Next we're going to move on to talking about searching or reading data out.
