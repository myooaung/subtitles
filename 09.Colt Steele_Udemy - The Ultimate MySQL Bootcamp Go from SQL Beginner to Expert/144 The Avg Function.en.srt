1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,080
Next up we're talking about as a good thing.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,550
Next up we're talking about average.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,920
And as you might have guessed because I've said this for pretty much every video on this section it

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,020
doesn't it sounds like.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,010
Actually that's a lie.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,270
It sounds like.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,220
But what it does is average data.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,560
So it will some things together and then divide them based off of how many things added together.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,260
So it's pretty useful if you're trying to do things like find the I don't know average sales for something

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,190
in a given month or find the average price of something in a database or the average anything an average

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,630
number of users that are average number of followers that your YouTube videos have.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,840
I mean averages are pretty useful in general.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Think of all the times in your life.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,750
Hopefully.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,050
I mean I don't know maybe you don't.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,040
Maybe you never average things but I feel like it's something I find myself doing.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,370
It's a lot of what teachers do is find averages average scores average grades.

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,660
OK let's just get back to this.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,150
There are a lot of uses for averages.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,730
It's not a perfect way of getting inside it.

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,130
I want to say that you know the average is this amazing all encompassing piece of data but it can be

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,180
useful anyway.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,310
So how do we use it.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,700
Also as you might have guessed I'm going to show you how to use it on its own first and then how to

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,010
use it with group type.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,320
By now we'll be able to do this pretty quickly and it should service review so we could do something

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,950
like this.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,070
Calculate the average released year across all books and that's very simple.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:42,240
We do a select a Viji average release year from books and as you can see we get nineteen ninety nine

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,870
point seven eight nine five.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,690
And it's important to note yes there is a decimal.

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,580
And it goes out to four places here.

33
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,960
We'll talk more about different types of data data types in a coming election.

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,590
Well we'll talk about the differences between integers and the ways of storing decimals.

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,260
But for now it's important that you notice when you do average it doesn't round things up to a whole

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,220
number.

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,060
It gives you four decimal points.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,030
You can also do things like select the average page count from all of our books which is 348 point five

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,640
seven eight nine pages.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,580
OK.

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,860
So now let's see how to use it with Group.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,890
That's a more common application.

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,900
How do we do something like calculate the average stock quantity for books released in the same year.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,840
So this is a little bit different.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,940
We're not grouping by author in this case.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,450
We have a couple of books that were released in the same year by different authors and this is sort

47
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,000
of arbitrary and very arbitrary.

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,920
But how do we calculate the average stock quantity for books released in the same year.

49
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,700
Looks like this select e.g. average stock quantity from books group by release year.

50
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,830
So let's try it.

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:06,640
Select average and we want to stock quantity quantity from books.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,090
GROUP BY released here just like that.

53
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,160
Not that insightful to look at.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,410
Let's be honest.

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,090
But maybe we could do something like this.

56
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,410
Let's print out the release year that count how many books were released say you're in an average year.

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:34,600
So it will look like the average stock quantity excuse me so we'll have released year.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,580
And then let's also well let's just leave it at that at least and an average stock quantity.

59
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:51,790
And if I do that you can see 1945 95 or average quantity hundred 2001 134 is your average quantity.

60
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,550
Yes.

61
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,620
Not that useful.

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,230
I totally agree.

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,360
But I just want to mix it up because we've been doing a lot of group by author name comma author name

64
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,240
and it gets kind of old so we can group by other important pieces of data.

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,690
But of course we could do something like this.

66
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:20,050
Select Let's do our good old author name author Al name and average Let's do average pages written by

67
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:30,530
every author or each author from books group by author L. name author F. name.

68
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,060
Ooh boy.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,690
A little bit too eager there.

70
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,170
What's her problem.

71
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,890
Looks like I'm missing a comma.

72
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,200
Right here.

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,190
OK.

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,100
So you can see the average page is written.

75
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,650
We saw how to select the men in the Macs as well as the sum.

76
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,410
Now we have average.

77
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:01,490
Also it's important to note that someone like let's see John Steinbeck who we know has one book 181

78
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,800
it still adds the four decimal points.

79
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,670
That has to do with the data type that this is.

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,200
And basically I understand punt that one we talk about data types but I just wanted to highlight it

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,720
here.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,480
You still get those four decimal points even if it's an even integer even not meaning.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,320
Ok that's a bad choice of words not as an even and odd.

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,920
Let's say as a whole number.

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,850
All right so that's average.

86
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,330
And that actually wraps up the section on the new content on these aggregate functions.

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:40,310
So we saw count what we saw grouped by and then count min max sum an average all different things that

88
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,070
we can do on their own or in conjunction with Group By.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,120
All right so now we're going to get another chance to practice it.

90
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,320
Hopefully you're looking forward to that.

91
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,810
And if you're not it's still good to do.

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,910
It's like you know vegetables just gotta eat them.

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,110
I hope I don't offend anyone.

94
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,650
If you're vegetarian right.
