1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,470
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,120
So before we go any further we have a couple of quick exercises that are just going to test you basically

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,080
on what we just learned select and where.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,580
So the first one I'd like you to write the sequel that will select the following.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,040
And this is using our cats so the same data that we already had which is why I asked you to hopefully

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,790
you inserted the same cats.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,350
Basically it's like all the cats but only get their ID and then the next thing I'd like you to do.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,120
Of course you can post a video and do it and then move on when you're ready to the next question which

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,340
is right the sequel that will select the following.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,630
Name hen breed only so we don't want the we don't want aids.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,770
Just name and breed in that order for all of the cats.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,200
All right.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,670
And the next one is a little bit more complicated.

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,610
You'll need to combine both things we just learned the select expression and the WHERE clause.

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,560
So in this case you're going to only select the tabby cat.

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,530
So the cats that have breed equal to Tabby and we only want name and age.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,790
And then finally this is a little bit of a challenge because I didn't show exactly how to do this but

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,290
hopefully you'll be able to figure it out.

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,040
We'll talk about it and answer video either way but hopefully it's not too difficult in this case.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,410
What you're doing is selecting the instances where cat I.D. and age are the same.

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:31,030
So if I go back to the data here when I select all of them if you look here cat I.D. and age they're

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,040
not the same one in four to 10 but egg eggs.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,710
Cat ideas for an egg is four years old and Jackson is has an idea of seven and is seven years old.

24
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,090
So how can you say like just those two and I don't want you to cheat.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,080
Don't select based off of their name or their breed or something.

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,080
I want you to select where cat ID is the same as age.

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,290
And we only want I.D. and age as well.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,690
OK solution video is coming up next.
