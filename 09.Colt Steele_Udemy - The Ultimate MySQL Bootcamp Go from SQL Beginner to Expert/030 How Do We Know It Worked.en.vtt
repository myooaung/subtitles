00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.970
So we left off by creating a new catch table and it said queery OK.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.300
But the question is how do we know that it works.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.230
How do we know that it did what we wanted it to do.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.540
So there's a couple of options.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.060
The first come and I'll show you is pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.870
Show tables very similar to show databases.

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.790
It just is going to show you the current tables in your database so we can try that.

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.850
Now Inkheart 9 will do show tables just like that and it tells us tables and cat app.

9
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.800
There is one called cats.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.920
So that's great.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.650
It tells us that there is a cat table but that's pretty much it doesn't say anything about the contents

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.590
of that table what are the different columns in it.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.030
Which brings us to our next command which is again using Show show columns from a table name.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.950
So in this case we would say show columns from cat.

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.840
So let's try it out now.

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.970
And as you can see we get some nice little table back here that says we've got to field name and age

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.340
name is have our char with 100 limit and age is an integer.

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.380
And don't worry about this 11 for now.

19
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
Then we've got some other data that we're also not going to worry about because we're going to talk

20
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760
quite a bit about it in the next section.

21
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.320
But there are some other categories here that we're just going to ignore.

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.230
But this is what we want name for our age and perfect.

23
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.410
One other thing I'll show you is that you can use a shorter version.

24
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.030
Technically these are slightly slightly different commands but used in this context.

25
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.400
There is no difference.

26
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.690
So we can use describe that DGSE a table name.

27
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.960
And that's my preference.

28
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.800
It's shorter easier to remember.

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.430
So let's try that out describe cats.

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.540
You can see get the exact same printout.

31
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.460
So I did say that you could use them differently in a more advanced setting where you can basically

32
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.600
pass in some other things to describe.

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.300
So anyways it doesn't really matter.

34
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.810
But I just want you to know they're not exactly identical.

35
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.090
It's not like one is a shortcut for the other.

36
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.020
But they do the same thing in this context.

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.570
All right.

38
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.550
So this video was pretty quick.

39
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.640
It was just about kind of testing and making sure that when you create a table it's created accurately

40
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.010
and that you can one tell that the table is there using show tables.

41
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.140
But more importantly see the actual columns in that table.

42
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.280
Using these two commands.
