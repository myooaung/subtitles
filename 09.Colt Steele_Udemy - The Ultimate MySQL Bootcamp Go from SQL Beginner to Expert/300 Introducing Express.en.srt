1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,320
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,850
Very high energy because we're moving on to a very exciting portion of the course.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,140
We've now seen how to take a database in my ass.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,790
Q Well everything we know and combine it with a node file a single file that doesn't do.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,350
I mean it depends on your impression of it.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,420
It doesn't do a whole lot just inserts but it inserts 500 things are just pretty cool and they're all

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,450
randomly generated.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,800
But that's not an application that's still useful for our application will be able to use that.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,490
Just to recap the whole reason we're doing that is so that when we start up our application we have

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,420
some data in there.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,290
We have something to work with rather than totally empty database or something that has two users.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,620
We have 500 realistic randomly generated emails and created at dates.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,470
OK.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,450
So we've done that.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,250
We have that.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,660
Now we're moving on to the web application portion.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,430
So remember this is join us our mailing apper waitlist app where there's a nice page with it looks style

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,510
that's nice it says join us in big letters.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,090
It says how many users have currently joined.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,630
And there's also a guarantee 100 percent.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,580
It's not a cult.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,410
And then there's a form at the bottom where you can actually enter your email to join the list.

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,680
So we have to get there.

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,260
We're going to start with the basics of a web app.

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,340
So just like we had to start with the basics of node we're now starting with the basics of building

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,140
web applications.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,540
OK.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,700
That brings us to something called Express.

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,960
So if you've taken the course or if you're familiar with node and you've used it in any web development

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,190
capacity you've probably come across the framework Express.

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,610
It's a Web development framework that helps us make applications faster.

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,100
So if you're not familiar with frameworks in 10 seconds what they are are tools libraries that are a

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,210
bit more complex a bit more controlling of how you write your code.

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,620
They dictate things for you.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,710
You play by the rules but they help you make things faster.

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,490
So a web development framework helps you make Web sites faster.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,040
There are iOS or game development frameworks that help you make games faster so they can limit your

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,430
freedom a bit but they empower you because they speed you up and they let it they let you focus on things

39
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,240
that matter.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,900
So with all that said Express it's very simple a lightweight framework that allows us to do is once

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,800
we install it and included in a file we can very quickly make a web application.

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,300
So something like faker is a package that allows us to quickly get random data a very small kind of

43
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,690
feature that's it's useful but it's a small thing.

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,030
Express is a package that when you use it and install it it does a lot.

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,560
It sets up just a server for you it listens for incoming requests it figures out how to respond to requests.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,920
It handles H-2 on CSSA in responding with that.

47
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,000
It figures out how to parse a response body all these things will go into but it does a lot.

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,120
So let's take a look.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,930
Very quickly the documentation express J s dot com a fast and opinionated minimalist web framework for

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,830
no js.

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,330
As you can see you can just install it NPM install Express.

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,100
We'll talk about dash dash save in just a second.

53
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,560
And you can read more about it here.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Basically it provides a robust set of features for web applications.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,670
It's light weight.

56
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,220
So what that means if I go over here to know yes frameworks is a site that I found it has a list of

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,200
some of the most popular Noad framework.

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,180
There are a ton of them out there because people love using frameworks for good reason.

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,880
They help you make things faster.

60
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,350
There's two categories that this person has categorized them into Sinatras like in rails like.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,990
Basically this comes from Ruby.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,910
These are two Ruby frameworks Sinatra and rails rails.

63
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,510
You might have heard of.

64
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,210
It's a bigger framework very popular in Ruby but it controls everything.

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,230
It's very strict.

66
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,340
Sinatra is much lighter weight meaning that you have more freedom to make decisions.

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,950
It's less opinionated which means that you can configure things how you want but also the advantage

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,930
of something like Rails is that you don't have to make decisions.

69
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,210
For example how to structure your files.

70
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,510
Where do I put my CSSA files in Rails.

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,840
You don't have a choice in Sinatra you have to decide.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,330
So with that said there are all these frameworks for node.

73
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,460
EXPRESS Is the top one here that we're going to use but there are other ones there's sales and Gedi

74
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,930
or two that I've used.

75
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,440
Khoa I don't know if trench coat or Kellaway is one that's becoming popular now.

76
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,240
A lot of people are using too.

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,150
So anyway I'm just trying to point out here that there are a bunch of frameworks just like when I said

78
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,450
we could have used any language to talk to my ass.

79
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,370
Well we could use any node framework to make a web app where it happening to use Express.

80
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,090
OK.

81
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,410
So the first thing I'd recommend here is to look at the documentation for Express.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,610
If you're curious if you haven't taken a course in it you're not familiar with it or you have never

83
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,940
worked with a web framework.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,130
The documentation is pretty straightforward if you click on getting started.

85
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,820
You don't have to go through all of it.

86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,180
But if we're actually going to do.

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,270
Hello world here's a simple app that we'll be making in just a moment but it has a nice can of walk

88
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,930
through using express how you write certain things with syntaxes and then there's a guide that much

89
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,640
more in depth.

90
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,920
And then there's a reference when you click on the API reference.

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,620
Make sure you're doing four point x.

92
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,210
The most recent and this is sort of like that.

93
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,860
Think of them I ask you all docs there's all these methods that we see over here and you can read about

94
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,670
them over here.

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,990
So we'll be referring back to these docs as we go through the course.

96
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,000
And for now that's where we'll leave off.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,470
All I wanted to do in this video is introduce express tell you that it's a node framework show you the

98
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,030
Web site the documentation.

99
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,290
Then in the next video we're going install it and create our own first application.

100
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,870
First web app.
