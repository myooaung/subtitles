WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.880
Get.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.060
So in this video we're just going to go over the solutions to the exercises I introduced in the previous

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
video and the first one here is to print the total number of books in the database.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:22.120
So we need to use count and all that we'll do is write a select count star from books just like that

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.420
and we get 19.

6
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.940
All right.

7
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.300
And that's it.

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.690
The next one is to print out how many books were released in each year.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:41.050
So we need to use a group by group by released here and then use count in conjunction with that.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:59.220
So let's do a select and we'll just do count Starr from books GROUP BY released here just like that.

11
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.300
Now on its own this isn't that useful so I'll go ahead and add in like you released here comma count

12
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.180
so that we get the released and then the count you can see most years have one book released 2001 has

13
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.590
three.

14
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.550
2003 has two.

15
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.390
All right.

16
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.220
So the next problem print out the total number of books in stock.

17
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.140
So this one you'll actually need to use some.

18
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.170
You'll need to sum all the stock quantities which is something I guess we haven't really used.

19
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.680
But it's nice fell from.

20
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.510
We haven't used stock.

21
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.280
Why can't you got a chill out.

22
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.500
It's a start.

23
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
Quantity is not a piece of data that we use very often but it is here.

24
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.230
We've tried to do it a little bit but it is there as you can see.

25
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.450
So we just want to add them all together and that's just going to be select some stock quantity quantity

26
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.520
from books as we go.

27
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.460
We have 2000 450 books in stock.

28
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.420
So the next problem here is to find the average release year for each author or so many to group by

29
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.970
author and then we need to use average Viji to calculate the average for this year.

30
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.150
So let's give it a shot average release year for each author.

31
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.290
So we need to do a select average and then release here.

32
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.250
From books group by and then we're grouping by author.

33
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.130
So we'll do l name Khama author f name again because of the Harris issue.

34
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.700
What are their names.

35
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.470
Dan Harrison free Harris.

36
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.570
OK so if we do that my cat again.

37
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.140
Oh boy.

38
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.120
Well we've taken care of that and I don't mean.

39
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.520
Wow.

40
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340
Apparently they have not taken care of it.

41
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.900
Right.

42
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.080
Hang on.

43
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.710
So back to the problem at hand.

44
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.090
This works.

45
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.340
We're getting average years.

46
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.520
But to make it a little bit better we should also add in the author name author Alvin I'm just so we

47
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.290
can make a bit more sense of the data.

48
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.290
So now we can see Raymond Carver's average release years 1985.

49
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.240
See Neil Gaiman's his 2006 point six six six seven.

50
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.390
All right.

51
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.390
So that's all there is to that problem.

52
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.810
Now we get to the one that's a little different.

53
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.610
Find the full name of the author who wrote the longest book.

54
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.370
So there's a couple ways of doing it the the way that doesn't qualify as a solution.

55
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.560
The two step process would be first to find the longest book.

56
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:18.530
So that would be select max pages from books like this 6:34 and then you know at this point we can make

57
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:28.660
a second query select and we want to concatenate first name and last name so we do concat author name

58
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.400
comma author L name and we want a space in between

59
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.040
that

60
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.490
from books where pages equals 6:34 and there we go we get Michael Chaplin.

61
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:56.310
However we want to do it in one step so we can either do the sub query route so do so like concat author.

62
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:06.480
However instead of we'll do from books but instead of just doing web pages 6:34 will do where pages

63
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.050
equals and then we use parentheses for the sub query.

64
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.660
Hopefully you remember this part and then in here all that we do is write our queries.

65
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:27.410
That's going to be select max pages from books and we get the same thing.

66
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.340
I go Siobhan and then there's the other way of going about it which is to not use Macs at all and circumvent

67
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.820
that which is actually faster to use order by and then limit it to one.

68
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.870
So we could do the same thing so I can cat author F. name author L name from books and then we just

69
00:05:49.870 --> 00:06:00.840
do an order by pages ascending limit one and they believe have that backwards.

70
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.990
We got the longest book not the shortest one area so we want it in descending order so that we get the

71
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.910
longest one at the beginning.

72
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.590
And that's going to be 6:34.

73
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:26.090
So if we if we get rid of this limit one and actually we get rid of limit 1 and let's do pages comma.

74
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.830
All right.

75
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.180
So you can see now you've got six thirty four all the way down to 176.

76
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.550
And I was I had it backwards.

77
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.280
OK.

78
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.400
So both are valid ways of getting a solution.

79
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.240
This one is a little bit.

80
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.310
Well it's a little faster because we're running one query.

81
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:54.610
This version is more complex more advanced I guess but I would definitely stick to using this when possible

82
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.430
using order right.

83
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.890
All right.

84
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.400
Let's move on to our final challenge here.

85
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.680
Make this happen.

86
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.490
So I've got a couple of things going on.

87
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.980
We've got a year so things let's see if we get Year number of books in that given year and the average

88
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.440
pages for all those books for that given year.

89
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.160
So things are grouped by year and we have three alias's going on.

90
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.060
OK so let's give it a shot.

91
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:29.860
So we'll start off by selecting year or released year and giving it the alias of year

92
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.740
and the next thing is the count.

93
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:41.370
Remember we're going to have a group by at the end so we're doing all of this you know writing the three

94
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.940
things we're selecting before we actually have the group by.

95
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.920
But at the end we're going to have group five at least here.

96
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:52.150
So this here number books is count to count the number of books released that year.

97
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.290
So all in debt and just do count star paths.

98
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.110
And I need quotes here because we have that Octa Thorpey I think is what that's called the hash symbol

99
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.260
as well as a space.

100
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.750
So we need quotes for Aliase if we want to match this then we have average pages.

101
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.120
So it's going to be the same thing as far as our alias is concerned.

102
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.170
So we need average number of pages as a Viji pages.

103
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.120
That's correct.

104
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.980
There we go OK from books.

105
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.510
And you know all and done this one to group by.

106
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.220
And we want to group by released here hit enter and pray.

107
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.100
And it looks like it worked out.

108
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.790
19:45 had one book 181 pages long.

109
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.690
Take a look at.

110
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:55.090
Like 2001 there were three books and the average number of pages is 443 and the third.

111
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.510
All right.

112
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.740
So that matches what I had here which means that we got it right.

113
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.670
Don't ask why you would do this.

114
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.410
Just don't ask.

115
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.230
That's it for this section and help us in the next section.
