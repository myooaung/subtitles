00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.290
So in the last video at the end I mentioned that we're about to move on to bigger and better operators.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.880
And this is the first of those it's called logical and you'll also see it as just two ampersands.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.440
So what it does it's sort of a step up in operators.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.690
It allows us to actually chain together multiple pieces of logical information multiple operators together

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.730
and basically it necessitates that all things are true all conditions are true.

6
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.120
Now that sounds like jibberish.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.400
So let's put it in practice let's see what I mean.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.610
So here's an example.

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Let's say I want to do something like this.

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.140
Select books written by Dave Eggers that are also published after the year 2010.

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.410
So individually these are each straightforward tasks a color coded them to show you select books written

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.090
by Dave Eggers.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.180
We know how to do that.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.350
We also know how to do select all books published after the year 2010 using greater than what we just

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.900
saw.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.730
However to put these together we need to use the logical.

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.680
And so here's the first part.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.460
It's like books written by Dave Eggers that look like this.

19
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.060
It's like start from books where author name equals Eggers and then just like books published after

20
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.630
the year 2010 will look like this.

21
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.950
Select star from books where release year is greater than 2010.

22
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.460
So to put them together we use and.

23
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.470
OK.

24
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.740
So as I mentioned we can either use the word or the text A&amp;E or to ampersands and it looks like this.

25
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.840
So Nexstar from books where author name equals Aggers and released here is greater than 2010.

26
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.090
And that's it.

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.340
So basically we just take the two where clauses and shove them together with the word and and what this

28
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.740
means is that both parts have to be true in order for it to be selected.

29
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.890
So it will start.

30
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.830
Well check this author's last name.

31
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.960
Eggers if it is then it will move on say OK.

32
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.410
And was it released after 2010.

33
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.540
If it wasn't then it discards it and it doesn't like it.

34
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.270
However if both parts are true then we see the results.

35
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.870
So let's try it.

36
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:24.100
OK so let's start off by selecting the title author Al name and released here working in this document.

37
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.380
We're going to copy and paste in but I'm just putting a record of it here to make it easier for me to

38
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.310
edit as I go through.

39
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.620
So select title author Al name and or at least year from books where and we're just checking where author

40
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.410
last name equals Aggers.

41
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.550
Just like that there's some in Colin and you can see we have these three hologram for the king the circle

42
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.500
and my favorite Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.

43
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.070
And then we have for least year.

44
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.690
So for some reason someone comes into our bookstore and says You know I really like Dave Eggers but

45
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.500
I only like his later stuff which I would disagree with.

46
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.720
I think his earlier stuff was better.

47
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.860
But let's say someone says that.

48
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.640
Well then we would do something like select.

49
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:19.090
And I'd like to just copy this and change the WHERE clause to where at least here is greater than 2010

50
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.480
which we already know how to do it should we review how this gives us all books released after 2010

51
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.160
and then to combine them is where we use the logical and and

52
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.380
release year greater than 2010.

53
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.370
OK.

54
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.060
So let's check that it works.

55
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.120
You can see we only get two results because both of these things have to match.

56
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.980
So author has to be exactly Aggers case insensitive and really here has to be greater than the year

57
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.400
2010.

58
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.580
And just to show you we can replace this with double ampersands and it works the exact same way.

59
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.480
There we go.

60
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.450
OK.

61
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.500
So that's the basics of and we'll use it all the time.

62
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.680
It's important when you I mean at any time you need to change together things if you're trying to you

63
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.050
know search based off of true to criteria.

64
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.720
So common example might be something like It's like star from products that say we work in a toy store

65
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.930
where Brand equals Lego.

66
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.540
But when you're on a store off online store often there's like an option that will say you know show

67
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.970
stock items or don't show out-of-stock items.

68
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:50.110
So we kid do you think behind the scenes like where brand is Lego and in-stock equals true.

69
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.110
That way we wouldn't be showing the customer any Lego products that are also out-of-stock which is frustrating

70
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.790
when you see that.

71
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.190
So that's a pretty common use cases when you're working with a value a boolean yes or no value like

72
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.720
in stock.

73
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.130
X is active user or something like that.

74
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.020
OK.

75
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.840
So the last thing that I'll address here is if we go back to the sort of problem set things like 1 less

76
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.130
than 5 but rather than just doing one on their own I'm going to give you a couple here we're going to

77
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.210
chain them together with and and I'll give you a first example here's one greater than five and seven

78
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.480
equal to nine.

79
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.200
So what does this whole thing evaluate to

80
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.860
remember both sides have to be true.

81
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.580
So let's take either side and take this one is one less than five.

82
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.340
Yes that is true.

83
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.450
Is 7 equal to 9.

84
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.280
No that's false.

85
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.550
And that immediately nullifies falsifies excuse me the entire thing.

86
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.860
Both sides have to be true just to double check.

87
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.050
Let's give it a shot.

88
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.030
Select and you can see zero force.

89
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.670
OK.

90
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.600
Just like before.

91
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.410
I mean take a moment fill out a couple of problems and hopefully you'll stick around and give them a

92
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.790
shot.

93
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.280
All right.

94
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.970
I'm back.

95
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.870
So I have three simple problems hopefully simple that I don't.

96
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.460
Go ahead give them a shot and I'll be back.

97
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.320
All right what you know.

98
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.020
I'm back.

99
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.060
So let's go over these quickly.

100
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.960
The first one.

101
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.800
Remember both sides have to be true.

102
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.580
So start with the first negative 10 greater than negative 20.

103
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.490
Is that true.

104
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.370
Yes.

105
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.780
It's larger than negative 20.

106
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.730
How about this.

107
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.120
Is zero less than or equal to zero.

108
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.830
Yes because zero is equal to zero.

109
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.110
Therefore we have true and true.

110
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.670
So this whole thing is true.

111
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.330
Let's try to Yep we get one.

112
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.940
OK.

113
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.900
Moving on we have.

114
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.780
Negative 40 less than or equal to zero.

115
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.210
And yes I know I had a negative sign here.

116
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.010
I apologize.

117
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.880
That was an accident.

118
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.140
That's wrong.

119
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.140
So hopefully you didn't spend too much time panicking about that is negative 40 less than or equal to

120
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.860
zero.

121
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.540
That's true.

122
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.940
It's smaller than zero.

123
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.830
And I use the English version A&amp;E 10 greater than 40.

124
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.470
Well that's actually false.

125
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.570
Which makes the whole thing false unfortunately.

126
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.070
So let's try it and we get zero which means false.

127
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.240
Finally it's 50 for less than or equal to 54.

128
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.040
That's true.

129
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.320
Fifty four is equal to 54 and is equal to a upper case.

130
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.810
Laura could say you cold upper case by now you should remember they are equivalent.

131
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.560
So there's true on both sides.

132
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.220
And we get true.

133
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.330
All right.

134
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.180
So the last thing I want to highlight about and is that we're not limited to just two components like

135
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.130
we saw here.

136
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.170
You know where author Al name is Eggers and released years graduate than 2010.

137
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.370
We could do three.

138
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.490
We could do 20 if we wanted to.

139
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.880
There's probably an upper limit at some point but typically if you're working with anything more than

140
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.770
really more than three there's there are other ways of doing it or you may need to change your table

141
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.410
structure which we'll get to when we talk about tables and more death and we talk about joints in particular.

142
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:30.360
But in this case I could do something like this where author last name is Aggers and release years 2010

143
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.360
and Title contains the word novel.

144
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.540
Don't ask why.

145
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.770
But let's say we have a needy customer who wants Dave Eggers book only likes his later work and wants

146
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:48.200
to be a novel and the way that she knows or he knows it's novel is that it contains the word novel in

147
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.000
the title.

148
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:58.830
Well if we go back to what we had here let's just copy this and duplicate it and add a nother condition.

149
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.330
I'll do them on separate lines now so I'll do ampersands for that one but then I'll do a and D for the

150
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:17.420
last condition which is title like and all that we want is present novel present semi-colon.

151
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.520
So let's try that and there we go.

152
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:27.520
We get a hologram for the King novel because OK first part author name is Aggers.

153
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.210
At least here is greater than 2010.

154
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.090
2012 is and Title contains the word novel so all three are met.
