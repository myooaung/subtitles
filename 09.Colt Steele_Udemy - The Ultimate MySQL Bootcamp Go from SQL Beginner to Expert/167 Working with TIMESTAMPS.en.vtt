00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.020
So this is the last bit of new content around dates and date times and times.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.200
I admit this section is a bit of a doozy or a pain or I don't know.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.590
Maybe not the most exciting thing.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
With that said this is a really important topic that we're going to discuss here.

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.540
And it's something that you'll be doing all the time or probably will be doing all the time.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.460
I do it all the time which is adding in time stamps to our tables.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.420
So when we say time stamps there's two things to unpack.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.640
One is that that's a generic term that just refers to storing information metadata about when something

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.630
is created or updated that that sort of a standardized name across programming languages or across just

11
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.900
in programming in general and app development time stamps for to basically saving information about

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.120
when you create a post or when you start when you insert something into a table.

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.410
However in my as well timestamped is also a data type.

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.090
So yes I know it's the last video on the section but I'm actually going to show you another data type

15
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.360
so hang in there.

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.400
Fortunately this data type is really simple and there's only one case that I recommend that you ever

17
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.380
use it.

18
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.290
OK.

19
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.660
So there's a page called The date date time and time stamp types are going to ignore date.

20
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.990
We've already talked about that.

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.300
Let's compare date time and time stamp.

22
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.150
They both do the same thing.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.370
They store date and time information but there's two differences.

24
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.120
If we read the description date time is used for values that contain both date and time parts.

25
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.610
Yes we know that the time stamp is used for values that contain both date and time parts as well.

26
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.390
So they're identical in that sense.

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.430
But the main difference comes down to the range of times that and date they support.

28
00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.950
So if we look at date time it goes back to year 1000 and all the way up to year nine thousand nine hundred

29
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.380
ninety nine time stamp on the other hand only goes back to 1970 and up to 2038.

30
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.610
So that's really important to note if you are working with something where you know you're storing dates

31
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.120
that may go back very far like if I'm trying to think of a good example but things before 1970 Certainly

32
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.460
you might have sites where you're storing a birth date and you might have users who are older than that

33
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.850
and they're born in the 60s or the 50s.

34
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.410
So time stamp would not work.

35
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.790
Same thing going forward if you're working with dates and date times where you need things to be further

36
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.260
into the future past 2038 then you're not going to want to use timestamps as well but for what we're

37
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.790
talking about just saving when something is created or when it's most recently updated we don't need

38
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.450
to worry about that being before 1970 or after 2038 because it's right now or when our app is up and

39
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.190
running.

40
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.680
You know now is relative.

41
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.680
But basically it's not going to be past 2038 and we're not changing those dates all that we're going

42
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.610
to do is store information.

43
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.660
So time stamp is a good data type to use there and you might be wondering why use it in the first place.

44
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.460
Why does it exist if there's already date time.

45
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.480
The answer like so many things in my school is that it just takes up less space.

46
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.390
I believe it's 4 bytes compared to eight for date time.

47
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.690
Or it might be.

48
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.600
It's a it's double to use date time compared to time stamp.

49
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.300
I believe it's four and eight.

50
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.060
So it's easier.

51
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.290
And if you're doing something you know every time you insert the thing into a row you are updating something

52
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.610
that four versus eight makes a difference.

53
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.100
If you're working with thousands and thousands or millions of records.

54
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.430
So now that we've got that out of the way just to summarize they use to store the same type of data.

55
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.550
This one is smaller timestamps take up less space but they have a more limited range.

56
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.640
So use date time for everything except for what we're about to show you.

57
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.560
OK.

58
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.490
So let's hop over to cloud 9 here we are.

59
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.000
And I have a simple schema going to create a table called comments comments.

60
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.760
It's very simple.

61
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.730
It has two fields the first row is called the first field is called content and it's just the content

62
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.460
of the comment.

63
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.340
You know things like Great article or I made a thousand dollars a week working from home learn how email

64
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.540
me or whatever spam comment there is and then this is the important part created it which is a time

65
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.990
stamp.

66
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.740
First thing to notice it could be Date Time.

67
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.670
Just want to make that clear you can do that.

68
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.430
It will work.

69
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.640
But we're using time stamp because this is basically what it's intended for and it's takes up less space.

70
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.360
So just setting the time stamp on its own is not that useful.

71
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.750
This is the key part.

72
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.240
Setting the default value to be now.

73
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.170
So whenever it's created take that now that current time and put it in time stamp.

74
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:16.500
So if we run this schema right now and we insert a few things so let's do insert into comments.

75
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.570
All we need to insert is content and what we'll do is just insert our first one.

76
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.060
We're going to do them separately so that they have different time stamps.

77
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.470
So the first one will be L-O.

78
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.500
What a funny article something silly like that.

79
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.010
Then let's do another one.

80
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.180
Like

81
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.820
I found this offensive.

82
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.890
OK.

83
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.090
So now if we do so like star from comments you can see as well.

84
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.480
What a funny article created at Artie Feldon automatically today's date the time 36 seconds compared

85
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.020
that to.

86
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.370
I found this offensive.

87
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.960
Same date same time until we hit second.

88
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.400
It was created 10 seconds later.

89
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.270
So that's created at.

90
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.780
And of course that's really useful.

91
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.550
I would show you how to sort them.

92
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.390
However they're already sorted here.

93
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.110
As you can see because the order I'm putting in or putting them in is sorting them.

94
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.180
But let me just try one more.

95
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.190
Let's do just some jibberish.

96
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.180
Select them all.

97
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.110
Now you can do things like order by created at.

98
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
And now we'll order them.

99
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.190
Basically the way they're ordered now.

100
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.670
But we can reverse that

101
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.230
change it to descending.

102
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.490
Now we have the most recent comments up top.

103
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.120
So that's created at using default.

104
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.480
Now along with time stamp but what if we also wanted to store any time a field was changed.

105
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.380
There's an easy way to do that as well.

106
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.700
Just scroll down.

107
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.940
Magically hidden here.

108
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.090
So I sort of calling it created that I made a new field called changed at and the first part is the

109
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.440
same sets.

110
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.830
It's a time stamp and it sets a default value to be.

111
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.020
Now then we get this on update which you haven't seen before.

112
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.740
And frankly this is really the only time I ever use it.

113
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.540
I don't know trying to think if I ever use another capacity.

114
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.630
Pretty much this is the only way I've seen it used on update current time stamp.

115
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:36.740
So what this is saying is that when the row is changed so if content is changed then update changed

116
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.060
that to be the current time stamp.

117
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.510
So we could put something different yet we can put three although that's a problem because it's not

118
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.250
a time stamp.

119
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.140
But if we made this an and I could do something ridiculous like this.

120
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.160
And every time that comments a row is updated it will change.

121
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.890
Change that to be the number three.

122
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.040
But there's no reason to do that whatsoever so I walked.

123
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.460
So if we run this I called it comments too.

124
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.500
By the way I'm not pointing that out because I think it's original but just so they are aware.

125
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.630
It's a different table if I.

126
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.690
Now let me just use the same comments that I've already run.

127
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.510
And just change it to be inserted to comments to.

128
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.220
Here's the first one.

129
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.460
And our next one will be just.

130
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.640
Ello ello ello.

131
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:35.150
Well OK and now we do is select a star from comments to.

132
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.350
He is the change that it's filled in.

133
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:48.200
Because we created them and let's just do one more this time will be I like cats and dogs just to please

134
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.380
everybody.

135
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:56.630
Unless you're a bird person I guess or you hate animals so they're ordered by default because this is

136
00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.380
how we added them and there's no other way that they would be ordered.

137
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.150
But let's try updating one.

138
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.200
OK.

139
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.330
So let's update this jibberish here to say something else.

140
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.430
It's been a while since we've done an update but hopefully remember.

141
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:22.650
So we're going to want to update comments to set content equal to and let's say this is not gibberish.

142
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.020
Something like that.

143
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.560
And then you need to specify where content is currently.

144
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.330
This mess of jibberish.

145
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.430
OK.

146
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.240
So if I update that.

147
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:42.750
Notice what you had before 20 30 18 days not going to change 2038.

148
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:49.490
Now if I do a like star it's changed to 2033 0 to.

149
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.800
And so now if we order things by

150
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.180
what we call it changed at.

151
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.140
You'll see we now have a new order.

152
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.780
And so that's really important to take note of is that if you want to not only track when something

153
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:12.570
is created but when it was updated you can use this set up here so we have time stamped default.

154
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.550
Now on Update Oh one thing you didn't talk about current time stamp.

155
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.200
You could also put.

156
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.770
Now here the reason I didn't it's just to show you you can also use current time stamp.

157
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.500
It's just another shortcut.

158
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.870
I prefer to use now just because it's like I said a couple of times short simple easy to remember but

159
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.930
current time stamp does exact same thing in this case.

160
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.680
OK.

161
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:41.340
So this is something a bit of a recipe that will probably return to is worth knowing you'll see me use

162
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.630
it as we go in the scores and some of the other schemas that we create.

163
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.330
Things get more complex.

164
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.340
It's important it's useful to store that metadata about when things are created or when they're updated.

165
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.150
OK we're done.
