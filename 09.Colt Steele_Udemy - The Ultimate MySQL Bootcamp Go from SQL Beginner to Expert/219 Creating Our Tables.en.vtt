1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.510
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.660
So let's hop over to cloud 9 and we'll start simple.

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's work with the reviewers tables.

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.080
The simplest one.

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.930
So we're going to implement that first.

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.240
So we'll go over here and just to be totally transparent.

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.830
I created a new database just so we have a fresh place to work.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.280
You don't have to do that as long as you don't already have tables named series reviewers and reviews.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.960
If you do you may want to make a new database.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.950
So I'm working on one called something ridiculous and stupid that I probably will regret.

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.240
TV review app.

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.590
Not too bad.

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:59.350
So we're going to start off by creating a table which you're going to call reviewers work with.

14
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:09.290
So we'll start off by creating our table which we'll call reviewers and reviewers only has three things

15
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:20.370
Id first name and last name so we'll start off with ID and first name and last name and we know ID needs

16
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.920
to be an ant that should be familiar by now.

17
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.780
Autoincrement primary key first name will just be char 100 and same thing for last name.

18
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.640
So pretty straightforward table to start with.

19
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.750
For reviewers the next thing that will move on to before we insert things that actually get our tables

20
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.540
going.

21
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.470
So all tables first and then insert data.

22
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.370
So next up will do series ID.

23
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.050
Title released here and genre.

24
00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.770
So create table series and inside here will have an ID which will be exactly the same.

25
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.330
Autoincrement primary key and primary keys are especially important because we're going to use them

26
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.650
as foreign keys in the reviews table and we need to have valid rows that were pointing back to.

27
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.690
We need to make sure whatever the series idea is here that it's actually a series in our database.

28
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.670
It's not pointing to some non-existent show or non-existent reviewer in the case of reviewer ID.

29
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.510
OK.

30
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.780
So the next thing is the title of the series which we'll just make of our char

31
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.480
and then once we do that we'll move on to release date or release year in our case and we have a couple

32
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.220
of options for the data type here so we could make it a date.

33
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.530
But all we want is the year and a date has this kind of format where we have the year and then the months

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.540
and then you know and so on which we don't care about.

35
00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.660
So we could make it an aunt and that would work but then potentially someone could accidentally insert

36
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.890
something with a release year of like 10000 or 9 9 9 9 9 9 which is not a valid year.

37
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.330
So there's actually another data type that we can work with which I haven't shown you.

38
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.000
It's just called year and year for it will be a four digit year like 1999 or 2004.

39
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.170
There used to be a year to type but I believe it's been deprecated now.

40
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.100
So we'll work with year four.

41
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.710
That's not the point of this lecture so don't let that hang you up.

42
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.830
I just want to show you that it exists.

43
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.120
So we have that and then the next thing that we have is genre and genre will just be of our char as

44
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.940
well.

45
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.260
OK.

46
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.740
So we have those two tables.

47
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.720
Now let's actually start with those and let's make sure that they work.

48
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.120
Those are first one.

49
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.080
And here's our second series.

50
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.370
Great.

51
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.710
Now what I'm going to do is actually insert some data will come back to reviews in a moment.

52
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.560
So I have a bunch of series data here you can of course copy and pasted from the Including the included

53
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.370
code which is what I recommend you doing because this took forever to type although it's not as bad.

54
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.170
Give you a preview of what our reviews data looks like.

55
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.070
That was a pain to type so this isn't as bad but we've got shows most of them are shows that I picked

56
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.640
because I like but I also picked some because I didn't like them.

57
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.160
So we have some variation in the ratings in particular I want to make sure that our data was realistic

58
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.470
and not everything was a 9.0.

59
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.640
So I'm just going to copy this over put it in this file so we have a record of it and I'm going to insert

60
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.470
it and make sure it works OK.

61
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.850
So that was 14 series who just inserted and I'll do the same thing for reviewers and they have seven

62
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.490
here.

63
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.100
But that's plenty.

64
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.580
And we'll paste it in.

65
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.940
Now let's make sure it works.

66
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.280
Let's do a select star from series to start.

67
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.780
You can see that make this a bit bigger.

68
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.170
Here's all of our series Archer Arrested Development.

69
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.670
Bob's Burgers all the way down.

70
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.680
We've got animation comedy and dramas.

71
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.520
And then let's do a select star from reviewers and we've got seven of them.

72
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.310
Totally random names except I did put myself in there purely so that I could review my own movie my

73
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.590
own shows that I'd like everyone else has fictional just totally made up reviews but the ones that I

74
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.170
put in there are relatively accurate to my personal TV tastes.

75
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.170
OK.

76
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.680
So then that leaves us with having to now implement the reviews table which we left for last because

77
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.700
for one thing it depends on these two tables.

78
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.480
And it's also a little bit more complicated.

79
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.840
So let's get started.

80
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.310
Scroll back up what I like to do all of our kind of schema code up top to create table.

81
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.430
And this is revues and the first part's easy and easy enough.

82
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:13.420
We'll have an ID which is an auto increment primary key and then the next part's pretty simple to which

83
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.670
is rating.

84
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.250
Now what data type Do we want rating to be.

85
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.540
If we look at the examples I've given you we have eight point nine nine point five.

86
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.010
So we could have just done an integer that would work.

87
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.000
But that's not the way that we were going to go here because we want decimals after it.

88
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.350
So we could have just you know only allowed whole numbers from 1 to 10.

89
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.670
But instead we're going to do sort of like I am D-B does where they have a decimal system and our maximum

90
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.440
rating will be nine point nine.

91
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.220
So zero to nine point nine.

92
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.390
So that's going to be a decimal.

93
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.520
And if you think back to the section on data types there are two things you pass into the decimal.

94
00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.940
The first is the total number of digits we want allowed which is just too because we only want things

95
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.150
like four point four.

96
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.380
We don't want forty three point four.

97
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.450
We don't want nine nine point nine.

98
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.730
And then the second is how many things or how many numbers after the decimal place.

99
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.690
We just want one.

100
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:22.200
So that will give us two total numbers like 9.9 or 5.6 something like that.

101
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.910
So that's all we need there.

102
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:32.610
Now we get to go back series ID and reviewer ID so both of the both of those will just be integers.

103
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.990
So we'll just start with that series ideas an ENT and reviewer.

104
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:44.230
ID is an ENT as well but of course we're not done because now we need to explicitly say that they are

105
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.660
foreign keys.

106
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:51.970
Remember from the last section you don't have to do that but it's a really smart thing to do to enforce

107
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.390
that when you insert a review.

108
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.840
It actually corresponds to a valid series and valid review.

109
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.670
So the syntax for this.

110
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.970
It's been a little bit but it's foreign key.

111
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.540
And then we tell it will work with series ID first.

112
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:14.860
So we're saying okay this field series ID is a foreign key references and what is it referencing the

113
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.880
series table and what field the ID field.

114
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.640
So just like that and then we'll do the same thing.

115
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:33.340
But this time we're saying this reviewer ID field right here is a foreign key references the reviewer

116
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.530
table peer the ID field there.

117
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.770
Oops there we go.

118
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:49.100
So make sure we have commas in the right places and our semi-colon at the end and then see if it works.

119
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.870
So there is a mistake in this code.

120
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.830
I've already gone back and edited this but I kept this in here because it's a mistake that I think is

121
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.610
pretty common and it's a little tough to spot.

122
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.820
If you look at maybe you already spotted it but if you look at the result of the error I get it says

123
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.080
can't create table.

124
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.640
It's really not very useful but what's happening here.

125
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:18.510
Typically if we get an error like that has something to do with foreign keys here and the main thing.

126
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.430
Remember that these are referencing external tables.

127
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.940
So we have a series table but we don't have a reviewer singular table.

128
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.780
It's reviewers.

129
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.450
So I end up doing that quite often I see some of my students do that often as well because sometimes

130
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:40.480
you just talk about the things and singular We have review were ID versus review ID here it's very easy

131
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.710
to mess that up.

132
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.760
So now hopefully should work just fine.

133
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.290
And it appears to.

134
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.180
OK.

135
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.410
So we still don't have any data in there.

136
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.950
The last thing that we'll do is copy and paste this monster.

137
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.560
All these are views.

138
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.550
This is like an hour to try and get this with some realistic data.

139
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.450
So I want to add numbers that accurately relatively accurately reflected the quality of shows.

140
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:14.740
Now you may disagree with it but copy this in definitely don't waste time typing this yourself.

141
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.730
Copy it from the code that I've provided and paste it.

142
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.660
So now we should be good to go.

143
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.090
I'm just going to add this in here so we have a record of it.

144
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.780
And just to double check that everything worked.

145
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.690
We're just going to select start from reviews and we'll leave it at that.

146
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.550
So as long as we see our data in here.

147
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.490
Notice how difficult it is to understand what does any of this really mean.

148
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.030
At the moment nothing unless you happen to know you have memorized the different IDs for series and

149
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.170
for reviewers.

150
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.050
So that was preparing our data creating our schema and inserting our sample data.

151
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.400
Next up we're going to start working with it.
