00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.770
So we're moving onto the R of crud which is read.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.430
How do we retrieve and search data from a database.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.460
And we've actually already seen this the magic command is select.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.080
So remember when we were doing this earlier select a star from cats I told you not to worry about it

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.060
too much because we'd spend more time on it and it was really just something that we needed to have

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
to check our work at the at that time when we were inserting data but we didn't actually talk about

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.000
how it works what the star means.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.910
That's what we're going to do now.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.540
So the star in select star from cats me and give me all the columns in the cats table.

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.790
So we're asking for the cats table.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.200
That's the from cats.

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.840
And in that table we just want everything that we have.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.890
So in our case that means cat Heidi name age and breed we want all of them coming back to us.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.140
So let's do that now.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.320
Select a star from cats.

16
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.380
You can see we get cat ID name breed and age.

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.530
And we also get every single cat.

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.510
No one is missing.

19
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.700
These are the seven that we inserted.

20
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.540
So that's the basics of select star which you'll use often just to check things out.

21
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.410
But we can also get more specific about what data we want back which is where the select expression

22
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.270
comes in.

23
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.000
Basically there's a way for us to specify what columns we want in particular I only want the ID or I

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.220
only want cats names and age but not the breed.

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.420
So to do that rather than saying select star we can do things like select name from cats and if we do

26
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.570
that select name from cats What do you think the table will look like.

27
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.750
Looks like this.

28
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.720
We only get name so it gives us all seven names but nothing else.

29
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.480
We could also do select age from cats.

30
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.420
And hopefully this is what you expected.

31
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.830
We just get a bunch of ages and just to hammer it home here we can also do a select let's do cat ID

32
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.480
from cats and we get one two three four five six seven.

33
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.420
OK.

34
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.290
So that's useful enough but oftentimes we want more than one piece of data but we don't want everything.

35
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.420
And that's where this comma separated post comes in.

36
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.170
So this whole thing is the select expression where saying select name and age from cat so we can try

37
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.320
it.

38
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.630
Now select name comma age from cats.

39
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.580
And what do you think we'll see.

40
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.680
So we get a table with name and age returned back.

41
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.620
So there's no limit on that we could do name age comma cat ID common breed which would be the same thing.

42
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.630
So like star we could do name age and breed or cat ID and name and age and so on I think you get it.

43
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.310
We can mix and match whatever fields we want back.

44
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.670
So just to illustrate my point let's do a select cat Heidi common name comma age from cats and we hit

45
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.360
enter and we get those three fields.

46
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.310
Notice we're missing breed but we could just go at that and if we wanted

47
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.380
and noticed that the order matters.

48
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.040
So I said can I do the name then age then breed.

49
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.690
And that's what we get.

50
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.500
But if I just did a select star

51
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.080
it uses the default order which is cat ID name breed and then age which is just how we entered it when

52
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.650
we created the table so we could reverse it if I wanted to I select age then breed then name it then

53
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.850
Cat ID from cats.

54
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.320
And there we go.

55
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.030
OK.

56
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.380
So that's pretty much all there is to this select expression for now at least where we're just specifying

57
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.930
exactly which columns we want or we can default and use the star which will give us all columns.
