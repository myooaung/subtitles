00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.850
Already.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.040
So we inserted 500 users it was kind of a behemoth of a section to get there.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.270
Lots of ground to cover.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.430
But now that we're there are back in our comfort zone hopefully we're going to have a couple of exercises.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.370
I know we have a lot of them but this is cool.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.490
We have a lot of data now where it was you know a single you hit the return key once and you got 500

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.360
users.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.520
Much easier than having to copy and paste like 20 books.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.610
So we're going to play around with them.

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.020
And again your data is randomized just like mine.

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.670
So your tables and your results will look different but the queries will work the same.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.350
So here's the first thing.

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.830
Find the earliest date that a user joined and all we need to see is the date.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.690
And also notice how I formatted it.

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.940
Pay attention to that.

16
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.840
It's just the earliest date and then the next problem find the email of the earliest user.

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.090
Now this one's tricky.

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.950
Remember how I talked about this with min and max way back a couple I don't know five six hours ago

19
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.650
about how when you use min and max you do just get the min you don't get the row itself.

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.180
So we had to use a set query.

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.840
So the hint is use this query to find the email that corresponds to the earliest user.

22
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.620
Then take all the users and I want to see a table where we have a month name and then the number of

23
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.970
users joined who joined in that month.

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.110
So it doesn't matter what year we have some 20 16 some 20 17 most likely.

25
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.220
So we're not grouping by that just by the month.

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.710
So you have to figure out how you extract the month name from the date and then go from there.

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.160
Also notice the order count the number of e-mails or the number of users with Yahoo emails and the way

28
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.260
that you can determine that it's just if their email ends with AT yahoo DOT com.

29
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.270
So how do you do that.

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.170
Count them all.

31
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.900
And then finally calculate the total number of users for each email host and this one's a little bit

32
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.800
complicated because you're basically going to be doing four different checks or to say all right does

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.860
that email end with Gmail.

34
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.850
Does it end with Yahoo.

35
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.830
Does it end with hotmail and then you need to calculate how many each end with these.

36
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.740
So it's a little bit complicated.

37
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.340
That's why I left it for last.

38
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.420
Hopefully you're able to get it.

39
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.120
If not solutions coming up next video.

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.300
Just remember your data is going to look different.

41
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.510
Don't panic if your numbers are different.

42
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.830
All right.

43
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.850
I'll see you with a solution.
