00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.110
All right you've got one more video here.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.370
And this has to do with managing triggers which sounds a bit like a chapter in a self-help book but

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.280
really it has to do with how we make sure our triggers are working and mainly delete them.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.370
So this is where the name of our trigger comes into play.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.650
And then also I'll end with a quick warning about triggers.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
So the first thing that we can do is just list the triggers that exist in a database so we can just

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.440
use show triggers to see what we have going on.

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.890
And I'll warn you this is not my warning.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.330
I already talked about it but I'll warn you that what you get when you run this is kind of a mess to

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.100
look at.

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.200
But we can see we have in our Instagram data we have to triggers prevent cell follows.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.440
And then you can actually see the code inside of that trigger.

13
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.740
And then we have capture unfollow and you can see that code as well.

14
00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:03.590
And if I switched over to the other database I believe it was use trigger demo and I do show triggers.

15
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.760
We have one here.

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130
This is our must be adult.

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.010
All right.

18
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.290
So we have that I'll switch back to my Instagram clone.

19
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.600
OK.

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600
And do our show triggers just to make sure they're still there.

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460
They shouldn't go anywhere anyways.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.060
But we've got two of them.

23
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.640
So that's pretty much it to listing them.

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.520
Moving on.

25
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
So if I want to remove a trigger it's pretty simple.

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.040
It's drop trigger and then the trigger name.

27
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.660
So let's go back.

28
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.850
Let's say I want to remove this prevent cell follows.

29
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.660
I want to allow users to follow themselves.

30
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.290
So I want to get rid of that.

31
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.820
I'll just copy the name just so I don't have to type it.

32
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.340
And we just do drop trigger pre-event cell follows.

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840
And if we do our show triggers again it's gone.

34
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.110
And just to verify that it works it's not just the leading trigger from show triggers lets try and trigger

35
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.060
it if you will with something that would have caused a problem or thrown an error in the past.

36
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.710
So insert into follows and we have follow word I.D. come follow me.

37
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.900
This is the worst part

38
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.320
values.

39
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.960
Let's Insearch one thing where they're the same.

40
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.550
How about seven and seven.

41
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.910
No problem.

42
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.720
So in the past that would have been a problem because that trigger but it's now gone.

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.490
OK.

44
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.460
So that's really all there is to managing triggers or at least all that I'm going to talk about here.

45
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.020
We can look at them using show and we can delete them using dropping trigger.

46
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.520
So that brings me to the last thing that I warned you about which is I wanted to just briefly address

47
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.120
a potential pickup with triggers.

48
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.040
This is kind of a concern that a lot of developers have and it has to do with debugging code debugging

49
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.640
applications that make use of triggers in your database.

50
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.190
So imagine that you're a developer on a team with a bunch of people and something's not working how

51
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.270
you expect it to.

52
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.260
Let's say when you insert something into a table you realize that actually two items are being created

53
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.460
for some reason and you have no idea why.

54
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.310
And you might think OK maybe that something happening on my side of the application maybe that's my

55
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.860
code that's that something is wrong you know with our logic on the front end with our let's say Objective

56
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.850
C code and you could scour that forever but you would actually never get to the core of the problem

57
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.260
if it was because of a trigger and triggers are kind of stealth little bugs waiting to happen because

58
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.780
you have no way of identifying that something is happening because of a trigger.

59
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.650
It happens kind of behind the scenes like remember.

60
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.570
Go back here with our unfollow if I can go find that way back here.

61
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.820
Oh boy where is that.

62
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.180
Here we go.

63
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.770
Here we had ninety nine entries created automatically when all they did was run a single line of sequel

64
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.360
to actually delete things and ended up creating 99 things.

65
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.830
Now we knew that was going to happen.

66
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.670
But if you have a bunch of triggers and somebody doesn't know about I'm on team or you forget about

67
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.710
them it can make things difficult to debug because it's basically magic happening behind the scenes

68
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.030
things that are hidden.

69
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.030
Typically you know when you're debugging your code is up in front of you you can see where the problems

70
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.810
are happening.

71
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.960
So triggers cause problems sometimes because of that and the other thing I would say is that some people

72
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.970
have a tendency to chain triggers together.

73
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.320
So with unfollowed example you could have another event trigger.

74
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.290
So let's say here were one follow is deleted.

75
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.110
We're inserting into an follows.

76
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.790
We could have another trigger for when something is inserted into unfollowed to do something else.

77
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.460
And you can chain them together and there's actually situations where believe it or not that actually

78
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.900
makes sense but it's kind of frowned upon by a lot of people.

79
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.640
So just be conscientious if you're using a lot of triggers.

80
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.180
Typically there's a better way of doing it without having to make use of triggers.

81
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.310
And if there's not then you know that it's a good use case for triggers.

82
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.320
I'm not saying you should never use them.

83
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.370
By all means they're very useful.

84
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.910
It's just that you should be conscientious about them and try and find ways to not use them.

85
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.360
OK.

86
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.440
So to wrap that up.

87
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.500
Just be aware that triggers can make debugging more difficult more problematic because stuff happens

88
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.320
behind the scenes.

89
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.720
It's not explicit when something happens.

90
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.280
And then also be aware that too many triggers can often be a problem and you want to avoid triggers

91
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.070
as much as you can.

92
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.350
Not at all costs or anything I'm not saying they're bad.

93
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.640
Just be careful with them.

94
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.120
All right.

95
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.610
So that answer some of your questions about triggers.

96
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.200
Hopefully you can see the utility in them and I know a lot of people are asking about preventing people

97
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.410
from following themselves.

98
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.680
So if nothing else hopefully it's nice to see that how you can actually prevent people from following

99
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.720
their stuff.

100
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.310
All right.
