WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.050
So we're back if you watch that optional kind of boring video.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.850
We're now moving on to an exciting and non-optional video which is all about the project we're going

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.410
to make.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.400
So we're going to build a simple web app to start using node and my Eskew all together.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.780
So what is this app.

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.790
Well it is called join us and it's a cult mailing or excuse me a startup mailing list application.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.320
So it's you probably seen this before when there's a new company that's launched maybe you haven't but

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.820
if there's a new company that's launched they're not quite ready yet but they want to get their name

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.950
out there they want to start getting interested parties registered or collecting their information so

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.590
they can send updates or so they can invite them you know once the application is launched.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.840
So that's what we're going to build basically a way of collecting people's emails and it looks like

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.690
this.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.860
Now I'm not you know a great designer.

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.910
And anyway that's not the focus of this course.

16
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.980
Hopefully you think it looks ok enough.

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.050
But really what I just want to go over are the different features.

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.740
Now it's very feature rich.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.550
The point is to make it simple but to show you how the we're connecting with my Q Well through Noad

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.520
and how this application kind of showcases both selecting information and inserting information.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.930
So the first thing you'll see there is a photo here.

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.730
And we don't have to worry about copyright or licensing issues.

23
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
I actually took this photo as a bit of a brag I guess.

24
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.090
Sorry but back to the content here we've got.

25
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.720
Join us in big letters and then we've got into your e-mail to join.

26
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.630
And then a number here and this number changes so 518 is basically the count of all the users currently

27
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.320
in our database.

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.330
So when I made kind of this but what we call this the alpha version that I made screenshots of that

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.730
I'm I made before.

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.370
You know I have to make that up before I teach it.

31
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.500
So when I made this version I had 518 users in the in the waitlist in the database.

32
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.340
We are 100 percent not tickled.

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.290
Then the other thing is this.

34
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.430
Enter your email join now button which you enter an email.

35
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.020
It's going to take that e-mail address and insert it into our database.

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.990
So there's kind of two things we're doing right selecting.

37
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250
We're going to count how many users are in the database.

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.430
We don't need all the information we don't need.

39
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.210
518 email addresses.

40
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.460
We just want to know how many.

41
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.270
And then we want to be able to insert something from a form when you click this button.

42
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.810
It's going to go send the data to our node server than the node server is going to send it over to the

43
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.010
My School database.

44
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.750
Wait to see if it worked or not.

45
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.850
And then it will do something you know.

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.970
We'll decide what it does.

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.880
Does it take you to a new page or is it just refresh the page does it show you a message that says you're

48
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.800
signed up.

49
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.680
Whatever does.

50
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.430
But the key really is about adding information to our database and getting information out.

51
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.240
OK so that's how it basically works.

52
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.230
Let me show it to you.

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.130
Here I am.

54
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.910
I've got.

55
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.020
Join us.

56
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.610
Let's create a new user here.

57
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.730
Let's call it.

58
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.360
How about Lou the cat at gmail dot com.

59
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.770
We click Join now.

60
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.640
And you can see takes us back which we can decide what to do if we want to change that will I'll show

61
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.290
you how.

62
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.790
But now it says we've got it 519 on our waitlist.

63
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.180
And you know I can refresh I can stop the server which will see you in a little bit.

64
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.990
This will be 519.

65
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.730
This isn't hard coded in.

66
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.030
This is coming straight from the database.

67
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.510
OK.

68
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.030
So that's it.

69
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.820
Now let's talk about how it works what's the workflow like when I go on my computer like I just did

70
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.910
and I refresh the page or I enter that address and I hit enter.

71
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.460
A request is sent to our node server which will see how it is set up in a little bit.

72
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.890
And the no js server has code that says oh OK this client is asking for our home page.

73
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.420
Well on the home page we're supposed to have a number here of the total number of users in our database.

74
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:07.660
So let's ask hello my ask you all database can you tell me how many users are in the database and hopefully

75
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.660
you're aware that would be a count.

76
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.770
So would do a select count start from users that will come back and it will say ideally 518 or whatever

77
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.360
it is a thousand users.

78
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.510
And then my server the code there takes that number and it plugs it in puts it right here and it sends

79
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.000
us the page sends it back and I see the page.

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.660
Same thing roughly the same thing happens when I enter my email and they click Join now I'm sending

81
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.470
my information my e-mail to the no server with a message basically saying I want to add this.

82
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.420
I'm signing up.

83
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.500
So then my server says Oh this time this person is trying to sign up.

84
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.470
They're not just asking for the home page they're trying to sign up.

85
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.140
OK.

86
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.590
My ask.

87
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.880
Well I'd like to insert this user within with this e-mail address then my ask.

88
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.790
Well we'll say that worked or oh we actually already have a user with that e-mail so we can do that

89
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.370
or something else maybe there's an error that will be sent back.

90
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.390
No jast figures out what to do.

91
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.110
Do I send an error message or do I send a congratulations success message.

92
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.970
Do I just take them back to the home page and refresh it.

93
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.690
That's you know the decisions that are made here.

94
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.070
So that's the basics.

95
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.150
But then the next thing is where do we start.

96
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.100
There's a lot of pieces here right.

97
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.260
We have to talk about no genius installing that we have to talk about how it communicates with my ass.

98
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.100
Q Well we have to talk about creating web apps and HDMI and CSSA and Javascript.

99
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.890
All of this stuff there's a lot of moving pieces.

100
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.910
So where do we start.

101
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.100
Well we're starting with this handy dandy green box will draw your attention to the right side of the

102
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.870
screen which tells you we're starting basically with the relationship between no genius and my s.

103
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.560
Q Well how do we talk from javascript to my ask you up.

104
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.660
So we're going to start with basic things like I want to select the current date from javascript or

105
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.600
I want to insert a single user into my s queue up so no web app.

106
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.680
This whole left side of the screen will be gone for the first part but then once we have this relationship

107
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.570
established we figured out how to insert a user we figured out how to select all users or select the

108
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.380
count.

109
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.160
Then we will then kind of expand into the web application and add in the logic for creating a web app.

110
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.580
So that's our game plan we're with this site.

111
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.120
So the very last thing to discuss is what our table will look like.

112
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.330
So for this web app very simple right all that we need to store for every user and we'll just call it

113
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:42.460
users we could call it you know emails or interested people or whatever weightlifters but we'll go with

114
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.670
users and all we need to store is their email address right.

115
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.820
That's the key thing and that's all they're entering.

116
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.360
But it's also would be really useful to store created ads.

117
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:59.410
So we have a time stamps for when that user was created so that we could do things like figure out when

118
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.870
most of our users signed up or what day that week most users are signing up or just count how many users

119
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.660
we've had.

120
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.300
You know this year compared to last year.

121
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.550
So it's really nice to have created that is very simple as well.

122
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.240
So those are the two fields we'll be working with the two columns and that's it.

123
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.310
Nice and simple.

124
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.080
And then the other thing to discuss is our game plan from here on out and our first goal.

125
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.070
We talked about how we're only working with this side of the table or of this diagram what we're going

126
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:33.940
to work up to is using Noj as to randomly generate an answered over 500 users into our database.

127
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.700
So I had five 518 users in there.

128
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.800
They all had unique emails.

129
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.640
I did not code those by hand.

130
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.070
I used a tool that generates some for me and then I'm going to take that and insert them into our database.

131
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:53.230
So basically shows you the power of using a language like node that we can very very quickly generate

132
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.310
data and not have to waste time getting 500 test users in there.

133
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.230
So that's the first goal we're working up towards.

134
00:07:59.230 --> 00:07:59.920
In this section.
