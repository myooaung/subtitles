00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.510
A welcome back.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.320
So this section is a big one.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.980
Really exciting stuff.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.550
I mean exciting is relative.

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.850
We are you know talking about databases but I do have a party here to celebrate.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.350
Yeah.

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.590
So let's see what are we talking about here.

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.980
This course has been out so far all about data in basically one table at a time kind of self-contained

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.150
basic data and nothing all that exciting and nothing very complex no data that is related but of course

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.540
in the real world all of our data or almost all of it is related.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.160
We don't have books on a web site without also having things like reviews and customers.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.860
And I don't know if shopping carts.

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.640
We don't have cars on their own.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.650
We might have cars in our database but then we might have salesmen and dealerships and all the other

15
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.820
things that go along with it.

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.930
Or like an Instagram you don't have just photos.

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.700
We have users photos comments tags likes followings relationships.

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880
All this stuff that's related.

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.880
So this is a turning point where we well one of the touring turning points are we start to work with

20
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.170
most pool tables that are connected.

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.370
So we're going to talk about how data is related and then how to implement those relations using multiple

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.400
tables and some of the buzzwords some of the big things we're talking about here are Joines foreign

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.310
keys and primary keys which you've kind of seen before one to one one to many many to many relationships

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.680
lots of stuff.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.290
But like I said this is the first of a couple sections focusing on related data and the other thing

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.260
that you may want to celebrate is that we are done with our books done with the books data.

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.660
You can totally go burn the books if you like throw them off a cliff.

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.330
We're done with that.

29
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.500
We're moving on to bigger and better things inching closer to our Instagram data at the end of the course.

30
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
OK.

31
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310
Have fun don't forget your party hat because I didn't.
