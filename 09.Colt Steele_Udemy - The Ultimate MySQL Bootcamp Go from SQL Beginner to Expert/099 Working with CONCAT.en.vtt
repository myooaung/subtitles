1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.490
All right.

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.930
So we have that out of the way we've seen how to run files using the source command.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.100
And then we actually did that with the sample data that I gave you.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.910
Now we are actually dive into the meat section which is all about string functions.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.250
And the first thing I want to show you is that if you go to Google and we type in my as well string

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.870
functions as string functions excuse that and we hit enter here.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990
You can see I've already clicked on this link.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.800
The Maia's well and reference manual string functions.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.870
I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the documentation of my ask.

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.420
Well for one thing I think it's kind of ugly and looks dated but it does have all of the information

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.260
you need.

12
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.300
I just don't really like how it's presented but if you look at this giant list here these are all string

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
functions that we can use and a lot of them are very very specific.

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.810
I'm going to show you some of the more.

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.640
Well first of all the useful ones and then a couple just fun ones and that will be able to be combined

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.750
together for some good exercises but we're not going to take a look at most of these.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.600
Most people don't even know that these are here.

18
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.580
I'd say that's a generalization but in my experience working with mice and people who work with my ask

19
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.750
you out you use maybe five of these on a regular basis and then occasionally you might need to do something

20
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.940
like hey is there a way of doing X.

21
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
Let me go check on the documentation and oh look there is a way of doing that.

22
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.490
Perfect.

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.550
Or oh no there's not a way.

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.310
Great.

25
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.050
What am I going to do next.

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.880
So I just want to show you that this is here.

27
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.120
And the first one that we're actually going to take a look at is called Concat.

28
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.870
So what it will do is combine pieces of data.

29
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.280
It's combining strengths.

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.710
So here's an example using this book data.

31
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
Remember that we have author first name and author last name.

32
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.770
And there are valid reasons for separating that data sometimes.

33
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.100
I mean you might want to sort books by last name and sometimes you may only want the last name in certain

34
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340
contexts you might not want the first name.

35
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.140
It's not a great example but there are reasons that you would separate this out.

36
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.530
Just like when you're filling out a form online you're signing up for a site.

37
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.700
They usually don't just ask you for your full name.

38
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.950
They ask you for a first and last name but then if they have those pieces of information it's pretty

39
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.380
easy to combine them.

40
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.610
So that's what we're going to see now.

41
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.600
How do we combine these two and get something that says Juba.

42
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.360
Here we are Neil Gaiman or in this case Foster Wallace as the last name which I'm actually not sure

43
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.370
if that qualifies as a last name exactly but David Foster Wallace how do we combine that.

44
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.410
How do we get that.

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.500
The answer is we use Concat.

46
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.100
So let me just first show you what we have right now.

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.550
Well do a select authored f name author L name from books and that's what we get here.

48
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.240
Just what I had printed out in the slides.

49
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.570
So what we want again is to combine them but we'll take some baby steps.

50
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.330
And here's a slide.

51
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.620
I totally got to have them myself.

52
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.680
What if I want full names.

53
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.850
So concat the way that concat works is that we pass in multiple arguments or pieces of data and it will

54
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.610
combine them.

55
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.910
So whatever we give it in this case I mean if you had columns x y and z this would work but it's really

56
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.690
just supposed to be an example.

57
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.510
More specifically what you can do are things like this concat a column name with another column.

58
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.730
So that's what we'll work on.

59
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.310
We're going to do first name or author name and author L name and combine them together.

60
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.970
And if we do this right here.

61
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.350
So concat author name and author L name what you actually do is just slam them together.

62
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.700
Put them exactly together concatenate them.

63
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.650
So there's no space in between.

64
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.210
So we get Dave Eggers jubilate here.

65
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.940
So there's no you know that's not exactly what we want maybe quite a comma maybe we want last name comma

66
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.810
first name or maybe we want first name space last name.

67
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.050
So there's a way of doing that when we can cat we can pass in a column name and then some other text

68
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.900
and then another column name.

69
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.030
And if we wanted more text it we can keep going on and on and on and it will concatenate everything.

70
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.680
So to add a space it's pretty simple.

71
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:30.120
Author first name comma and then a space comma author name and that will give us Dave Eggers Juba the

72
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.760
here.

73
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.860
So now that I've shown you the slides.

74
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.460
Let's take a look.

75
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.870
And the first thing I'll show is that often people expect they can just come in here and just type Concat.

76
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:52.590
But if I just do concat Well author f name comma author L name there's a problem.

77
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.610
Hopefully you can identify what the problem is.

78
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.480
If I hit Enter this is not valid syntax.

79
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.370
First of all it doesn't know what table.

80
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.830
What if we have multiple tables.

81
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.680
Where's Arthur F. name coming from an author name.

82
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.140
And second of all we have to select So we can't just run these willy nilly.

83
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.880
We can't just run them on their own.

84
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.920
We need to run them as a select select concat and then in here I'm actually going to start with something

85
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.330
simple.

86
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.540
I'm not going to use columns.

87
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.790
I'm going to use text.

88
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.810
So I'll just put something like.

89
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.640
Hello comma world.

90
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.240
So this is very trivial but if I just do this.

91
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.140
Select concat Hello world and I hit enter.

92
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.110
You can see it does it for me and it just gives me.

93
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.010
Hello world.

94
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.610
Combined these two things.

95
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.550
So I can do the same thing in outer space and rather than a space with two dots it is easier to see

96
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.030
and we need a comma.

97
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.000
A lot of punctuation going on.

98
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.960
Select concat Hello comma dot dot dot comma world.

99
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.540
It just shoved them all together and we get.

100
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.580
Hello world.

101
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.530
So that's how we can do it with just text which you probably won't be doing.

102
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.300
You'll be doing things like this.

103
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:20.950
Select and then you can cut a column like author name and then a space and then author L name from books.

104
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.950
So let's try it.

105
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.020
We can copy it now go over here and paste it.

106
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.200
Select and what it will do when we hit enter is just make a new column for us or in our results.

107
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.200
It doesn't change our initial data just to be clear.

108
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.160
Our data looks the same in the database.

109
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.880
This is purely about printing it out but we have this new thing up here with this horrible title concat

110
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.780
author name comma space comma author Al name.

111
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.810
But then in here we have the data that we're looking for.

112
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.560
We have for the theory we have Patti Smith Raymond Carver and so on.

113
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.350
So that's really useful to combine data like that.

114
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.390
Now if you want to get a little fancier Let's rename it so let's give it an as.

115
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.590
And we'll just say as a full name just like that.

116
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.210
Now I get full name up here.

117
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.840
Jim Pilla here in the game and so on.

118
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.200
So that's Concat.

119
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.350
I'll show you a couple more examples just to show you how these string functions work.

120
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.210
You don't have to just do one at a time.

121
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.990
We could do something like this.

122
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:35.350
Select and will do author first name just on its own author name as first name.

123
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:51.040
Let's just do first actually as first comma author L name has lapsed and then we'll have a concat author

124
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.660
and let's do it on new line just because it gets a little messy here.

125
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.900
Concat author f names.

126
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.230
This is what we've already seen with this space comma.

127
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.220
Author L name.

128
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.340
And we'll call it full so we'll have three different things printed out the first name under the title

129
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.840
first author L name at last.

130
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.580
And then the full name combined using concat as full.

131
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:29.180
So then we need to say from where from books now I hit enter and I get this pretty little table first

132
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.080
last and full.

133
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.020
So what I want to show is that you don't have to use it in isolation.

134
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.660
You can combine it with other things and you can see this as we go.

135
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.270
We're not going to just use concat and you don't have to just use one concat per selects you could have

136
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:50.240
multiple If we wanted to you know I could have full name and then I could have full names comma separated

137
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.020
instead.

138
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:58.130
And I found to do that you can probably figure this out but rather than just having a space there I'll

139
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.040
just put a comma.

140
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.060
And now I get a comma here.

141
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:11.330
All right so one more thing about concat is that there's something called concat ws which stands for

142
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.100
concat with separator.

143
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.160
So there might be times where you're concatenating concatenating multiple fields multiple things together

144
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.620
with the same symbol or piece of data stuck in between them.

145
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.830
So there is a shortcut for that.

146
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:34.280
So if I wanted to have title dash author named dash author last name let's not debate why but if I wanted

147
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.720
to I could do something like this.

148
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.430
Select Concat.

149
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.060
And we have author.

150
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:51.650
Actually we started with title comma and then we wanted to dash and then author F. name comma and then

151
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.340
another dash comma author L. name just like that.

152
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.440
So it's kind of a lot of her repetitive typing especially if we have more items that we're combining.

153
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:10.720
But if I just do this year from books you see it does what you expect puts the title dash first.

154
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:16.460
Last but we can use concat WS and it looks like this.

155
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.620
So it switches things around a bit.

156
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.230
The first thing that we pass in is what we want the separator to be.

157
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.090
So in this case a dash with a space on either side.

158
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.160
And it will go ahead and then insert that in between every other thing we pass in.

159
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.080
So we'll have title dash author first named dash authorize.net.

160
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.820
So now if I pace that in you can see if we get the same result.

161
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.200
Although I added spaces here but it's the same idea.

162
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.980
It's sandwiched every time.

163
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.990
So just worth noting if you ever are in a situation where you're combining lots of data in the same

164
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.200
manner you can use concat ws to save you typing this or whatever your symbol is.
