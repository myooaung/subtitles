1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.610
All right.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.050
So we discussed our game plan for implementing the relationship.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.680
The one too many association between customers and orders.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.110
Now let's get to it.

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.680
So we'll start off with customers which is a little bit easier.

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.190
So we're going to have an ID a first name a last name and email.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.360
And these three the last three are all of our chars and ID isn't it.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.420
So let's start off with that and I'll let you know.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.370
I have basically our data already written so that we don't have to spend time typing it out.

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.840
You'll be able to copy and paste it but I do think it's good if you go through actually typing the schema

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540
itself and just copy the copy and paste the data in because there's no reason you need to spend time

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.360
typing Plus deal and all these email addresses over and over.

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:54.980
You get to create table customers and let's just start by defining what we need so we have an ID we

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.680
have first name last name and we have email and as we said these are all our chars.

15
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.490
And we'll just do one hundred and I'll copy that and paste it had my semi-colon.

16
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.280
And so we're almost there.

17
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.010
We just need to figure out ID.

18
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.610
And this should we review it and we could leave it at that.

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.790
But it's best to add autoincrement and primary key.

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.600
And that's because a couple of things.

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.690
One it's a good habit to get into at the very least it can be useful for sorting things but more importantly

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.300
where you're going to reference this ID customer's ID in another table.

23
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.250
And so we want to make sure that it's unique like we discussed.

24
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.930
We don't want to have you know Customer ID too.

25
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.510
We don't want any ambiguity as to who or which customer that's referring to if we had two different

26
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.730
customers with the same ID that would be problematic.

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.650
So we're going to make it unique with auto or with primary key and autoincrement primary key on its

28
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.930
own inforced is the fact that it's unique.

29
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.470
But we would have to manually enter it in.

30
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.060
It should be review but I would have to actually say something like insert into customers and then what

31
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.140
would I do here let's say id and I'll just do first name I would have to manually go through and say

32
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.110
OK this user has ID of two and the first name of Tom and then the next one I would have to make sure

33
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.050
it was unique and do three or I could do 20 or 50 as long as it was unique but I don't have to care

34
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.000
about that ID.

35
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.650
If I put autoincrement.

36
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.040
So we'll do that.

37
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.960
OK.

38
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.680
So that gives us customers to make sure we had our camera there and then next up we have orders and

39
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.520
Order has an idea as well.

40
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.680
So that will also be a primary key and we have ordered date and amount.

41
00:02:51.710 --> 00:03:02.110
So let's start with those three create table orders and the first thing we have is ID.

42
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.320
And then we had ordered date and you might be inclined just to call it date but that can be problematic

43
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.970
because that is an actual data type it would be like naming a column int or var char.

44
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.090
So we don't want to do that.

45
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.780
So we'll call it order date and then we have a mount.

46
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.820
So order date it's just going to be a regular date.

47
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.580
We won't worry with date time even though I prefer date time just to make it simple for us we won't

48
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.370
have to deal with the time component.

49
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.670
So that's not what this is.

50
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.600
This exercise is focused on so we can eliminate that so date and then this will be a decimal.

51
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.000
And for our purposes let's say 8 comet 2.

52
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.340
So we're 8 is the total number of digits and 2 is the number after the decimal.

53
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.640
So we'll start with that decimal 8 coming to order date.

54
00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.840
It's just a simple date and then Id isn't the same auto increment primary key.

55
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.950
But then that brings us to the last thing which is different and we haven't seen this before it and

56
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.020
all we're going to do is write customer ID.

57
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.570
That is the name of the column what data type is it.

58
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.570
Well it's just going to be a number it's an integer.

59
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.470
So we could just leave it at that if we wanted to.

60
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.590
And I'll show you what that looks like to start.

61
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.310
So I will go ahead and leave it at this.

62
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.630
I'm not recommending that you actually run this just yet because we are going to change this and I'll

63
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.340
show you why in just a second.

64
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.790
OK.

65
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.460
So we had my semi colon in here and then let's make sure we don't have any typos.

66
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.730
The first thing I'll show you is that I'm in a new database.

67
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.760
This is a bit of review.

68
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.630
It's been a while.

69
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.230
How do I check the name of the database.

70
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.760
I'm currently in it to select database.

71
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.520
So I made a new one.

72
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.920
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.840
You could do it inside the bookshop.

74
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.120
I just wanted to have a clean thing we have no tables yet so I'm going to make our customers table and

75
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.430
see if it works.

76
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.830
And then our orders table.

77
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.530
Okay perfect.

78
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:19.190
So then I have all this data down here that I'm not going to type by hand but if you take a look it's

79
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.770
adding How many users five users.

80
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.070
I added one who wasn't in our database already or who wasn't on the table here which is Bette Davis

81
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.780
so Boy George George Michael David Bowie blue steel and Bette Davis.

82
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.660
So that's just going to insert into customers make sure that works.

83
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.310
Let's do a select star from customers.

84
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.530
Perfect.

85
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.030
And then this is a tricky part where I'm actually inserting the orders.

86
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.700
And if you notice all that I'm doing is the date of the order the price and then Customer ID at the

87
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.770
end.

88
00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.720
And right now there is no explicit association between customer ID here and ID here.

89
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.060
All that I've said is this is a number so it's up to me to put whatever I want in there.

90
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.420
So let me show you.

91
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.140
I'm just going to do that now by copying this and pasting it in.

92
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:21.250
And now if I do a select star from orders you can see we have customer IDs 1 1 2 2 and 5 which is fine.

93
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.080
That looks good to us because we also have users who go up until 5:00 but there's nothing stopping me

94
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.830
from doing something like this.

95
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.650
Let me just copy this first part.

96
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.280
There's nothing stopping me from inserting something with let's say price is thirty three point sixty

97
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.090
six sixty seven.

98
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.310
Why not.

99
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.050
And customer ID is 95 or 98.

100
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.410
There's nothing stopping you from doing this.

101
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.690
And that's not well.

102
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.560
I mean we could get by with this right.

103
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.270
We could just know that we're never going to insert something with a cast right that doesn't exist.

104
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.900
But because there is no association between customer ID and this ID we can do whatever we want which

105
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.890
is usually not a good thing.

106
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:18.500
So if I hit Enter now we have an order with a customer id that doesn't actually exist with a corresponding

107
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.440
customer.

108
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.870
So what what we want to do is actually add in a constraint here.

109
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.750
So just like there's a primary key we also can explicitly say something is a foreign key.

110
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.280
And the easiest way it's a little longer.

111
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.040
It looks like this on a separate line foreign key and then in parentheses we say the name of the field

112
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.920
to the column are referring to which is in the Orders table.

113
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.730
Customer ID and then we have to say what it's referencing.

114
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.070
So it's referencing think of drawing this line up to ID.

115
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.610
OK.

116
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.310
So we have customer id up there.

117
00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:01.220
So we're going to do references and then the name of the table which is customers.

118
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.550
And then in parentheses the name of the field which is ID ups I lost it here.

119
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.330
OK.

120
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.960
So it seems like a lot but all we're saying is hey there's this column that we need to find customer

121
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:21.170
ID and make that a foreign key and it needs to reference remember foreign key means that it's referencing

122
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.320
something external something outside the table.

123
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.090
We want it to reference the customers table and in particular the ID field.

124
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.510
One small note I'll add your key is don't always have to be IDs.

125
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.350
There are almost always IDs but you can get away with other things you like.

126
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.830
I think we discussed this earlier.

127
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.640
Sometimes you want emails to be unique and you could make that a primary key instead.

128
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.160
But IDs are easiest because they're short they're simple you can autoincrement them and it's ninety

129
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.310
nine point nine percent of the time what you use.

130
00:08:52.370 --> 00:09:00.370
So here we go again just go up the steps you define first customer I.D. and then and just to clarify

131
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.780
you can call this customer I.D. you can call this whatever you want.

132
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.480
I gave just regular I.D. and gave this customer underscore I.D. which is a convention when you have

133
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.930
a foreign key to use the name of the table underscore the name of the column just so that it's clear.

134
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.790
And you know we already have an idea here.

135
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.270
OK.

136
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.200
So we're taking this.

137
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.510
Making a good foreign key referencing this field here.

138
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.990
So to see the effect of that we're actually going to need to drop our tables and start over.

139
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:39.250
So it's just drop table and we can do both at once so customers orders OK and now how do we see our

140
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:39.700
tables.

141
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.740
That's a quick review as well show tables nothing.

142
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.500
OK.

143
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:51.320
So I'm just going to face this again again we had our first table make sure we didn't screw up our syntax.

144
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.740
The second one great only difference is this line here.

145
00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:02.520
Now we're going to insert our customers again and insert our orders again.

146
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.730
And if we do a show like Star from customers you can see nothing changed to a select star from orders

147
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.390
nothing changed.

148
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:18.390
Great but then now let's try and insert something else like we did earlier.

149
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.230
So I'm just going to copy this line again down below.

150
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.760
And we're going to insert an order.

151
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:33.640
We can keep the same date that's due June 6th and our price will be thirty three point six seven.

152
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:39.190
But our idea is going to be ninety eight which doesn't exist.

153
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:45.820
Our customer ID is 98 which doesn't exist as a corresponding user or customer ID as you can see we only

154
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.040
go up till 5.

155
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:54.730
So if we try that now we have a problem which we didn't have before.

156
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.970
Cannot add or update a child row a foreign key constraint fails.

157
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.970
And so basically saying I can't do that because the constraint you had said this is a foreign key referencing

158
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.020
customer ID or customers in the ID field.

159
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.450
And there is no customer with ID 98.

160
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.430
So it's now enforcing that which is great.

161
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:19.680
And if we select all of our borders again you can see it's not in here.

162
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.050
It didn't make it in here.

163
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.740
So we now have this.

164
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.440
Think of it as a bouncer at the door that is checking if there's a corresponding customer which is useful.

165
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.020
OK.

166
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.640
So that's what foreign key does.

167
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.080
And I'll go ahead and end this video there but we haven't really explored our data yet.

168
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.430
So in the next video we're going to start seeing how we can work with our data.

169
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.990
How do we how do we basically connect these two tables.

170
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.150
We have them a sociate ad but now how do I do things with them.

171
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.270
How do I figure out who ordered what.

172
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.990
Like if I look at orders right now I have a customer ID.

173
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.160
But what if I want the name of the person the first name or both first and last name or the e-mail.

174
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.900
So that's coming up in the next video.

175
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.390
And we're going to dive into really important topic which is joint.

176
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.410
So that's coming up.
