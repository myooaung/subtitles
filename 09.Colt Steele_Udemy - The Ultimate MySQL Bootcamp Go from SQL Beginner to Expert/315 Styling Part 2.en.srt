1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,680
So I'll just copy everything from the form to start and I'm going to comment things on and off as we

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,440
go.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,190
OK.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,730
So look at our form right now.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,830
Quite Ugly.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,340
Let's start Brian taking a look at line height is simple but border none.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,210
What that will do if you make it bigger if you look at the form down here as refresh.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,260
I don't know if you could see but a quarter went away.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,150
The default border then what I'm doing is adding in a line at the bottom.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,560
And actually what would make this easier is if I just show you the finished app just a moment.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,270
Here you go.

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,150
So we have that white line running underneath.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,800
So that's what they just added in.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,010
It's very hard to tell because we still have the rest of the form there.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,030
So the next thing let's make the background transparent.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,380
OK.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,180
So it's easier to see even though it's very small on the screen right now.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,230
Now there's no white background and a couple other things.

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:55,990
I made the fonts.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,440
Whoops.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:05,550
Get rid of that made the font size bigger made the form or the input itself bigger and then included

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,670
a margin color and some padding.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,890
Also I'm using a class here.

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,350
It could also just call this input.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,810
But what's being styled is not the form itself but if you look here we have a class that equals form.

26
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,720
So it's the input right here.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,320
Refresh now and we're getting closer.

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,980
Let's go back to 100.

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,610
One thing that you may notice is when I click here I get this annoying focus effect.

30
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:44,430
You can get rid of that with a C S S which if you go to the bottom you got this input type text focus.

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,290
And what this will do is say when an input with type called text is focused when someone clicks on it

32
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,830
there should be no outline.

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,710
So if we save now and try it I don't get that weird outline.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,190
Also if you notice I have the text white here and then I decided to do that.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,700
This is placeholder text.

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,360
It's what this is.

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,390
As soon as you start typing it turns white but the placeholder is dark to change placeholder text is

38
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,490
a bit annoying.

39
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,790
Hey not going to even bother spending much time on what this is but if you notice there's this fancy.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,690
Basically it's just three browser specific way of doing this where we're targeting the input placeholder

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,660
text and I'm setting the color to be slightly see through.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,810
So now if I do it oh that's not what I wanted to refresh now for I do it it's slightly transparent but

43
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,130
I start typing.

44
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,090
There we go.

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,310
OK.

46
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,010
Moving on along.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,830
That takes care of our form for the most part.

48
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,490
Now we've got the button the button is pretty straightforward.

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,440
Me format this a little better.

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll just copy it all over

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,750
and save mainly what I'm doing can actually get rid of this is adding in three pixel solid border then

52
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,750
I'm making the font size bigger.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,570
I'm making the color I'm all changing the color.

54
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,480
Adding some padding adding a background color and then so the color here is referring to text a border

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,540
radius to make it rounded and then making it slightly see through again.

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,640
So you can see that changes made.

57
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,570
I'm not a designer so I'm sure there are many better ways things we could do to just make this look

58
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:31,810
better.

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,190
I'm not terribly happy with it but it's good enough or I might ask you of course.

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,990
So that's pretty much it for the button.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,220
Which then leaves us with basically positioning things and formatting them.

62
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:50,620
How did we get this to be centered vertically roughly vertically in the page which is what we did here.

63
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,140
What I did here and it's not too bad although we need to do is change our markup a little bit.

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,890
So we've got a basically two divs that everything is wrapped in the first one contains everything.

65
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,310
And then there's a second one that also wraps around everything.

66
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,140
First one is called Flex container and the second one gave a class of container.

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:19,770
I'll just copy this and pasted over into a home that Ejay us but at the same content we've got to join

68
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,000
us.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,070
You got our paragraph form but now we also have these two divs on its own.

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,840
I refresh.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Nothing changes.

72
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:39,080
However if we add in this little bit of success here what this will do is help position things vertically

73
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,200
so we can put this in we can put it wherever we want but I'll put it towards the top.

74
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,330
Now if I save and refresh the page.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,960
Now we've got everything vertically centered so this isn't a course on C Ss So it's not a course on

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,930
things like flex blocks or positioning or what these fields do.

77
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,790
But this is a nice and easy way to position things well relatively easy.

78
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,370
And so we're basically done here just to review what we did.

79
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:16,080
The first thing we did was to allow or just set up so that it was serving a public directory which was

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,810
this fancy line here.

81
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,340
Everything inside the public directory is now available in our views.

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,430
So what I'm going to do.

83
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,290
I'm actually going to close down our CSSA and markups who just focus on what we actually have.

84
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,720
So then in our home that yes we can link to the SS.

85
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,490
We do need that slash and it's referring to this app Dotsie assessed there.

86
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,400
OK.

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,390
So then aside from that we added a font and then our applets.

88
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,370
SS We added a bunch of styles which we mainly copy and pasted.

89
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,440
So the point of this course.

90
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,550
But things like changing the font adding shadow changing colors adding the background image changing

91
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,290
the background image size how it is positioned or how its size and taking over the whole screen but

92
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,990
not overwhelming it.

93
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:08,310
And then also the font weight and making our font lighter weight then we've got our form and our button

94
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,560
that we formatted and then also we positioned things using these two divs and styling those.

95
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,540
One thing that we could do to make this a little bit more kosher is to add a head and a body to it.

96
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,820
So if you're familiar with aged female and probably have been asking why we haven't done this.

97
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,530
You don't.

98
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,470
I mean we should have it there but we don't have to have it.

99
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:35,970
A browser will add it automatically but it's definitely an improvement to follow convention do not rely

100
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,870
on a browser to do that for us.

101
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:45,370
So now we've got a nice officially formatted kosher home that Ejay as file and just double check that

102
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,020
it still works.

103
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,630
All right.

104
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,150
And let's make sure our form still works.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:58,860
No reason it shouldn't but let's add in a Jared at gmail dot com and we're joined now and we see we've

106
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,300
gone up to 506 now and we could go over to my ask who will run the same query.

107
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,630
Select start from users ordered by created at sending this time from them at one and we get Jared at

108
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,260
gmail and we get the correct time stamp and we are officially done with this app.

109
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,890
So if you wanted to of course you could change.

110
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,750
You could create a second page to redirect to that said thank you or congratulations.

111
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,780
Or you could you know restyle this or you could collect more information if you wanted a challenge instead

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,990
of just an email collect a name or a birthday or a phone number that's more useful than an email.

113
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,120
If people give it away at least.

114
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,750
So this was a lot to section just to make this work although if we really think about it the bulk of

115
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,970
it was introducing things like Noad and NPM.

116
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,260
And you know that might ask you a package and assassinated him out.

117
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,720
Yes.

118
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,680
So much groundwork for an app for a simple web app but the minuscule part was super easy.

119
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,850
Hopefully you know creating a table and inserting a single thing or selecting account stuff that we've

120
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,800
been doing for a long time in this course.

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,380
So hopefully you feel good about that.

122
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,590
And this was more of just a high level survey of creating an app but I want you to feel like you know

123
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,780
you leave this course making something even if it is simple but you've now seen how all the parts fit

124
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,430
together.
