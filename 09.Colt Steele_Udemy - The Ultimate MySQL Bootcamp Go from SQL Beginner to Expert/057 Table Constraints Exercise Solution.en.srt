1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,930
All right.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,000
So if all you care about is the solution.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,130
Just check out the code.

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,400
Following this lecture or post the video you can see the solution here.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,300
But I'll go ahead and go through the process of typing this out very quickly.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,320
I'll kind of speed it up.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,230
So what I'd like to do is start by defining the rough skeleton of what we need in a sequel file.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:32,680
So we need a create table employees and then within that we'll have Id have first name last name of

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,100
middle name and then we have age and current status just like that.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,100
And then we can fill in the data types.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,180
So we know ID is an integer and age is an integer then these are our chars for our cars.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's say 2 5 5.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,660
So somebody may have a giant name and same for current status.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,980
So then the next thing that we could do is focus on an idea which we know needs to autoincrement And

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,940
we also want it to be mandatory and a primary key.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,940
So mandatory means not know.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,130
And the primary key there's actually two options.

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,970
The first one is to do this and the second one just duplicate this.

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,880
It's also in the slides is to add it on the end here.

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,130
We don't want that underscore that.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,020
There we go.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,300
So these will do the same thing.

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,000
But of course we're not done.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,940
So the next thing would be first name and first name it's just mandatory as is last name.

25
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,270
So we'll just add not no and not no middle name.

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,510
We can leave alone and we've got age which is also mandatory.

27
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,340
And then finally current status which is mandatory but there's also a default value.

28
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:05,610
So we want nominal defaults employed and then we need to make sure we have all the correct Comus here.

29
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,400
Just like that at our semi-colon aswell.

30
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,130
Copy it.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,970
Let's see what happens.

32
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,350
All right.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:25,390
So looks good we can describe employees and then if we wanted to let's just do a single test insert

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,540
to make sure our default value works in our autoincrement works.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:38,350
So what do you insert into employees and we'll do it first name a last name com age and that's it.

36
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,630
Because everything else either has and is allowed to be know or has a default value and will insert

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,440
someone with the name of Dora Smith.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,420
Yes.

39
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,880
And let's say she is fifty eight.

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,510
OK.

41
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,460
Copy that set in.

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:06,700
Let's do a select star from employees just like that and it looks good.

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,600
We've got an I.D. auto incrementing at one first name last name.

44
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,010
Middle name is No.

45
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,620
Because it's allowed to be age of 58 and current status is employed because we didn't specify one.

46
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,990
And we have a default value.

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,760
All right.

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,610
So again the other solution here is just to put primary key on the same line when you're defining the

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,250
column.

50
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,430
I prefer to do it that way.

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,380
But you also see it done this way both work.

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,080
All right.

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,680
That's it.
