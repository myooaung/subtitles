1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,270
OK so we made it through all of that crud that's sort of a joke.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,610
Anyways we're now talking about string functions.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,340
So basically we've seen how to interact with our database create stuff insert it update delete all of

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,860
that.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,000
But now we're going to focus more on select or reading the data out because what we've been doing right

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,720
now is just reading the data directly as it is.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,610
So I can say you know I select breed and name from cats and that's it.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,630
I get it back and that's great but there are things that I could do with that data.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,250
So with numbers I might want to add them together or I might want to I don't know reverse a string or

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,690
replace all spaces with a certain character or conjoin first name and last name or conjoin you know

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,700
two pieces of data together.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,490
All of these are different operations different ways of printing or data out that we can do.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,340
And so we're going to start focusing on them in this section we're talking about string functions.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,680
So there's going to be a bunch of things that we see I already mentioned some of them we can concatenate

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,300
words we can take certain parts of a string and leave other parts out.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,370
We can reverse we can uppercase lowercase replace characters all sorts of things.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,590
But before we get there first thing you want to do is show you something that I think is pretty useful

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,140
and that we'll use pretty often from here on out.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,440
So up until this point all of the sequel that we've been writing has been manually entered into the

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,880
command line into the CLIA here.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,620
So if I want to create a table I have to type create table and then the name of the table cat but let's

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,580
say that I mess it up so let's say I typed singular cat which technically isn't a problem per se but

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,450
it's a good idea to have things pluralized.

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,600
It won't break but.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,780
So let's say I don't notice for a little bit though.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,110
So I create a table cat and we want you know name is Vardar 100.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,750
Age is 10.

28
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,770
When are doing age is it just like that.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,450
Let's say we leave it at that.

30
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,790
Now this isn't a great example because it has a short line.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:17,840
But if I messed it up I have to go all the way back here and edit it right and do cats like this.

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,390
But let's now suppose that I have something even longer and I want to put it on separate lines and format

33
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:33,990
it nicely like this great table cats and then we have printed c there and you do name is var char and

34
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,000
let's say misfile this like that age isn't it.

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,140
And then I realized oh shoot I totally messed up.

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,840
I don't have a way of getting back there.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,890
I don't have an easy way of getting here.

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,320
So I have to retype the whole line or copy it.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,080
There's no simple way of editing it.

40
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,280
So what I want to show you is that we can run code from a file and that's really really useful.

41
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,480
Running sequel files that we're going to talk about here.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,120
So basically by the end we will be working with files that look like this.

43
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:16,350
They're nicely formatted they have nice syntax highlighting we can edit them make changes and so on

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,000
and run them when we're ready rather than typing things manually into the command line.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:29,160
That doesn't mean that we won't be typing things here because it's very useful to go away Siri.

46
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,200
It's a very useful tool.

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,920
I should probably add that out while it's a useful tool that allows us to explore things try things

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,660
out if they're short lived.

49
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,640
It's great but if we're really trying to do more serious stuff it's much easier and better to work in

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,430
a file.

51
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
You can make edits you can share it with people.

52
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,490
So that's what we're going to do.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,910
So let's go ahead.

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,270
I mean get out of this and I'll just hit enter and get an error and that's fine.

55
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,130
So right now I'm in Cat's database and if I do show tables we don't know I do have a catch table but

56
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,800
if I look at it it's empty.

57
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,200
So what I'm actually going to do is drop that catch table drop table cats.

58
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,320
OK.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,320
So what I want to do is remake the cat's table and what I could do is what I just did here create table

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,450
cat and do the whole thing.

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,850
But rather than that I'm going to do it in a file and then all I'll have to do here is run that file

62
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,470
execute it with one short line so I appear to have a new file.

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,720
Again you can do file new file.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,940
You can use the shortcut shown here.

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,670
You can right click and do new file as well whatever we do though.

66
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,610
We need a new file and I'm just going to put something in there so create table and I am showing you

67
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,610
creating a table but we'll be putting any sequel queery in here creating a table dropping tables inserting

68
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,500
data selecting any sort of query we want to create table cat that's so easy now to format it nicely.

69
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,900
We'll have a name which is Vardar 100.

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,220
Let's do an idea as well.

71
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,490
See how easy that was.

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:21,600
If I made a mistake ID will be an ant not no auto increment comma name or char and then we'll do age

73
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,760
isn't and will do.

74
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,270
Primary Key is cat ID.

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,370
So this should all be review.

76
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,090
But what's nice is I have this query like this.

77
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,320
I need to save the file.

78
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,480
So I did command us but you can also go file save.

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,400
And we need to give it a name any name will do.

80
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,550
I'll just call it first file and this is the most important part as well.

81
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,790
So that's what identifies the contents of the file as secret code.

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,950
So we need that click Save make sure changed up there.

83
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,700
Also you can see we got a syntax highlighting now which is also very useful.

84
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,700
Ok so I'm sure by now you can see the value in doing this.

85
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,150
You have a history of your work.

86
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,060
You can edit it share it with people.

87
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,710
It's just a much better way of doing it.

88
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,490
So how do we actually run it.

89
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,140
Well this is a magic source and then a file on it.

90
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,570
So in our case our file name is first filed as well.

91
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,050
So we just need source file name as well.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,760
So I'm going actually quit out of the Seelye and first thing I want to show you is that it matters where

93
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,060
you are when you initialize your Seelye.

94
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,620
So when I type LS here and if you're not familiar with that it just lists the current files.

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,090
So this shows me is that I have book data.

96
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,840
First file and problems are.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,860
So we want first file.

98
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,440
Don't worry about these other two.

99
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,010
So we are in the correct directory to access that file.

100
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:02,050
So if I start up to a lie with my ask you will see T.L. space Selye and I use the cat app database just

101
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,300
like that I'll make some space.

102
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,830
Now all I do is source first file dot as well just like that.

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,760
And we'll see what happens.

104
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,130
It says queery OK.

105
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,690
So now how do we know it works.

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,340
Well we could do describe cats and here's our table.

107
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,310
So that's all there is to actually executing the file source and the file name.

108
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,780
But what I want to show you two things.

109
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,580
I'll go ahead and make a new directory.

110
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,080
You don't have to do this but I'm just going to call it I don't know testing.

111
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:43,450
And then instead of testing I'll make a new file and what I'll put inside of that file is a select statement.

112
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,930
So let's start from cat.

113
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,810
Actually let's do an insert insert into cats and we'll just do what we have here.

114
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,820
Name and age which I'm just realizing and capitalized so we could obviously go back and change that

115
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,580
here and rerun it.

116
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,380
But we'll leave it.

117
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,280
So insert into cat's name and age just like that

118
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,790
values and name will be let's do Charlie.

119
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,560
Age will be let's do an old cat 17.

120
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,830
Save the file.

121
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:37,880
And you file save and make sure the file is as well and so do rename and I'll just call this insert

122
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
dot as well.

123
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,330
OK let's actually just to show you we can do more than one thing at a time.

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,520
Insert both or let's insert too.

125
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
And this one will be called.

126
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:57,440
I think we already have a Sindee let's do a Khani who is 10 and then at the end we'll also do select

127
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,930
star from cats just like that.

128
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,420
So these three things will be executed at once if we do it correctly.

129
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,670
So now to reference this file our Seelye is running in this folder so we can't just say insert data

130
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,630
as well.

131
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,140
If we did that source in-circuit as well it tells us it can't find that file.

132
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:28,000
So what we need to do is do a source testing slash insert data as well and there we go.

133
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,350
So that's important.

134
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,540
You have to access the correct path.

135
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,810
You have to refer to this file by its full path to get there.

136
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,000
So if you're in this folder all that we can access are these.

137
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,660
But if we drill to this folder then we have access.

138
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,040
And obviously you could extrapolate that to as many layers as you need.

139
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,330
So now let's make sure it worked.

140
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,600
You can see after it worked we had queery OK one row affected.

141
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,380
That was our first answer.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,990
And then the same thing our second insert and then our select statement gave us this right here.

143
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,830
So that's all there is to running code from a file.

144
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,580
It's really really useful.

145
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,980
We'll be doing it pretty much nonstop.

146
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,150
And the first thing that we're going to do is actually get some new data into our database using this

147
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,950
in the next video.
