00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.790
Get so Problem three

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.260
very similar but we're going to then substitute in for a no.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.570
Under Title we want it to say missing an under grade you want it to say zero so we can actually just

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.520
use the same thing.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.260
So it's going to be select.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.020
I'll do this on separate lines.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.140
First name comma title common grade

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.840
from students left join papers on students that ID equals papers.

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.440
Student ID mouthfull.

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.990
However when we're working so first name will be the same title.

11
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.880
We're going to if it's no we're going to make it that the text of the string missing.

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:05.180
And that's where our lovely if no function comes into hand or comes in handy Let's say so comma and

13
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.490
we'll just replace it with missing.

14
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.820
So remember I'm beating a dead horse hopefully at this point if knoll takes this if title is no then

15
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.240
it replaces it with missing.

16
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.340
Otherwise it just keeps it as my first book report my second book before this one.

17
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.170
So we'll start with that.

18
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.640
You can see if we get missing we still have no for grade.

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.250
That's a simple fix the same thing.

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.460
If no grade comma and we want to zero not text not a string zero.

21
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.390
You want the number.

22
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.020
Because this is it over here.

23
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.800
Perfect.

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.720
And we're done yet missing zero missing zero and then things that didn't have no are untouched.

25
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.840
All right.

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.160
Moving on this one is similar in that we want to have data for students who don't have papers.

27
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.490
So Roger and Lisa.

28
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.810
So this is not going to be an inner join.

29
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.220
We know that because if we did an inner join we would only get these three.

30
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.880
We wouldn't have anything on Rush and Lisa are students who maybe aren't doing so hot they're not turning

31
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.700
things in.

32
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.600
But what we want is only the first name and their average for all their papers and if they didn't turn

33
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.270
anything in their average is the.

34
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.690
So this really means is we need a group Nici group of students and we're going to start by selecting

35
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.170
all of this and we'll get rid of our if Noll's So let's just do the title again.

36
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.610
We don't even need Title Duey we just want grade.

37
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.970
We'll start with that.

38
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.110
So if we do a left join K we get this this is this is actually close.

39
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.820
Right.

40
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.620
The only thing is we need to condense our data.

41
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.610
We need to group these together.

42
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.120
So what's the best way to group them.

43
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.110
Well we could use first name that would absolutely work that are unique.

44
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.600
We could not use on the paper side of things we could not do paper step student ID because Raj and Lisa

45
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.250
don't have papers that student IDs so that's no for them which is problematic.

46
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.760
We can't really dependably group by no.

47
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.620
And also we don't want a group rise and they sit together.

48
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.720
So we want to group from this side of the table and we could do names but there's also something else

49
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.020
that we're not seeing.

50
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.270
We do star

51
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.430
we can just group by student ID so you can see here.

52
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.310
So what I was saying is that student ID doesn't work because these are no.

53
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.520
And if we group we don't want these together we want them separate.

54
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.420
So let's group by

55
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:52.460
group by students and we could get away with just saying ID because there is no ID on our papers table

56
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.790
right.

57
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.860
We didn't have ID which you probably should have just for good practice but we don't have it.

58
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.620
But if we did have it then we definitely need to be explicit and say students.

59
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.480
Heidi it never hurts to do that.

60
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.420
So what group.

61
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.430
Student ID and if we copy it and repaste.

62
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.320
OK so we're getting close.

63
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.490
Sort of we have things groups remember that hides data from us because it's groups behind this row.

64
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.590
Two of Caleb's papers to Samantha's But we're at least getting data grouped.

65
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.600
So then the next thing is rather than displaying grade here we don't care about grade what we want to

66
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.830
display is the average of all the grades for those two.

67
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.810
So Caleb has two grades 60 and something else.

68
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.120
Samantha has two.

69
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.920
Raj has have to deal with that and a little bit.

70
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.290
Carlos Carlos has won.

71
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.220
Lisa has no.

72
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.050
We'll deal with that in a second as well.

73
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.850
But let's see what we get now.

74
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.240
OK so we get to averages sixty seven point five.

75
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.130
96 in 1893 averages excuse me and then for our people who don't have papers we end up with no and no

76
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.000
simple solution.

77
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.100
If they don't have any papers we just use if no

78
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.960
if no average grade.

79
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.020
And we just want to make it zero just like that before we did it.

80
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.160
And now you can see we get rajin to have zeros in if we check against what we had here.

81
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:36.110
There's only one small change which is we need to order them descending order by quarter by average

82
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.920
and actually rather than doing average grade.

83
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.130
Let's just give this an alias which is what I did over here I just called it average.

84
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.880
Now we can do order by average.

85
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.830
Perfect.

86
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.900
And there we go.

87
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.770
Well no I lied.

88
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.130
If I average descending.

89
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.610
And now there you go.

90
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.380
OK.

91
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.960
Perfect.

92
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.210
Moving on our final problem same thing although we're just now adding a passing status to a new field

93
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.130
that doesn't exist in either table.

94
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.860
And that says passing if the average grade is greater than 75 or equal to 75 and failing.

95
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.260
If it's less.

96
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.640
So this is a great use for a case statement.

97
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.950
OK.

98
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.870
So let's give it a shot.

99
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.580
This one is very similar to the previous problems.

100
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.030
I'm just going to copy paste it and just rename it problem 5.

101
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.270
So all we need to do is add in another field but this field involves a case statement.

102
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.610
So what I like to do is always do my case.

103
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:43.060
And together case and we'll call this passing was a passing status.

104
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.500
There we go.

105
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.280
OK.

106
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.130
So what do we fill in here.

107
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:58.030
We're basically trying to say when what when average of grade will copy that is greater or equal to

108
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.570
75 then what do we want we want it to be.

109
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:12.030
Passing perfect otherwise you want it to be failing.

110
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.080
And let's see what happens.

111
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.020
OK.

112
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.890
So seems to be working.

113
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.280
Passing passing failing failing failing.

114
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:30.020
One thing to note though is that when we're doing average grade here for some of them it's no.

115
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.850
Remember that.

116
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:39.710
And so it's important to realize we worked with no is no greater than or equal to 75.

117
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:50.680
And the answer is no which is bizarre right versus if we had done is 65 greater than or equal to 75

118
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.040
We get zero or one true or false.

119
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.770
But we're getting no.

120
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.390
When you worked with.

121
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.010
No.

122
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:02.220
Fortunately that is working to our advantage because when we get no here it basically the case statement

123
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.190
moves past it ignores it and does the else.

124
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.290
But it is important to understand that.

125
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:18.730
So you could do something like this if you wanted to be extra careful when average grade is no then

126
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.760
failing.

127
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.450
So that would catch not right away.

128
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.350
Then we have.

129
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.090
OK.

130
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:30.310
When it's a number greater than 75 equal or greater than 75 than passing otherwise that means it's a

131
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.470
number that's less than 75.

132
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.120
And that means failing so we won't see a change in our results here.

133
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.820
Right.

134
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.150
It looks exactly the same.

135
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.580
Passing passing failing failing failing passing passing failing killing failing.

136
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.830
The difference is that we're not relying on this weird comparison between.

137
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.400
No.

138
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.120
Because it is bizarre is no greater than or equal to one.

139
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.640
And it tells us No.

140
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.950
It's just it's useless.

141
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.950
No it is a weird special value that has things like is no.

142
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.130
So let's take advantage of that just to be safe.

143
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.830
All right.

144
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.160
Now we're done.

145
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.400
Hopefully you enjoyed some of that.

146
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.680
It's a little bit different than some of the exercises we've done in the past involves joins but hopefully

147
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.690
it's not too scary.

148
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.530
And if it is I'm sorry just I'm sorry.

149
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.910
Hang in there.
