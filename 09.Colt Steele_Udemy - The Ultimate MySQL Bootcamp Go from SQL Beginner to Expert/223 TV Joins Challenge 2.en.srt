1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,330
OK moving on to our next little challenge here.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,070
So here's what the end result should look like.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,160
We have two fields just like we did in the previous one.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,680
But there is quite a bit of difference if you notice we have titles still.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,570
So that's the same but we only have one entry per series so we don't have you know Archer Archer Archer

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,470
Archer Archer we just have Archer wants somewhere where are you over here.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,520
But we also have average rating.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,140
So this is for all of the reviews all the ratings for a given title put them all together and find the

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,810
average and then the other thing is that the results are then ordered from lowest average to highest.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,830
So basically we're going to work with very similar data and take that same approach join the same two

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:54,480
tables we're joining series with reviews but then we're going to group them together and then we're

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,910
going to average the rating and then we're going to order by average rating and just like the previous

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,930
problem there are certain series that don't have reviews.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,300
They're not showing up here so we don't need to worry about that.

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,670
Well if we're worrying about Knoll's or non-existent data that's not a problem for this particular challenge.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,380
So we're going to call this challenge

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,390
to average rating.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,820
So if we just actually type a very similar thing.

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:37,740
So select title and rating from series join previews on series.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,190
ID equals reviews.

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,740
Series ID.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,470
This is going to get us really close.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,860
We have all the data we need right here.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,390
This is it.

25
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,790
We don't need IDs or we don't need to worry about release scares or genres or anything.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,120
This is all we need.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,200
However we need to group things together so that all Archer reviews are together.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,310
All Arrested Development reviews are together and so on.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,180
So then that begs the question how do we group them what's the best way.

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,060
And there's a couple of approaches that really we could do it based off of the name the title but that

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,610
assumes that there's only one show named Archer one show named Bob's Burgers which is probably true

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,940
ninety nine point nine percent of the time but it's possible that we have shows with the same name.

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,900
Or maybe there's a remake of a show I'm trying to think of.

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,120
I know there's been examples of this where there is an older show that's been remade more recently but

35
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,030
basically it's best to not have to worry about it because we're not making we're not enforcing that

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,680
the name of the show is unique.

37
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,560
If we go to series The only thing that has to be unique is ID.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,030
So it's much better to group based off of that ID.

39
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,920
And of course it's here.

40
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,760
Well we're not seeing it printed out but we can easily see it if we just add in series ID.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,210
So now if we run this you can see we have that ID there.

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:16,700
So even if we had another show named Archer down at the bottom with idea 15 if we grouped by the series

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,460
ID then they'll be unique and they won't you know Muddy the averages and muddy the group.

44
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,850
So that should work fine.

45
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,930
We don't actually need that series idea anymore but we're going to do a group buy and we need to do

46
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,830
series idea that's important.

47
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:44,390
If we just do id that is confusing because it could also be reviews that Id just to showcase that if

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,280
we just select star I'll get rid of the group by just like star.

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,200
You can see even though it's still messy We've got one idea here and we've got another idea here.

50
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,940
So this is the series ID and this here is the reviews ID.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,760
So we need to be explicit.

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,110
OK so let's undo our changes.

53
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,580
Go back to what we had.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:16,910
We're going to group by series ID and if we just do that doesn't get us that far gets us closer but

55
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,660
raiding is just going to be the face for the first one.

56
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,900
Luck of the draw essentially.

57
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,550
It's not an average that's just showing us one rating even though they're grouped by this idea here.

58
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,540
We're still not getting the average and that's a very simple thing to change.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,370
We just need to do average here which we should be comfortable with by now.

60
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,320
And let's give it an alias average rating just like that.

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,530
OK.

62
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,960
Let's take a look.

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Looking good.

64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,440
We've got title an average rating.

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,200
Couple of things.

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,730
One we need to get rid of ID and.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,840
We need to change the order.

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,330
So let's start with a simple one.

69
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,180
Get rid of the ID then let's go ahead.

70
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,920
And at the end add an ORDER BY.

71
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,400
So how do we want to order them.

72
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,120
Well what about just using average rating.

73
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,790
So ordered by average rating.

74
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,630
And then what order do we want.

75
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:23,980
We can work with the default ascending order because that's what I have here from 5.3 eight up to nine

76
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,100
point nine.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,100
And there we go.

78
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,840
Five point 3:08 up to nine point nine.

79
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,790
Now that's basically the end.

80
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,850
But I do want to highlight that these reviews are a little bit accurate in my opinion at least.

81
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,230
General Hospital not my favorite show only gets five point three on average probably well deserved.

82
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm sorry if that's shoke close to your heart but I want to highlight.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,350
Amazing show that nobody watches called Halt And Catch Fire.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,480
I mean look at this has a 9.9.

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,810
How did that even happen.

86
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,810
I mean who decided that that's real data coming from real people millions of ratings and the average

87
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,700
is nine point nine.

88
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,580
Fantastic.

89
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,040
OK.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,160
But really this is a great show.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,310
Nobody watches it.

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,090
I highly encourage you to watch it especially if you have any interest in computers the history of computers

93
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,180
history of the Internet.

94
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,280
Although I will say Season One is a little slow but hang in there if you do want to watch it.

95
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,130
All right.

96
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,540
So we're moving on to our next problem in the next video.

97
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,700
Watch out and catch fire.
