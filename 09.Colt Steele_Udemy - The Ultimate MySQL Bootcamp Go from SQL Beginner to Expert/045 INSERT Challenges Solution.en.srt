1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,630
OK let's take a look at a potential solution for this people problem.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,110
So first thing we need to create the table using the create table statement with first name as a VAR

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,500
char 20 last name var char with the 20 character limit and age as an int.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,120
So let's do that.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm just working in the cat app for now.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,140
It's fine.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,810
We're going to do this at the end.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,530
So we'll start off with the create table and we'll call it people

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:45,920
and the first thing that we'll have is first name which is FAR FAR FAR char 20.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,540
Next thing is last name which is the exact same.

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,130
And then finally we have age which is an ant and then our closing parentheses.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,010
OK let's just double check it worked.

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,190
Use describe people call first name us name age Farje of our char.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,860
It's perfect.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,080
So now we're going to insert our first person Tina Belcher who is 13.

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,820
So insert into people and we'll start off.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:34,220
Let's do first name last name age and then values and we'll do.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:42,370
Tina Belcher was 13 right.

19
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,110
OK we hit enter.

20
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,270
Just double checked that it worked.

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,390
Select star from people there.

22
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,900
Tina is perfect.

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,990
Now we're going to insert our second person Bob Belcher who is 42 and my instruction here was do it

24
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,530
in a different order.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:14,250
So we'll do an insert into people this time let's do it Age last name first name

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,020
values.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,090
So age was hired God he's 42.

28
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,340
Last name is Belcher and first name is Bob.

29
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,640
Don't forget our semi-colon.

30
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,830
Let's do our select again.

31
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,010
Perfect.

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,670
It worked out.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,750
It was supposed to be great.

34
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,150
So then the last insert we're going to do is a multiple insert.

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,430
We have Linda Belcher Philip Fronde and Calvin Fisher.

36
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,890
Oh boy this is going to be a lot to remember.

37
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,860
Let's start off by just typing out the basics.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:02,820
Insert into people and we'll do this one with first name then my last name and then finally age just

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,110
like that.

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,710
Then we'll do values and we'll start off half.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,440
We'll start off with Linda Belcher who is forty five I think it was.

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,960
And I'll do Comus on the new line and then we'll go with Phillip Fronde

43
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,880
and he is 45.

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,400
No.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,630
Thirty eight.

46
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,800
I mean is this too hard.

47
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,680
Lastly we have Calvin fish Jodra.

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,530
I'm just going to copy fish owner who is 70 Calvin

49
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,660
fish over 70.

50
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,020
All righty.

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,770
And before I forget I need a semi-colon.

52
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,860
Perfect.

53
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,230
Let's do our select star again.

54
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:11,340
Have to use up arrow a couple of times and we have Linda Phillippe and Calvin Belcher Fronde fish over

55
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,410
40 5:38 70.

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,730
Perfect.

57
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,740
So that's it.

58
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,870
And I didn't specify this in the instructions but let's go ahead and delete the table.

59
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,430
So that's a drop table people.

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,740
Goodbye to the Belchers and the other two and we verify that it's gone.

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,700
If you tried to do select start from people we get an error but if we do show tables.

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,310
Now we only have cats.

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,630
All people are gone.

64
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,980
Just left with cat.
