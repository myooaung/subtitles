00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.670
OK.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.990
So the last little bit of syntax we'll learn and this section has to do with deleting tables.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.390
We've seen how to create tables we've seen how to describers show their columns.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.710
We haven't seen how to put anything in those tables yet.

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.900
That's coming up next in the next section.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.810
But the last thing we'll do is see how we delete them.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.910
So think to yourself for a moment.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.000
What's your guess about how you delete a table.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.310
My hint is that it's pretty similar to how we've seen how to delete something else before.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.670
In my school.

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.260
OK.

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.420
So think about that and I'll just wait here for a second I guess.

13
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.610
Did you make coffee right.

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.200
So the magic is drop table and then the table name.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.720
So rather than drop database we're going to say drop table and then cats.

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.120
In our case.

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.010
So just to prove to you that that works.

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.820
Let's give it a shot.

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.360
Back in cloud nine.

20
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.730
I will type drop table.

21
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.250
And this is permanent.

22
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920
It's going to disappear.

23
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.580
It tells us queery OK.

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.030
To make sure that it's actually gone.

25
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.710
We could use a couple of different things.

26
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.870
It's up to you.

27
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.120
We can do show tables.

28
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.300
And it tells us empty set.

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.600
There are no tables here.

30
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.370
Whereas before when we did that we got data and if we tried to describe cats now we get an error because

31
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.400
cats no longer exists so it can't even show us the columns because it doesn't exist.

32
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.080
So that's all there is to dropping or deleting a table.

33
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.840
Very similar to dropping a database.
