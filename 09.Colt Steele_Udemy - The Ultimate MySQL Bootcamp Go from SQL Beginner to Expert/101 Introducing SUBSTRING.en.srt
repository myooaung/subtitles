1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,820
Next up in this onslaught of string functions is substring.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,530
So substring allows us to select individual part portions of a string.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,140
I only want the first character.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,230
I only want the middle 10 characters or the last character so on.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,590
So the syntax is similar.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,610
Chicken cat.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,640
Here's an example.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,410
In this case we're not working with columns or tables or anything.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,150
We're just working with static data.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
Hello world.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,540
And with this will do.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,290
Select.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,860
So there's our selector again and then substring our string function in parentheses.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,820
In this example the first thing we do is tell it here's the string we want to work with.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,170
So that first thing is Hello world.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,260
And then what we're going to do is only print out the substring the portion from 1 to 4.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,020
So those are indices referring to characters.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,260
And in my ask you Will they start at 1 if you're familiar with other programming languages.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,790
They often start at zero.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,070
That's not the case here.

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,380
So h is one.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,530
So we go from 1 to 4 to 1 2 3 4 which gives us hell.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,270
I'm sorry that is a bad word to me.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,400
So hello world one before it gives us that.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,910
But that's not the only way of using it.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,140
Here's another example.

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,980
Select substring hello world the same starting piece of data and this time we give it is 1 number 1

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,040
index 7.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,820
So if we count one two three four five space is six seven is that W..

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,470
You might think it's only going to give us that W but that's not true.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,410
It gives us from that W on to the end.

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,020
So if you only pass in one number rather than 2 It starts from whatever that index is and just goes

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,880
to the end.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,530
So let's try a couple out.

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:02,700
We'll do a select substring and we'll just do the hello world example that we just saw it will go from

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,340
1 to 4.

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,660
So we already know the answer here.

38
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,990
Hope there's hell as you can see.

39
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,510
One two three four.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,810
We get help.

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,320
So if we change that from let's do three to eight we get a low Oreille.

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,630
So that's one way of using it.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,810
And then the next way as we saw is if we just leave that second or third argument off and we just say

44
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,320
hello world comet 3.

45
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,380
It will go from the third character or one to three to the end.

46
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:42,990
So we get low world or in the case that I showed you seven we get world and there's one more way that

47
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,360
we can use it which is to actually give it a negative number negative index.

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,270
So what do you think will happen.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,170
I give it negative 3.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,710
Hello world.

51
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,240
Well if the answer to that we get RLT So it starts from the end of the string and it goes from one negative

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,030
one excuse me to negative 2 to negative 3 and includes all of them.

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
So R L D.

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,920
We try that give negative three.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,420
You can see we get R L D and if we did negative 7 would go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 to this.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,950
Oh and we get 0 world.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,270
So that's how we do it with just static data.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,470
But now let's say we wanted to work with a column.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,030
So in our case let's take the example of title.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,090
So let me just do a select star from actually that's just like title from books.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,800
So we've got a variety of like some titles right short ones like white noise Coraline long ones like

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,310
what we talk about when we talk about love stories.

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,800
Let's say I wanted to just print out.

64
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,790
I don't know the first 10 characters of every title maybe.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,460
You know you've probably seen that before when you're on a shop and if there's a long title the whole

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,450
thing isn't printed out.

67
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,660
There's just you know a couple words and then dot dot dot or read more something like that that you

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,420
can click on.

69
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,390
We'll do something similar.

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,140
So to limit this what we do let's just take this as an example.

71
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:28,410
We can do a select substring will give it the whole title and then we only want from 0 to 10 or from

72
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,430
1 to 10 excuse me we could do that.

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,220
And this actually here's another error that I considered editing out but I've decided not to because

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,860
it is worth taking note of.

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,220
The problem is that it thinks that I'm still in a quote because I have this opening quote and this closing

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,700
quote.

77
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,280
But in between I have another quote which is actually an apostrophe in this case.

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,990
So this is not going to work if I do this I'll just exit out and just ignore that.

79
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,970
But I have to read you the whole line and rather than using single quotes I'll use double quotes like

80
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:16,600
this where I'm calling from selected stories just like that.

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,180
All right.

82
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,250
And then I'll get rid of this other quote I put at the end.

83
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
So that is important just to take note of when you're working with strings.

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,710
If you have a quotation mark in there you've got to work around it.

85
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,940
So I do this and you can see it give me where I'm.

86
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,970
Yes this is 10 characters maybe isn't long enough.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,660
But we're just going to work with that.

88
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,830
So now to do it to every single title it works just like we did with King cat.

89
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:54,870
We're going to do a select substring title comma one comment 10 from books and that's it.

90
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,620
And there we go.

91
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:04,880
Now we have this ugly heading up here so we could do it as again as in let's just say short title like

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,400
that.

93
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,380
Now we get this short title blah blah blah.

94
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,440
The names say North Smith American GI a hologram.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,970
Some of these actually work in a circle.

96
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,760
There we go.

97
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,130
Just good.

98
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,980
All right.

99
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,000
So one other thing I'll show you.

100
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,630
There is a shortcut it's a very small shortcut but you can type substrate.

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,570
Su B SDR.

102
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,080
I don't use this all that often because I can really remember what the short cut is because in some

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,070
languages there'll be substring where it's SU b s t.

104
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,810
There's some I've seen s b s t.

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,430
It's just not clear which characters get cut out because it's not just all vowels because we have a

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,470
use still anyway so if you would like you can use this I can just show you if you replace that would

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,940
you select substring and just change substring to be substrata it does the same exact thing.

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,100
But what I also want to show you is that we can combine concat and substring or any of the string operators

109
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,050
or the string functions you'll see.

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,470
So let's say I wanted to add a dot dot dot after this.

111
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,570
So it looks like this short title the name say dot dot dot rather than just an abrupt cut off at a dot

112
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,750
dot dot.

113
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,260
So hopefully you can identify what we need to do is first chop our string.

114
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,800
Use a substring 9:59 and then concatenate that with dot dot dot.

115
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,780
So I'll do this in a separate file.

116
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll go ahead and make a new file and I'll just call it something silly like code that as well.

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,270
So we know we're going to do is select and there's going to be a king cat in there.

118
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,200
And what we're going to concat is the short title.

119
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,690
So again this is wrong.

120
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,740
What I'm typing but I just want to put a placeholder.

121
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,660
The short title with a dot dot dot from books.

122
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,630
So this won't do anything right now.

123
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,540
We need to replace this with how we actually achieve that short title.

124
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,450
And that's going to be with a substring.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:24,030
So in here we type substring and we want to put title in there comma and we want it to go from 1 to

126
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,820
10.

127
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,080
So this looks like a lot it's pretty ugly to format it a little nicer.

128
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,680
We can do this depends on how intense you want to be about it.

129
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,680
I like to just do it like this here.

130
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,450
So substring is our first argument.

131
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,340
Comma dot dot dot.

132
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,360
The second one from books.

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,670
So if you look at it you can see the order things are going to happen.

134
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,500
So substring is going to happen first for every title so that will be the name say or American G.

135
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:01,110
And that will be concatenated with dot dot dot and that will run for every single book in our database

136
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
from books.

137
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,060
So if we save that we could either source the file or just copy and paste it.

138
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,790
So let's do that.

139
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:15,150
Now we do source book code data as well.

140
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,920
And there we go.

141
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,460
The name say dot dot dot Norse myth dot dot dot dot dot dot dot.

142
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:31,830
But you see if we get this really hideous title appear so let's put in as we'll call it as short a title

143
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,540
save again rerun it.

144
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,400
Now we get this much much nicer short title the name say dot dot dot and so on.

145
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,100
All right.

146
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,320
So that's all there is to substring.

147
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,060
But the tricky thing in my opinion is just knowing that you can combine them.

148
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,260
So it takes a little bit of getting used to.

149
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,730
But again the way it works is whatever's on the inside first will be evaluated.

150
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,410
So substring will happen first and then that will be concatenated with this.

151
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,350
So that's it.

152
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,460
We have a couple more and then we'll do some challenges.
