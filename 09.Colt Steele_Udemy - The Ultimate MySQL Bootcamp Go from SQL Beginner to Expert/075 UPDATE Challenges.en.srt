1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,440
So it's your turn.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,820
We have a couple of pretty painless I hope update exercises.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,130
They should be pretty quick.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:15,080
So the first one here is to change Jackson's name to Jack.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:23,400
Once you've done that can move on to the next one which is to change Ringo's breed to British Shorthair.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,950
And then finally update both Maine Coons ages to be 12.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,870
So there are two cats that have breed of Maine Coon.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,850
Make them both 12.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,600
OK.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,760
So in the next video we'll talk about answers.
