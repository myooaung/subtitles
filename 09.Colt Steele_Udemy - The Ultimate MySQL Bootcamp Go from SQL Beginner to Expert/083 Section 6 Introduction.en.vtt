Hey welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.390
So this section is a bit different than everything else.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.150
I mean I guess you could say that for every section hopefully.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.610
But the structure is pretty different because it's all challenges it's all exercises.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.830
So the way that this will work is you're going to practice all the commands you've seen up until this

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.280
point.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.730
Everything from creating a database and switching and using the database to creating your tables and

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.840
defining schema to then doing that basic Kroto operations we've talked about creating reading updating

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.940
and deleting data all that stuff all those commands that are associated with that you'll be practicing

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.040
them all at once.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.020
In this section and it's not just one giant video I broke it up into kind of logical hopefully sections

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.990
that make sense.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.470
They'll go through you know the Create section will create data together and then you'll do exercises

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.130
with it and we'll be working with all the same data.

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.910
So we get all the same answers which is really important that you know if you're following along and

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.520
you're trying to update something that your update looks the same as mine.

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.390
So the data that we'll be working with has to do with inventory management has to do with let's say

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.310
a clothing company an online clothing retailer or maybe just our closet.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.430
We're just doing a inventory of my closet I need to figure out what fits what doesn't fit what colors

20
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.230
are there what shirts have holes.

21
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.730
I didn't know what to give away to charity what to burn in a pile if that's what you do.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.960
All that stuff.

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.040
And you know we all have different types of shirts.

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.800
I got props again.

25
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.450
You know short sleeves we've got long sleeves and the under appreciated and elusive three quarter length

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.810
sleeve.

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.010
Not to mention things like you know Hawaiian shirts or even Hawaiian shirts of different colors to he

28
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.650
didn't see that coming like that.

29
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.200
Another Hawaiian shirt.

30
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.030
Yeah.

31
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.630
Should probably stop this video of him.

32
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.590
So let's get on with the exercises.

33
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.410
Coming up a whole bunch of exercises around Schertz.
