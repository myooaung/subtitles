00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.190
All right so we've covered the C and the and crud create and read now we're moving onto the you.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.770
Which stands for update.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.120
So how do we update or alter existing data in our database.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870
We've inserted something and maybe we made a mistake.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.870
We want to change it but it's not always a mistake in our application.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.500
Let's say we have users think about when you're updating your password you forgot to password as a user.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.130
So you click the forget password link and you reset your password.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
Well that needs to be changed to the database or you change your profile picture on Facebook or you

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.740
change your ID on a relationship status or something.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.750
All of that requires updating.

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.010
So how do we do it.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.070
And the answer is that we use probably the longest sequel command you've seen so far.

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.720
There's multiple parts but the key words are update set and where.

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.800
So we've already seen where this is where we tell my Eskew will which items in particular we want to

15
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.170
select to update.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.920
So in this case this entire line here is going to find in the cafe table all the cast who have a breed

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.440
of Tabby and we're going to change that breed to be short hair.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.380
So again we have update and a table name then set.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.340
And this is a list of the changes we want to make.

20
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.060
So in this case I'm setting the breed to be short here and then who do we want to or who is wrong way

21
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.870
of saying it but what do we want to perform it on.

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.360
What does the actual data in this case breed equals tabby.

23
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.640
So I will go ahead and just copy this line move over here and if I do a select star from cat you can

24
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.520
see that we have two Tabby's right now Ringo and misty.

25
00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.300
I paste this line and update cat changed their breed to be short hair if their breed is Tabby and now

26
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.880
we select star again.

27
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.580
You can see that both Tabby's are previously Tabby's are now shorthairs Misty and or excuse me Ringo

28
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.930
and Misty.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240
So here's another example.

30
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.470
Let's say I wanted to change Misty's age to be 14 right now Misty is 13 and we realize I don't know

31
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.460
we realize that her dental records are wrong.

32
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.560
Apparently you can tell how well the cat is from their dental or from their teeth.

33
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.910
So we misjudged how old she was and we want to make her 14 now so to do that looks like this.

34
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.220
Update The cat's table set age to be 14.

35
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790
We don't need quotes this time because we're working with a number and integer and we only want to do

36
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.380
that if name is Mysti.

37
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.330
So let's try it

38
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.180
now.

39
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.440
So let's start again.

40
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.740
Or actually you want to be more specific.

41
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:10.550
We could do select star from cat where name equals Misty.

42
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.060
Let's try that again without that extra L at the end.

43
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.410
You can see Misty is now 14 rather than 13.

44
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
The last thing that I'll mention about updating is that there is a good rule of thumb that you should

45
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.050
follow when you're updating something you should make sure that you're targeting the right data before

46
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.100
you actually do the update.

47
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.200
So basically run the Select the equivalent select using your where query and once you make sure that

48
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.810
returns the data you expect then update it just so that you avoid accidentally updating the wrong data.

49
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.860
And the same holds true when we're talking about deleting which will do in just a moment but the core

50
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.350
idea is that there is no undo button so you could update something back manually if you messed it up

51
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.610
but you always want to just make sure you're targeting what you mean to target before you hit enter

52
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.120
on your update.
