00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,080
A there it's me again it's time for yet another one of these videos.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,360
This time we are diving into Section 3 a really important section.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,990
And yes you could probably say that about everything in this course but this is where we really get

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,530
going.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,920
It's really crucial in the last section.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,520
It's true.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,930
We did run our first my su command.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,790
But if we're being honest they're a little bit underwhelming kind of lame.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,090
They didn't do much in this section that actually changes.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,600
We see our first commands around data.

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,440
So we'll be able to make a new database or do a database and then inside of those databases we'll start

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,820
working with tables which are kind of the fundamental structure in all of school and my.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,140
So really important stuff.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,640
And by the end of this section will actually throw out the entire section or sprinkled a bunch of exercises

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,760
around you know commands that will learn things like creating databases using and switching to databases

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,360
and then creating tables and describing tables.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,290
So a bunch of challenges coming up.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,060
But like I said this is a really important turning point where we actually get past all the garbage

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,490
around setting stuff up installing.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,270
Now we're actually doing real my of stuff.

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,280
So let's get going.
