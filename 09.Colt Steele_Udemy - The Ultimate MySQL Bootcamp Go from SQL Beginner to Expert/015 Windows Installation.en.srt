00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,540
Warning this video may contain extremely frustrating installation instructions for experienced developers

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,710
only it's advise that you install use in cloud 9 to avoid Nuvo period.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,330
All right.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,750
If you're still here after the stern warning I'll talk about how to install my ask you out on Windows.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,660
Of course remember you will probably run into some sort of issue depending on your computer and what

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,140
you have installed already.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,640
It can be difficult.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,910
So that's why I really really really recommend that you use Clubine skip windows until the end of the

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,560
course.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,570
OK that's enough of a broken record.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,490
Let's get started.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,230
So to install my ask you all on a PC you need to go to my s q l dot com and then click on the download

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,910
section and then click on community and other community.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,690
You can actually click on any of these if you click on download what it's going to suggest for you if

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,380
you're a Windows user is that you actually use the Maia's installer rather than downloading things individually.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,090
Basically it's a package that will help install a bunch of my Escuela things all at once that you may

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,890
or may not use that you may or may not need.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,750
Make sure that you have the correct version selected depending on your architecture.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,690
And click down.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,950
And it looks like it starts downloading but it actually doesn't.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,390
You have to click another button at the bottom.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,960
No thanks.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,370
Just start my download and then fast forward through this takes a little bit to download Panay on the

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,120
Internet.

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,810
But then once it's done all you want to do is open it up run the installer.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,530
OK.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,940
So then we have a couple of options.

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,960
We're going to select developer default and then click next and then depending on what you have installed

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
in the computer you may need to actually install some other requirements.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,710
So I did hear.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,600
So I basically had to go through a couple of times.

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,420
Double click click execute.

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,210
Wait for something else to go install.

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,000
In this case visual C++ and then I had to repeat that a couple of different times.

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,840
Now that will probably be different for you and your machine but then once it finishes click on execute

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,560
again.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,190
And this will actually start the installation process.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,530
So there's a bunch of components installing But once they're complete click next.

39
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,540
And then we move on to configuration and all we really care about is configuring the server.

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,670
So we'll click Next again.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,780
Basically click next.

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,210
Another time we don't need to change anything.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,510
And further another time.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,470
Click next.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:15,800
OK.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,370
So we're now at the point where we need to decide on a root password for my as well.

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,700
So you can decide on whatever you like.

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,110
I just chose password the word password.

49
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,620
It's not a good password but I want to make it simple easy to remember.

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,200
So you type it in twice tells me that it's weak.

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,940
And then I'm also going to add a user here.

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
You don't have to do this.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,530
I'm just going to make one with the name Colts and also the password will be password and then confirm

54
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,720
the password also tells me that it's weak and I'll click OK.

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,210
So really all that you need to do is remember whatever password you type for the root and then click

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,020
next and then we'll click Next one more time.

57
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,120
And then finally again will click execute and it will start to apply the configuration.

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,630
And it may take a moment or two.

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,150
Then once it finishes everything should be installed.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,980
So I'll click Finish and then get out of here.

61
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,560
So that's how we install.

62
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,680
Next important thing is starting up the command line client which you can find just under my ass Q Will

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,940
command line client.

64
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,480
Click on it and then you'll need to enter your root password which in my case was Password.

65
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,660
And now we're able to actually type some code something like show databases which we haven't talked

66
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,680
about but you can type code in there.

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
You can also try typing things that aren't sequel and you'll see you get error messages but all that

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,830
we really need to care about is that we have the command line client up and running and we can type

69
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,570
stuff into it.
