1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,510
OK.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,520
So next up we have another nice clean table just three results.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,590
And as you can see what we're doing here is grabbing things based off of genre.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,750
So we only have three.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,320
Fortunately animation comedy and drama.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,880
And then what we're doing is computing the average review the average rating for each of those genres.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,580
So this will be a little similar to what we've already done earlier and this problem said the main difference

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,600
is that we're working with genre now rather than just the title of a given series.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,790
OK.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,160
One thing I def need to correct the record here called this challenge five.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,370
I was wrong.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,870
After four after three comes four now we're on Challenge five.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,740
OK.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,670
And we'll just call this genre average ratings.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,280
OK.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,480
So to get this information from our three tables the two that were that we need to identify that we're

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,520
working with are the series table because that's where our genre information is stored.

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,750
And then the reviews table that where ratings information is stored.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,790
So we don't care about the reviewers the people who review them.

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,690
That doesn't matter.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,020
All we need is genres.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,070
And then the ratings so we can start with either one.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:21,370
Let's start with Star from series just like that.

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,720
OK.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,630
So we're going to want to work with is the genre portion but we're going to need to join with the reviews

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,450
table so we'll just do that now.

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,810
So let's start from series.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,830
Join revues.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,170
Hopefully this seems familiar now.

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:49,020
On series ID equals revues dot series ID and if we leave a star in there we're going to get a lot of

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,950
stuff so we don't need all that.

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:00,310
Let's just pick out a few things like title Johnna and rating.

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,380
OK.

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,460
So now we can see we've got you know all the ratings for Archer all animation of course because they're

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,730
the same exact row here with a relevant rating appended So join them together.

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,760
It's an inner join and that's what we want.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,640
We don't want to be working with you know non-existent ratings.

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,870
We don't want to take let's say What was it.

39
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,180
Pushing Daisies which didn't have any reviews Well that's a comedy I believe.

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,130
Maybe it's a draw.

41
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,960
I don't remember.

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,090
But whatever it is we don't want to try an average No into the average rating for dramas so the average

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,040
rating for comedy.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,210
So we don't want to do a left join you on.

45
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,170
OK.

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,620
So we've got this on Sirius ID.

47
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,330
Blah blah blah blah blah.

48
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,460
Now all we need to do is group things by genre.

49
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,170
That's what we're trying to do here rather than by title group by genre

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,540
and if we do that we should see this is immediately reduced down to three rows.

51
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,310
Although remember that it's just kind of hiding all the data that lies beneath.

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,450
So we have animation here but that doesn't mean that there's only one.

53
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,510
It's just that gripped by when you when you use a group by it's displayed in a very weird awkward way

54
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,480
that I think is kind of confusing but what we want to do is rather than we can get rid of the title

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,130
to it rather than just genre rating.

56
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,430
We just want average rating and that should do it for us and we get the average ratings.

57
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:47,540
There's an alias so I can add that in like that and that's it.

58
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,970
So now we get animation.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,860
It's the lowest rated still quite high comedy is the highest rated 8.1.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,980
And drama is right in the middle.

61
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,240
8.0.

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,810
And I suppose this is as good a time as any to introduce the round function.

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,340
We haven't used it yet but we're getting a lot of decimals here and we don't we don't care about them

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,600
let's just round it to two decimal places.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,470
So it looks like this round and I'll do it on separate lines here.

66
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,930
So we have round average rating but we don't just say round average rating we have to supply what we

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,380
want around to two digits for us and then we'll use ads for trading.

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,480
So I could have done it all in one line in gigantic gross line in my opinion.

69
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,330
So it's a little better to break it up like this takes up more space but it's a price we pay.

70
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:43,880
OK.

71
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,690
So around the average two digits and call it average rating.

72
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,830
Now let's double check that works.

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,940
And there we go much easier.

74
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,770
You didn't have to do that of course but it figured it was a good thing to show.
