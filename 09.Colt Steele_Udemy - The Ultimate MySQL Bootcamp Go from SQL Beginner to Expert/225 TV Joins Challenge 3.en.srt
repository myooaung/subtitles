1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:00,890
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,290
Moving on from the title an average rating challenge we now have something new for the first time we're

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,060
working with reviewers.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,860
So what we have here is the first name of a reviewer the last name and then their rating.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,550
So for every single rating that's been given we want to have the rating or for every review that's been

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,800
given out the rating.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,820
And the first and last name of the reviewer who gave that rating.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,390
So it's pretty similar to what we did up here with movies and ratings or series and ratings.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,000
Except now we're working with the other tape.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,610
So if we have these three tables right we've worked with let's go back here.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,050
We've worked with series and reviews together.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,330
Now we're working with reviewers and reviews so the outer two.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,320
So let's get started on this one.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,130
We will pop over here and just write challenge three.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,760
Obviously the most important part of this entire video.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,040
So we know we want to work with.

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,910
Let's start with reviewers.

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,310
That's the first thing you want to work with.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's take a look at those seven reviewers.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,380
OK.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,570
So for every review that these reviewers have written we want to see the corresponding rating.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,230
And another side note I deliberately put in a reviewer who hasn't written any reviews.

23
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,380
We'll get to him or her in a little bit.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,190
But we don't care about that one.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,000
In this case.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,520
So for this problem we don't need to worry about that.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:33,980
OK.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,440
So we've got to start from reviewers and then let's just do a select start from reviews.

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,630
And all we want to do is take these reviewer ideas.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,710
Let's take three for Kimbra and find all the matches where reviewer ID is three so here's one here's

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,440
one here's one.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,720
As you can see Cloud Nine is actually highlighting them for me which is really nice.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:10,010
So we want to join on this right here so we want to join between reviewers and reviews where reviewer

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,930
ID is equal to reviews dot Ruut reviewer idea.

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,920
A lot of review saying that over and over is a bit of a tongue twister.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:28,560
So it's like star from reviewers and we'll do a joyn reviews on.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,740
And we want to do reviewer ID equals revues dot.

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,250
If she were ID.

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,940
It's a mouthful but hopefully it makes some sense you're starting to identify the patterns behind these

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,270
joints.

41
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,370
We've been doing this a couple of times now between the last section and this section.

42
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,930
So we're joining the two tables where reviewer ID is the same as a reviewer.

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,000
ID is the same as reviews review reviewer ID and what do you know that the same thing without the mess

44
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,640
that they just warned you about.

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,630
OK now I want to fix that.

46
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,460
We have a giant list for every review that's been made.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,030
Over here we have the corresponding first last name and ID of the reviewer.

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,180
It is just more information than we needed to get because all we asked for was first name last name

49
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,140
and rating.

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,800
So let's now whittle it down.

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:38,460
So rather than star will select first name last name and rating just like that and now we get the right

52
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,290
result.

53
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,360
So I have a quick question which is what type of joint is this.

54
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,690
When we leave off the inner it's still implied.

55
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,800
So it's an inner join the intersection of those two circles the two tables.

56
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,360
And so because it's an inner join the Order doesn't actually matter.

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,260
So just to prove that to you first here's what we had before.

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,170
What you expect.

59
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:11,540
Now let's do the same thing but let's select from revues inner join reviewers.

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,990
OK.

61
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,830
So if we leave this at a star which is what we had before.

62
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,700
You can see that the order that our data is actually kind of printed in the basic sense when we use

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,390
start is different.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,140
Right we have on the left the reviews and then the reviewers on the right.

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,310
But when we're hand picking things that we want like first name must have been reading.

66
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,970
It doesn't matter because we're dictating the order.

67
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,870
I'm saying I want first name then last name then rating.

68
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,610
So as long as the data is in the right place which both of these do they're combining them.

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,850
Whether we're doing a revues inner join reviewers or reviewers inner join reviews the same data is there

70
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,980
and then all we're doing is cherry picking what we want.

71
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,280
So both of these work just fine.
