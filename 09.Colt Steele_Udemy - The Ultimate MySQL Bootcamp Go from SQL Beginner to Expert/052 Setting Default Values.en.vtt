00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.520
OK so we're moving on in this video.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.190
We're talking about default values.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.160
What's up with this part right here.

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.930
Default So as we talked about a little bit in the last video it's helpful to be able to decide or to

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.590
set default values.

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.340
So if something is not specified that there will be a fallback.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.220
And here's how we do it.

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.690
We use default.

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.190
So you can see both of these when we're defining a table default and then we specify a default.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.150
So for name if you leave off name I just said OK we'll call it unnamed or name to be determined sometimes

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.780
if this is a cat shelter in the real world sometimes they decide on a name a little bit later once they

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
figure out the cat's personality and then for age if this is more of a silly example but if we wanted

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.830
to if you didn't specify age we could always set it to be ninety nine.

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.070
Not sure why but for the sake of this exercise we're going to do it.

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.490
So let's give it a shot.

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.180
Remaking a new cats table cat 3.

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.590
OK here we go.

18
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.540
So create table cats 3 and I'll do a new line here.

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.140
And we will have a name for our car.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.800
Let's do 20 even though my slides say 100.

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.440
It's OK.

22
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.690
Default in our default will be.

23
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.240
That's a no name provided.

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.750
How about that.

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.690
It's important that whatever you put here matches the data type so we couldn't say the default is the

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.860
number 100.

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.130
And then we'll have our Khama age and age isn't it.

28
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.790
Default should be 99 perfect clothes that.

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.030
Now if we do our describe cats 3 Here we go.

30
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.760
So we have default no provided default 99 for H.

31
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.380
Awesome.

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.700
OK so now let's give it a shot let's do insert into Cat 3 and I'll do.

33
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.260
Age only.

34
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.320
And no name and age will be let's do 13 just like that.

35
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.170
What do you think will happen going to insert a new cat into Cat 3 which is right here only for fighting

36
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.000
age and name has a default value of no name provided.

37
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.640
Ok I did it.

38
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.720
Now let's look like Star from Cat 3.

39
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.760
And I get no name provided.

40
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.670
Perfect.

41
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.000
So we have a default value that's working great.

42
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.080
We could do the same thing for age.

43
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.330
Feel free to skip this if you feel like you know exactly what's going to happen.

44
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.900
I'll leave.

45
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.960
Let's leave both off this time and certain to catch three values.

46
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.440
Now when we select.

47
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.720
We have another unnamed cat this time who is ninety nine years old by default.

48
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.830
So the next thing that I want to talk about here is another version of creating a table for cats for

49
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.470
this time.

50
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.820
And I combined not know all along side default.

51
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.420
Otherwise it's the same so we have name our car default this unnamed age it default that's 99.

52
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.040
But I didn't not no.

53
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.180
And as I wrote here you might be thinking isn't this redundant because if we have a default value it's

54
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.470
already saying it won't be no.

55
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:57.720
If we go back and we look at cat's regular cat if we do an insert into cats just like this.

56
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:08.240
And if you can remember all the way back to cats we have no default provided and you select star from

57
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.730
cats we get.

58
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.130
No no there's no default values.

59
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.910
And then when we have our cat 3 when I insert something like this right here incertain to Cat 3 it's

60
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.530
totally empty.

61
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.010
We have those defaults.

62
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.140
So when I select star ups from Cat 3 we get no name provided.

63
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.410
Ninety nine.

64
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.000
So why would we want to add.

65
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.970
Not no.

66
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.680
And the answer is that we could still manually set something to be no.

67
00:04:46.130 --> 00:05:00.140
So if I did that here let's do insert into Cat 3 and I'll do name and age name and age values and I

68
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.180
will say there's no name or let's say name is what's another state in Montana.

69
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.960
It's not too bad for a cat's name.

70
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.650
Great state by the way.

71
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.170
And we'll leave age as no explicitly no.

72
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.230
Just like that.

73
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.900
That to do so like star from got three and you can see that there is nothing stopping us from setting

74
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.010
age to be no all that we have it's a default value if you don't specify something it will be 99.

75
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.980
But you're allowed to say no I'm allowed to say this is explicitly an empty value.

76
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.880
OK.

77
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.320
So that's where this comes in name for which are not.

78
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.850
No.

79
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.050
And a default.

80
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.780
And I won't make you sit through me typing that whole thing.

81
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.700
So I'll just copy it but to walk through it again.

82
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.520
Same thing here.

83
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.420
Same with the default We just did not know and not know.

84
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.040
So let's go ahead paste this in.

85
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.190
This is Katz for this time.

86
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:15.830
If I do describe cat 4 we now have no is no on both and we have a default on both.

87
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.750
So we're almost there.

88
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.860
I know spend a little bit of a long video.

89
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:31.450
Let's do a insert into cat 4 and we will specify name and then age.

90
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:41.590
And this time if I do values AUPs and I say name is what's in it.

91
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.630
Let's do Cali fine.

92
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.410
Sort of a state name and age is no.

93
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.150
If I do this this time we get an error.

94
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.650
So not just a warning but an error saying it cannot be No.

95
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.760
And that's what not.

96
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.300
No specifies so important to note that you'll use not know pretty often.

97
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.880
It's a way of basically requiring that something has a value but also saying that it's not allowed to

98
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.380
be know itself which I also included as a slide here in Cat 3.

99
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.140
We can manually insert something as.
