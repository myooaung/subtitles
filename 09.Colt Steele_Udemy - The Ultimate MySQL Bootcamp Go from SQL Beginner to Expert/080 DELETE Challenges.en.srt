1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,100
So it's your turn here.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,320
We're going to get some practice with it delete.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,170
So we have three different things that like to do the first one is to delete all cats that are four

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,060
years old.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,730
So if we look at our data there's only one right now because we got rid of egg.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,130
But I would like you.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,960
So don't just say delete Ringo or wear breed as British Shorthair or ideas one but use age then the

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,250
next is to delete cats whose age is the same as their cat ID.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,540
Now I had to do something similar to this with the select exercises.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,790
Now you need to put that together with the.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,470
So in our case it's only Jack at this point so Jack has an idea of 7 and age of 7.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,380
But once again no cheating.

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,480
Don't just select based off of name or breed do it the way I specified please.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,540
I mean it's up to you but the way I recommend.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,140
Next up is to.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,110
Oh my gosh.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,970
All cats.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,940
So that thing that I said I wasn't going to do because I didn't want to eat all of our data.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,770
Well you're going gonna do it and then we'll be starting with a whole bunch of new data in the next

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,220
exercise.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,730
Give it a shot.
