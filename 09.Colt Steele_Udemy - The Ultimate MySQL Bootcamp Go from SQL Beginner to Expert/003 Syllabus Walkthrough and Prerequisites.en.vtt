00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.930
So what I'd like to do in this video is take a quick tour or walk through of the syllabus.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
Talk about the curriculum what the Course covers and what it doesn't cover and at the same time it's

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.530
a good place to talk about prerequisites.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.080
If there's any experience you need for this course in the short answer is no but there's a longer answer.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.870
There are a couple of things that might be helpful.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.680
So the way I'd like to do this rather than just talking to you sitting at my desk is to actually use

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.740
the magic of editing or a high tech fancy skills here and hop into the syllabus now and just go over

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.230
some of the details with you.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.700
All right.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.020
I'll see you there.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.940
OK.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.370
So I'm looking at the syllabus here.

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.230
There is currently 300 or so different lectures across 17 different sections and I won't waste your

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.510
time going over every single section.

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
I just want to point out some of the big trends and kind of where we're going based off of where we

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.700
are right now.

17
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.180
So the next section is really focused on setting the stage for what my ask is how it compares to other

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.410
databases what makes something a database what sequel compared to my as well.

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590
And then we shift focus to installing.

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.700
So by the end of that section you'll have your own copy installed and then from there we really dive

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.570
into code.

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.330
We see how to create databases how to put data in there and then we focus a lot of time on how to get

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.510
data out.

24
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.230
How do we write complex queries and along the way there are dozens and dozens of exercises including

25
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.070
section 6 which consists entirely of challenges the crud exercise challenge or we spend a lot of time

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.010
working with one dataset in detail then we keep moving on basically working our way up towards more

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.490
complex queries asking more complex questions of our data.

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.340
So all of this contains things like aggregate functions learning about string functions learning how

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
to work with data and date Times had a sort our results.

30
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.150
And then also working with logical operators.

31
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.480
And if none of that means anything to you don't worry.

32
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.510
But if it does you're looking for it you'll find it in the syllabus and then we move on to the next

33
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.610
chunk of content which has to do with interrelated data with more complex data structures.

34
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850
How do we represent them with my as well.

35
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.730
Or a sequel.

36
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
So if we start talking about Joines if you've heard of Joines before Section 12 and 13 focus on joints

37
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.720
and then in Section 14 we start working with our Instagram database Klym.

38
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.030
So what we'll do here is actually set out to come up with a clone of an instagram like database.

39
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.030
Obviously it won't be as complex as Instagram but we work with things like photos and users and comments

40
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.030
and likes and hashtags and followers and friends.

41
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.970
All that fun stuff.

42
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.830
So we'll set up our database here we'll design it and then Section 15 is all challenges using that Instagram

43
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.310
data.

44
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.920
So it sort of serves as a final exam to the course although not to test their solutions immediately

45
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.720
after but it sums up everything we've done until this point you'll have a bunch of data thousands and

46
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.430
thousands of rows of data that I'm going to provide you you'll put it in your database and then you'll

47
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.350
write code to answer a bunch of real world questions that someone or some company might have about the

48
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.170
data.

49
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.340
That's not the end of the course.

50
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.110
We move on at the end into kind of a broader section where we start talking about my Q Well plus other

51
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.800
languages.

52
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.230
So we see how to interact with node in my ask.

53
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.790
Well.

54
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.500
And then finally the course ends when we build a simple web application using my as well and no together.

55
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.040
So that's a rough overview of all that we cover.

56
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.670
One thing you might be wondering about are the prerequisites.

57
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.290
And I did say earlier that there are no prerequisites.

58
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.270
You don't have to have any experience aside from being able to work with the computer being able to

59
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.780
surf the Internet download things.

60
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.960
But I should note that towards the end while at the very end when we start talking about no J.S. and

61
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.180
building a web app it definitely will help if you're familiar with things like javascript edged him

62
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.580
out and C S S.

63
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.720
This isn't a course on those topics.

64
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.620
So I'm not sure I don't spend you know hours and hours going over them like I could.

65
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.500
However I do spend a little bit of time introducing them you know in a couple of minutes doing a crash

66
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.700
course but that's not the focus of this course.

67
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.350
So that's the only note I would add if you're here just for my as well.

68
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.890
And that's where you're concerned about there are no prerequisites.

69
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.320
But if you really want to be able to understand.

70
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.570
No genius at the end.

71
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.470
And the web app that we built it will help if you have a little bit of experience with it.

72
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.170
Tim Mounty assess in javascript.

73
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.180
Other than that though no prerequisites.
