00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,600
Hey welcome to the next section here.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,090
This one we're continuing with our Instagram data and see if blue will do her trick again.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,700
Blue can you get it.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Who is my adorable little kitty.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,930
You can stand up like a human she's come so far just like you have come so far.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,850
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,850
So we're working with Instagram data.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,380
We set up the schema.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,970
Now all we have left is to do stuff with it.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,290
So the way this section works is rather than me giving you a bunch of tables you know showing you here's

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,490
the result I want.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,290
We're going to do it a bit differently.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,610
I'm going to ask you more of a real world's question like hey we're doing a sweepstakes.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,290
How about we're doing a campaign email campaign to e-mail all of our inactive users and send them a

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,870
reminder that they should post.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,390
So we need you to get all the active users e-mail addresses.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,680
So something like that where it's kind of in real world terms not in the terms of a database like select

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,220
all users where blah blah blah but you'll have to translate it.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,140
So we'll do things like that or will do things like hey we have a brand who's really pressuring us to

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,600
figure out what hashtags are the most useful way to generate generating the most likes and they want

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
to know what three hashtags they should use.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,450
So then you'll have to go write the query to find that answer.

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,500
What are the best hashtags.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,200
How do you know.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,690
So hopefully that's exciting.

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,910
Trying to make it kind of a nice ramp off to the real world just for the data section.

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,170
And then after this like I said we have the web app portion of the course.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,760
OK.

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,900
So lots of exercises all exercises and solutions in this section.

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:41,630
By.
