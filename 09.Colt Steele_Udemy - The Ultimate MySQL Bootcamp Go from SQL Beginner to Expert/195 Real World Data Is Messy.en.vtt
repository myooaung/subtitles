1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.130
OK we'll come back.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.390
So we're finally here and this is a bit of a turning point in the course really important section.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.460
That's scary too much but really fundamental to how sequel and mines are used in the real world.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.880
So this is a section all about relationships and also something called joints which we'll get to in

5
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.860
the second part of this section.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.400
So let's focus on the relationships part first.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.580
So far in this course we've been working with very simple data things like books or users where we only

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.530
have a couple of columns per table and that's been by design.

9
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.800
We need that simplicity in order to focus on what's important to isolate the different features that

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.820
we're talking about whether it's functions or logical operators.

11
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.320
It's much easier to teach those when we don't have 20 different tables to worry about and we can just

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.290
basically drill down into one table and focus on that.

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.710
But that's typically not how the real world works where we might have a users table but there's no site

14
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.600
that really can just get by on having users unless it's featureless.

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.020
There is plenty of other things that need to go along with users whether it's comments or likes or tweets

16
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
or posts or photos or any sort of I don't know Order transaction.

17
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.430
There are all these different things that we could have long side users.

18
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.280
So we've been working with simple data but is about to change.

19
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.980
Real world data unlike what we've been working with is really messy typically and interrelated.

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.170
There's a lot of connections between data.

21
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.810
So some of those things I talked about with let's say users if we're working with just a simple blog

22
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.100
site.

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.300
So nothing like a Facebook or a complex social network just a simple blog.

24
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.920
We still need to have user data.

25
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.790
We need to have information about posts blog posts.

26
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.090
We also need to somehow keep track of comments and then tags and that can get pretty complicated already.

27
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.030
Not to mention things like advertising and tracking not only ads on their own but how ads are related

28
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020
to users and what users are clicking on and not clicking on.

29
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.760
There's so much data that just from a simple blog site something that may not seem that complex there's

30
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.120
so much stuff that we could store.

31
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.820
So we're going to focus on how we work with interconnected data in the next couple of sections so we're

32
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.680
no longer focusing on one table.

33
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.750
We're going to see how do we work with two tables or three or four that are related so not just tables

34
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.850
that exist independently but tables that reference one another and are interconnected.

35
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.960
So let's get going.

36
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.760
And the first thing that I want to do is go back to our books data.

37
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.140
So remember our books table.

38
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.190
Don't worry we're done with it.

39
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.620
We're not going to be typing any books code.

40
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.260
But on its own it's really simple.

41
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.350
We had a Books table with author first name and last name a book title released year page count in a

42
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.640
stock inventory I believe a stock quantity.

43
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.330
And I think that was it.

44
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.230
So again on its own that just represents a single book.

45
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.100
But you can't really do much with that.

46
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.620
But if we are running a sort of books site where we sold books at a minimum we would need to keep track

47
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.820
of things like versions.

48
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.120
So we didn't even talk about this.

49
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.990
But there's often multiple versions of a single book.

50
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.240
If you go on Amazon and you look at a book let's say Harry Potter the second book.

51
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.350
Chamber of Secrets.

52
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.620
Well there's going to be the initial British release the UK version as a hardcover and then there's

53
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.210
a paperback and then there's the American version and then there's a paperback.

54
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.060
There is a full color illustrated version that came out relatively relatively recently.

55
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.240
Looks pretty cool that has these giant illustrations.

56
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.400
It's the same title.

57
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.190
How do you keep track of that is at a different table.

58
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.920
Or do you just make a separate book for every one of those.

59
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.860
But if you do that then how do you make sure that they're connected.

60
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.670
Because when I go on Amazon and I look at the hardcover it also will show me below you know some people

61
00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.380
also buy paperback version or it's also available and I don't know 25 40 different languages.

62
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.100
So there's all sorts of things to worry about just with versions.

63
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.290
But then we have authors Well that might seem straightforward.

64
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.860
We have an author first name and last name.

65
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.750
Two columns on our books table.

66
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.350
But that's not sufficient.

67
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.430
When we have multiple authors so some books a lot of books have multiple authors.

68
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.520
What about if it's a research paper that we're selling or a journal that has dozens of authors potentially.

69
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.720
So there's a lot of things to keep track of there that we can't really do right now.

70
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.580
We only have room for one author in our columns.

71
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.450
Then a whole big thing is customers.

72
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.520
If we're doing a book shop on line books on their own it's great.

73
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.390
But we also need ways to keep track of users or customers.

74
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.390
This is what I'm calling them in this case.

75
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.590
So customers on their own also can't do that much but we might keep track of their e-mail log in information

76
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.630
of course who wouldn't just or their password directly but for simplicity's sake let's say for keeping

77
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.070
track of password and e-mail so that they can log in.

78
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.360
And then there's a whole bunch of other things orders.

79
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.090
So if customers want to order books how do we store that.

80
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.340
We need to create a new order and it needs to be associated with the customer who created it needs to

81
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.750
have address information maybe and needs to have the content of the order.

82
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.840
Are there books one book how do we support that.

83
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.370
How do we handle that.

84
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.630
What about if we're working with dates and times and we need to keep track of when a return period expires.

85
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.480
So we need to have a you know an order date and then keep track of 30 days or 60 days after that or

86
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.630
whatever it is.

87
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.550
Then we also need to store or somehow keep track of the transaction information addresses for billing

88
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.270
address not only shipping address the type of shipping that billing information so much store and then

89
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.410
a whole other thing is revues.

90
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.670
So if we go on Amazon or pretty much any book site any book that you look at will have dozens or hundreds

91
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.490
sometimes thousands of reviews.

92
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.090
So we've got reviews their ratings that you know the number of stars.

93
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.990
But then also a title for the review and then a caption and then the actual content of the review which

94
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.600
may be 10 characters I hate this book.

95
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.120
However many characters that is or it could be a giant paragraph someone's love letter that they're

96
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.070
writing to a book.

97
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.750
So how do we account for all of that.

98
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.700
And then the last thing that we'll talk about.

99
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.220
So you may think that we could just get away with storing this in a book which we absolutely could we

100
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.990
could just have one genre but many books don't cleanly fit into one genre.

101
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.560
You might have a vampire novel that's also historical fiction because it's set in Victoria period England

102
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:54.540
or we might have you know a sci fi book that has elements of fantasy or who knows you can have all sorts

103
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.460
of you know cross-pollinated genres so only assigning one genre might not be that useful.

104
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.120
We may want to have a bunch more.

105
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.180
And in fact on Amazon you can see there are books that will have two or three different genres or different

106
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.170
tags associated with them.

107
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.540
So what I'm trying to show you here is that we were working with books on their own but in a typical

108
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:19.350
app or typical Web site that has to do with books and bookstore in our case there's a lot more that

109
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.320
goes along with books to make anything functional to store any important information.

110
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.230
And this is I don't know maybe half of the tables that you would need to get away with the candidate

111
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.320
the MVP or the bare minimum.

112
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.670
There are still many other things something like orders for instance might actually need to be split

113
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.840
into a couple of tables.

114
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.530
You might need to have an address section or an address table which I need to then have a separate billing

115
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.430
table.

116
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.940
We might need to have shipping.

117
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.550
There could be all different tables that we could split it up into.

118
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.720
So this isn't to say this is the end all be all this is just that there's a couple of other tables that

119
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.690
we need to consider at the bare minimum.

120
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.330
OK.

121
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.590
So we'll stop here in the next video.

122
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.670
We're going to identify some of the different types of relationships between data at a high level.

123
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.560
What are the different types of associations.

124
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.660
And I'm back.

125
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.720
I totally forgot to show you this even though I wrote a note to myself.

126
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.770
I totally skipped this.

127
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.950
So I'm back after recording this.

128
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:22.590
Adding this to the end I want to show this schema diagram that I really think highlights how messy data

129
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.970
can be.

130
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.520
So here is I think I showed this early on in the course this is just a potential schema for Facebook

131
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.820
and it's definitely incomplete.

132
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.590
It's maybe a tenth of the number of tables that Facebook has but you can see just to store basic things

133
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.110
like events and users.

134
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:47.940
We have event Facebook event we have event membership which is related to RSVP States which is also

135
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.670
related to venues which is also related to groups and to workplaces and to Facebook profiles.

136
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.860
And it just goes on and on and on.

137
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.920
So what I'm trying to show you is that data can get messy and in fact here's another super intimidating

138
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.740
schema.

139
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:08.730
This one is a little bit crazy because it has to do with storing protein database.

140
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.610
I think it was I saw some article on IBM and I believe MIT.

141
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.110
Unfortunately it's very low quality image that you can actually see the tables.

142
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:22.830
But each one of these little rectangles has a separate table and every line is a connection between

143
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.910
the tables.

144
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.950
Now this is the worst I've ever seen the craziest.

145
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.910
And I think that was the point is that they're trying to just show you you know they're never going

146
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.190
to actually look at this to try and understand anything but they're trying to show you how complex protein

147
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.880
information is.

148
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.620
When you have all these different combinations and permutations for a given protein without going into

149
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:46.560
too much detail here this isn't a bio course but the way that a protein is folded the same structure

150
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.980
basically the same amino acids depending on how it's folded can drastically change the features if you

151
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.490
will.

152
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.780
Basically what that protein does how it behaves.

153
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:05.190
And so this is a way of documenting using sequel in some way the structure of a protein using a database.

154
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.570
OK.

155
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.040
So that's a scary there I just think it's kind of a powerful image although grainy it is powerful to

156
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.770
see.

157
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.600
Basically some really messy ugly gross data that can be supported using tables.

158
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.210
It just doesn't look pretty.

159
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.510
But that's the important part in kind of the point of this video is I wanted to get you prepared mentally

160
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.940
for working with some more complex data.

161
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.100
Although nothing that looks like this.
