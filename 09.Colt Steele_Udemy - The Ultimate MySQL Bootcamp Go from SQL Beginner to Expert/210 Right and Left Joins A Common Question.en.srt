00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,150
Okay I'm back with a very quick EDITION.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,560
This is a frequently asked question that I get pretty often which is is there really a big difference

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,130
between right and left joins if we just change the order of what we're joining.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,650
And the answer is No they're actually the same.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,460
So if we do a left join where this is customers a.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,170
And then on the right we have orders that's identical to doing a RIGHT JOIN.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,950
If instead we put customers over here and we put orders under way.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,740
So think of it as just you know flipping this there's no difference.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,210
So let me show you an example.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,460
If we go and we go grab our simple left join from way back here.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,270
This one right here simpleness left join and I will paste it down here just you have it to see.

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,610
And let's paste it in as well.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,180
OK.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,860
First of all there's a lot to look at right.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,190
But what's most important is that we have on the left customer's information first and then on the right

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,110
we have our order information right.

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,380
And then we have Knoll's where we don't have a matching order.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,300
OK.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,540
So what happens if we try and do the same thing.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:23,580
But instead of doing customers first we do orders and we do a right join customers on customers that

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,920
ID equals orders customer ID.

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,450
OK.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,870
So if we do this look at what we get here.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,860
So we have the exact same data.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,600
One two three four five rows one two three four five but the order that they're printed is different.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,540
Right.

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:53,920
So we have on the left side now we have our orders information and then on the right we have our customers

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,470
information but the actual data that's displayed is the same.

29
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,620
Yes the order changes but that's know trivial.

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,030
That doesn't matter.

31
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,690
So in effect these are equivalent.

32
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,390
And in fact some like some environments that I've come across some developing environments won't even

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,290
support a right join and they just want to do a left join and switch the order.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,990
So to actually to sum up one more time let's say I did the same thing here with orders and customers

35
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,870
but I did a left join.

36
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,500
What would happen now.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
What's a left join with orders first and then customers.

38
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,200
And the answer is it's the same as doing a right join.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,850
Except if we start with customers and then orders.

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,720
And unfortunately we don't really have anything to see right because our data doesn't have any discrepancies

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,650
on the order side.

42
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,080
This was the entire last video was about which I will not retread here but my point is that they look

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,060
the same and they look just like an inner join us well but when we have something different like with

44
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,820
our left join for customers and orders you can see that the data is actually the same.
