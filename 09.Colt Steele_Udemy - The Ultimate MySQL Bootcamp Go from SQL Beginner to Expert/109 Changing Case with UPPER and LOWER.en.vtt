00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.470
All right we'll come back.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.670
So we've made it through a lot of string functions.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.810
We've seen concat and replace and substring and reverse and Chaar and we have two more that I'm combining

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.420
into one video because they're really simple and straightforward and they're a natural pair.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.720
And then after we finish this we have some fun exercises.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
So the two that we're looking at are upper and lower and they do what they sound like they change the

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.800
case of a string.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.290
We can make something all caps or all lower case letters.

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.530
So let's take a look.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.910
What do you think this will do.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.250
By now you should be familiar with this select and some string function.

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.550
So select upper hello world is going to convert Hello World to all caps and just to prove that.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.120
Let's go over here and do it and we get hello world in all caps.

14
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.830
Likewise select lower hello world will convert everything to be lowercase.

15
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.200
So it's really just the H and the W and we get.

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.510
Hello world.

17
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.960
I still don't believe me.

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.750
OK.

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.670
There we go.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.920
Hello world.

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.570
So honestly that's pretty much it.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660
Just like the other couple of videos before this.

23
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.050
If you feel like that's good enough.

24
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.500
Go ahead.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.970
Move on to the exercise.

26
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.170
But if you want to see me use it.

27
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.040
Wisdom of our author data.

28
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.210
Stick around.

29
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.310
So let's do something silly like printout.

30
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520
All book titles in all caps.

31
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:40.230
So to do that it's just select upper title from books and that's it.

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.310
And of course we can combine it with other things so we could do something like.

33
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.270
My favorite book is as if someone was yelling.

34
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.230
My favorite book is and then a book name like The Namesake.

35
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.870
And to do that we need to combine the uppercase version so I'll start writing it here.

36
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:10.240
Upper title and we need to concatenate that with this string right here and to concatenate them kind

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.220
of building backwards.

38
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.630
Here we need to use concat just like that so concat my favorite book is and which is that is space the

39
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.200
uppercase version of title and then we'll just add a select concat from books.

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.020
So it kind of built that one in a different way starting from the inside out.

41
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.040
You can see we get my favorite book is a namesake.

42
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.320
My favorite book is a circle.

43
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.610
My favorite book is kender is the Cannery Row.

44
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.580
Yeah I'm not sure I put that there.

45
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.850
Well anyways if we delete that extra and rerun this

46
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.270
now it's grammatically correct.

47
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.350
So that's pretty much it to upper and lower.

48
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.830
I mean we could change this to be lower if I mean fine if you make me show it.

49
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.960
I don't think there's any surprise about what will happen but just in case it just converts everything

50
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.950
to lowercase.

51
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.910
OK so that's upper and lower.

52
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.940
That was a lot of stuff.

53
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.130
All these different string functions we saw.

54
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.880
Now it's time for you to get some practice doing it yourself.
