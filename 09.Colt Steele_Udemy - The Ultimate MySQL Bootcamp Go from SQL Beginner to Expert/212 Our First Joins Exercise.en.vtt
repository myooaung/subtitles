1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.160
All right.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.570
So we made it through or at least I made it through hopefully still hanging in there over the years

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.830
you're alive and you survived that section.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920
I know it can be brutal.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.120
This is for me and for most teachers the hardest thing to teach.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.670
Not because it's technically that difficult but it's a big thing.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
We have to have multiple tables and have multiple tables so we have to create schema we have to insert

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.890
the data then we have to you know show what the data looks like to understand it and then we can get

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.560
started with the joint and you have to manipulate the data to change it just a lot of work and it's

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.160
tough.

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.020
It's tough to keep it engaging and frankly I don't think that that was terribly engaging.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.120
So I'm sorry.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.530
Hopefully you made it and I'm doing my best to make the rest of this a little bit more exciting because

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.090
once we have these tools and are built into a lot easier to start doing case studies which we'll be

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.270
doing are making it full application.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.590
We're getting close to end products actually making things rather than you know silly one off the examples.

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.270
OK.

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.930
So it's a long preamble.

19
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.880
It's now your turn and this is where you're probably if you're confused if you're stuck with this joint

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.180
stuff.

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.760
This is hopefully where you'll be able to make some big connections to have some breakthroughs.

22
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.870
So it's this is a little different than exercise if you've done the past there's only one schema on

23
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.240
one table you'll be working with and there's not even that many questions but the first thing is that

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.610
we're going to be working with students and papers.

25
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.730
So I'm a teacher let's suppose I guess I am teacher but let's say I'm working in a classroom with high

26
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.430
school students in an English class or literature class it's be very very simple data.

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.110
I'm telling you what I'm looking for students and papers and for students will only worry about an ID

28
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.730
and their first names so don't even care about the last name.

29
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
Well let's make sure first name is unique and then we're going to have papers.

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.810
And it's a one to many relationship one student can have multiple papers but a paper can only belong

31
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.800
to one student.

32
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.040
So these papers will have a title a grade A letter grade like her not a letter grade a numeric grade

33
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.490
excuse me like 90 or 60 if they don't do particularly well.

34
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.400
And then a foreign key student ID which is referencing a student ID OK.

35
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
So that's the basic schema and I'd like for you to first go through and actually implement this.

36
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.680
And don't worry about the data because in the next slide I'm giving you the data you can copy and paste

37
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.420
it in.

38
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.410
So this data is what we'll be working with.

39
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.090
So we have one two three four five users.

40
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.390
Students doing that.

41
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.540
And then we have six.

42
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.810
I can count five different papers but there's a couple important things.

43
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.690
One is that a couple of students actually have multiple papers.

44
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.700
So for instance if we take Caleb his ID is one that you can't see that here but he's the first one inserted.

45
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.770
So his idea is one and he has my first book report which didn't get a great grade and 60 percent.

46
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.680
My second book report and which only did marginally better 75 percent than we have Samantha who wrote

47
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.360
Russian let through the ages.

48
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.740
And we also have another paper by her to maintain the art of the essay.

49
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.070
And then Raj looks like we don't have anything from Rush where his idea is three.

50
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.770
I don't see anyone or any paper with the idea of three and we have Carlos who wrote or has in magical

51
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.360
realism.

52
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.290
And then we have Lisa who didn't submit anything either.

53
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.000
So let's say the whole point of this is that it's the end of the year and I'm trying to figure out who

54
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.880
submitted what papers what their average grades are.

55
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.040
If I need to you know talk to somebody about they didn't turn anything in who's going to fail and so

56
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.610
on.

57
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.420
So here's a data we're working with.

58
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.020
But the first thing you need to do is write the schema.

59
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.710
So just again to reiterate primary key foreign key are far more integer integer.

60
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.270
OK moving on.

61
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.150
Once you have that done and you have your data in and play around with it.

62
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.930
But I'd like you to print this first table so all that we have here is first the name of the student

63
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.930
and their corresponding paper the title and the grade.

64
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.620
Samantha and her two papers Carlos and his paper cart.

65
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.490
Caleb and his two papers and the corresponding grades.

66
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.030
So this is a joint.

67
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.090
What type of join is it.

68
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.260
And you only need these three things so I don't want to see I don't want to see student id just first

69
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.980
name title and grade.

70
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.980
And then once you've done that we have another joy.

71
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.580
I'll give you a hint.

72
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.660
Everything in the section in this exercise involves a joint.

73
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.490
This one is different because we have the same basic stuff.

74
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.020
Caleb in his two book reports Samantha her two papers rush though no title no grade.

75
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.940
Raj didn't have a paper.

76
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.600
Carlos Boreham and magical realism.

77
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.410
And then Lisa.

78
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.420
No no this is not a paper either.

79
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.550
So print this out.

80
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:28.020
It's a different joint and once you've done that move on similar but notice instead of having no and

81
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.470
no.

82
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.200
When a student didn't turn any papers that we now have missing and zero for their grade missing for

83
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.960
title 0 for their grade.

84
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.600
So it's the same thing here.

85
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.540
We're just subbing in OK.

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.940
Then we get to this.

87
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.840
This is going to be an average grade next to every student.

88
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:57.170
So we have Samantha and the average of her two papers is 96 Karlos the average of his one paper is 89.

89
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.920
Caleb's average for two papers.

90
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.970
Sixty seven point five.

91
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.700
Raj has an average of zero.

92
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.960
He didn't turn a paper in.

93
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.390
And Lisa has an average of zero as well.

94
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.570
So I won't give away too much about this but you can use the same joint you used here you just then

95
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.970
need to condense it.

96
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.270
We need less information you'll need to.

97
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.660
Well that's I'll leave it at that.

98
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.670
And then finally print this an extension of what this one was except there's a new column which is passing

99
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.220
status and passing status.

100
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.290
It just says if a student is passing or class or not and the threshold shouldn't I should have written

101
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.870
this out.

102
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.910
The threshold is if they get a 75 average in the class or higher.

103
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.380
So Samantha passes Carlos passes.

104
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.640
Caleb Unfortunately it's below 75 so he fails as you Raj and Lisa.

105
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.300
All right.

106
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.090
So there's a bunch of joints I need to write.

107
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.650
First things first though get the data in there create the schema get the data in play around with it

108
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.350
and then attempt these.

109
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.620
How many five joints.
