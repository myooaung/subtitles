1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,730
OK.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,720
So at the end of this project all we have left is to style it.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,040
And it's kind of funny I think for a lot of people this is the most exciting part even though it has

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,800
the least to do with the Course but I guess it's nice to have something visual to make it look nice

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,990
if you know this as skip this.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,140
You can just copy the style sheet in.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
Take a look at what I did.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,210
This is not going to be like I've said a couple times not of course on X it's on a course on CSSA.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,980
So what I'm going to do is rather than spending two hours of video going over you know styling this

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,900
one piece at a time and talking about my workflow and why I'm doing certain things what I've done is

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,030
just copied over the finished style sheet and our finished markup.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,230
But we still have our empty marker or a basic markup and we don't have a style sheet.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,370
So what I'm going to do is just walk through and kind of copy bit by bit over and explain what chunks

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:56,580
do.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,510
But not everything.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,480
And these two files you can also you can find yourself in the slides are too large but I've included

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,190
them along with this video so that you can copy from there unless you're someone who likes to type things

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,470
manually which some students do.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,210
OK.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,590
So again these are two files that are not connected to our app.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,990
These are the solution files.

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,710
I'm going to refer back to but for now we're stuck with this our basic h team out.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,700
And we don't even have a way of styling it.

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,850
And for those of you who don't know CSSA or know what it is it's how we add style color font images

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:37,590
Well we add images generally but we can add a background image to something using C Ss and the way we

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,770
usually write that is by creating an external style sheet a C S S file and writing styles in there like

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,940
this.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,430
So we need a way to actually connect them and not going to go into too much detail.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,720
But usually what we do looks like this we would have a link raÃºl Eco's style sheet.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,270
This is NHT him I'll tag that includes an external stylesheet.

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,670
So if I do that and I just paste in here there's two problems.

32
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,520
One we don't even have an act out CSSA created but to express isn't going to know about it.

33
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,560
Hi Paul Well we can do is start off by creating a new directory.

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,450
And this is just a conventional name.

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm going to call it public.

36
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,920
That's kind of standard for a web app but you can call it whatever you want.

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:29,630
And inside if they're going to create a file called app C Ss like that and then we'll put our code in

38
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,150
here.

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,900
And let's start with something really simple like turn the whole body.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,550
It gets color purple so all our text is purple like that color purple blue.

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,360
Hey my cat just attacked me.

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,100
Hey why don't you let me record OK.

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,640
Hang on I'll be back here to handle this.

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,110
All right.

45
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,880
That's been handled crazy cat.

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,210
So back where we were.

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,530
We've got our laptops the SS body color purple.

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,460
This is not connected to our app.

49
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,910
If it were then our techs would be purple but it's not.

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,780
So how do we get it connected.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Well there's a problem.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,040
Long story short we need to add this line.

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,930
So this is another app you use and this tells the Express I go into our main file here app Jass is at

54
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,320
it with the other apps that use keep all our configuration and it's basically saying take whatever is

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,370
in the public directory which is right here take all the contents and serve them so they're accessible

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,220
by our views or from our Javascript.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,590
So now if I can restart the server app just the SS is going to be available to this file.

58
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,390
Hopefully And if we are fresh the page we now have purple text.

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,990
OK.

60
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,810
So we now have a stylesheet connected and if you had just a quick aside if you had multiple different

61
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,220
views here and you wanted them to have the same style sheet you could use this line and all of them

62
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,020
where there's actually a better way which I'm not going to talk about in this course called Parshall's

63
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,480
where you can basically have code that runs on all of your views but you can also have a separate style

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,260
sheet for different views if you want to just put them all in public.

65
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,150
OK.

66
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,320
So that's the first simplest thing.

67
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,450
The next thing you'll notice in the finished markup is there's also a Google API.

68
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,370
Google font included.

69
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,910
So I'm going to put that in here too.

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,120
This is for a font called rubato pretty common one if you're not familiar with Google fonts.

71
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,630
Really great resource free fonts that you can use on your own web sites.

72
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,060
And they look good.

73
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,260
So now let's also go back to our See assess and learn to copy some of this body stuff over for example

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,760
font family.

75
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,750
Let's start with that.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,120
So we don't want things to be purple we can get rid of that but let's change the font so that we now

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
are using that rubato font.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,480
There you go.

79
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,050
Our font has changed slowly getting there.

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,490
Next thing that will do if you go back to the SS is we'll take the color and the tech shadow and the

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,860
text the line.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:25,000
So I don't need font family again I'll get rid of that blindness of OK so this color is like a slightly

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,590
purple gray if I remember and we've got this slight shadow which I don't know if you could pick up on

84
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,860
on the original.

85
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,840
We're getting close.

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,980
Well no that's a lie but we're getting close to being done with body.

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,210
Then we've got a couple of other things.

88
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,550
First off is the background image.

89
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:50,500
And if I just show you this image in its entirety it's a massive image of peaceful mountain in Argentina

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,700
down in Patagonia.

91
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,990
They took on a backpacking trip.

92
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,130
It is called Sarah Turei.

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,780
And yeah that's my little plug for my photography.

94
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,990
Maybe we'll have a photography course one day.

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,780
So here's this photo that we'll use we just need that you are and we're setting the bodies background

96
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,840
image to that photo save and refresh and it works.

97
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,280
But you can see kind of just looks like a solid color but it's using the image just so big that it's

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,940
taking fee.

99
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,690
You know I don't know five or six of these screens or more so that's actually something that if this

100
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,580
is a real app it would be good to just use a smaller image so we're not loading such a big image but

101
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,040
what we can do is use background size and set that to be covered.

102
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,080
And now it will basically take the image and make sure it covers the entire background.

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,090
So we've got that getting a little closer now.

104
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,300
The next thing that we can do if we scroll down we'll come back to this flex container we've got our

105
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,760
H-1 and our paragraphs.

106
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,260
And if you noticed I'm setting the font weight to be 100.

107
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,230
I'm actually going to get rid of that in both of them.

108
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:08,060
There's a better thing that I can do which is just sent the fat set the font weight to 100 in the body.

109
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,420
And what that will do is just make our font thinner so that we get thinner text.

110
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,050
OK.

111
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,110
So we've done that and let's see moving on.

112
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,670
Let's work on the H-1 next.

113
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:28,560
So the H-1 is giant or what's not giant yet put this Join us that will be giant in a bit.

114
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,490
It's got a couple of things that we're doing.

115
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,570
We've got we're setting well let's just copy it all over the margin to be zero font size.

116
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,720
Five hundred pixels

117
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,910
line height is 400 pixels OK.

118
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,540
So it looks massive right now.

119
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,040
And that's because I'm super zoomed in.

120
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,610
So it's not massive now.

121
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,010
It's still big.

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,370
But nowhere near as bad.

123
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,000
So we've got.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,080
Join us.

125
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,430
And that's big it looking relatively good.

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,190
But we want to do of course is position it downwards.

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,760
But I'm going to wait to talk about that.

128
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,660
So we'll move on to the next thing.

129
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,040
We've got our paragraph that we can style and really all we're doing for the paragraph is changing the

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,290
font size.

131
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,990
So this here gets bigger.

132
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,580
Then after that we're onto the form and the button.
