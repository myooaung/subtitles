00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.260
So we're going to start off by taking a bit of a step back and talking about two very high level general

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.960
questions that are pretty central to everything this course is about and they are.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.780
First off what is database seems like a pretty straightforward question but there is a little bit of

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.060
terminology you need to discuss.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.670
And then secondly why do they matter.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.690
So let's start off with the first one what is a database what actually makes something database and

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.830
there are a couple of definitions that we could go with here.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.410
I kind of synthesized some of them into my own definition that has two parts.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.200
And the first part is that it's a collection of data which seems pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.090
There are all sorts of collections of data around us in the real world things like when you go to your

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.810
doctor's office and there's a filing cabinet full of medical records or even just that a to do list

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.260
or a list of things to buy at the grocery store qualifies as a collection of data or going back a little

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.000
bit in time.

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.360
If you remember what Rolodexes word a Rolodex full of different people's contact information that qualifies

16
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.120
as a database.

17
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.450
Under this definition.

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.560
Speaking of archaic technology like a Rolodex.

19
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.620
Another example of a database is a phone book.

20
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.920
So I say this mainly jokingly but I actually have some siblings who don't know what phone book is or

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.990
they've never seen one or used one before.

22
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.670
It's a gigantic book basically that you look up people's phone numbers based off of their name.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.920
So it's usually organized by last name alphabetically for people.

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.090
So you would look through the book until you find someone's last name and then you would try and match

25
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300
the first name and then you find the phone number.

26
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700
So let's take a quick example here.

27
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.610
This is a fictional phonebook.

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.800
Think of it as just a little section of a phone book that has tens of thousands of entries.

29
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
And these are fictional characters alphabetically organized by their last name.

30
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.150
So Archie Andrews comes in for Betty Cooper who comes before Ned Flanders and so on.

31
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.600
And then we have corresponding phone numbers.

32
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.780
So imagine you have a gigantic phonebook with this information in it.

33
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.390
And I asked you to do something like find Ned Flanders phone number Well it's actually pretty straightforward

34
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.660
as long as you're comfortable using the alphabet in alphabetical order.

35
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.380
You look through the book until you find f f l and so on until you find Ned Flanders and then you find

36
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.570
his phone number.

37
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.550
It's what the phone book is made for.

38
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.920
However it gets a little trickier or a lot trickier it really if I ask you to do something like find

39
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.330
everyone in the phone book who has the first name.

40
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.360
Ned there isn't an easy way to do this.

41
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.820
You basically would have to go through every entry in the book and check for how many thousands there

42
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.180
are is this person's name.

43
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.670
So I have a couple other questions that are similarly difficult.

44
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.240
So the point here is just if you were to find all phone numbers with a particular area code or to find

45
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.390
all people who have a three letter first name it's not easy and it would take a lot of time.

46
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.560
Like a ton of time.

47
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.410
So that brings me to the next component of the definition of what makes something a database.

48
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.380
In my opinion which is not just a collection of data.

49
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.310
It also contains a method for accessing and manipulating that data.

50
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.720
So going back to this phone book we would want a way some sort of program or code that would allow us

51
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.060
to do things like find everybody with the first name net or find all people who have a three letter

52
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.980
first name or even do things like add a new person into the phone book or change area codes or change

53
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.040
phone numbers or get crazy and just delete people from our phone book or delete everybody if we wanted

54
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.260
to we would have some sort of program or code as part of our database that would help with that that

55
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.220
would allow us to interface with the data.

56
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.310
So I did say we were going to dive a little bit into the jargon and terminology.

57
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.710
I usually try to stay away from that early on while I try and stay away from that in general but especially

58
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.140
early on in the course.

59
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.480
Basically if you've read about databases if you've used one before if you've read a blog post about

60
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.600
them you may have come across the term database management system or relational database management

61
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.170
system or DMX or RB DNS all these different acronyms.

62
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.110
Basically this right here what I have on the screen database versus database management system refers

63
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.260
to the fact that what I just talked about having data collection of data and then having an interface

64
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.270
for that data are two different things.

65
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.900
So let me show you a quick example.

66
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.240
Imagine that you have an application.

67
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.350
Let's say it is a dating app and then you have a database and you're storing all sorts of information

68
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.080
all the different users all the different messages that have been sent the photos whatever else goes

69
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.320
into your dating app but on its own.

70
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.390
The database here is basically like our phone book.

71
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:16.250
It's a gigantic collection of data which is great for storing data but it really doesn't do very much.

72
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.940
You can almost think of it as if it was a gigantic file on your computer.

73
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:28.070
So for our application to be able to do things like Update somebody's username in the database or edit

74
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.700
their profile photo or delete a user if they want to leave our application whatever it is there's a

75
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.140
database management system that allows us to interface with that database.

76
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.900
So it's just the code to the program that does the talking to our database for us.

77
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.360
So we talked to our database management system and it talks to the database.

78
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.800
OK.

79
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.170
So for the most part we're out of the weeds with the jargon here.

80
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.940
The reason I brought this up though is that oftentimes when people talk about data rates you actually

81
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.700
hear them referring to both of these things.

82
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.190
The database management system and the database together just as a database.

83
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.240
So what I have right here is a list of some of the more common databases you'll run into.

84
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.110
And actually I just did it there when I was just talking about these four things.

85
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.760
PostgreSQL my Eskew Well Oracle sequel lite.

86
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.730
They're not technically databases.

87
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.470
They're actually database management systems.

88
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.160
But for the most part people just call them databases.

89
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.700
So when we say things like my as well as one of the most commonly used databases it's actually one of

90
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.820
the most commonly used database management systems.

91
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.380
So it's not the end of the world if you forget about that but it is important because it will help you

92
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.810
understand later on when we actually start talking about a sequel when we start talking about some of

93
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.860
the code that you write to interact with the database.

94
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.730
I think it will help you understand what you're doing and that you're giving commands to this database

95
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:02.130
management system which then goes and gives commands to the actual data itself or to the database itself.

96
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.360
OK so to wrap everything up here's a little bit of a synthesized definition.

97
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.520
What is a database.

98
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.930
Well it's a structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.
