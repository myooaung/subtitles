Hey welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.660
So I'd like to start off this section by asking you a question.

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.760
It's not really a quiz or anything but I just want to know why there's a chicken on my desk and in the

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.960
meantime Lou and I are here to talk to you about the next section.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.200
So we're continuing on our trend of working with multiple tables.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.420
We saw a one to many relationship in the last section.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.660
Now we're moving on to a many to many relationship and save this one for second.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.100
It's a little more complex.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.360
Don't be afraid is still very doable and very important.

10
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.890
Keep saying that very useful to be able to have multiple tables with a many to many relationship.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.570
So we're going to focus on the section on implementing a schema for TV shows with reviewers and the

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.320
reviews that they write.

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.020
So think of like I don't know Breaking Bad and American horror story or two different shows.

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.910
We'll have a bunch of them.

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.710
I'll give you data and then ten different human reviewers Maybe a cat or two as well.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.460
And these reviewers can go and assign ratings to every show.

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.000
So I could say this is a 10 to nine that too for whatever.

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.220
So that's what we're going to implement that sort of a schema which is a many to many relationship.

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.740
Hate it.

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
Stop eating that eat the chicken.

21
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.900
So OK where was I.

22
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.240
Exercise.

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.690
Yes.

24
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.450
This section is all exercise basically the way that I decided to do it is to go through not only building

25
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.820
the schema but also asking common questions about the data and performing common operations and the

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.290
joints we want to perform.

27
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.890
Basically as we go.

28
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.270
So the whole thing acts as a bit of a code along slash exercise.

29
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.800
So hopefully you like television if you don't then this will be a great insight great window into the

30
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.580
world of television for you but more importantly we're talking about joints.

31
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.710
Again working with multiple tables.

32
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.110
All right.
