1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,140
Either.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,470
So I have a small confession to make at the beginning of this video.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,260
This is not my first time recording this.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,870
I recorded this about a month ago along with all the other videos in this section and something happened.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,500
I didn't save it correctly.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,270
Maybe I accidentally deleted it.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,650
My cat stuff on the keyboard.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,750
I have no idea.

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,570
But the original video here is gone.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,610
And normally that wouldn't be a problem.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,680
It's happened before.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,510
Or I just rerecord a section because I'm not happy with it.

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,870
You know that's not too bad.

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,910
It's easy to do.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,530
But since this has to do with dates and in particular it has to do with these three date functions that

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,550
I'm going to show you.

17
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,030
Basically they give us the current date the current time and the current date time.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,810
You'll see in the videos following this one that the code that I ran when I was recording it the first

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,450
time resulted in different dates and different times than what you'll see right now.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,530
So it's not a big deal at all.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,270
It's just evidence that I recorded them on different times but I wanted to just let you know what to

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,960
expect.

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,460
OK.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,260
And the last video we inserted these to where we manually created or basically wrote out the dates the

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,410
time and the date time and then in the initial recorded version of this video.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:17,250
This is the new person that I inserted and this birthdate birth time and birth date time were all done

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,400
using these three functions here that give the current birth or the current date.

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,280
So at the time it was April 21st and the time was 7 12 and this is the date time and so I used these

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,720
to generate this.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,140
So in the next video you will see this person with toaster birth date April 20th 21st and so on.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,340
But in this video where I'm actually showing you that creation I'm having to rerecord it.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,380
So there's just a small discrepancy.

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,060
Other than that everything else will be the same.

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,770
So let me show you these three methods here that are really useful.

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:02:00,810
Simple things but Kuhr date gives current date as I said her time gives the current time and then now

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,780
gives current date time.

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,770
So let's try one of them just on their own.

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:14,640
If you did something like select her date you'll see that I'm actually recording this on 5:12 May 12th.

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,950
So not quite a month later but a couple of weeks later.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,950
So if we do the same thing with her time

41
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,290
we get the time and then if we do.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,720
Now we get the daytime.

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,580
So using them on their own is not useful really just to select the current time it's much easier just

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,510
to look at your watch but they become useful when we use them in conjunction with insert statements.

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,480
So things like when we're inserting a new user and we want to save the time that the user was inserted.

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,600
What we could do is basically write an insert into and we'll do people let's do our select start from

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,740
people.

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,800
OK.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:05,740
So we'll do insert into people first date birth time and birth date time.

50
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:13,050
And so I think the hypothetical story I gave was that toaster was my son my first son and he was born

51
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,450
exactly at the moment when I hit enter.

52
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,820
So we'll do the same thing here.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,860
Inserting into people birthdate birth time birth date time.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,210
This would be my new son and this one's name is me actually I'd name as well.

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,430
Oh boy I'm really bad at naming things.

56
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,170
You can tell I named my cat blue which is blue still.

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,780
By the way you didn't catch that.

58
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,900
OK so I'll name him micro-wave and then rather than writing out to date here what I'll do instead is

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,950
for the birth date I just say curred date.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,530
And then for the birth time I'll just use her time and then for birth date time I use the now and out

61
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,600
of all these I end up using now the most often because as I've mentioned before we use daytime's a lot.

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:09,530
OK so if we just run this right now and insert that and now you are select star from people you can

63
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,070
see that micro-wave now has the date the time the date time that reflect exactly when I inserted this.

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,240
Just a couple of seconds ago and that's pretty much all there is to these three nice simple functions.

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,540
Another way that we use them by the way is not just to insert data with current dates and times and

66
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,430
so on but also to compare data to the current time.

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,050
So I'll show you how to do some basic data math.

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,070
We'll be able to figure out you know how long ago something was compared to now.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,220
And so we need to be able to refer to now where we want to figure out how many dates or how many days

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,170
somebody was born ago compared to the current date.

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,350
So we need that current date in order to help out with that.

72
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,100
OK.

73
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,280
So the last thing I'll do here just for continuity sake is the microwave that we have toaster Larry

74
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,800
and Padam which is what I had in the original recording so that the next video here hopefully will be

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,090
relatively seamless.

76
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,610
So I'm getting rid of my son I'm sorry microwave it failed you.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,210
OK.

78
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,330
Now he's gone and we're back to these three.

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,970
All right.

80
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,250
So that's her date card time and now.
