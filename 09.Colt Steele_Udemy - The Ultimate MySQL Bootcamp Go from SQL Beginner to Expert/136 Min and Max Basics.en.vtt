00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.550
OK so next up we're going to continue on with two new functions and they go together.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.220
They fit well they're min and max minimum and maximum and they do what they sound like with their name

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:19.080
says they help you find and identify minimum values in a table or maximum values in a table and we can

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.560
use them on their own and we can also combine them with Group By to get further insights.

5
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.500
So we're going to see how to do both.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.820
We're going to start off by using min and max without GROUP BY.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.840
So we can do things like find the minimum release year in our entire table so you know what was the

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.970
first year any book was released.

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:49.170
And to do that just looks like this select men release year in parentheses from books.

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.100
So just like we did with the count where you could just count all the books if you wanted to you can

11
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.950
just use men on its own.

12
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.250
So let me show you how to do that.

13
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:08.780
Now go over to cloud nine and we can just do a select men released year from books.

14
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.800
And 19:45 is the earliest book that we have released the earliest years that a book was released.

15
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.960
We can also do something like select man pages if you want to see what's the shortest number of pages.

16
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
And that's that tells us 176 is the shortest.

17
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.190
So of course maximum works the same way.

18
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.200
So instead of men we just type Max and my X and does the same thing.

19
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
So here we're finding that while it doesn't do the same thing it works in the same way but it does the

20
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.000
exact opposite.

21
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.120
It's going to tell us or return the longest or the highest number of pages.

22
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.230
So if we do that I'll just recall that last line and just change it to be Max

23
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510
634.

24
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.700
That is our longest book and we can do the same thing with year if we wanted to

25
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.210
2017 is our most recent years the highest number year.

26
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.930
So that's the very basics of maximun minute Max have you on say it.

27
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.350
I do want to call your attention to something sort of weird.

28
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.680
What if I wanted to get the title of the longest book not just the number of pages like we have here.

29
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.140
Just finding out that 634 is a longest.

30
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.790
Isn't that useful.

31
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.440
What if I wanted to know what is the book What's the title.

32
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020
Who wrote it.

33
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.020
The year is released.

34
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.530
Any other information.

35
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.630
Well you might think you could do this.

36
00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:00.220
Select max page is common title from books and if we try it out select max pages common title from books

37
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.020
it says that the namesake is our longest book and it has 634 pages.

38
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:17.180
And while yes 634 is the maximum pages in our entire database The Namesake is not 634 pages.

39
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:27.010
And in fact if we just do a select and let's just do title comic pages from books if we find the namesake

40
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.770
you'll see that it's 291 pages and the one that is 634 is the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.

41
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.450
So that's a problem.

42
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.600
Here's a nice slow graphic.

43
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.260
It's the largest emoji that I can make and these slides for some reason.

44
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.590
So I'm just going to go ahead and insert a much larger one now.

45
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.760
Postproduction very fancy.

46
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.140
So how how do we get around this.

47
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.320
There has to be a way.

48
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.770
In fact there's multiple ways in the next video.

49
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.130
It's a bit of a cliffhanger here and the next video we're going to see a couple options including a

50
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.130
preview of a more advanced method something that we haven't seen just yet but there is a way to do it

51
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.740
using what we already know.

52
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.370
Something we learned a couple of videos ago.

53
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.230
All right.

54
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.950
Next video.
