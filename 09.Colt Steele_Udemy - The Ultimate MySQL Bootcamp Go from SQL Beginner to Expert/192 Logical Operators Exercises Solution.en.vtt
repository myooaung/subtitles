1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.740
OK.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.070
So let's go over.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.330
Hopefully you're still alive.

4
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.020
It was maybe a bit of a challenging problem set.

5
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.500
But if you're still here let's go with these first three.

6
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.950
So evaluate the following.

7
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.450
Select 10 not equal to 10.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.870
Well 10 is equal to 10.

9
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
So this should return false and we get zero.

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.760
Next One little more complex we've got.

11
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.970
And remember that means both sides have to be true.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.860
Start the left is 15 grade than 14.

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.350
Yes that's true.

14
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.710
But how about this side.

15
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.600
Ninety nine minus five gives us 94 is 94 less than or equal to 94.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.100
Yes it's equal to.

17
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.080
So that means both sides are true meaning the whole thing is true which we get 1 finally select 1 in

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.220
5 come a three or nine between eight and 10.

19
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.430
So we've got more.

20
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.370
I mean it's either side can be true for me to make the whole thing true.

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.760
So let's start with this select one in five come three.

22
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.060
Remember he didn't show you this explicitly.

23
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.600
But we saw how to use in.

24
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
So you should know how it works is one in that set of five comma three.

25
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.210
No.

26
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.120
So this is false but that doesn't nullify the whole thing and falsify it because what's on the right

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.230
side is nine between eight and 10.

28
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.160
Yes it is.

29
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.220
So this is true making the whole thing true.

30
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.750
Let's try it.

31
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.200
There we go.

32
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.120
We get one.

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.400
So false.

34
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.190
True true.

35
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.410
Next select all the books written before 1980.

36
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800
So I didn't specify what part of the book.

37
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.030
That's totally up to you.

38
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.250
Let's just do title and release here so we can see that released year from books and then the key thing

39
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.610
is we want to do where released here is less than 1980 and not less than or equal to because it says

40
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.570
non-inclusive so less then we're released here is less than 1980 to make sure it works.

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.290
And there we go.

42
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.850
All books written before 1980.

43
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.250
Apparently we only have one.

44
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530
Let's just actually verify that.

45
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.910
It's kind of catching me off guard there.

46
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.430
And it looks like that's the case.

47
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.160
All we have is Cannery Row Well I apologize if we don't have more exciting data.

48
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.820
Next up select all books written by Eggers or shavin which I now know how to pronounce.

49
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.260
So there's a couple of ways of doing this.

50
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.000
Let's start with the most straightforward maybe which would be.

51
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.540
And also let's do title and author last name.

52
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.930
So again I didn't specify what parts he had to select.

53
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.880
It's up to you but this makes most sense if we can see the authors last names.

54
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.350
So what we can do is select them where and we can use and or so we can do a double equality where author

55
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.510
last name is equal to Aggers or author last name is equal to Shaban where author L name is equal to

56
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.410
Aggers or author name is equal to shavin just like that.

57
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.300
That's one way of doing it.

58
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.110
And you can see we get those for books.

59
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.530
However we can also use in because all that we're doing is trying to see if author L name is in the

60
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.650
set of Eggers and shavin so we can combine them.

61
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:50.610
Basically say where author name in that set copy that never go.

62
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.600
Same result.

63
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.750
So whichever you prefer this one is a little bit easier to see.

64
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.270
I guess it's shorter easier to edit and if you want to add another author and it's pretty simple but

65
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.720
this is also perfectly valid.

66
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.510
Next select all the books written by Lahiri published after 2000.

67
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.810
So the first thing will do.

68
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.990
Title and this time will do.

69
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.520
Author L name.

70
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.080
And released here from books and will start by all books written by the.

71
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:36.120
So where author L name equals Harry so we can start there.

72
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.550
We know this should work but we get two books and now we want only the ones published after 2000.

73
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:53.480
So what we need is a logical and so where author name is here to live here and released here is greater

74
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.830
than 2000 and I didn't specify if it was inclusive or not.

75
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.070
So based off of language published after 2000 will keep it as a greater than if you put an equal sign

76
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.270
there.

77
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.220
It's not.

78
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.100
I mean you got it right.

79
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.150
Essentially I didn't do a great job of clarifying that before.

80
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.400
So either one works now we only get the namesake.

81
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.470
Also really great read.

82
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.930
Next up select all books with page count between 100 and 200.

83
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.620
So just like the problem we did back here there's a couple of solutions.

84
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.470
The first one is to use logical and so we can do select title and page count or is it just pages from

85
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:44.440
books where pages is greater than 100 and less than 200.

86
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.400
So where pages will do greater than or equal to pages is greater than or equal to 100 and pages less

87
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.060
than or equal to 200.

88
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.160
That's one way of selecting based off of a range.

89
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.540
As we get these shorter books but we could also use between which maybe you gathered because of the

90
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.550
language here.

91
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.650
It screams out between.

92
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.720
And that might simplify it a bit.

93
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.560
So all we have to do is change it to where pages between 100 and 200.

94
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.250
Nice easy to read version.

95
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.120
We get the same results.

96
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.490
OK.

97
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.290
One thing remember that this is inclusive.

98
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.190
So if we didn't want to include 100 and 200 we could either do this or we would have to change just

99
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.930
to be 100 one and when ninety nine or something.

100
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.280
OK.

101
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.170
So I'll leave it as 200.

102
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.140
Moving on select all books where the author last name starts with a C or an S.

103
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.500
So there's also a couple of ways of doing this one.

104
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.430
We'll start with the simplest one.

105
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.230
So we want to select and this time will do.

106
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:06.380
Title and author L. name from books and basically we want to let's just type it out with the pseudo

107
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.330
code or English code.

108
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:17.720
So where author Al name starts with C or author

109
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.020
Al name starts with s.

110
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.590
So those are not you know it's not valid code.

111
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.240
So how do we do this.

112
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.590
There's a couple of options.

113
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.860
The first one is to just use like if you're comfortable with that sort of starts with C..

114
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:45.780
You can just say where author I'll name like and then we use the percent sign to force the C to be at

115
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.530
the beginning of the string.

116
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.780
So remember that this says string starts with C and then anything afterwards.

117
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.940
So that's one way to say it starts with the C and then we just do the same thing done here like s but

118
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.470
the percent sign after that and that should do it for us.

119
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.770
So we get shavin Smith Carver Steinback Saunders good collection of authors.

120
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.960
However there's another way which is to use substring.

121
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:22.590
So if you remember substring Maybe you remember me complaining about how there is also an abbreviated

122
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:33.770
subset S T R version so we could use that so we can say were author L name sub stra of author L name

123
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.800
and we want one common one which will give us the first character we want to check where that's equal

124
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:48.550
to C or not just duplicate this whole thing where it's equal to S..

125
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.860
So we could do this and we get the same thing.

126
00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.640
But there's yet another way to clean this up which is to then I'll just keep them all here so you can

127
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.910
see them all.

128
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:12.940
We could go and because we're checking these two values we could also use in C comma s just like that

129
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.620
and get rid of the OR.

130
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.930
So now we're saying it's like title author realname from books where the first character of author all

131
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:26.370
name is in the set of C or S And We get the same result.

132
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.930
So three different ways.

133
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.970
Next up.

134
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.020
Moving on to case statements.

135
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.300
So in this one I tried to throw you for a little bit of a curve ball because unlike the other case statements

136
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.510
we saw where we were just using greater than the must.

137
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.880
Then there's a couple of things we're doing here.

138
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.850
So we're just working with title but you're seeing if title is like stories.

139
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.140
And then you're seeing if it exactly equals just kids or a heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius.

140
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.090
So let's let's start off with the basics.

141
00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:05.760
Select title and author name and we'll just do from books just like that.

142
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:12.370
And then we need our case statements syntax so we're going to have case and I like to just put my and

143
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.910
right in there as well as my as I call it type which I don't actually think is a great name genre would

144
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.800
be better.

145
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.560
But inside of here we're going to have our statements.

146
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:30.730
So the first thing we're going to do is figure out OK if Title contains the word stories anywhere type

147
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.120
as short stories so when title like.

148
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.990
And how do we write or express the fact that it can contain stories anywhere not just at the beginning

149
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.870
but anywhere in there.

150
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.490
Well we use parentheses accesory for sentence.

151
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:54.320
So this means that it contains the string stories with anything afterwards which technically we could

152
00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.980
have histories or something which maybe is not what we want but we can leave it at that.

153
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.080
You could put a space here or something to make sure that is just stories but I'll keep it simple with

154
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.400
stories like this.

155
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:15.440
Then that's going to be short stories as our type.

156
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.900
OK then we have another statement.

157
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.980
When title and when title is exactly just kids or Heartbreaking Work is Staggering Genius.

158
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.480
We should print out memoir.

159
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.710
So let's leave that part blank and just add in then

160
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.360
memoir.

161
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.980
So then how do we fill this part in.

162
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.700
It's pretty straightforward it's going to be a bit annoying.

163
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:52.130
So how do we check it's equal to just kids when title equals just kids or when title equals.

164
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.740
And this is going to be very long so I'm going to copy it.

165
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.270
Where are you

166
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.180
just like that.

167
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.120
And I might shorten that.

168
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.340
I definitely would shorten it so maybe it would be better to use it like or something and search for

169
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.650
a particular part rather than the entire name.

170
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.610
But that was the problem here.

171
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.970
Followed by our else which is otherwise everything is a novel.

172
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.170
So that's where this comes in.

173
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.050
Else novel just like that.

174
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.070
Now let's double check.

175
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.660
We don't have any extra commas which I said I sometimes do looks good.

176
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.020
Let's try it out.

177
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:46.000
And we get all novels except for just kids and a heartbreaking work is staggering genius.

178
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.800
And then those are memoirs and then we have to Raymond Carver collections of short stories and a David

179
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.680
Foster Wallace Collection.

180
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:53.840
OK.

181
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.520
So that's it.

182
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.950
And of course he could clean this up so you could have used in here.

183
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.030
Title equals so you could say where title.

184
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:08.770
In just kids comma Heartbreaking Work Staggering Genius you could use the like something like this or

185
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:14.630
a title like heartbreaking although maybe we have multiple books with heartbreaking the title.

186
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.730
So I'm going to leave that and move on to our final one.

187
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.580
How do we make this happen.

188
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.810
So again what's happening we're grouping things right.

189
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.050
Author and we're counting how many books each author has written but we're not just printing that out.

190
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:35.240
We're printing it along with a space and then to correct the pluralize version of books.

191
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.500
So we'll start by just printing out.

192
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.750
We can ignore title just to author last name and account without the book's part.

193
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:58.820
So that should be review of group by and count so we'll select author I'll name Khama count star from

194
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.000
Books Group II and we need to group by author.

195
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.930
So if we do this

196
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:17.000
you'll see we end up with Carver has two books Aggers has three books and so on.

197
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.760
We do have that problem with Harris having two books.

198
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.540
So we need to make this more specific.

199
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:30.370
Are we also grouped by author first name and now we have two different Harris's perfect son now how

200
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.490
do we instead of just printing out like this how do we add in that variable.

201
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:40.100
The changeable suffix book or books that use the case statement.

202
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.880
So I'm going to make some space here and rather than just printing the count we're going to add in our

203
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.690
case case.

204
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:54.160
And and if you look at how I printed it I just call that count.

205
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.880
So and as counts then what is the logic we're actually trying to do.

206
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.030
What we're trying to figure out when the number of books count star is equal to 1.

207
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.740
Let's say then we want to do something.

208
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.500
Let's just say singular book.

209
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.060
This isn't the right answer.

210
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.390
Otherwise will you.

211
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.580
Books.

212
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.300
OK so the logic is going down the right page regrouping things by author.

213
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.350
Then we're having a case statement that says when the total count of the number of books that authors

214
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:33.030
written is equal to 1 then count is book.

215
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.840
And before I forget we are missing our then's.

216
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:42.190
So one count equals 1 then book that's very important.

217
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.280
Now if we paste it OK so we get Carver has books.

218
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.770
Eggers has books but huge Harris has book.

219
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.670
So we're close but how do we get the number in there.

220
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.090
And we need to use Concat.

221
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.690
Hopefully you guessed that.

222
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:05.770
So we're going to concat Basically we want to take the number which is going to be count and we want

223
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.910
to concatenate it with space book.

224
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.310
Now if we wanted to shorten this we could just hard code this as one book.

225
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:14.580
Right.

226
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.510
Because when Count is equal to 1 then it's always going to be one book.

227
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:26.110
This is the one where we have multiple books we need to add in the number because it could be two books

228
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.290
could be 10 books.

229
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:37.690
So of concat the two pieces which are going to be Count star comma and I know this looks like a lot

230
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.180
here.

231
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.980
So let's step through it.

232
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.730
Concatenate the count with space books.

233
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.580
So two books three books and that should do it.

234
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.890
Let's double check.

235
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.840
Here we go.

236
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.980
Carver has two books.

237
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.380
Shaban has one book.

238
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.000
Harris has one book here he has two books.

239
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.790
The only other improvement I guess to suggest would be to also put author first name just to make it

240
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.050
a little clearer.

241
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:14.460
In the case of Harris we now can see Dan Harris has one book and Frida Harris has one book to play here

242
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.880
he has two books.

243
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.480
Oh right.

244
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.780
Quite a bit there.

245
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.720
You made it through time to move on.

246
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.900
We can burn that part of us that's attached to the books.

247
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.900
We are done.

248
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.300
We're moving on to bigger more exciting things.

249
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.830
I highly recommend that you if you're at your computer get up and take a break because joined our big

250
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.220
section.

251
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.160
Very important stuff.

252
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.840
Coming up next but a bit dense so go for a walk.

253
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.470
If you'd like or do whatever you need to do to get prepared to focus on joints.
