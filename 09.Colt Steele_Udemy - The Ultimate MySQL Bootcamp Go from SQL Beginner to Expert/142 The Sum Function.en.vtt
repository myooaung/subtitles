00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.940
All righty then it's a little enthusiastic.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
Well next up we're going to talk about summer which is another built in function.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.350
It doesn't it sounds like I know I say that a lot but it's some to gather data.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.010
It adds things together.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.420
Very exciting.

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.370
It actually is pretty useful.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.780
You can do things like I don't know some together all the profits all the sales that you've made or

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.700
your entire payroll for a given month.

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.630
Let's say you can find some important information using.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.880
For instance you might want to sum all the pages in our entire database.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.210
So this is following the same pattern as the last couple of videos have.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
We're going to show you how to use this function on its own without good.

13
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.040
And then I'll show you at the end of the video how to use it with Group.

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.580
So OK.

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320
Some All the pages in the entire database.

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.180
It's pretty simple.

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.370
It's just a select some pages.

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.430
From books and it tells us six thousand six hundred twenty three.

19
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.630
And that's all there is.

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.200
We could do silly things like some go way Siri.

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.510
All right we're back so we could do something silly like a select some released year and that's just

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.310
going to add together all the years in our database.

23
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.200
Let's see thirty seven thousand nine hundred ninety six.

24
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.720
Very important insight we just gained.

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.570
OK.

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.360
So that's all there is to something things on it don't.

27
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.070
Now let's see how we use it in conjunction with GROUP BY.

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.160
It works the same way as what we've seen before.

29
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.680
Basically we group things together by whatever let's say author or I don't know year and then we select

30
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.460
what we want and we can use some to help a select so select all the pages or some all the pages each

31
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.250
author has written.

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.230
Let's see who which author cumulative cumulatively has written the most number of pages.

33
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.690
So we'll start with a select and those two are the same thing with the with author F. name author L.

34
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.180
name.

35
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.740
And then we'll some pages.

36
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:27.570
So we'll do that from books and then we need our all important group by author F. name author.

37
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.120
Actually you need to do l name first and then FDM just like that.

38
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.680
And you can see looks like Dave Eggers has the most 1293.

39
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.090
Raymond Carver 1:53 John Steinbeck only has one book so it's only 181 pages and that's pretty much it.

40
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.110
To some at this point we could of course do the same thing with let's say adding the released year for

41
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.930
their books.

42
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.810
Also a very insightful piece of information that we need but we can see people who have multiple books

43
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.770
like Raymond Carver.

44
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.600
There's multiple years added together Yep that's pretty much it.

45
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.660
OK so that's some I guess said.

46
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.310
You may end up using it if you're.

47
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.970
I don't know.

48
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.690
Dealing with sales data or payroll any sort of information where you're summarizing things.

49
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.130
Actually I just used it recently when I was compiling my taxes.

50
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.310
Probably going to bore you to death of this but I have a whole I have a database that has sales data

51
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.960
for every week for one of my projects I have going on and I just wanted to figure out exactly in a given

52
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.890
year how many cells or not how many but how many dollars I had sold in that entire year and just add

53
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.510
all those values together.

54
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.130
I didn't want to manually enter them into a calculator so it was just a matter of using Select sum and

55
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.900
actually did a select some with a group by because I grouped by year because of sales going back.

56
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.430
I think 2016 15 and 14.

57
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.440
So I only want in 2016 for my tax season anyways.

58
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.490
If you're still there.

59
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.040
Thanks for making it through that.

60
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.190
And our taxes are not the most interesting subject.

61
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.530
But yeah some can be useful sometimes.

62
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.410
And now that was just bad.
