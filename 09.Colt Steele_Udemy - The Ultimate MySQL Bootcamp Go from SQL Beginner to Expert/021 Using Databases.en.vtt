00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.770
So we saw how we can create databases and destroy them.

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.650
So what comes next.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to see how we actually use them.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.690
And I mean that in a very literal sense in my as well.

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.000
There is a use command and what this does is it tells me as well which database we want to be working

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.780
with.

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.520
So we have potentially 10 different databases on one my a school server and we want to search some data

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.440
from one of them.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.420
What we need to tell my as well which one we want to be using at any given time and we can switch between

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.330
them using the use command that you see right here.

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.840
So really quickly show you how it works over in cloud 9.

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.870
So if we create a new database

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.850
then we'll just call this one dog walking app and we hit enter.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.050
We do show databases.

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830
There it is.

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.180
And if I want to use that all I have to do is type use dog walking app and you won't see much except

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.730
for database changed.

19
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.030
That's a good thing.

20
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.660
But if we wanted to know for sure what database we are currently using there there's another in my escarole

21
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.430
command that we can use that command looks like this select database with parentheses after it.

22
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.220
And what this will do is tell you the currently used database.

23
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.240
So let's try that out.

24
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.540
Back in cloud 9.

25
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.380
If I type select database with those parentheses and a semi-colon that tells me database is dog walking

26
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:51.340
app and if I decided to delete that database I would use the drop database dog walking app command.

27
00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.280
It tells me queery OK I do show databases and it should be gone but if I do my select database command

28
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.670
pause and think to yourself for a moment what database do you think I'll be using right now.

29
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.440
We were using the dog walking app but then we deleted it.

30
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.430
So now what.

31
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.010
And here's the answer.

32
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.310
Kind of a trick question.

33
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.870
We're not using a database right now and the no here and we'll be talking a bit more about NO throughout

34
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.670
this course but that basically means we're not using any database.

35
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.190
So just to show you one more time if we switch.

36
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.970
Let's say I wanted to use one of these preexisting ones like the C-9 database.

37
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.270
I'm not going to do that.

38
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.060
But if I wanted to I just use C9.

39
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.160
And now if I do my select database

40
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.620
tells me database is se'nnight.

41
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.080
OK so that's all there is to using a database.

42
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.490
And then also this select database command to see your current database.

43
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.510
Next up we'll start talking about tables and putting some data in these databases as soon as possible.
