WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.550
All right we made it.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.820
This is the section that a lot of you probably have been waiting for.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.110
It's where we connect my ass.

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.720
Well not to just a random node file but to a web application which is really just a random node file

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.360
that has some other code in it.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.220
We haven't seen yet but that's what we'll see in this section.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.370
So we're going to build a very simple app that serves as sort of a mailing list for a startup slash

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.130
Colt c u l t c o l t or Colts.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.600
It's very hard to say but that's how we're going to build mailing list application that you know we

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700
could collect emails before we launch a product or something or collect emails before the world or whatever

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.110
we're worrying about.

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.190
So we're going to see how to do that in this section.

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.710
It's going to be mainly a catalog.

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.240
So it's going to function really I'm going to show you something then you'll do it yourself and I'll

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.040
show you something else and you'll do it.

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.710
There's not going to be you know a ton of new content as far as my as well as concerned really none.

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.490
It's really all the auxilary stuff that goes into a web app.

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.750
So if you don't know anything about web development I should preface this by saying there's going to

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.450
be a lot of stuff here and this is one section right this could be a whole course on development.

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.280
In fact some people have built courses on web development.

21
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.160
This is not a course on webdav So it's an hour or so of content not 40 hours of content.

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.680
So don't get overwhelmed just follow along and build it.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.380
If you are someone who knows development some of this may seem a little bit slow for you.

24
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.160
For for example and I'm talking about H.M.S. assess feel free to skip.

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.080
I mean feel free to skip whenever you want but in particular those sections.

26
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.190
So that's pretty much all I have to say here.

27
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.240
Congratulations on making it to this point.

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.050
Very exciting.

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.740
Hopefully you can see how to make an app Bleus very jazzed about it aren't you.

30
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.520
Blue blue.

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.940
That's about the most excited she ever gets.

32
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.050
I miss dogs.
