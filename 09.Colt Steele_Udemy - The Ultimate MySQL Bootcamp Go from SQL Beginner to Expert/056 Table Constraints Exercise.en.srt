1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,740
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,150
So it's your turn to put some of this into practice with a single exercise.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,660
It should be pretty quick.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,700
All you need to do is define a single table.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,140
So here are the demands.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,440
Well the man sounds a little strong here the requirements define an Employees table.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,380
So let's say we're a company trying to manage them.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,420
Employees will definitely need more data than this to actually make it operational.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,980
But for now this is all we need.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,480
Seven different fields seven columns ID last name first name and middle name and then age and current

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,450
status.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,160
And actually I can't count.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,400
This is six.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,960
So Id it's relatively self-explanatory.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,230
It should be a number.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,520
I'm not telling you the data types but you should know at this point what they are.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,000
So a number that automatically increments it's mandatory so it can't be left off and it's a primary

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,430
key.

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,490
Last name and first name are both text which is in that data.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,280
Again you need to use the actual term and then neither of them can be left blank either.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,490
They're mandatory but middle name.

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,540
Well it's also text it isn't mandatory because not everyone has a middleman so we can leave that blank.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,740
Then we've got age which is numeric and it is mandatory can be playing.

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,220
And finally current status which is essentially like their employment status if they're employed or

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,080
if they're fired.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,440
And it should be mandatory so it can't be null.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,240
But if no status is provided when something is inserted it should default to employed.

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,100
So we'll have two statuses employed and terminated or fired or something.

29
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,110
I guess turbinate is more professional.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,560
And so it should just default to current status is employed if nothing is provided to insert.

31
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,030
OK.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,100
So go ahead and define this table type it out.

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,690
Try running it to make sure it works and then try inserting some data as well to make sure that it works

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,850
ok.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,920
If you want a solution have it in the next video.
