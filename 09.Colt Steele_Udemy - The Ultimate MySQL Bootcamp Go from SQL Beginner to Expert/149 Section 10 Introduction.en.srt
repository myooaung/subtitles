00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello again.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,730
Welcome to the next section.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,080
So first of all hopefully you can see me.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,450
I am wearing camouflage.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,530
I know that I can make it a little challenging but I am here not just a floating head.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,730
With that said this section is a well keep saying important everything is important but this section

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,340
is really taking us back to basics in a way we're talking about data types.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,110
So if you remember way back I don't know Section 3 ish.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,050
I mentioned that we would come back to data types.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,460
When I introduced Vardar of our car I forgot to say it and integers are two data types you've been working

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,550
with which are great.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,310
They're very useful but there's a big world outside of those.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,690
What about things like decimals.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,020
How do we store currency you know price information where we have information after the decimal.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,550
How do we store things like dates and time.

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,050
Well we're going to go things like dates and times.

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,270
There's a lot of information that we need to store that doesn't neatly fit into Vardar or integers.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,210
So this section is all about introducing and surveying those kind of different data types and it could

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,640
have done this early on in the course but I've done it in the past like that in person and I find that

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,070
students get too bogged down just worrying about all the data types when really they need to be focusing

21
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,900
on things like create tables and insert statements.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,140
You know that's the focus of sequel in my essay.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,950
Q Well we can insert or we can add new data types easily.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,320
So that's what this section is.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,890
We have the two we've been working with.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,610
Now we're adding a bunch more a ton of exercises here.

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,620
Nothing you know complex with our data.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,810
We're not you know using any brand new data set.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,990
All we're going to focus on are the data types.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,640
We'll see.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,590
In particular we'll focus on dates times date times time stamps.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,220
All of this terminology it gets a little crazy but hopefully we can simplify that in this section.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,230
All right.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,620
See in the next video.
