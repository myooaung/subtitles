1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,370
So now that we've seen how to use source we're going to take advantage of it to get some sample data

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,840
going for the next couple of videos and exercises.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,650
Cats are kind of boring.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,210
They're pretty simple at this point.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,030
Name and age and breed and we need some more complicated data.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,670
And that's a little something that's a little more real world.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,090
So we're still not working with you know something straight out of a production app because we haven't

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,540
seen some of the features that we need to know for that to work.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,040
So it's still kind of simplified data but what we're working with is books data.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,060
So this is what we have.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,000
I've given you this file so you can find it in the file section or if the downloadable section of this

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,570
video.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,620
Basically there's two parts for creating a Books table.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,690
And I'll go over that in just a second.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,070
And then after that table is created there is a bunch of values that I'd like for you to insert and

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,360
I didn't want you to have to type these all at once but I want us to all have the same data so we can

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,010
be on the same page when we run exercises.

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,950
So all of this data is actually real data about books from Amazon.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,620
And basically it has every book has a book ID so that should not be new.

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,010
There's a title to our.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,770
Then we have an author first name and author last name.

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,910
So if we look at one Here's the namesake.

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,940
That's the title The author first name is Juba and her last name is Lahiri.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,670
Then we have the released year.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,540
So what year was it released.

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,900
And this is an example where we're using kind of the I don't wanna say dumbed down but simplified version

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,840
of data because typically you would probably store a date an actual date not just a number like 2003.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,260
So we'll see how to do that when we talk about dates.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,690
But for now we just have 2003 and then the next thing is stock quantity.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,780
And this is just an arbitrary number I picked.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,120
The idea here is that we have a fictional bookshop and we're keeping track of all the books and how

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,790
many we have in stock.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:14,820
So for the name sake we have 32 copies in stock for a hologram for the king we have 154 copies in stock.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,080
Then the final thing is the pages how many pages are in that book so you can see some books are really

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:29,330
long like the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay has 634 pages and some are much shorter like what

36
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,450
we talked about when we talk about love by Raymond Carver.

37
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,910
Really good short stories if you like short stories.

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,160
176 pages.

39
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,820
So a note about these books.

40
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,780
I started off by just picking off the best sellers on Amazon.

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,820
As of writing today so I think that's where this one Norse mythology final game came from but I then

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,010
just decided to create a variety of years and page numbers.

43
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,780
Some of my favorite authors.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,110
It's a whole mix of things.

45
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:05,270
So it is real world in a sense but it's also sort of I plan certain things to work a certain way so

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,650
we have certain you know we have some really long titles and some short titles.

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,520
We have some really long books and short books we have some books from the 2000s and some from the 9900

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,450
and so on.

49
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,060
Basically I wanted a variety of things that we could practice with.

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,960
So go ahead create a file in cloud nine and put all of this in there.

51
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,230
Now if you want to type it go ahead.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,640
But I would recommend that you don't just say that you don't accidently mess something up.

53
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,630
We want our data to be consistent.

54
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,000
So go ahead copy it make a new file and then we need to execute that file.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,860
And I want to make a new database right now if we do select database.

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:52,190
We're working with cat app I want to create a database and we'll call it bookshop and then use bookshop

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,730
and we should have a blank slate.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,460
If we do show tables there should be nothing here.

59
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,840
Perfect.

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,410
So what you want to do is make sure this file has been saved and then we just execute it.

61
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,100
So it's a pretty straightforward source.

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,280
And then you need to make sure you either are referencing the correct path.

63
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,640
So in my case I'm running my CFI and my root directory.

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,960
So all I have to do is book data as well whatever you call it.

65
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,130
You don't need to refer to.

66
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,990
I recommend just putting in the main directory for now but we could you know you could have a separate

67
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,170
folder if you wanted to.

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,240
And you just need to refer to it correctly anyways.

69
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,730
Source Book data as well.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,750
And here we go.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,660
All right.

72
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,030
First thing we get this message and that tells us the create table worked and then we get 16 rows affected.

73
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,900
And that tells us the Insearch statement worked.

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,220
So let's just verify those do describe books.

75
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,960
Here we go.

76
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,850
Here's all that we created in that table.

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,940
And let's just do a simple select start from books and you can see it's pretty messy.

78
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,750
And that's still a bit.

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,130
We're going to work on ways.

80
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,990
We're going to see ways of refining this and making things shorter.

81
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,070
Collapsing data and so on.

82
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,580
So that's all we're doing in this video just getting set up now that we have it in there and our database

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,390
will be able to work with it and be on the same page.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,830
Awesome.
