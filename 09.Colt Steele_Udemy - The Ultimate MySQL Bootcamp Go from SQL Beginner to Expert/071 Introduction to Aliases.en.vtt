00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.250
So one more thing we're going to talk about with reading data when we're talking about crud before we

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.460
move on to updating and deleting there's one other thing which are aliases.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.940
These are really simple very short video here.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.540
Basically we can specify how our data should be displayed back to us.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.610
So what that means is rather than having cat ID name breed and age here I could tell my as well that

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.400
instead of breed I want I don't know type of cat.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
Or instead of age I want years and it won't alter the data itself.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.990
It just is how it's displayed to me.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.550
So let me show you a more specific example.

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.280
Here we have using an alias.

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.170
We're selecting the cat ID as ID so rather than saying cat ID in the results it will only say id and

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.580
then name from cats.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.690
Now this is not that clear why it's useful and that won't become clear for a little bit because right

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.050
now our data is very simple and straightforward.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.810
But once we have multiple tables and we're selecting from.

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
But let me give you an example let's say we have a pet shelter where we have a cat table and a dog table

17
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750
and both of them have a name.

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.840
So dogs have names.

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.960
Cats have names.

20
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.590
And when we talk about join tables which you'll learn about in a little bit that's when we take both

21
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.100
tables and we select from them at once and combine them and the results we would have two columns with

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.150
name.

23
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.920
So we would need to figure out which one is cat name which one is dog meat.

24
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.220
So we could use this as to label it so it wouldn't change the actual data.

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.470
Ours our data is the same the columns are the same but when printed back out to us when it spits out

26
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.560
the data it would use an alias.

27
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.580
So if we try this now

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.550
Cat ID as ID a common name from cats you'll see that we get ID here.

29
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.430
And just to make that clear I did the same thing and I even put a little arrow pointing to that ID.

30
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.890
It doesn't say cat I.D. It says ID.

31
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:14.410
So also just to prove this we could do something like select name as cat name or Also just to show you

32
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.820
you can use quotes to add spaces.

33
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:26.350
So cat name like the comma will also select breed as Kitty breed.

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.520
Why not from cats.

35
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.430
And there you go.

36
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.550
Our new column headers here are cat name and Kitty breed.

37
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.190
But of course if we do describe cats you'll see nothing has changed.

38
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.840
Our fields are still name and breed.

39
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.650
Just when we print them out so that's all there is to alias's you'll see us using them later on.

40
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.360
But I want to introduce them now so that you're not overwhelmed with a bunch of new stuff.

41
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.610
When we get to join tables.
