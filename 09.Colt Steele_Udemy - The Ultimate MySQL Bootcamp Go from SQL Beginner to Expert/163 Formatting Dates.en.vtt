00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.340
So in this video we're continuing with dates not the most exciting topic potentially I know but an important

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.320
one nonetheless.

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.420
So we're talking about formatting days.

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.990
Right now we have dates times date times all stored in a somewhat clunky condensed but difficult to

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720
read at least for human.

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.100
It's difficult to read format just not very nice.

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.490
So how can we extract things out of let's say a date time.

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.770
How can I convert that so that it says something like.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.740
April 21st.

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.220
Like the full month name followed by a space Twenty-First to 1 S T and then the full year rather than

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.890
you know 2017 dash 0 4 dash 2 2.

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.780
So we're going to do that first thing I want to show you though is that in the documentation there is

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.030
a pretty massive list of date and time functions.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.990
And I will be honest with you.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.280
Most of these I never use and you likely will never use that won't stop me from showing some of them

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.590
to you and I'm going to try and highlight which ones are most important and the first two I'm going

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.120
to show you.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.250
I don't actually think are that important but they are nice to know that they exist and they're a set

21
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.160
of these one off little functions.

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.100
I'm not sure even what to call them.

23
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.480
But basically there's a group of them at least in my mind that grouped together things that will extract

24
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:36.600
an individual piece of information like day or day name or day of month day or week day of year hour

25
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.930
month minute.

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.870
So let me show you what I mean.

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.030
So I'm going to hop over to cloud 9 and we have a select star.

28
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:56.930
Let's only worked with birth date for now so we'll select name comet birth date from.

29
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.720
OK.

30
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.120
So instead of displaying the date here or the entire date what I can do is use some of those things

31
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.930
that we talked about.

32
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.700
Whatever that group is trying to day you'll see what it does.

33
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.820
So rather than birth date I'll select day of birth date and all that it does is extract the day.

34
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.930
So for you compare actually what might be better.

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.600
And if I keep a birth date and I just add in an extra column with day so it's extracting the day 11

36
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.420
25 and 21.

37
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.500
So there's other things we can do.

38
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.910
Let's just go with this list to have a peer day name.

39
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.520
And this is a bit more useful.

40
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.530
There are times when you want to do this as you can see we're extracting that.

41
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.380
So turns out this is a Friday.

42
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.490
This is Saturday.

43
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.760
This is another Friday.

44
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.360
I know some people can figure this out.

45
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.960
Mentally there's a whole trick to doing it.

46
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.700
I'm not one of those people so we just have to trust it that this is indeed a Friday.

47
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.230
Moving right along.

48
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.110
We can try.

49
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.240
Day of week.

50
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.500
And you might wonder how is that different.

51
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.280
Well it gives you a number.

52
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.610
So Friday is a six Saturdays seven Sundays one and so on.

53
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.940
Then we also have day of year and that will tell us starting from the beginning of the year.

54
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.440
How many days was at Intel.

55
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.330
Misstepped the parentheses.

56
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.230
Area until that date.

57
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.160
So for something on Christmas of 1943 it was that 350 the day of the year my cat blue.

58
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.250
Come on Blue.

59
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.370
And this of course takes into account things like leap years.

60
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.930
So important to know.

61
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.530
With that said these also applied to date times.

62
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.830
So if you tried to do it on time we start right there instead of doing first date.

63
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.280
And you tried to do first time while others never be an immediate problem which is we're not storing

64
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.860
day of the year or day information at all.

65
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.410
But just to show you we don't get an error right.

66
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.500
We get warnings but we don't get something that breaks everything.

67
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.910
We just get no it doesn't work.

68
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.150
But we can do it on a date time and that's what Like I said I use most of the time.

69
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.000
So if we do birth D.T. Instead you can see that it's giving us the correct numbers here.

70
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.060
3:59 right 11 and so on.

71
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.840
So we we can use all of ones I've seen Day Day name but there are other things too briefly that work

72
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.700
for date and date time.

73
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.230
So things like month.

74
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.480
So that tells us the month.

75
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.600
What else is there.

76
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.460
I think there's a month name yet.

77
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.500
So if you want the full name of the month.

78
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.550
There we go.

79
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.610
And then lastly when we're working with the time so if we go and changes to birth time

80
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.510
there are a few methods that apply here.

81
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:35.860
We can do things like our if you want to extract the hour or minute.

82
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.330
Now I don't end up using time on its own that often so I don't really end up using these minute or hour

83
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.080
second on their own effort really.

84
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.560
So that's part one of formatting dates.

85
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.540
Imagine if you wanted to use something like this instead of just printing out the day or something.

86
00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:08.350
We wanted to say April 21st 2017 at 6:00 p.m. maybe or we don't even need that let's just say April

87
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.080
21st 2017.

88
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.720
So how would we take this date.

89
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.260
That would be 2017 dash 0 4 dash 21 and convert it to this.

90
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.130
Well we could use what we've already seen and do a giant Concat.

91
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.230
I won't make you do this entire thing but basically we could extract the month name

92
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.780
get this and then concatenate it out with a space and then this part's a little trickier right.

93
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.270
You need to.

94
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.250
It's going to be a pain.

95
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.960
Honestly you would have to have some magic that I haven't shown you how to do yet because you don't

96
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.520
always add as T after a number.

97
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.480
What if it's the 23rd.

98
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.090
So that's a little bit more complicated so let's reduce it to this.

99
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.530
So for that we would want to get the day right.

100
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.060
And then we want that year.

101
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.240
So you could do a giant Concat.

102
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.250
Basically it would take all of these birth date.

103
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.210
It's just going to get messy.

104
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.440
And the point is that there's a better way.

105
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.280
But imagine you're doing this.

106
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:23.200
So we have a concat month name of the birth date comma with a space comma the day of the birth date

107
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:32.030
comma another space comma that year or if the birth date is a bit of a mess.

108
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:39.670
But let's see if it does work so we'll just select that from people.

109
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.920
There we go.

110
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:49.250
November 11 1993 December 25th 1943 25 1943 April 21 2017.

111
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.560
So it does work.

112
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.120
But this is not a great way of formatting dates.

113
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.630
And in fact there's a much better way which you probably gathered because the way that I set this up

114
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:06.240
there is an entirely separate method or function excuse me that we can use called date format.

115
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.280
So date format is really really useful in my opinion.

116
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.050
I use it all the time.

117
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:17.650
What it does it looks a little intimidating looking at the documentation but what it does is it allows

118
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.650
us to format things nicely and powerfully.

119
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.940
We have a lot of different things that we can do.

120
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.810
So these are called specifiers over here there's a table of them and they're basically little symbols

121
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.890
little shortcuts that allow us to specify what we want from that date.

122
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:41.080
So let's say we're working with the date time and if I want to get the month name I use percent sign

123
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:50.950
capital M. and if I want the month number then I use percents on lowercase m if I wanted to get the

124
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:57.210
day of the week as the weekday name I use percent upper uppercase w if I want the date that week has

125
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.500
number is percent lower case w and so on.

126
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.870
So what we do is combine them together in a string.

127
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.270
And when you pass it into date format it will take a date and then the string of how you want to format

128
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.170
it and spit out a nice answer for you.

129
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.030
So here's an example.

130
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.630
Use my fridge there my ice maker I guess being noisy.

131
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.390
So we've got date format of this date time here.

132
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.070
It works some day times and just plain days.

133
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:35.650
So here's the date time though my fridge making so much noise.

134
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.000
I think it's done.

135
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.340
So we have this date time and we're formatting it with this which looks a little bit like jibberish

136
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:50.760
but we have percent uppercase W. which gives us the day of the week as the word the name of the day

137
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.400
of the week.

138
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:58.040
And then a space which gives us that space then we have present upper case M which is the name of the

139
00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.910
month.

140
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.480
So we have October and then another space and then we have percent y which gives us the year.

141
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.630
So really useful and versatile.

142
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.800
I'm just going to just copy this one over.

143
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.670
Just run it so that you can see what happens.

144
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.630
If I hit Enter we get Sunday October 2009 but we're free to put whatever we want in here so we can do

145
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.480
dashes.

146
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.730
Not that it really makes sense but if we put dashes there it still puts important information here that

147
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.870
we specified.

148
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.080
But now they're separated by dashes.

149
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.940
So it gives us some freedom we can do you know group them together like that if we wanted to put commas

150
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.440
or we can put an entire word before after we can do whatever we want.

151
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.370
So this is really really useful if we go back and select let's work with date time.

152
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.980
So we'll do select date format

153
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:07.600
and then we're working with birth T and then some string that will provide in just a second.

154
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.540
We'll come back to that

155
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:21.340
from people we can start with something really simple like just getting the day of the week has a yellow

156
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.610
to do day of the week first as a word so uppercase w

157
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:36.940
we could do something like was born on a Friday Saturday or Friday.

158
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.840
But as you saw there are a bunch of other things that we can do here.

159
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.100
Know we can work with hours and minutes.

160
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.610
We can work with second month names tons and tons of things.

161
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.180
It's really versatile and very useful.

162
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.610
And typically the things that I end up doing with it are just formatting data so that they look like

163
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:10.320
you know at least in the US where we put the month first followed by the day followed by the year.

164
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.800
So that's pretty simple to do.

165
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.370
Think about how you would do it though.

166
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:21.560
If you want to give it a shot how do we take this and change it into that so we can do that now.

167
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.700
All that we want is good month number.

168
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.310
Right.

169
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:37.540
So that's percent Am I believe followed by a slash and the day present D followed by a year which is

170
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.870
percent why and see if that works.

171
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.420
Almost If you notice I use lower case Y and that gives us that two.

172
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.470
I don't know we call this the abbreviated year the last Dugit digits of the year.

173
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.580
So we want uppercase Y and I just have to remember that.

174
00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:02.200
But if you couldn't remember how to do it you can solve this and you'd find it.

175
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.000
Where's that your numeric 4 digits versus two digits.

176
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.700
So let's wrap all this up we talked about a lot of different ways of formatting dates.

177
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.600
I frankly don't use these that often.

178
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.640
Like I said because you can do the same thing using date format.

179
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.790
I should mention there's also a time format.

180
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.410
It works exactly the same way.

181
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.940
You just pass in different or you pass in a different format or here.

182
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.760
So you're not going to be able to get month day and year from a time that you can get you know hours

183
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.980
minutes seconds.

184
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:41.140
But like I said I'm not working with times as often and if I am using a time component within a date

185
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.570
time so I might do something like this

186
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:59.830
at let's say let's just do hour and minute and we'll put a call in there and there you go.

187
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.190
So I'll do something like that.

188
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:08.140
But I'm rarely working with just a time but there is a time format if you do need to do that.

189
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:08.850
OK.

190
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.210
So back to where I was wrapping up here.

191
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.540
There are all these weird one off functions.

192
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.910
I don't use them though because you can just replicate it using tape format and it's much easier for

193
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:23.710
me just to remember one function date format rather than 15 separate functions.

194
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.180
So that's the basic formatting dates.

195
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.800
Next up we're going to talk a bit about doing math with Dade's.
