1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,680
OK so what we've seen so far allows us to specify what columns we want name and age only or only easy

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,490
but it still gives us every single result in the table.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,910
So if we have 10000 users in our database if we wanted to select one we don't have a way of doing that

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,600
right now.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,550
We only can select all of them which really is not that useful.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,210
In fact most of the time when you're selecting things you're doing it deliberately and you're trying

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,700
to find particular pieces.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,020
You're not just trying to check in on your table make sure everything's OK.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,610
You're usually trying to let's say sign someone in if it's an application you're trying to verify find

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,520
someone by their user name and check if their password matches that they entered into your website or

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,380
something like that where you're searching for specific data.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,710
And to do that we need to use what's known as the WHERE clause.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,310
So it's another magic keyword where it allows us to get specific.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:04,500
It allows us to say I want all cats who are 4 years old or I want all cats who are Tabby's and those

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,760
are very simple examples.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,130
But later on throughout this course we'll continue to expand your arsenal for select and for searching.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,350
You'll be able to do things like I want all cats that are Tabby's between the age of 1 and 2 and whose

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,510
name starts with the letter B.

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,280
Let's say.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,140
So we'll be able to get much more specific.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,090
But for now we're focusing on the basics.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,720
And as a side note I want to show you that we will use where all the time.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,200
So it's not just for searching or for selecting But we'll need to use it when we're updating or deleting

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,370
things as well because we're trying to update every single thing or delete every single thing.

25
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:50,370
Usually we want to update something specific so we might say I want to update the cats where their age

26
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:57,290
is too and I want to make their age three versus I want to update every single cat to have an age of

27
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:57,830
three.

28
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,070
We could be more targeted using WHERE.

29
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,930
So we're going to start by seeing how we use it to select.

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,660
So here's an example.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:12,260
Select the star from cats where age is for so notice the syntax here.

32
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,880
We have our same select star from CAS that will give us all cats but then we have this where age equals

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,290
four.

34
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:28,550
So what this will do is only select the data from the cat's table where the age column is equal to four.

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:38,650
And if we try that now if we look at our data actually you'll see we have two cats Ringo and egg who

36
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,080
are both four years old.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,950
So if we do a select start from cats you see what we get.

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:53,480
But now if we modify that with our where age equals four semi-colon we only get those two results.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,600
So we still get cat ID name breed and age because we you start that tells us the columns.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,590
But now we only have two results because we used where to get specific.

41
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,680
One note noticed that when I refer to age here that is the column age.

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,170
There's no quotes around it.

43
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,690
It's just age.

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,560
So we can do the same thing here but this time I'm using name to drill down or to get specific.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,160
So select star from cat.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,350
Name is equal to egg.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,520
And notice I use quotes here because it's no longer an integer like ages.

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,230
Name is far char.

49
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,200
It's text.

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,740
So we need those quotes so we can try that.

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:42,680
Now select star from cats where name equals egg.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,130
Just like that you notice we get egg cat ID name breed and age.

53
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,290
One side note while I'm here you may come across as at some point.

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,410
What do you think will happen if I fully capitalize eg.

55
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,790
It still works.

56
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,290
So it's important to note that by default this is case insensitive.

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,040
So I could do lowercase g uppercase G and it still gives me the same data.

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,480
So we'll see ways around this later on.

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,710
Oftentimes it is useful though to not worry about case if you're dealing with things like an email address

60
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,840
where case doesn't actually matter.

61
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,540
So if a user types in their email with a capital letter at the beginning versus lower case it should

62
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,650
still be the same email in your database.

63
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,990
But we'll talk about that later.

64
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,410
I just wanted to point out that the thing case insensitivity So that's all there is for now to the where

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,910
clause.

66
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,790
Now there is a lot more that we will be seeing and working with like I mentioned at the beginning of

67
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,540
this lesson we will come back and use where all the time.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,210
And in fact we're going to continue to use it for updating and deleting.

69
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,860
Like I said we need to specify what we want to delete and what we want to update.

70
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,680
But I just want to make it clear we're not done with where there's a lot of add on functionality that

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,140
we'll see in ensuing sections.

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,680
Perfect.
