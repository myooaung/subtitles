1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,460
So we've seen the basic components of crud creating reading updating and deleting.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,860
You've learned how to do all those operations and sequel and now it's time for the super ultra hyper

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,960
mega critics or size.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,950
Actually let me try that one more time.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,860
It's time for the Pied Piper American regular protesters of Tony Benn.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,790
Half a second.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,260
I already regret that.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,480
So let's move on.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,480
So the idea here is that you're going to get to put all the different things you've learned to use.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,240
So this will be one exercise in this case.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,940
We're working on closet inventory.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,160
Super exciting I know.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,060
So basically the idea is that I or you or somebody has a bunch of clothing in their closet that they

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,170
want to go through an inventory and figure out sizes and colors.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,700
And we're just focusing on shirts so different types of shirts tank tops polo shirts T-shirts and so

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,160
on.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,240
And we can go through and we'll just perform some basic operations on them.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,310
I do want to add a note that I know that up until now our data has been sort of trivial and this included

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,030
T-shirts.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,890
It's not that exciting or that realistic really.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,670
But we still don't have the pieces to go into complex real world data that you would see in a web app

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,480
but we will get there.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,320
And so hold tight.

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,520
I promise we'll be seeing a lot of real world potentially more exciting definitely more challenging

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,010
data.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,270
So we're working on spring cleaning.

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,680
And you're going to have a bunch of operations to do and the first one is to create a brand new database.

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,910
So think back to how we did that.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,660
No more working in the database.

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,750
We need a new one called Shared DB.

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:45,710
To create that and then the next step is to create a new table called shirts and to do that you need

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,080
a little more information.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,400
You need to know what does that table look like.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,540
So here you go.

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,110
Here is a graphic representation.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,360
We've got a shirt I.D. which can not be null and is a primary key.

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,320
We have article which should be something like T-shirt or polo shirt or tank top.

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,310
It's text.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,830
And we have the color of the shirt which is also text white green black blue and so on.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,080
We have the shirt size in this case Smalls and mediums text.

42
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,840
And then we have last oh actually before I move on I do want to call your attention to the fact that

43
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,410
I did shirt underscore size rather than just size.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,790
And that's because size is a bit of a reserved word.

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,520
You can still use it but it's a word that my ass will use just internally size.

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,000
And so it's better to avoid any conflicts there so I just want my shirt size.

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,470
And then last worn is a number and that refers to roughly how many days ago the shirt was last for.

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,250
So the idea is that we would inventory our closet.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,260
Maybe you do this maybe you don't.

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,570
But you go through and you figure out what you don't wear all that often and then either sell it or

51
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,180
donate it or I don't know make tie dye with it.

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,490
Whatever you do.

53
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:06,230
So that's what we're trying to calculate or what we're trying to store here and it's just the number

54
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,850
for now.

55
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,430
So create that table.

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,200
It should be called shirts.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,840
And once you do that you can move on to the next step which is getting the starter data in there.

58
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,350
So I want all this data in the table but I don't want you to have to type it up yourself.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,690
It can be obnoxious to insert that manually.

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,080
So I've given you a basically a starter seed data that contains the exact same thing.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,370
So a white T-shirt that small with 10 days ago.

62
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,070
So you can see it's the same as this first shirt here.

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,620
And I've done it for all eight.

64
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,610
So you could copy this.

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,970
It's in the text of this video as well.

66
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,260
And then what you can do is just insert it all at once.

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,280
So remember how to do a multi insert.

68
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,770
Get all that data in there with a single line.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,150
And then the next step is to add a single new shirt.

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,890
So insert something manually not using a multi answer but just one at a time.

71
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,610
A purple polo shirt that's medium.

72
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,650
That was last worn 50 days ago.

73
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,470
All right.

74
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,030
So then once we have those nine shirts in there we can now start to do some stuff with them.

75
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,480
First thing we'll do is select all shirts but only print out article and color.

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,370
So we should only see T-shirt purple polo shirt black.

77
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,050
We don't want to see ID we don't want to see size or last worn.

78
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,900
Then once you do that the next step is to select all medium shirts.

79
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:38,100
So all shirts that have size of medium and print out everything but the shirt ID.

80
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,490
So we want all of this here article color shirt size last worn but not this.

81
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,410
But only for the medium's OK.

82
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,610
Then next up we're moving on to update.

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,150
So we've done that create in the read we're working on update now which is update all polo shirts to

84
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,470
be size large.

85
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,780
Maybe I don't know you realize that the company that makes your polo shirts it might say medium on them

86
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,730
but in reality they're pretty large.

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,480
And so you want it.

88
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,830
Update your database.

89
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,010
It's a dumb story.

90
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,000
Just let's just go with it.

91
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,070
So change their size to large So that's where article equals polo shirt.

92
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:24,110
Next up update a shirt that was last worn 15 days ago and change last one to zero.

93
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,520
So this would mean we are sure that was born 15 days ago that we decided to wear today.

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,900
So we're going to change the database to say last warn is now zero.

95
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,540
So once you do that.

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,760
Now our final update.

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,290
We had a bit of a mishap.

98
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,770
We were doing laundry.

99
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,350
We took all the white shirts and we washed them with I don't know.

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Some colored stuff that we shouldn't have and we shrink them at the same time so we have a double update

101
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,380
here.

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,720
You need to update all the white shirts to now be an extra small size and their color is no longer white

103
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,710
but it should be off white.

104
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,940
So you need to update both of those at once with one line just to be clear.

105
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,240
All right.

106
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,100
Next we're deleting.

107
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,310
So delete all old shirts and in our case all just means if it was worn 200 days ago or last one 200

108
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,810
days ago we will see very shortly how you can do things like delete all old shirts that have been last

109
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,600
worn greater than 50 days ago.

110
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,710
But for now we're doing exactly 200 days.

111
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,600
OK.

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Next up our taste has changed we've decided we no longer like wearing tank tops.

113
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,570
We don't like the person that it turned us into.

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,370
So we're going to delete all tank tops from our database so delete all data.

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,530
The Paul shirts were article is tank top then finally catastrophe strikes.

116
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,290
We have to do the all shirts.

117
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,680
I'll let you decide why.

118
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,830
But we need to delete all the shirts.

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,160
That doesn't mean delete the table or the database just delete the shirts in the table.

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
So it should be an empty table.

121
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,900
Then finally drop the entire Schertz table.

122
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,320
Another catastrophe.

123
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,850
So it should be an empty table at this point.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,520
Drop it entirely and that's it.

125
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,500
So go through all those steps.

126
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,920
I recommend just pausing the video as you go.

127
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,680
Make sure you do them and then if you'd like watch the solution to see how to do it or how I did it.

128
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,350
OK.
