1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,320
So we're moving onto logical order which as I just mentioned is like a brother or sister to a logical

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,850
end.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,820
And if you've worked with any programming language you're most likely familiar with and and or logical

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,420
and and logical or so logical or you can either write out as Omar or just like we could write A&amp;E for

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,880
and or we can use these two pipe symbols.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,040
So these are not uppercase eyes or els or ones they are the piped character which is usually located

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,090
above the right return or enter key.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,420
You have to hit shift most often to hit it.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,190
So it's two of them together just like it was two ampersands for and just symbols.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,780
It's pretty standardized or very standardized across all program languages that I've worked in ampersands

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,630
and types for or.

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,180
But you can also use the phonetic or that spelt that version o r.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,690
So before we dive into exactly how it works let's try something.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,610
So we had this in the last video.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,310
So it's all books written by Dave Eggers.

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,780
Released after the year 2010.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,750
But what if we just change the ampersands to the or pipes.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,470
What do you think will happen first of all.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,590
So I'm just going to copy this an Oxford type this all again.

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:28,150
And just change the ampersands here to OR and make a hit return.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,820
So it's clear what's happening.

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,640
So if we read this if you just say the word or hear it makes a bit more sense it's like title An author

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,240
name and released year from books where author name is Aggers or released here is greater than 2010.

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:55,090
So if we run it what we'll get is all books written by Dave Eggers and all books were released here

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,780
is greater than 2010.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,220
So rather than both sides of this having to be true just if either side is true we'll get the data so

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,640
we get all the books by Eggers including this one a heartbreaking work a staggering genius which came

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:17,200
before 2010 but then we move on to the second part which is to selected all books that were released

30
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,440
after 2010 regardless of the author's name.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,810
So it's a way for us to specify two things either of which we want to be true or both.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,680
So in the case of a hologram for the king it is both written by Dave Eggers and it was released after

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,090
2010 or same thing with the circle here.

34
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,420
But 10 percent happier for instance it was only this part was true released years greater than 2010

35
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,240
because author L name is Harris or Saunders In this case or gaming.

36
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,040
OK so again that symbol right there.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,620
I forgot I made this nice little slide this animation that changes symbol is very very important.

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,490
It changes the meaning entirely from the statement.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,120
So if we have two conditions with an ampersand between them or three or any number of conditions with

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,790
ampersands it means that both sides must be true in order for the whole thing to be true as we've seen

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,110
already.

42
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,730
However with the OR operator it means only one side must be true for the whole thing to be true or both

43
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,910
sides can be true as well.

44
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,480
And I know that's a bit odd to talk about in this way without actual examples.

45
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,350
So if we hop over again and we do the same thing I've been doing the last couple of videos and to type

46
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,310
up a few example exercises and then we'll go over solutions.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,030
OK so I'm back here.

48
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,920
I've got three just three this time that I'll use logical order to try them out and then I'll be back

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,660
with a solution and I'm back already.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,370
OK.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
So first one here.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,220
40.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,340
Less than or equal to 100.

54
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,400
Well that part's true.

55
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,150
Forty is less than 100.

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,020
So it doesn't matter what's over here.

57
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,750
This whole thing is true because we only need one half to be true.

58
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:13,680
Happens that negative 2 is not greater than zero but that's irrelevant because the left side is true.

59
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,370
Moving on to this one 10 and greater than five is that true.

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
Yes.

61
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,970
So it doesn't matter what's on the right side.

62
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,830
But that happens to also be true that the whole thing is true.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,520
So we get one and this last one bit of a curve ball is the letter A.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,210
Equal to the number five.

65
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,460
Well that's not true.

66
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,430
However this side says 3000 is greater than 2000.

67
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,310
That is true.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,400
So the whole thing is true

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,690
as you can see we get one for true.

70
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,760
OK.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,220
Last thing before I forget.

72
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,820
Just like with.

73
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,190
And we can chain or together as many times we want.

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,350
So it doesn't have to be something like this.

75
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:04,420
So if I go back to this example it's like title author I'll name released your from books where author

76
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,120
name is Aggers or release here is greater than 2010.

77
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,960
So let's try adding an OR here and I'll spell it out this time.

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,740
And let's say not only do we care or do we want to select things written by Eggers or released or greater

79
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,630
than 2010.

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,420
We'll also add another or which is stock quantity is greater than 100.

81
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,460
So books that we have a lot of stock in as well.

82
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:36,050
And let's also print stock quantity just like that just copy this whole thing.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,550
Paste it semi-colon.

84
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,240
And if we look to see it makes a slight difference because we also get this.

85
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,400
David Foster Wallace story collection in here which was written in 2004 which normally wouldn't make

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,790
the cut with our previous version but because we added star quantity greater than 100.

87
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,610
It's in here because stuck on the is greater than 172.

88
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,780
So for some of these for instance a hologram for the king.

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,460
All three parts are true.

90
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,180
It's written by Aggers it's released after 2010 and it has more than 100 copies in stock.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,330
But then like for David Foster Wallace and oblivion only one part is true.

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,120
The last part.

93
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,580
So it just goes to show you that only one component even if we have three different conditions only

94
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,000
one part has to be true for the entire thing to be true.

95
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,780
And for it to be selected and spit back to us OK.

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,210
So that's logical or one thing that I will point out that I know you're probably dying to get on with

97
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,790
this video but you can combine or and and see how to do that in a little bit.
