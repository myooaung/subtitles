1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,780
All right moving right along here we're working with photos this time.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,430
And the easiest way to store photos is just a single table photos.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,100
But of course they need to be related to a particular user who created the photos.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,550
So we'll have an idea and all will store about an image itself is the image you Arel which will just

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,560
be a string.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,590
You know we could have added a caption as if our char excuse me not string could have added to caption.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,790
We could have added location data on Instagram you can say where it was taken.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,900
You know there's all sorts of things that we could do but we're just focusing on image you are all in

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,890
our case.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,020
And then a user id very important foreign key pointing to users dot ID.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,710
And then we also have created ad just like we had with users just a nice way to be able to you know

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,310
sort photos by most recent to least recent or figure out the first photos somebody posted or if one

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,210
photo was posted before another if you know what one looks like it's this is actually happened to me.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,650
People take a photo of mine and repost it claiming that it's their own.

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,600
Doesn't happen often but two times actually the same person and the person actually flipped the image

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,360
like mirrored it posted it claimed that it was their own.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,030
But of course it could just show that mine was posted first thankfully because there's a date.

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,450
I mean it didn't really matter anyways.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,010
Right.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,500
Just photos on their social network.

21
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,730
But still having that created out there helps me there.

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,530
So let's implement it now.

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,480
It's pretty straightforward.

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,660
Just create table photos

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:51,230
we're going to have an I.D. We'll also have our photo or image you or ever we want to call that will

26
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,430
have a user ID and then created that.

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:07,940
So ID is an integer or it's autoincrement primary key will be referencing photos that ID from other

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,960
tables because things like comments are associated with a particular photo or likes our and tags as

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,470
well.

30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:23,210
So we need that primary key there image you or will just be a Vardar 255 book.

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,630
We should add not no.

32
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,760
We don't want that to be empty or to be all that's a big problem because there would be no photo to

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,100
display and then user ID that would be an integer.

34
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,780
And let's also make that not know a photo needs to be associated with the user.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,580
We can't have an orphan photo that has no user and then created that just be another time stamp that

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,770
the default value of.

37
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,490
Now the time is created.

38
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,980
But we still need one more piece which is our foreign key constraint which is going to pertain to user

39
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:12,070
underscore ID which is referencing references the users table the ID field as the referer and there

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,860
you go.

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,230
OK.

42
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,180
And that will create our photos table.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:26,740
So if I just restarts this whole thing now if I do show tables we have both tables in there if I do

44
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,170
or describe photos you've got photos there everything looks good and just like before.

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,350
If you want to stick around I'm going to insert one or two photos in here associated with our three

46
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,130
users.

47
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,230
But I'm done with creating the schema so you feel free to move on to the next one which is comments

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,860
but if you want you can stick around as I do.

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:54,130
Insert into photos and DiVall just to an image URL and a user ID.

50
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,150
Those are the two things we have to supply our self values and our first one let's say blue.

51
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,130
Submit it and we'll come back to you or else.

52
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,080
But Blue's idea is going to be one.

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,940
And if we weren't sure could do you know select star from users can see blue SP1.

54
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,400
Charlie Brown is too cold.

55
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,170
It's three.

56
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,230
So we'll just do something silly.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Let's just say that you are.

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,820
I was just random like that.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:31,710
I'll duplicate that a couple of times in card it's command shift D or control shift on a PC and then.

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,030
But you know here's another random thing this time it's submitted by Charlie Brown.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,640
Let's say Charlie Brown has another one as well like that.

62
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,880
OK.

63
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:53,710
And I haven't submitted any photos that should work if we run our source again this time.

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,680
So I'd drop the database recreated it switched to it use it with the use command created or two tables

65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,590
inserted all of this data.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,280
Now if we can do select star from photos we should have three simple photos there with a user ID.

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,110
We're now at the point where we could do a simple join if we wanted to figure out who posted these photos.

68
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,180
So again indefinitely if you feel good about this move on and don't waste time watching this.

69
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,320
But if you want the practice we could just you select.

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,220
Let's say I wanted to have the image you were all created at and the name of the username of the person

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,730
instead of a user ID.

72
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:47,130
So we'll just do a select start to start from photos join to a default inner join users on and we're

73
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,780
going to do it where photos don't use your ID equals users dot ID.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,090
So if we start with that

75
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:06,620
there's a lot there some let's send it out to just be photos that image you are now com users.

76
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,840
User name savageness username.

77
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,660
Yes just like that

78
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,070
copy.

79
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,390
OK.

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,330
Now we can see that the cat created that and Charlie Brown created those two.

81
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,110
All right.

82
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,380
And what I'm going to do just to set a pattern for the next few videos is move these you know Joines

83
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,610
and things that I'm just playing around with down to the bottom and comment them out.

84
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,120
We don't want those to run but I'll leave the insert statements here as well as to create tables.

85
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,390
All right.

86
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,970
Moving on.
