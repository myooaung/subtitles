1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,130
Either Welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,100
So this section is really important.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,520
It's where we actually start talking about code.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,150
It's where we install everything.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,380
And by the end you'll be running your own sequel commence.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
So some big things we're doing to start off we're just going to talk about what makes something a database

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,340
what makes a database compared to.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,380
I don't know just a programming language.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,280
What's the difference.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,360
And then we talk about the difference between sequel as well and Maia's.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:32,760
Q Well a really common question and something that's basically fundamental to all databases are all

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,430
relational databases at least and then from there we're going to move into installing stuff.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,280
Really important step for this course.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,000
You'll install my Esky well get it up and running.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,970
And by the end of this section for some of the challenges and exercises you'll be running your first

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,450
bit of my ask you all code.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,360
So nothing crazy we're not working with any you know complex data yet.

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,050
We will be but not yet.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,630
We're starting off nice and easy.

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,150
Just some simple commands but still something.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,290
So by the end of the section we'll be doing that.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,680
All right let's get going.
