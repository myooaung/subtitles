00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:06.255
In this demonstration, you will learn how to fetch and pull changes.

2
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.275
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:13.265
As you can see, now we have the perspective of Julia.

4
00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:17.010
Julia still has here the very simple Program class without the

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.305
head command that Thomas has implemented.

6
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.285
Let's open up Team Explorer.

7
00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:27.305
As you can see, Julia has opened the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

8
00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:31.295
Now let's go to the Synchronization page of Team Explorer.

9
00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:36.265
Let's click here on Fetch to see if there are any Incoming Commits.

10
00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:40.937
Julia can see here that Thomas has added the DataAccess project to the

11
00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:44.285
solution and that he has implemented the head command.

12
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.635
Now Julia can click here on Pull to merge these

13
00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:50.315
commits into her local master branch.

14
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.255
As you know, pull does a fetch and a merge.

15
00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:58.033
Now you can see we got the latest Program.cs file with the

16
00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.305
head commands that Thomas has implemented.

17
00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:05.255
Now Julia could also start the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool,

18
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:09.285
and she can just type in help to see what this command does.

19
00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.305
But actually, she thinks this text should be,

20
00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:16.275
Write help to list available coffee shop commands,

21
00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:20.245
because here we write, Available coffee shop commands.

22
00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.285
So let's make this adjustment.

23
00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:29.255
Let's adjust this text, Write help to list available coffee shop commands.

24
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.245
Now let's go to the status bar here, we have one change,

25
00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:37.255
let's click on it, and now we are on the Changes page of Team Explorer.

26
00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:38.005
As you know,

27
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.593
you can right-click this file and you can compare

28
00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:42.265
it with the unmodified version.

29
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:45.225
Instead of using this context menu entry,

30
00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:48.570
you can also double-click your file in Team Explorer to

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.295
directly navigate to the changes.

32
00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:54.295
And here you can see now that we have added here coffee shop.

33
00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.285
Now let's commit this change.

34
00:01:56.285 --> 00:02:00.295
Let's write here as a message, Adjust help message.

35
00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:05.245
Now let's use the drop-down here and then select Commit All and Push.

36
00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:10.265
Now we are here on the Synchronization page and you can see the Outgoing Commit.

37
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:14.040
Now Julia has successfully pushed her changes to the

38
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.305
master branch in the remote repository.

39
00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:17.305
In the next clip,

40
00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:26.000
we will switch back to the user Thomas and you will learn how you can resolve merge conflicts.
