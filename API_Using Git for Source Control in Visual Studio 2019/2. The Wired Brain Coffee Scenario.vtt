00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:06.927
Throughout this course, we will use the so-called Wired Brain Coffee scenario.

2
00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:11.917
Wired Brain Coffee is a company that runs several coffee shops around the world.

3
00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:14.561
Now they want a new coffee shop information tool that they

4
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:18.537
can use to find out how many kilograms of coffee beans a

5
00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:20.937
specific coffee shop has in stock.

6
00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.987
They ask you to build this coffee shop information tool.

7
00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:26.917
But now worries, I will help you.

8
00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:28.987
We will build this together in this course.

9
00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.997
What they want from us is actually this console app.

10
00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:37.937
As you can see, it says it's the Wired Brain Coffee - Shop Info Tool.

11
00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:41.334
You can write help to list the available coffee shop commands and

12
00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.907
you can right-click to exit the application.

13
00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:48.937
So let's just enter help, and now you can see the available coffee shop commands.

14
00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:50.987
Frankfurt, Freiburg, and Munich.

15
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:54.937
Let's enter frankfurt here and let's hit Enter.

16
00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:59.418
Now you can see that the coffee shop in Frankfurt has 107 kg of coffee

17
00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.977
beans in stock and they have also 350 paper cups in stock.

18
00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:07.997
To exit the application, you just enter quit and hit Enter.

19
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:09.957
So this is what we will build.

20
00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:12.977
So now let me show you the planned architecture.

21
00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:14.813
We will create a .NET Core console app that is

22
00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:18.927
called WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool.

23
00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:22.163
This app will use a .NET Standard class library to

24
00:01:22.163 --> 00:01:23.957
load the data about the coffee shops.

25
00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:28.934
The WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess library generates the data about the coffee

26
00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:31.977
shops in memory so that you don't have to set up anything else,

27
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:35.937
like, for example, a database to get this sample running.

28
00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:37.917
This solution is very simple,

29
00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:41.937
but it's great to learn how to use Git in Visual Studio.

30
00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:45.927
You will learn how to create a Git repository for this solution.

31
00:01:45.927 --> 00:01:50.967
We will create the Git repository locally on my machine with my user account.

32
00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:55.987
Then we will push it to a Git service so that the repository is also there.

33
00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:59.917
As you know, Git is a distributed version control system,

34
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:05.917
which means in this case that you have the full repository locally and remotely.

35
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.907
A well-known Git service it GitHub.

36
00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:11.937
But in this course, we don't use GitHub.

37
00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:14.917
Instead, we use Azure DevOps.

38
00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:18.957
But the concepts that you will learn apply to any Git service.

39
00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:19.383
Now,

40
00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:23.818
working with just my user account won't show you the typical

41
00:02:23.818 --> 00:02:27.182
workflow and scenarios that you have when multiple developers

42
00:02:27.182 --> 00:02:29.927
are working on a project with Git.

43
00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:30.997
But I have good news for you.

44
00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:34.997
Throughout this course, there is another developer in our team.

45
00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:38.967
I'm happy to introduce you to Julia Developer.

46
00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:43.947
Julia with clone the Git repository from Azure DevOps to her machine.

47
00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:44.977
Throughout this course,

48
00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:50.967
we will either work at Thomas or as Julia so that you can see both perspectives.

49
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:52.947
With these two user accounts,

50
00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:56.997
you will learn how to handle different Git scenarios in Visual Studio.

51
00:02:56.997 --> 00:03:00.327
Let me show you now the course outline so that you

52
00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:02.987
know how this course is structured.

53
00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:04.118
In this first module,

54
00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:07.413
you will learn how to create a Git repository and how to

55
00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:10.947
push it to Azure DevOps as user Thomas.

56
00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.907
You will also learn how to clone the Git repository

57
00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:16.937
from Azure DevOps with the user Julia.

58
00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:17.967
In the next module,

59
00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:22.496
you will learn how to commit changes and how to synchronize your local

60
00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:26.947
repository with a remote repository by pushing and pulling commits.

61
00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:30.957
You will also learn how to handle merge conflicts in Visual Studio.

62
00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:34.997
Next, you will learn how to work with branches and tags.

63
00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:38.298
You will learn how to create a branch in Visual Studio so

64
00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:40.947
that you can work isolated on a feature.

65
00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:45.907
You will also learn how to merge your feature branch back to the master branch.

66
00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:48.967
I will also show you in this module how to create tags.

67
00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:50.163
In the next module,

68
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:55.947
you will learn how to create and review pull requests directly in Visual Studio.

69
00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:58.917
When we will start with the last module of this course,

70
00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:00.977
the coffee shop info tool will be done.

71
00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:04.977
You will learn in this module how to view the history of your code.

72
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.967
I will show you how to view the history of a file,

73
00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.917
how to compare changes of two commits,

74
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.267
and how to use CodeLens in Visual Studio to find out more

75
00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:16.927
about the history of a specific code part.

76
00:04:16.927 --> 00:04:22.587
In all these modules, the Wired Brain Coffee scenario is used with the two users,

77
00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:23.917
Thomas and Julia.

78
00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:24.997
Now, in this current module,

79
00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:29.957
you will learn how to set up exactly this structure that you see on this slide.

80
00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:40.000
Let's start in the next clip with my user account and let's create a new local Git repository with Visual Studio.
