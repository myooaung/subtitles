00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:02,495
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:07,891
you'll learn how to create a repository for an existing solution.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:11,252
Here I've opened a directory of the Git repository that

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:13,851
we have created in the previous clip.

5
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:17,881
You can see here the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool solution.

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:21,931
Now let's delete this .git folder, which is our local Git repository.

7
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:26,901
Let's also remove the two files gitattributes and gitignore.

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:31,841
Now we have actually a solution that is not under source control.

9
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,024
Let's double-click the solution and let me show you how you can create

10
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,841
a Git repository for the solution in Visual Studio.

11
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,921
Let's go to the Solution Explorer, and all you need to do,

12
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:44,483
you just right-click on the solution and you can select

13
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,891
here Add Solution to Source Control.

14
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,891
This will create a local Git repository.

15
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,921
Instead of using the Solution Explorer,

16
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:56,228
you can also use Visual Studio's status bar to create a

17
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:58,861
local Git repository for this solution.

18
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,911
So, let's click here on Add to Source Control, and now you can see Git.

19
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:07,911
Let's click on Git to create a local Git repository for this solution.

20
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,881
Now Team Explorer shows the Synchronization page.

21
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,921
Here you can push the local Git repository to a remote repository.

22
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:19,861
Now let me just bring up the File Explorer again.

23
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,383
Here in File Explorer, you can see we have,

24
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,891
again, a new local Git repository,

25
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,921
and Visual Studio has also added the two files,

26
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,891
gitattributes and gitignore again.

27
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,921
Now let's go back to Visual Studio.

28
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,871
Let's go to the Home page of Team Explorer and let's click here on Changes.

29
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,891
As you can see, there are no changes,

30
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,931
so let's look at the history of the master branch.

31
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,901
Let's go to the Branches page, let's right-click on the master branch,

32
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,861
and let's select here View History.

33
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,876
As you can see,

34
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,779
Visual Studios has automatically made the two commits that

35
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,871
we did manually in the previous clip.

36
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,931
First, it added the files gitignore and gitattributes,

37
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,891
and then it added the project files.

38
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:06,350
You can actually look what is part of such a commit but

39
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,921
double-clicking it in this history view.

40
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,851
So you see, the other two files were added,

41
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:14,174
and in the other commit, the Program.cs file,

42
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:17,931
the cs project file, and the solution file were added.

43
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright, so now we have a solution in a local Git repository. Let's push this repository now to Azure DevOps.
