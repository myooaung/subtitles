00:00:01.463 --> 00:00:06.393
In this demonstration, you will learn how to push to a remote repository.

2
00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:09.423
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:11.413
To push to a remote repository,

4
00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:15.373
you just go to the Synchronization page of Team Explorer.

5
00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:17.413
So let's click here on Sync.

6
00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:23.373
Here you find two sections, Push to Azure DevOps and Push to Remote Repository.

7
00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:25.773
In the first section, you can click here on Publish Git Repository,

8
00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:30.906
and then you can use your Microsoft account to find all the

9
00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.463
organizations you are part of in Azure DevOps.

10
00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:38.443
Then you can specify the repository and you can just publish that repository.

11
00:00:38.443 --> 00:00:41.373
But instead of using this section,

12
00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:44.443
let's use the second one that works with any Git service,

13
00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.373
including Azure DevOps.

14
00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:49.383
Here you just click on Publish Git Repo,

15
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:54.373
and then you need to enter the URL for an empty Git repository.

16
00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:57.443
In Azure DevOps, everything is set up already for us.

17
00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:02.383
So let's go to Azure DevOps to grab that URL.

18
00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:07.383
Here I've opened dev.azure .com /wiredbraincoffee.

19
00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:10.373
Let me switch my browser to full-screen mode.

20
00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:14.463
The Wired Brain Coffee organization has here a Tools project.

21
00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:19.413
Let's open up this project and let's click here on Repos.

22
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:25.443
As you can see, here is an empty WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

23
00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:28.193
So let's just click here this little button to copy

24
00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:30.443
the clone URL to the clipboard.

25
00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:34.453
And now, let's go back to Visual Studio.

26
00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:40.423
In Team Explorer, let's just paste the URL and let's click here on Publish.

27
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:43.393
Now the repository was published.

28
00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:46.463
When you publish the first time to Azure DevOps with your user account,

29
00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:51.433
you will see a pop-up window that asks you for a user name and password.

30
00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:56.403
Now let's open up my browser again with Azure DevOps.

31
00:01:56.403 --> 00:01:59.423
Let me hit F5 to refresh this page.

32
00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:04.413
Now you can see we have uploaded the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool.

33
00:02:04.413 --> 00:02:06.373
Let's click here on History.

34
00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:10.443
Here you can see the two commits that Visual Studio has created for us.

35
00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:13.413
Now let's go back to Visual Studio.

36
00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:19.413
When you click on Branches, you can see now the remotes master branch.

37
00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:23.413
Also, when you go to the settings in Team Explorer,

38
00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:28.383
you can see here beside the Global Settings the Repository Settings.

39
00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:31.251
These Repository Settings are available when you have opened

40
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.463
a local Git repository in Team Explorer.

41
00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:36.423
Let's click on these settings,

42
00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:42.443
and when you scroll down here you can see here the Remotes repository.

43
00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:46.393
So if you want to add a remote repository manually,

44
00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:47.463
or if you want to edit it,

45
00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:52.423
you can do this here in the Repository Settings in Visual Studio.

46
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:56.443
Alright, now the user Thomas has a local Git repository,

47
00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:01.423
and he has also pushed the Git repository to Azure DevOps.

48
00:03:01.423 --> 00:03:02.525
In the next clip,

49
00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:11.000
we will switch to the user Julia and she will clone that Git repository from Azure DevOps.
