00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.050
In this demonstration, you will learn how to push an update for a pull request.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.990
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.040
As you can see, we work now as user Thomas.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.050
In the previous clip, Julia has approved Thomas's pull request with suggestions.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.040
So now in Team Explorer, let's go to pull requests.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.960
Here you can see the Handle coffee shop commands pull requests,

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.050
and you can see that it was approved with suggestions.

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.020
So let's double-click this pull request, and let's click here on Open.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.000
Now down here in Visual Studio, you can see the Pull Request Comments.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There is an active comment from Julia.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.960
Hey Thomas Claudius Huber, you should include the paper cups in stock.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.970
This comment was made in the CoffeeShopCommandHandler.cs file.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.970
So let's click here on this file name to navigate to the file.

14
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.980
Here you can see Julia's comment,

15
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.000
which was added to the line where we write the Beans in stock to the console.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.010
Let's turn off the comparison view to see the whole file.

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.040
Julia wrote, you should include the paper cups in stock.

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.050
Oh yes, that's actually a great idea.

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.010
We should also write the paper cups in stock to the console.

20
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.990
So let's hover this comment, and now we can like it,

21
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.020
and we can also add an answer.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.050
Hi Julia, that's a great idea.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.960
I'll add it in an update.

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.000
And let's click here on Comment.

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.010
Now let's go back to Team Explorer,

26
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.020
and let's open up the Program.cs file and let's scroll down here.

27
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
Oh, here we see actually the thumbs up.

28
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's hover this, and now you can see that Julia likes this code.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.040
Now let's go back to the Team Explorer, and let's exit this pull request view.

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.030
As you can see,

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.393
we are still on the feature/coffeeShopCommands branch for

32
00:01:54.393 --> 00:01:57.000
which we have created the pull request.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.980
So now let's update this branch.

34
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.970
Let's go to the Solution Explorer,

35
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.050
and let's open up the CoffeeShopCommandHandler class.

36
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.990
Let's scroll down, and here,

37
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.980
after we print out the Beans in stock of the found coffee shop,

38
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.000
let's add another Console.WriteLine,

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.980
and let's print out actually the Paper cups in stock.

40
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.960
And let's use the coffee shop's PaperCupsInStock property.

41
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's add a semicolon, and now this looks good.

42
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.000
Let's quickly test if the application builds.

43
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.153
Yes, let's write here help, and let's type in,

44
00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.010
for example, Freiburg,

45
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.990
and now you can see that we have here 250 paper cups in stock.

46
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.588
Great!

47
00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:42.980
Let's quit the application.

48
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.960
Now let's go to Team Explorer, let's open up the Changes page,

49
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.010
and let's enter here a commit message.

50
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.000
Let's write here, Write paper cups in stock to console.

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.980
And let's commit and push that change.

52
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.020
We have already created a pull request for this branch,

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.870
so now let's go again to the Pull Requests page and let's

54
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.990
double-click here this pull request, and let's open it.

55
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.000
Here you can see that we have now two updates.

56
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.050
Update 1 is the original pull request,

57
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.871
and Update 2 contains the adjustment that we have just made to

58
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:21.990
write the paper cups in stock to the console.

59
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.990
So now let's select here Update 2,

60
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.050
and let's open the CoffeeShopCommandHandler.cs file.

61
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.692
Let's scroll down to the Console.WriteLine with the paper cups in

62
00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:33.980
stock and let me turn off the comparison view.

63
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.980
You see here the old comment that we have made on Update 1.

64
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.465
Now let's right-click the line where we write the

65
00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:42.960
paper cups in stock to the console.

66
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.000
Let's select Add Comment from the context menu.

67
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.980
Now let's write, Hi Julia, here are the paper cups in stock,

68
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.020
and let's click the Comment button to create this comment.

69
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.040
Now we are done with the update.

70
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.465
In the next clip,

71
00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:05.000
we will switch back to user Julia and we will approve and complete this pull request.
