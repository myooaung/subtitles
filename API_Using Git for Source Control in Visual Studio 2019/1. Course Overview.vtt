00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
(Music) Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.070
My name is Thomas Claudius Huber, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.060
Using Git for Source Control in Visual Studio 2019.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.040
I am a software developer and I build applications

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
mainly with Visual Studio and .NET.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.717
In this course,

7
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:24.060
you will learn how to use Git for source control in Visual Studio 2019.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.090
Git is a very popular distributed version control system.

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.930
Distributed means that you have a full copy of the

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.080
repository locally on your machine.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.711
This allows you to work locally,

12
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:39.545
and when you are done you synchronize your local repository

13
00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.389
with a remote repository that you can store,

14
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.010
for example, on GitHub or Azure DevOps.

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.542
You will learn in this course how to use Git in Visual Studio 2019

16
00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:53.080
while building a .NET application in a small team.

17
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.050
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.383
creating and cloning Git repositories,

19
00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:03.060
committing and pushing changes to a remote repository,

20
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.189
working with branches and tags, including matching and rebasing branches,

21
00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000
and handling pull requests.

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.035
By the end of this course,

23
00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.616
you will know how to use Git in Visual Studio 2019 to track your code

24
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.010
changes and to collaborate successfully in a team.

25
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.060
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with the basics of Git.

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.838
But as you work in this course on a .NET project in a small team,

27
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:33.020
you should even be able to follow along without any prior Git knowledge.

28
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.810
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn about how to

29
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:49.000
use Git in Visual Studio 2019 with the Using Git for Source Control in Visual Studio 2019 course, at Pluralsight.
