00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:05.587
In this demonstration, you will learn how to resolve merge conflicts.

2
00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:09.527
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:14.507
As you can see, now we have again the perspective of the user Thomas.

4
00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:17.920
Let's assume that we want to implement now the quit command so

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.547
that the user can exit the coffee shop info tool.

6
00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:24.587
So first, let's adjust here the message.

7
00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:32.557
Let's add a comma here and let's add here, write quit to exit application.

8
00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:36.049
Now let's go down to the while loop and let me paste in an

9
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.567
if statement after the Console.ReadLine.

10
00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:42.439
We check here if the user has entered quit and then we

11
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:44.567
use break to exit this while loop.

12
00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.507
Let's try if this works.

13
00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:48.507
So now as a user,

14
00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:51.967
I can type in help to see the available coffee shop commands and

15
00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.567
I can type in quit to exit this application.

16
00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.547
Great, now let's commit this change.

17
00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:02.577
Let's go to the Changes page and let's enter here the commit message,

18
00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:07.567
Implement quit command, and let's click on Commit All.

19
00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.544
Now let's go to the Synchronization page and let's push

20
00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.577
this commit to the remote repository.

21
00:01:13.577 --> 00:01:17.497
Oh, we got an error here in the Output window.

22
00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:20.567
Let's open up Team Explorer again and let's pin it.

23
00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:24.517
You can see here, Failed to push to the remote repository.

24
00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.527
See the Output window for more details.

25
00:01:27.527 --> 00:01:28.587
So we should read here,

26
00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:32.147
Updates were rejected because the remote contains

27
00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:34.567
work that you do not have locally.

28
00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:34.997
Oh,

29
00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:39.047
this means Julia has pushed commits to the master

30
00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:41.497
branch of the remote repository.

31
00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:44.527
You know that if you have watched the previous clip.

32
00:01:44.527 --> 00:01:47.683
So now let's click here on Fetch to fetch the

33
00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:49.577
commits from the remote repository.

34
00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:54.547
Here you can see now the incoming commit, Adjust help message.

35
00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:59.557
Let's click on Pull to merge this commit into our local branch.

36
00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:03.507
Now you can see here that a merge is in progress.

37
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.557
You see this not only on the Synchronization page of Team Explorer,

38
00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:09.497
but also on other pages.

39
00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:13.577
You can click on Abort to abort this merge to continue to work locally,

40
00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:18.567
but in our case, we want to push the quit command to the remote repository,

41
00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:22.507
so we have to merge Julia's commit.

42
00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:25.507
As you can see here, we have one conflict.

43
00:02:25.507 --> 00:02:29.497
You see this conflict also on the left here in the Program.cs file.

44
00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:34.537
Now you could edit the Program.cs file here manually to solve the conflict,

45
00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:40.537
but instead of doing this, let's click here in Team Explorer on Conflicts.

46
00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.277
Now you can see here in Team Explorer that the

47
00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:45.587
conflict is in the Program.cs file.

48
00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:50.517
When you click on this file, you have three options to solve the conflict.

49
00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:53.577
You can keep the local file, you can take the remote file,

50
00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:57.507
or you can merge the local and the remote file.

51
00:02:57.507 --> 00:03:01.547
Let's do a diff with a local file to see what we have changed locally.

52
00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:05.537
Now you can see locally, we have adjusted here the message.

53
00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:07.557
Let me unpin Team Explorer.

54
00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:12.517
We have adjusted here the message, write quit to exit application,

55
00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:16.567
and we have implemented here this if statement to handle the quit string.

56
00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:20.507
Now let's look what has changed in the remote repository.

57
00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:22.557
Let's click here on Diff.

58
00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:26.433
Here you can see that the string was changed and here

59
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.497
coffee shop was added to that string.

60
00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:31.537
Oh yes, that's actually a good idea.

61
00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:35.537
We should keep that change, so we should do a merge.

62
00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:41.537
You can click here on Compare Files to compare the local and the remote changes.

63
00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:46.517
You see here on the left side the Program.cs file from the remote repository,

64
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:51.537
then you see on the right side the Program.cs file from our local repository.

65
00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:54.517
Now here you can see that we have a conflict.

66
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.570
Julia has added coffee shop to the string in the

67
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.547
Program.cs file of the remote repository.

68
00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:01.587
In our local repository,

69
00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:06.888
we have also adjusted exactly the same code line to add the message

70
00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:10.497
for the new quit command and when I scroll down,

71
00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:13.577
you can see that the if statement doesn't have a conflict.

72
00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:17.060
Now let's go to Team Explorer and let's click here on the

73
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.507
Merge button to merge these two files.

74
00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.547
Now the merge view opens up.

75
00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:28.497
You can see up here that we have one conflict and one conflict is remaining.

76
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:30.517
So when you click here on Accept Merge,

77
00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:34.567
you see that the file has one unresolved conflicting change.

78
00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.527
So let's click Cancel.

79
00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:41.507
You see here on the left side the Program.cs file from the remote repository,

80
00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:46.517
then you see on the right side the Program.cs file from our local repository.

81
00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:48.527
So when I scroll a bit to the right,

82
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:52.195
you can see this file on the left has coffee shop in the

83
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:55.027
string and the file on the right from our local

84
00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.577
repository doesn't have coffee shop,

85
00:04:56.577 --> 00:05:01.507
but it has our write 'quit' to exit application string.

86
00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:02.567
Then when I scroll down,

87
00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:07.537
you can also see that the write file includes our if statement.

88
00:05:07.537 --> 00:05:11.537
Now let's scroll up again to the red part, which is the conflict.

89
00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:12.557
In this merge view,

90
00:05:12.557 --> 00:05:16.587
you can see a third version of the Program.cs file at the bottom.

91
00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:19.577
This is the result of the merge.

92
00:05:19.577 --> 00:05:23.170
So now you can select the changes you want from the

93
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.547
remote and from the local file,

94
00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:28.537
and you will see those selected changes here in the result file.

95
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:32.507
In our case, let's select here the change from the local file,

96
00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:35.577
and now you see the Console.WriteLine down here in the result file.

97
00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:41.507
Now you can see up here that we have 0 remaining conflicts.

98
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:45.497
Important to know is that you can edit this result file.

99
00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:46.517
So in this case,

100
00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:49.441
we can just add here the string coffee shop that was

101
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.537
added in the remote repository by Julia.

102
00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:54.547
If you have multiple conflicts in your file,

103
00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:58.557
you can navigate through the conflicts with these arrow buttons.

104
00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.587
Now as we have resolved our conflict,

105
00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:05.537
let's click here on Accept Merge and let's go back to Team Explorer.

106
00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:08.557
As you can see, there are no remaining conflicts.

107
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:10.547
So let's click here on Commit Merge,

108
00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:14.557
which brings us back to the Changes page of Team Explorer.

109
00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:17.567
You can see here the staged Program.cs file.

110
00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:21.114
Let's right-click it and then select here Compare with

111
00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.497
Unmodified to double check our changes.

112
00:06:24.497 --> 00:06:27.497
You can see the string, write quit to exit application,

113
00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:29.547
is part of the Console.WriteLine.

114
00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:30.587
Let's scroll to the right,

115
00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:33.537
and here you can also see the string coffee shop

116
00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:36.497
that was part of Julia's commit.

117
00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:38.527
So now let's commit the merge.

118
00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:44.517
Let's enter here the commit message, Merge Julia's help message,

119
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:46.587
and let's click on Commit Staged.

120
00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:51.497
Now let's go to the Synchronization page of Team Explorer.

121
00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:54.527
You'll see, now we have 2 Outgoing Commits,

122
00:06:54.527 --> 00:06:57.587
Implement quit command and Merge Julia's help message.

123
00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:03.567
Let's push now these two commits to the remote repository.

124
00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:08.517
Let's click here on master to navigate to the Branches page.

125
00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:12.567
Let's right-click on the master branch and then select here View History.

126
00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:14.537
In this history view,

127
00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:18.557
let's click here this little button to switch to the detailed view.

128
00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:21.497
Now you can actually see the graph.

129
00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:24.547
Here you can see the merge of the two commits.

130
00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:28.567
Here is the commit from user Thomas where we implemented the quit command,

131
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:33.527
and here is the commit from user Julia where she adjusted the help message.

132
00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:34.886
And here at the top,

133
00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:39.517
you can see the merge commit where we merged Julia's help message.

134
00:07:39.517 --> 00:07:46.000
Alright, so far so good. Now let's wrap up what we have learned in this module.
