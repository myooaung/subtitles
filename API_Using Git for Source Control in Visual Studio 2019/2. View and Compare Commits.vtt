00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:05.636
In this demonstration, you will learn how to view and compare commits.

2
00:00:05.636 --> 00:00:09.566
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.636
As you can see, we work now as user Thomas with my user account.

4
00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:17.586
In Team Explorer, let's go to the Branches page.

5
00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:20.576
I have already checked out the master branch.

6
00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:23.127
Let's right-click it here and let's select Pull to

7
00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:26.566
ensure that we have the latest changes.

8
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.636
As you can see, the repository is already up to date.

9
00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:32.386
Now let's right-click on the master branch and let's select

10
00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.636
here from the context menu View History.

11
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:39.596
Here you can see now the history of that master branch.

12
00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:42.596
You can see here the commits that we have created on the feature/

13
00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:46.596
coffeeShopCommands branch to implement the coffee shop commands.

14
00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:50.248
We have created a pull request to merge this feature/ coffeeShopCommands

15
00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:53.586
branch into the master branch in the previous module.

16
00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.626
Here you can see the merge commit for the pull request.

17
00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:59.626
Interesting is that here is the author Thomas,

18
00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:03.616
but actually Julia completed this pull request.

19
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.586
When you hover this commit,

20
00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.576
you can see that the author of the code changes is Thomas,

21
00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:13.428
but the committer, the person who completed the pull request,

22
00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:14.616
is Julia.

23
00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.636
Now what you can do in this history view,

24
00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:21.576
you can right-click a commit and you can select here View Commit Details.

25
00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.606
Instead of selecting this context menu,

26
00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:27.328
you can also just double-click the commit in this view,

27
00:01:27.328 --> 00:01:31.576
and then the Commit Details will open up in Team Explorer.

28
00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:35.646
So here on this commit, you can even see that it has a related pull request.

29
00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:39.138
Let me double-click on the previous commit and you can see that we

30
00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:42.596
adjusted here the CoffeeShopCommandHandler.cs file.

31
00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:43.606
In this history view,

32
00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:48.556
you can also select two commits by pressing down the Ctrl key.

33
00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.566
So let's select here, for example, these two commits.

34
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:55.576
Now let's right-click and now you can select here Compare Commits.

35
00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:56.626
Let's do this.

36
00:01:56.626 --> 00:02:00.616
Now you see Team Explorer shows the Compare Commits page.

37
00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:04.586
Here you see the two commit IDs that you compare with each other.

38
00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:07.636
You also can see the details of the two commits.

39
00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:08.053
So,

40
00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:11.456
the first commit is the commit where we merged the pull

41
00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:14.576
request to handle the coffee shop commands.

42
00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:18.586
The second commit is the merge commit where we merged the feature

43
00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:21.646
PaperCupsInStock branch into the master branch.

44
00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:26.616
At the bottom, you can see the changes between these two commits.

45
00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.372
So now you can double-click here, for example,

46
00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:32.616
the Program.cs file, and now you can look at the changes.

47
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:36.636
So you can see here that Thomas introduced the command handlers.

48
00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:40.606
So comparing two commits is a very powerful feature.

49
00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:44.566
Now let's go back to the history view of the master branch.

50
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:47.503
Another important feature that this history view has is this button

51
00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:51.626
here that allows you to show only the first parents.

52
00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:54.949
This actually means that you will see only the commits that

53
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.636
were made on the master branch because we are viewing here

54
00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.596
the history of the master branch.

55
00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:06.556
In our sample here, the commits on the master branch are this merge commit,

56
00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.596
this merge commit, this merge commit,

57
00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:13.616
and these five commits at the bottom that we did directly on the master branch.

58
00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:18.596
So let's press this button and then we should only see these commits.

59
00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:21.192
Now you see the three merge commits and the five commits

60
00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:24.586
that we did directly on the master branch.

61
00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.636
So if you use a feature branch strategy,

62
00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.616
you will only see the merge commits when you select this button here.

63
00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:32.646
Now let me uncheck it again.

64
00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:44.000
So this view here allows you to view the history of a branch. In the next clip, you will learn how to view the history of a specific file.
