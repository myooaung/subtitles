1
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:06,364
In this demonstration, you will learn how to browse the history of a file.

2
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:09,394
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:13,384
Here I've opened the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool solution.

4
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:17,364
Now let's take a look at the history of the Program.cs file.

5
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:20,768
So let's right-click it here in the Solution Explorer and let's

6
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:23,424
select View History from the context menu.

7
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:28,354
Now you can see here the history view of the Program.cs file.

8
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:33,364
This view shows you all the commits where the Program.cs file was changed.

9
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:37,560
You can right-click a commit and you can select here Open to open this

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,434
specific version of the Program.cs file in a new tab.

11
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:44,152
You can also select here View Commit Details to open

12
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:46,424
the commit details in Team Explorer.

13
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,374
So here you can see, for example,

14
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:52,354
that as part of this commit where we introduced the command handlers,

15
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,344
the Program.cs file was changed.

16
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:56,364
In this history view,

17
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:59,545
you can also right-click a commit and you can compare the

18
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:02,364
Program.cs file with the previous version.

19
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:03,394
So let's do this.

20
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:06,374
Let's click here on Compare with Previous.

21
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:09,374
Now you see here the diff of the Program.cs file,

22
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:11,364
on the left-side the previous version,

23
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:14,384
and on the right-side the version of the current commit.

24
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:17,434
So you see here we have introduced the command handlers.

25
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:20,364
Now let's go back to the history view.

26
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:23,364
Instead of comparing a commit with the previous version,

27
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:27,364
you can also select two commits by pressing down the Ctrl key.

28
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:30,576
Now you can right-click and you can select here Compare to

29
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:33,414
compare the two versions of the Program.cs file.

30
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:37,404
So let's click here on Compare, and now you see a diff.

31
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:42,344
Let's drill down, and you see on the left side we had just the help command,

32
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,374
and on the right side other command handlers.

33
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,394
Let's go back to the history view.

34
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,404
Let's right-click again the two commits.

35
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,384
Instead of selecting Compare,

36
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:55,364
which brings you directly to the diff of the Program.cs file,

37
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:58,364
you can also select here Compare Commits.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:02,364
This opens up the Compare Commits page in Team Explorer.

39
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:05,394
Now you see here that we compare these two commits,

40
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:08,364
and down here you see all the changes.

41
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:12,394
So here in the Changes, you can just double-click the Program.cs file,

42
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:16,894
and then you are again in the diff view that we just saw where the

43
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:20,384
help command is replaced with these command handlers.

44
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,384
Now, let me close this diff view again.

45
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:28,414
Another great way to browse the history of a file is by doing a Git blame.

46
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:33,384
You can right-click any commit here and you can select here Blame,

47
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:36,364
or you can also go to the Solution Explorer,

48
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,374
right-click the Program.cs file,

49
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:42,414
and select here Blame to annotate the latest Program.cs file version.

50
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,424
Let's do this.

51
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,424
Let's select here Blame.

52
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,424
Now you can see the latest Program.cs file version.

53
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:53,344
The tab header even contains the commit ID of this version.

54
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,264
On the left side,

55
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:59,394
you see all the commits that made it into this version of the Program.cs file.

56
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:02,261
You can click here on the left side on a commit ID to open

57
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,364
up the commit details in Team Explorer.

58
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:06,508
So let's say, for example,

59
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:10,924
you want to know where this line with the using directive for the

60
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,424
WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess namespace was added or changed.

61
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:17,404
Let's click here on the commit ID.

62
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:20,394
Now the Commit Details open up in Team Explorer,

63
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:24,384
and you can see this was the commit Implement help command.

64
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,374
Now we can look at the changes.

65
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:30,691
Let's double-click the CS project file and you can see in this file

66
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:33,424
a reference to the DataAccess project was added.

67
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:38,344
Let's go back to Team Explorer and let's double-click the Program.cs file.

68
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,701
Here you can see that a using for the

69
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,354
WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess namespace was added.

70
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,369
In this commit,

71
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:50,374
we have implemented the help command for the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool.

72
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,384
Now let's close this diff again.

73
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:53,434
In this annotated view,

74
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:57,135
you can also right-click a commit on the left side and you can

75
00:03:57,135 --> 00:04:01,369
select from the context menu Annotate This Version to open up

76
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:03,424
this specific version in a separate tab.

77
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:08,424
So let's select here Annotate This Version for this 4b70 commit.

78
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:12,562
Now you can see a separate tab opens up that shows the

79
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:16,354
Program.cs file for this 4b70 commit.

80
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,384
Now you can see this version of the file,

81
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,869
and on the left side,

82
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:25,344
you see all the commits that made it into this version of the Program.cs file.

83
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,414
So let's right-click here, for example,

84
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:31,404
on the commit where we created the namespace and the Program class.

85
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:36,354
Let's select here Annotate This Version to take a look at this version.

86
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:40,424
Now you can see here is just a single commit in this annotated version.

87
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:45,414
This was actually the commit where we added the initial Program.cs file.

88
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:47,364
Let's double check this.

89
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:51,384
Let's click on the commit ID, and now you can see the commit details.

90
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:55,379
In this commit, we added the solution, the CS project file,

91
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,344
and the Program.cs file.

92
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,404
Now let's go back to the Solution Explorer.

93
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:03,404
Let's look at another CS file where we have multiple users.

94
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:08,434
Let's right-click the CoffeeShop.cs file and let's select here Blame.

95
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:12,935
Now you can see in this file that Julia has created a commit

96
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:15,414
here for the PaperCupsInStock property.

97
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:19,354
There is another commit from Thomas for the rest.

98
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,364
So when you click on this commit ID,

99
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:26,344
you can see with this commit the CoffeeShop.cs file was added.

100
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:29,344
Now let's click on the commit ID from Julia.

101
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:33,374
You can see this is the commit Add PaperCupsInStock property.

102
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:37,859
Here Julia changed the CoffeeShop.cs file and the

103
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,354
CoffeeShopDataProvider.cs file.

104
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,354
So now let's double-click on the CoffeeShop.cs file,

105
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:45,228
and now you can see that Julia actually added the

106
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:48,394
PaperCupsInStock property with this commit.

107
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:49,178
All right,

108
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:53,080
now you saw how to view the history of a file and how to do a

109
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,354
Git blame to annotate the file with a commit.

110
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:56,965
In the next clip,

111
00:05:56,965 --> 00:06:06,000
you will learn how to use CodeLens to view the history of your code directly in the code editor.
