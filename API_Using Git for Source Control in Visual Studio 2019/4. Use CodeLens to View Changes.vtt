00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:02.845
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:06.885
you will learn how to use CodeLens to view the changes of your code.

3
00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:10.815
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

4
00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.875
Here I've opened the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool solution.

5
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.565
Let's double-click the Program.cs file and let's say you want

6
00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.855
to know when the Program class was changed.

7
00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.525
You learned in the previous clip that you can right-click it here and you

8
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.885
can select View History to view the history of this file.

9
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.865
But instead of using this context menu in the Solution Explorer,

10
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:36.845
you can turn on CodeLens to see the changes directly in the code.

11
00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:40.875
So let's go to the Tools menu and let's select Options.

12
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.825
In the search box, let's enter here CodeLens.

13
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.850
As you can see, CodeLens is available under Text Editor,

14
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.815
All Languages, CodeLens.

15
00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:51.815
Let's select it.

16
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.855
As you can see, I have not enabled it.

17
00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.825
Now let's check this check box to enable CodeLens.

18
00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:04.570
CodeLens is available in all editions of Visual Studio 2019: Community,

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.835
Professional, and Enterprise.

20
00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:10.001
But the lenses for source control are only available in

21
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.825
the Enterprise edition of Visual Studio.

22
00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:16.855
I'm using here the Enterprise edition of Visual Studio 2019,

23
00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:21.905
so I have here lenses for Git like Show Timeline and Show Authors and Changes.

24
00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.825
Now let's click OK.

25
00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:28.845
Now you can see the lenses on the classes and their members.

26
00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:30.825
So here on the Program class,

27
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:35.905
you can see now the timeline lens and also the authors and changes lens.

28
00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:38.825
When you click on the timeline here,

29
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.855
you can see the timeline with all the changes.

30
00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:45.865
You can see commits were made during the last four days.

31
00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:49.905
So let's hover here the oldest commit, and you can see this was the commit,

32
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.905
Add project files.

33
00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:54.885
You can also see here the different authors.

34
00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.865
Julia has made here this blue commit.

35
00:01:57.865 --> 00:01:58.905
Let's hover it.

36
00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:02.875
Here you can see that she adjusted the help message.

37
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:06.865
Then there is also a commit that is not a circle, but a triangle.

38
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:08.845
This is a merge commit.

39
00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.815
Let's hover it, and you can see this is a merge commit.

40
00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:16.825
It has the commit message, Merge Julia's help message.

41
00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:19.865
So this timeline gives you a clue what changes happened and

42
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.855
how frequently this class was changed.

43
00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:26.895
You can also see here that the last change was 10 hours ago.

44
00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.855
Now let's click here on the authors and changes lens.

45
00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:34.905
Here you can see all the commits where this Program.cs file was adjusted.

46
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.825
You can double-click a commit here,

47
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:41.905
and then the Commit Details page in Team Explorer is shown with that commit.

48
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.895
Let's click again here on authors and changes.

49
00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:49.427
You can also click here on Show all file changes and then the

50
00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:51.895
history view of the Program.cs file opens.

51
00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:53.895
Now let's look at another file.

52
00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:57.845
Let's go to the CoffeeShop.cs file.

53
00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.477
Here on the class you can see that Julia Developer has

54
00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:02.905
changed this class 12 hours ago.

55
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:06.895
Let's click on the timeline lens to see the commits in the timeline.

56
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:11.895
So here is a blue commit from Thomas, Add data access project to solution.

57
00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:16.885
Here is the purple commit from Julia, Add PaperCupsInStock property.

58
00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:19.855
Now let's click here on authors and changes.

59
00:03:19.855 --> 00:03:21.895
Here you can see the two commits.

60
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:26.815
Let's double-click the commit Add data access project to solution,

61
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.699
and you can see this was the commit where Thomas

62
00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.885
has added the CoffeeShop.cs file.

63
00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.173
Let's click again on authors and changes here and

64
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.815
let's double-click the other commit,

65
00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.630
and you can see this was the commit where Julia has

66
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.895
added the PaperCupsInStock property.

67
00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:46.695
You can also see the lenses for source control on the

68
00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:48.845
individual members of this class.

69
00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:50.033
For example,

70
00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.855
the PaperCupsInStock property has just a single author and a single change.

71
00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.599
Let's click on this and you can see that there is only a single

72
00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.875
commit where Julia has added this property.

73
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.885
Also when you go to the timeline,

74
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:07.514
you can see this single commit here and you can hover it,

75
00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:12.815
and you can see this is the Add PaperCupsInStock property commit.

76
00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.520
The great thing about CodeLens is that you can see the

77
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.875
changes directly in the code editor.

78
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:21.043
You don't have to leave the code editor to find out

79
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:23.815
more about the history of your code.

80
00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:32.000
All right, so far to CodeLens. Now let's wrap up what you have learned in this module.
