1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:06,744
In this demonstration, you will learn how to approve and complete a pull request.

2
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:08,824
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:12,784
As you can see, we work now as Julia.

4
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:16,754
Julia is still connected to the repository

5
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:18,794
WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool in Azure DevOps.

6
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:21,774
Let's click now here on Pull Requests.

7
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:24,462
Team Explorer tells you here that if you don't see

8
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:26,754
all the pull requests in this list,

9
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,784
you can navigate here to Projects and My Teams,

10
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:32,744
and then select here your team project.

11
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,342
We have selected here the Tools project from Azure DevOps that

12
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:39,774
contains the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

13
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,774
And we can see the pull request that we want to approve,

14
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,774
this Handle coffee shop commands pull request.

15
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:49,814
Let's double-click this pull request, and let's select here Open.

16
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:51,814
Now let's go to the Team Explorer,

17
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:56,794
and here Julia can see now that Thomas has pushed an update.

18
00:00:56,794 --> 00:01:01,754
Of course, Julia doesn't look just randomly into this pull request.

19
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:06,774
Azure DevOps has sent her an email after Thomas has pushed the update.

20
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,734
So now she can look at this update in Visual Studio.

21
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:14,734
Let's take a look here at the CoffeeShopCommandHandler.cs file.

22
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,784
Let's turn off the comparison view.

23
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,744
Now let's scroll down.

24
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,814
Here you see an answer from Thomas to Julia's comment.

25
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:26,774
Julia wrote, Hey Thomas, you should include the paper cups in stock,

26
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:29,804
and Thomas answered, Hi Julia, that's a great idea.

27
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,824
I will add it in an update.

28
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:35,804
You can also see that this conversation is part of Update 1,

29
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,794
and you can click here to switch to Update 1.

30
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:42,734
We selected in Team Explorer to view Update 2.

31
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:46,097
Here this second comment belongs to the current update tool as

32
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:48,764
it doesn't have this switch to update header.

33
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:53,754
Here Thomas wrote, hi Julia, here are the paper cups in stock.

34
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:57,098
The comment was added to this line that writes the

35
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:58,824
PaperCupsInStock to the console,

36
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:03,794
and this statement is actually what Thomas has pushed with Update 2.

37
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:06,800
What you can also see here in the comments is that

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,744
Thomas is the author of the pull request.

39
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:14,824
What you can do in addition, you can set here the status of a comment.

40
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:18,794
So you could mark, for example, a comment as resolved.

41
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,824
But let's keep the comments active for now.

42
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:24,744
We will mark them as resolved in Azure DevOps.

43
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,824
So now let's go back to Team Explorer, and let's click here on Approve.

44
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:31,824
Before we approved with suggestions,

45
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:35,794
now let's just click on Approve to approve this pull request.

46
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:38,734
Then let's click here on Exit.

47
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:42,804
Let's go back to the Pull Requests page where we see this pull request.

48
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:46,787
The version of the Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension that I use

49
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:50,744
here does not have an option to complete a pull request.

50
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:54,754
To complete the pull request, you need to go to Azure DevOps.

51
00:02:54,754 --> 00:03:00,784
So let's right-click here the pull request, and let's select Open in Browser.

52
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:05,734
Now you can see we are here on the Handle coffee shop commands pull request.

53
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,774
Let me collapse the navigation.

54
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,814
You can see here the pull request was created by Thomas,

55
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:15,764
and he wants to merge the feature/coffeeShopCommands branch into master.

56
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:19,764
Julia, the reviewer, approved this pull request.

57
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,794
When I scroll down, you can also see the comments here.

58
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:27,784
Here you can see the PaperCupsInStock Console.WriteLine that Thomas has added.

59
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,784
You can also see the comment, Hi Julia Developer,

60
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:32,804
here are the paper cups in stock.

61
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,784
Then when I scroll down further,

62
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,414
you can see here the one commit that Thomas has pushed to

63
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,824
create an update tool of this pull request.

64
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,774
Let's scroll down a bit more,

65
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:46,774
and here you can see the comments that were made before Update 2.

66
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,764
Now let's scroll up again.

67
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,784
We approved the pull request already,

68
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:54,744
so let's click now the Complete button to complete it.

69
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:58,284
Note that you could add policies so that a pull request requires,

70
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:02,784
for example, at least two approvals so that you can complete it.

71
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,754
In this case, we don't have such a policy,

72
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:09,734
so Julia can actually now complete this pull request.

73
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,744
So let's click the Complete button.

74
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:14,774
And let's click in this dialog Complete merge.

75
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:19,764
Now you can see that Julia Developer completed the pull request,

76
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:22,774
but we haven't marked all the comments as resolved.

77
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:26,784
So let's select here the filter, and let's select here Active comments.

78
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:31,764
Let's scroll down, and yes, Thomas has implemented the paper cups in stock.

79
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:36,744
Let's click on Resolve, and let's also resolve that second comment.

80
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,734
Now we don't have any active comments anymore,

81
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,804
and the pull request is already completed.

82
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:45,784
Let's switch back now to Visual Studio.

83
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:51,774
Here in Visual Studio, let's click now Refresh on this Pull Requests page.

84
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:56,814
And now you can see the completed pull request is not displayed here anymore.

85
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,744
Let's go to the Synchronization page now.

86
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:05,794
As you can see, we are on the branch master, and let's click now Fetch.

87
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:08,794
Now you can see here the incoming commits,

88
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,744
Handle coffee shop commands and Introduce command handlers,

89
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:16,010
then the Write paper cups in stock to console commit that

90
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,976
Thomas did to update the pull request, and finally,

91
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:23,804
the Merge commit to merge the pull request back to the master branch.

92
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:29,744
Now let's click on Pull to pull these commits into Julia's local master branch.

93
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,784
Let's run the application, and let's try it.

94
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:34,774
Let's type help, let's type in munich,

95
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:41,784
and we can see 56 kg of beans in stock and 427 paper cups in stock.

96
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:45,015
So we have successfully merged the pull request to handle the

97
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:53,000
coffee shop commands into the master branch. Now let's wrap up what you have learned in this module.
