1
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:05,665
In this demonstration, you will learn how to create a pull request.

2
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:08,695
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,705
We'll still work with the user Thomas,

4
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:14,861
and now we want to create a pull request to match this

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,685
feature/coffeeShopCommands branch into the master branch.

6
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,715
When you look at the history of this branch,

7
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:24,645
you can see that it is two commits ahead of the master branch.

8
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:28,645
We have implemented the coffee shop commands on this branch.

9
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:32,645
Now let's go to Team Explorer and let's create a pull request.

10
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:36,705
So let's click here on Pull Requests to navigate to the Pull Requests page.

11
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,391
In the previous clip,

12
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:42,705
we have installed the Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension.

13
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,625
Let's click here on New Pull Request,

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:50,685
and now you can see we can create the pull request directly in Visual Studio

15
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,705
because of the Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension.

16
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:59,447
Here we see that we want to create a request to pull the

17
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,715
feature/coffeeShopCommands branch into the master branch.

18
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:05,635
Then we can enter a title and a description.

19
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:11,655
Let's change this title here to Handle coffee shop commands.

20
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,655
And let's use the same for the description.

21
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:18,665
And let's write here, in addition, and introduce command handlers.

22
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:21,625
Now you can select here Reviewers.

23
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,645
So let's just type in here Julia,

24
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:27,138
and now you can select here Julia Developer as she is also

25
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:29,715
part of that project in Azure DevOps.

26
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,658
You could also select here Work Items if you use

27
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,685
Azure DevOps to manage your project.

28
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:39,147
Then down here you can see the changes that you

29
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:40,655
have made in your feature branch.

30
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:44,705
As you can see, this comparison is against the master branch.

31
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:50,625
When you click on the Program.cs file, you just see your local Program.cs file.

32
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,847
But with the Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension comes also the

33
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:58,665
comparison view that you can turn on with this little button.

34
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:01,645
So let's click this button in the toolbar.

35
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:05,665
Now you see on the left side the Program.cs file from the master branch,

36
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:08,710
and on the right side the Program.cs file of the

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,675
feature/coffeeShopCommands branch that is part of our pull request.

38
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:16,788
This means now that you can go through the code changes of your pull

39
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,705
request with this comparison view locally on your machine.

40
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:23,488
So you could show it to another developer before you

41
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,645
finally create the pull request.

42
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,625
So here in the Program.cs file, you could scroll down for example,

43
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,635
and you could show that you have introduced here the command handlers.

44
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:36,645
You can also look at the changes in the other files.

45
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,675
But as these files were all added,

46
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,591
the comparison makes not much sense because every

47
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:44,655
code line in those files is new.

48
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:47,635
So let's turn here off the comparison view.

49
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,645
Now let's go back to the Team Explorer, let's scroll up,

50
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:55,625
and let's click here on Create to create the pull request.

51
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,670
Now you can see we have successfully created the pull

52
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:08,000
request and the coffee shop commands. Now let's switch to the user Julia as she has to review this pull request.
