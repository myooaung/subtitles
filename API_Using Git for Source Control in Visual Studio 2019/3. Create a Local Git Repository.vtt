00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:06.206
In this demonstration you will learn how to create a new local Git repository.

2
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.246
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:14.226
When you start Visual Studio 2019, you will see this start window.

4
00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:17.216
From here, you can open your recent solutions,

5
00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.236
you can clone or check out code,

6
00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:23.206
you can open an existing project or solution or a folder,

7
00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:26.206
and you can also create a new project.

8
00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:29.256
But in this clip, I don't want to start with existing code.

9
00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:29.542
Instead,

10
00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:35.196
I want to show you how to create a new Git repository with Visual Studio.

11
00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:40.266
So let's click here on Continue without code to open up Visual Studio 2019.

12
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:45.186
To work with Git in Visual Studio, you use the Team Explorer.

13
00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:48.246
You can open up Team Explorer via the View menu.

14
00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.256
So here you see Team Explorer.

15
00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.186
Let's click it.

16
00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.196
Now you are here on the Connect page of Team Explorer,

17
00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:59.176
and you can see you can manage here the local Git repositories.

18
00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:00.236
When you click on this little house,

19
00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:04.186
you can navigate to the home page of Team Explorer.

20
00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:09.226
From here, you can navigate to other pages like Changes, Branches, and Sync.

21
00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:14.176
So you can click, for example, on Changes, then you are on the Changes page.

22
00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:16.246
Let's click again on the house to navigate to the Home page.

23
00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:20.383
You can also use this drop-down here to navigate to the

24
00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:23.176
different pages of Team Explorer.

25
00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:27.196
You can navigate to the Connect page by clicking on this little plug here.

26
00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:31.196
So when I click it, we are, again, on the page that you have seen before.

27
00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:33.266
Now let's just go to the Home page for a minute.

28
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.256
If your Team Explorer doesn't look like this,

29
00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:41.216
you might not have selected Git as a source control plug-in in Visual Studio.

30
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:46.266
Let's go to Tools, Options, and let's search here for Source Control.

31
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.226
Let's click on Source Control,

32
00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:51.216
and here you see the Current source control plug-in.

33
00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:54.004
When I move this to the left and I select here

34
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.266
Visual Studio Team Foundation Server, you can see that the Team Explorer changes.

35
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:03.256
So let's make sure that you have selected here Git to see exactly what I see.

36
00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:08.196
Before we create a new repository, let's check our Git settings.

37
00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:11.236
To do this, let's navigate here to the Settings page.

38
00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.576
Here you can configure the global settings from the Git

39
00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:17.196
config file of your user directory.

40
00:02:17.196 --> 00:02:21.226
So when I click this, you can see here User Name and Email Address.

41
00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:22.123
As you know,

42
00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:27.236
the user name and the email address are part of every commit that you do in Git.

43
00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:31.596
Here you find also Visual Studio-specific settings like

44
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.236
this Default Repository Location.

45
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.216
Now let's create a local repository.

46
00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:38.246
Let's navigate to the Connect page.

47
00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:42.186
Instead of using the plug, let's use, this time, the drop-down.

48
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:47.196
Let's select here Projects, and here you can select Manage Connections.

49
00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:51.216
Now you can click here on New to create a new local repository.

50
00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.186
Let's cancel this.

51
00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:57.266
In the drop-down under Projects, you see also here New Repository.

52
00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.176
When you click this,

53
00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:03.079
Team Explorer goes also to the Connect page and it just opens up

54
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.206
this little view to create a new repository.

55
00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:09.256
So let's do this, and you see we are on the same page,

56
00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:14.186
and now just this little view to create a repository is opened up.

57
00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:16.256
So now let's enter a name for the repository.

58
00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:24.226
Let's call it WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool, and let's click the Create button.

59
00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:26.256
Now the repository was created.

60
00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:30.236
Let's right-click it and let's take a look at it in File Explorer.

61
00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:33.186
Here you can see the hidden .git folder,

62
00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:35.256
which is actually the local Git repository.

63
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:41.176
Visual Studio has also added the two files, gitattributes and gitignore.

64
00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:44.216
To open this repository in Team Explorer,

65
00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:47.236
you can right-click it and you can select here Open.

66
00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:51.206
Or, alternatively, you can just double-click it.

67
00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:54.186
Now you can see here that the repository is opened.

68
00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:58.236
When you hover over this, you can see the repository name and the path.

69
00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:00.206
When I go back to the Connect page,

70
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.246
you can also see that the repository is now bold

71
00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:06.206
because this repository is opened.

72
00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:10.266
This is important to know if you have multiple local Git repositories here.

73
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.246
Now let's go to the Home page and let's click here on Changes.

74
00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:17.935
As you can see, the two files, gitattributes and gitignore,

75
00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.226
are added and staged.

76
00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:23.176
Now let's just enter here a commit message.

77
00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:28.246
Let's just write Add git files, and let's click here on Commit Staged.

78
00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:31.926
Now let's go again to the Home page and let's click here on New

79
00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:35.256
to add a new solution to our new repository.

80
00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:39.176
Let's select the template for a .NET Core console application,

81
00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:40.236
and let's click Next.

82
00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:45.226
Let's call the application WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool,

83
00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:48.186
and let's click the Create button.

84
00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:52.206
Now you can see the solution appears also here in Team Explorer.

85
00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.226
If your repository has multiple solutions,

86
00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:58.186
you can just open them from here by double-clicking them.

87
00:04:58.186 --> 00:05:01.216
The open solution is also displayed in bold.

88
00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:02.954
When I go to the Solution Explorer,

89
00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:07.236
you can also see that we have now opened the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool.

90
00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:14.206
Let's change the Console.WriteLine to Wired Brain Coffee - Shop Info Tool!

91
00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:16.206
And let's save this.

92
00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:18.397
Now let's go to Team Explorer, let's click on Changes,

93
00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:21.616
and you see we have added a Program.cs file,

94
00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:25.226
the cs project file, and the solution file.

95
00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:29.226
Let's enter a commit message here, and let's just write Add project,

96
00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:31.266
and let's select here Commit All.

97
00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:34.176
Now everything is committed.

98
00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:37.226
Let's use the drop-down here to navigate to the Branches page.

99
00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.216
Here you can see the master branch.

100
00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:43.226
Let's right-click it and then select View History.

101
00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:48.176
Here you can see the two commits, Add git files and Add project.

102
00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:51.509
You can also switch here to a simple view that shows you the

103
00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.236
commits in a simple list and not as a graph.

104
00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:57.726
Alright, now you saw how to create a new,

105
00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:02.256
empty Git repository with Visual Studio and how to add a solution to it.

106
00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:10.000
In the next clip, you will learn how to create a Git repository for an existing solution.
