00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:06,315
In this demonstration, you will learn how to review and comment a pull request.

2
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,345
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:13,275
As you can see, we work now as Julia.

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:16,305
Let's go to Extensions, Extensions and Updates,

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:19,465
and you can see here that we have installed the Pull

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:24,295
Requests for Visual Studio extension, so let's close this dialog.

7
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:27,315
Let's click on the plug to manage our connections,

8
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:31,305
and let's connect here to the Azure Repo and Azure DevOps.

9
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,355
Now we have here Julia's Microsoft account,

10
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:38,305
and you can see she is part of the wiredbraincoffee organization.

11
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:43,265
Let's select here the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

12
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:46,820
You can see it takes already the local path Julia\

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,275
WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool that we have already,

14
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,355
so we just need to connect to the Azure Repo.

15
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:57,295
Let's click the Connect button.

16
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:01,305
Now we are connected, and you can see here the Pull Requests page,

17
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,315
so let's click on it.

18
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:06,775
Here Julia can now see that Thomas assigned her the

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,355
Handle coffee shop commands pull request.

20
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:14,295
Let's double-click this pull request to take a look at the details.

21
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:17,315
The title says Handle coffee shop commands.

22
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:20,133
Thomas Claudius Huber wants to merge the

23
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,285
feature/coffeeShopCommands branch into master.

24
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:27,295
Now you can click here on Open to take a look at the changes.

25
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,265
Here you see the changed files from Thomas,

26
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:35,275
so let's click on the Program.cs file and now the comparison view opens up.

27
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,335
On the left side, you can see the Program.cs file from the master branch,

28
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:43,305
and on the right side, the Program.cs of this pull request.

29
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:48,265
So here, Julia can see that Thomas has added the command handlers.

30
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:51,960
Now let's turn off the comparison view so that we look just

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,305
at Thomas's file from the pull request.

32
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:59,315
Julia actually thinks that this code with the command handlers is really nice.

33
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:00,355
So what she can do now,

34
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:03,898
she can just right-click here and you can see she can add

35
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:07,295
a comment or she can also add a like.

36
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,305
Let's click here on Add a Like,

37
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,355
and now you see this code line here has a thumbs up.

38
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:15,275
Now let's go again to Team Explorer,

39
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:20,325
and let's take also a look at the CoffeeShopCommandHandler that Thomas added.

40
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,079
Let's scroll down,

41
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,848
and here you can see how the Location and the Beans in stock of

42
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:28,295
the foundCoffeeShops are written to the console.

43
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,275
But in addition to the location of the Beans in stock,

44
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:34,712
this code should also write the paper cups in stock to

45
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,275
the console that Julia has added.

46
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:41,335
So let's right-click here, and let's add a comment,

47
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:45,933
Hey, and let's reference here Thomas, Hey Thomas,

48
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:52,325
you should include the paper cups in stock.

49
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,325
And let's click the Comment button.

50
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,275
Now you see that active comment here.

51
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:01,315
Now let's go back to the Team Explorer, and let's select here the action.

52
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:06,335
Let's approve with suggestions, and let's exit this pull request.

53
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:14,000
Great! So now we have reviewed the pull request, and now Thomas can send an update.
