00:00:00.020  -->  00:00:02.899
Office politics.

2

00:00:02.899  -->  00:00:08.470
Don't ever talk behind somebody's back at work and even at home.

3

00:00:08.470  -->  00:00:10.240
Don't, you know, speak with your spouse or

4

00:00:10.240  -->  00:00:12.730
family members about how much you can't stand somebody.

5

00:00:12.730  -->  00:00:15.574
Don't do that because it will ruin,

6

00:00:15.574  -->  00:00:17.965
it will ruin your attitude.

7

00:00:17.965  -->  00:00:22.329
You'll start getting very negative and you'll be less productive as a result.

8

00:00:22.329  -->  00:00:24.054
And plus it's bad karma as well.

9

00:00:24.054  -->  00:00:29.140
So, don't ever say something negative about anybody you work with ever.

10

00:00:29.140  -->  00:00:31.914
It's just not worth it, not worth it at all.

11

00:00:31.914  -->  00:00:34.810
And also when it comes to office politics when you first start

12

00:00:34.810  -->  00:00:37.810
working in a company kind of observe

13

00:00:37.810  -->  00:00:40.689
how the culture works for the first couple of months or so

14

00:00:40.689  -->  00:00:44.530
before doing anything too daring, so to speak.

15

00:00:44.530  -->  00:00:49.170
Every culture is different. Every company has a different way of getting stuff done.

16

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:51.520
And you want to make sure that you establish

17

00:00:51.520  -->  00:00:55.024
very close relationships with people in different departments.

18

00:00:55.024  -->  00:00:56.305
You want to have mentors everywhere.

19

00:00:56.305  -->  00:00:59.170
You want to mentor a lot of people as well and the assistants are incredibly

20

00:00:59.170  -->  00:01:02.320
important because they understand how to get stuff done.

21

00:01:02.320  -->  00:01:05.230
Don't overlook them. Don't overlook them at all.

22

00:01:05.230  -->  00:01:08.694
And the last thing I'll say about politics and I hate saying this.

23

00:01:08.694  -->  00:01:13.120
I'm a small company guy but when you first start a new company,

24

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:16.310
at a new company, if you're younger especially, face time matters.

25

00:01:16.310  -->  00:01:18.834
I hate that, but it does. You want to be the first in and last out,

26

00:01:18.834  -->  00:01:21.004
FILO, first in last out.

27

00:01:21.004  -->  00:01:24.010
Anyway, that's a little bit on office politics.
