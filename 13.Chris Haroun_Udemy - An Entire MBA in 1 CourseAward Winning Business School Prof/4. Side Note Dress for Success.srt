1

00:00:00,859  -->  00:00:04,584
You want to dress for success as well.

2

00:00:04,584  -->  00:00:05,858
I know it's a cliché,

3

00:00:05,858  -->  00:00:11,039
but you want to dress the way a person at a level above you,

4

00:00:11,039  -->  00:00:13,755
just above you, tends to dress.

5

00:00:13,755  -->  00:00:17,640
I know it sounds strange, but you want to think of yourself

6

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:23,179
as being adequate enough eventually to be in that position where you get promoted.

7

00:00:23,179  -->  00:00:27,938
So, it's also a reflection on your attention to detail,

8

00:00:27,938  -->  00:00:30,085
especially when it comes to meeting with clients.

9

00:00:30,085  -->  00:00:33,204
So, you always want to dress for success.

10

00:00:33,204  -->  00:00:36,210
I'm humble enough to know that I've got an awful sense for clothes.

11

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:39,420
I ask my wife every morning, "Does this match?

12

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:41,460
This match?" And I figured that – she told me,

13

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:43,884
by the way, black matches with everything.

14

00:00:43,884  -->  00:00:47,000
That's why I'm wearing these black shirts. So, you always want to dress for success.
