00:00:00.299  -->  00:00:04.914
Learn, earn, return.

2

00:00:04.914  -->  00:00:08.289
I'm on the board of this amazing charity called

3

00:00:08.289  -->  00:00:12.109
the Lima Foundation and this is the only plug I'll do in this whole course, I promise.

4

00:00:12.109  -->  00:00:13.705
Lima foundation.org.

5

00:00:13.705  -->  00:00:14.890
It's an amazing,

6

00:00:14.890  -->  00:00:19.164
amazing charity where we give full scholarships to people from broken homes,

7

00:00:19.164  -->  00:00:21.219
people that have absolutely nothing.

8

00:00:21.219  -->  00:00:23.814
And here in the San Francisco Bay Area,

9

00:00:23.814  -->  00:00:28.835
East Palo Alto has a high school graduation rate of only 40 percent.

10

00:00:28.835  -->  00:00:30.815
It's just tragic, terrible.

11

00:00:30.815  -->  00:00:34.719
And so, the methodology of this company or this charity,

12

00:00:34.719  -->  00:00:36.484
the Lima Foundation is twofold.

13

00:00:36.484  -->  00:00:37.884
They always talk about learn,

14

00:00:37.884  -->  00:00:39.945
earn, return and I love that.

15

00:00:39.945  -->  00:00:41.439
I love to learn.

16

00:00:41.439  -->  00:00:44.140
I like to earn. But more importantly, I like to return.

17

00:00:44.140  -->  00:00:46.899
I like to give to others and this charity has

18

00:00:46.899  -->  00:00:49.060
the most incredible saying and I've got goosebumps

19

00:00:49.060  -->  00:00:51.899
just thinking of this and that saying is this,

20

00:00:51.899  -->  00:00:55.340
"don't expect to realize your dreams in

21

00:00:55.340  -->  00:00:59.149
life unless you help others achieve theirs first."

22

00:00:59.149  -->  00:01:02.000
Learn, earn, return.
