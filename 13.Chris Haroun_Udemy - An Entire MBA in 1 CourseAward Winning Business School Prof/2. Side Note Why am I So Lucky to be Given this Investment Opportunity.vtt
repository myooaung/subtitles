00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:03.104
When somebody is trying to sell you a product or a service,

2

00:00:03.104  -->  00:00:06.434
I always want you to ask yourself this,

3

00:00:06.434  -->  00:00:11.160
why am I so lucky to be given this opportunity?

4

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:13.695
I want you to be skeptical because a lot of the times,

5

00:00:13.695  -->  00:00:17.204
especially when it comes to people you've known for a long time,

6

00:00:17.204  -->  00:00:22.655
they'll approach you only because nobody else wants to buy that product or service.

7

00:00:22.655  -->  00:00:25.640
And so you want to stick with the smart money always, too.

8

00:00:25.640  -->  00:00:28.574
So if you're investing in an investment or a company,

9

00:00:28.574  -->  00:00:31.339
if there's a very successful person that's already

10

00:00:31.339  -->  00:00:33.566
an investor like a Richard Branson or a

11

00:00:33.566  -->  00:00:35.365
Marc Benioff or a Warren Buffett or

12

00:00:35.365  -->  00:00:38.600
successful companies investing like the Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins,

13

00:00:38.600  -->  00:00:41.750
then your odds of making

14

00:00:41.750  -->  00:00:44.539
money are much higher because they've already done their due diligence.

15

00:00:44.539  -->  00:00:48.000
And so again, if somebody asks you to buy something,

16

00:00:48.000  -->  00:00:52.969
a product or a service, ask yourself why am I so lucky to be given this opportunity?

17

00:00:52.969  -->  00:00:54.979
Odds are in many situations

18

00:00:54.979  -->  00:00:57.920
that you're getting the opportunity

19

00:00:57.920  -->  00:01:00.000
to buy this product or service because nobody else will.
