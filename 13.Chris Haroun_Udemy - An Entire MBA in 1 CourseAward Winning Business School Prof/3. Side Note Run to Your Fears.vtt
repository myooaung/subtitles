00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:03.220
In business you want to run to your fears.

2

00:00:03.220  -->  00:00:05.570
What the heck is Chris talking about now?

3

00:00:05.570  -->  00:00:09.865
Well, if you're scared of something or fearful of something in business,

4

00:00:09.865  -->  00:00:14.230
then chances are your competition and your colleagues are as well.

5

00:00:14.230  -->  00:00:18.304
For me, earlier in my career I was so scared of public speaking. I was terrified of it.

6

00:00:18.304  -->  00:00:19.750
And so what I did was,

7

00:00:19.750  -->  00:00:22.179
I actually started volunteering in the,

8

00:00:22.179  -->  00:00:24.260
at Maguire Correctional Facilities,

9

00:00:24.260  -->  00:00:27.800
the prison here in Redwood City, California.

10

00:00:27.800  -->  00:00:29.734
And I would target, I would go in,

11

00:00:29.734  -->  00:00:32.734
and give speeches and just give optimism, what not.

12

00:00:32.734  -->  00:00:34.079
It was done through the church,

13

00:00:34.079  -->  00:00:36.115
wasn't just religious thing though.

14

00:00:36.115  -->  00:00:39.550
And I would talk to these 20 year olds

15

00:00:39.550  -->  00:00:44.204
that didn't have the luxury of having two parents growing up like I did.

16

00:00:44.204  -->  00:00:46.719
A lot of them had single parents or no parents at all.

17

00:00:46.719  -->  00:00:48.509
They were orphans. God bless them.

18

00:00:48.509  -->  00:00:51.850
And so, I went into the prison system and I started giving, you know,

19

00:00:51.850  -->  00:00:58.225
speeches on optimism and what not.

20

00:00:58.225  -->  00:01:00.670
And I was so scared the first time I did it.

21

00:01:00.670  -->  00:01:05.650
First time I did, there's actually a guy in there that had the F-word-- right here.

22

00:01:05.650  -->  00:01:08.310
And 20 or 30 people were sitting in the audience.

23

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:09.900
And it actually scared me,

24

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:14.560
but once I conquered that fear I was never the same.

25

00:01:14.560  -->  00:01:16.144
And I look forward to public speaking now.

26

00:01:16.144  -->  00:01:18.239
I absolutely love it, I thrive on it.

27

00:01:18.239  -->  00:01:20.129
I love helping people.

28

00:01:20.129  -->  00:01:21.609
And so in business and in life,

29

00:01:21.609  -->  00:01:25.099
you should always try to run to your fears because your competition won't do that.
