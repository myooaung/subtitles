00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome to this machine learning deep learning model deployment course.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.805
This is going to be a very exciting journey.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.520
In this course, you learned how to take your models to

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.610
production or how to make your models accessible to others.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.280
The focus of the course will be more and moderate deployment.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.090
However, we'll also be building a very simple model so that we can

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.340
demonstrate how you can take your models

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.620
to different environments using various techniques.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.505
You will learn how to Pratt machine learning experiments and deploy model using ML flow,

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.025
which is a popular ML obscured.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:56.285
Sun wordless is the next big thing in cloud computing.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.120
In this course, you'll understand how to make

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.420
serverless rest API for your machine learning models.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.430
If we're completely new to Python,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.280
you will get a crash course in Python and all the liabilities.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.690
And also we have explained in detail how to build models from scratch using

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.640
cyclic law and also how to build a neural network using TensorFlow.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.765
So machine learning, deep learning background is not required for this course.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:27.170
However, if you have prior knowledge building models that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.220
will help you in picking up the concepts of deployment quickly.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
We also have a section on natural language processing.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.880
You'll understand how to deploy NLP models to do sentiment analysis for real-time to its.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.510
For some of our labs, we'll be using Google Cloud or GCP.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.225
You don't require any prior background in GCP.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:50.540
We're provided step-by-step instructions as to how you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.890
can setup a GCP account for a free trial and priority, various things.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.960
Discourse is very hands-on and touches upon somato,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.080
practical aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.420
Let's dive in and get started.
