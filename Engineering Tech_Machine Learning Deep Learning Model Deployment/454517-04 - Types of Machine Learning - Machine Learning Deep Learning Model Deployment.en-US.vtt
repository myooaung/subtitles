00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
Let's understand different types of machine learning algorithms.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.825
We talked about customer profile,

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:12.315
learning from customer behavior based on certain profile and applying that learning.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.475
Let's look at it in detail.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.620
So when we say customer profile,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.185
it could be AID salary countries, gender.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:24.255
Based on that, let's say we know whether a customer is purchased in the past or not.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:25.740
One starts with purchase,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.795
euro starts but not purchased.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.740
If we feed that information to a machine-learning algorithm,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.065
you could look at this past purchase data.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.440
It will look at these different features in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.920
their behavior in terms of purchase or not, then create a model.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.010
Here the output is always one or 01 means purchase,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.495
0 means not purchase.

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.480
So this type of machine learning is called classification.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.580
When we are predicting certain number of classes from the input data.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.655
Let's look at another example of classification.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:06.635
When we feed an image to a model and the model recognizes it is a cat or a dog.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.810
That is also classification.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.390
If we create a machine-learning algorithm with

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.015
different images which belonged to three classes.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.695
It's a cat, dog, and cow.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.270
And if we create a model,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.015
that is also classification because our prediction is always limited set of values.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.465
There is another type of machine learning called regression,

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:29.075
where instead of predicting a class,

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:34.205
we predict certain values that could be a continuous value in terms of house price.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:37.190
You might have information about area,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.130
number of bedroom, and distance to the bus stop or city center.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.060
Based on that, if you have to create a model which will predict house price,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.505
that type of machine learning is called regression,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.980
where you predict a continuous value instead

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.730
of predicting which class the output belongs to.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.580
Classification and regression are called supervised

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.865
machine learning because Algorithm lands from the data.

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.240
It lands from set of features and the behavior.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.445
Fitting information about house price for a set of features.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:11.585
Or you are fitting information about whether the customer is bought or not.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.520
The algorithm is learning from that.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.705
And then it is predicting output for new set of variables.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.760
This is supervised machine learning,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.755
where you tell the algorithm what to look for in a particular dataset.

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:28.835
There is another type of machine learning called unsupervised machine learning,

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:32.450
where you feed certain data to an algorithm,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.670
but you don't say what to look for.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.800
For example, you could feed a salary,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.215
country, gender, and how much the person is spinning.

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.720
And ask the algorithm to group them in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.960
a way so that you can take certain decisions based on that.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.320
Typically nucleate clusters using unsupervised machine learning,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.910
you could create different clusters like young spenders are high-income, high spenders.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.890
And based on that, you can decide

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.980
which customer group to target in your marketing campaign.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.395
This is unsupervised machine learning.

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.615
In supervised machine learning,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:06.320
we split the data into training data and test data.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.075
Typically 70 to 80% data is kept for training the model,

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:15.320
and remaining 20 to 30% is used for testing the model.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.405
Let's create a development environment,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:21.450
load some data to start our machine learning process.
