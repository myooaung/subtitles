00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.510
Maintaining Watson's up data and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.529
experiments is a key aspect of machine learning operations.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.180
Many organizations keep track up machine learning experiments and define

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.320
a process to draw the conclusion on which model is best model.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.220
Also, there might be a compliance or

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.240
legal requirement to maintain worsened subdata and predictions.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.050
A data scientists should be able to track algorithm drained test ratio and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.170
different hyper parameters like number of epochs and landing Grade, a milk flow.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.330
And there are various other tools in the market

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.325
using which you can track all your experiments.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:46.849
Also tracking experiment execution time and number of resources

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:51.689
required help you derive the cost of machine learning execution.
