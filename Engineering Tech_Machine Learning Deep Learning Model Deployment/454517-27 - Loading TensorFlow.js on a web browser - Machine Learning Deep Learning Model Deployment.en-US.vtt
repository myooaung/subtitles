00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
Let's now see how to Lord dense uploaded to the web browser,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.380
will open a new folder.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.590
This is a blank folder.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.150
Let's add a new HTML file.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.350
We'll call it BFGS,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:35.805
demo HTML, type HTML.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:41.320
And select HTML5 will put some text here.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.230
Now let's load this page. Read lips server.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.805
I load the page now with Chrome browser.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.045
And we can see that text here,

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.570
let's say Visual Studio code.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.400
And the browser side-by-side will fix this typo.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.190
And we can see that it is getting refreshed.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.205
Now. Good lord, TensorFlow js to this webpage,

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:22.430
we can simply add a script tag with TensorFlow js,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.910
and that will our TensorFlow JS, this webpage,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.069
search for TensorFlow j's setup and go to their office or webpage.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.860
And here you'd see opsin to art and suppler JSON HTML file using a script tag.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.140
We'll copy this will include the script tag within the HTML head.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.610
Next door within the body,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.150
let's add another script tag.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.000
And here we'll print out worse onto the console.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.280
We can see that the TensorFlow version is getting printed to the console.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.225
And we can extract BFGS version,

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:30.035
and that is 2.0.0.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:36.000
So this is how you can lord denser progess, pitch.
