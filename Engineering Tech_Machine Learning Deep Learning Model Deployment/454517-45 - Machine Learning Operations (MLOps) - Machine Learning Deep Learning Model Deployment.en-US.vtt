00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.485
Ml ops or machine learning operations,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.250
is the combined effort of Data Scientist and operations.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.145
People could take models to production,

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:13.215
ML ofs's to machine learning,

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.660
what DevOps is to software engineering.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.090
In DevOps, we establish ca cd process to continuously integrate

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
the court and deploy the code to production and moment in a machine learning project,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.500
the additional things that we need to take care of.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.915
How do we continuously train our models,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:35.700
monitored their performance, and retrain whenever required.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.280
Ml ops guides you on how to package and validate your machine learning experiments.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.235
A monopsony is a relatively new field.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.820
Successful area mill adoption is yet to be figured out.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.200
In many organization data scientist work independently then notebook environment,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.150
usually there'll be no clear process defined on how to take those models to production.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.520
And only very few organisms have

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.030
the right tools in place to monitor the model performance.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.750
If we're an operation person with some machine learning background,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.270
you'll find an app opportunity in the middle of space.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.635
There are multiple tools in the market

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:19.310
to help you with the overall machine learning lifecycle.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.925
Airflow is a popular tool for data sourcing.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:27.665
You can also look at Uzi in a big data Hadoop and moment.

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:32.390
Pi yard is a popular tool for feature scaling or feature engineering.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.360
We have seen libraries like TensorFlow, pi-thirds,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.950
scikit-learn for machine learning,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.680
turning an evaluation for deployment.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.705
We have TensorFlow Serving serverless Cloud environment and various other options.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.285
Finally, when the modal is in production,

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:51.470
ML watcher and various other tools can be used to monitor the performance.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.779
You can use tools like giraffe get off for worsening and managing the overall process.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.660
Let's look at a popular tool called a mail flow.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.820
What machine learning lifecycle management.
