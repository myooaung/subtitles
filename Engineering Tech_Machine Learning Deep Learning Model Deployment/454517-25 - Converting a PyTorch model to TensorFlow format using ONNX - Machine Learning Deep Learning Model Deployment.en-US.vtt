00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.410
Annex is an open format for deep learning models.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.725
There are many deep learning libraries available these days,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.675
such as biters, TensorFlow,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.835
cafe to using annex,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.150
you can easily port models from one format to another.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.025
Format. On x is supported by a community of partners such as AWS,

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:26.229
Facebook, and many other companies.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.600
Let's understand how we can export our Python smarter to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.995
annex format and then import it in TensorFlow and use it.

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:41.530
We will put the PICOTS notebook that we created for customer behavior prediction.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.530
So this model can take A's in salaries

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.560
to parameters and predict whether a customer will buy or not.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.570
We need to specify a sample input parameters to export the mortar to annex four, Marta.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.615
Let's declare a sample tensor.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.075
You can have any values here.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.580
You tends to Mazda input Walmart.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.280
In this case, we are taking two parameters.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120
Has in salary.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.490
Using dot-dot-dot x-dot export,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.985
you can export the model specified the sample tensor,

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.575
that is the input format.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:28.670
Give her file and name and then export perhaps would be true.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.480
And after this biter to have generated this model in annex four.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.840
But now this file can be imported to TensorFlow Cafe too,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.675
and many other machine learning liabilities.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:46.170
Let's see how we can use this model in TensorFlow.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.250
First we need to import annex.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.720
Then we need to install onyx PF.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.105
After that, we would import onyx and import annexed.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:06.155
If we are using some other environment to load this model,

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:09.710
you might have to importance of low add-ons do it is not required in

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.610
the collaborate moment annex TAP class called prepare,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
using which we can import onyx model2 TensorFlow.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.960
Lets first lord Don export it to a variable.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.715
Then using prepare, we can convert onyx model2, TensorFlow, Walmart.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:30.030
You can hover over, prepared and read more about it.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.190
This is how we can convert it by touch mortar to annex format.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.140
And then using annex prepare,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.850
we can create a TensorFlow model.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.050
This converted model has

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.540
a run method which will take input parameters and give the prediction.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.190
Let's check the prediction for age 402750 thousand.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.830
It is minus 0.52 at index one.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.240
This should match with our biters prediction.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.860
This customer would buy because your next one value is higher.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.180
So this is how you can convert

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.450
the pi-thirds moderate propensity flow per month using Onyx.
