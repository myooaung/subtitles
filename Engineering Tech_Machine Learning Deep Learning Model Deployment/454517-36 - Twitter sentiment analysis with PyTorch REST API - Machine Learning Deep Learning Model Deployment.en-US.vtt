00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
We'll now integrate the Twitter sentiment analysis app with despite Dots risk TPA.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Let's first ensure the pi-thirds NLP Rest API is running.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.040
We have created a risk TPA using interrupt,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.350
and this is the public URL that ends the rocket generated for this rest API.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.350
Let's hit this endpoint from postmen.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.470
We need to provide the slash predict endpoint.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.760
We're able to predict sentiment using

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.415
the rest API that is running in the Colombian woman.

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:43.400
Now let's open the Twitter sentiment analysis notebook.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's try to hit Dar SDP from this notebook.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.915
Will first declare a variable URL.

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:55.760
After that will create a JSON string containing the input data.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.070
Will import JSON.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.705
And import requests.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.720
Then create this input data variable.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.690
After that, let's send a request.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.880
And I will try to print the response.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.300
So the status is 200.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.125
And if we do response.data will get the actual response string.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.450
The prediction is negative.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.675
So we are able to hit the race TPA from another notebook.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.940
You can hit it from anywhere.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.195
Let us now modify the tutors sentiment analysis program to use the rest API.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.700
We don't need the pickled files.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.750
Let's delete.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.410
This. Will face the tweets as before.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.750
Will phage 500 tweets

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.460
and managed to fit 500 tweets again on vexing topic will cleans the tweets.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.080
Now we don't need to import pickle because we will be invoking the rest.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.960
Epa will have two variables to keep track of positive and negative two, it says before.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.735
Now, earlier we use the TFIDF vector Asia and the classifier model to predict.

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:42.810
Now you'd be in working the rest API for each tweet will create a JSON string.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.215
Then we'll get the response using star dot post.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:52.470
And the sentiment would be response dot text.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.700
Will go to the pi-thirds race TPA notebook

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.040
and will modify the code to simply return the sentiment.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.250
So this would return positive or negative.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.720
Let's read on it.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.575
You can restart runtime and run the entire program from the beginning.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.540
We got a different URL.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.010
Let's copy that.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.950
We'll go back to the tutors sentiment analysis notebook.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.830
We'll update the URL in the URL variable.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.950
Now for each Tweet,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.989
once we receive the response,

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.915
will check if the sentiment is positive or not.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:45.300
Based on that will increase. The counters.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.740
Will fix this typo here.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.315
Now let's execute this code block.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:04:00.890
For each tweet, we are making a rest call to get the sentiment.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.450
And based on the response,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.860
we are increasing the counters while it is processing.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.650
Let's go back to the other note book and take the log.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.840
We can see that the HSDPA is getting the real-time to

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.760
its end processing and then returning the sentiment positive or negative.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.715
Let's go back to their Twitter sentiment analysis notebook and verify the account.

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:35.750
So there are six positive 2494, negative two,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.075
it's we're analyzing real-time to it.

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:44.225
So every time we will get a different response based on what people are tweeting.

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:46.970
The key thing we have learnt here is how to

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.150
integrate with the machine learning model through risk APA.
