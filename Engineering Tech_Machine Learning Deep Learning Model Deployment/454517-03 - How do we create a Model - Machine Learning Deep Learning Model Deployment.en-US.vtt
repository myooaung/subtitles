00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.035
Let's take a closer look at the machine learning process

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.830
and understand when our model is ready for deployment.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
In machine learning, the algorithm looks at the data,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.990
derives pattern and creates a mandala.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.090
Let's start from data.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.970
Typically we receive raw data and then we do the data preprocessing.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
Data preprocessing involves stapes like data cleansing data standardization,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.655
fixing issues with null values,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.810
missing records, unknown values,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.425
and various other things.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:39.140
During data preprocessing, we also convert categorical values, two numerical values.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.250
Because machine learning models can work with numerical data.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.760
This step can be performed within the machine-learning boundary,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.310
or it can be performed by another team.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.250
For example, a team which specializes in big-data Spark,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.059
which is a very popular technology for data preprocessing.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.375
For many models, we also do feature scaling.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.840
That is bringing all the features to the same scale so that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.410
the model will not get biased or influenced by the particular feature.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.730
Once that is done or data is ready for machine learning algorithm.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.400
Depending on the problem we're trying to solve,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.315
we might repeat this process several times to get the perfect data.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.370
For our machine learning algorithm.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.090
We feed the data to an algorithm and get a model.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.040
But is that the final model?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.105
Once we get a model,

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:37.145
we test the accuracy we defined to the model to get higher accuracy.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:41.030
If we go back to the data preprocessing step and generate the data again

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.410
and feed it to the algorithm again and to get the model with the desired accuracy.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.255
Apart from accuracy, we also check whether the data is overfitting or under fitting.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.355
And once we are happy with the model,

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:56.220
we deploy a particular Watson to production.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.510
So that is the final model and that gets used by different applications.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.770
In this course, our focus is more around learning how to deploy

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.240
the model so that it can be used in production by various other applications.
