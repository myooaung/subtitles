00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.565
You can also run your email flow experiments on the Google collab environment.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.020
Let's see how to do that.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.210
We'll go to Google collab environment and create a new notebook.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.010
First, we need to install a mail flow.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.845
Deploys in start.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:34.575
We had earlier seen how to create a risky beyond Google collide using NG rock.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:35.880
And using NG rock,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.450
we can also create a public user interface for ML flow.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.515
We'll install paella Iraq liability by Indie Rock is a Python wrapper for Iraq.

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:59.900
Then we'll specify the port for the MLE flow UA and run it in the background.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.475
After that, we'll import in

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:12.820
Iraq will invoke in 0 kilometer to kill any existing open tunnel.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.970
Then will open in a stupid tunnel at port 5 thousand using this command.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.005
So at this point occurred started by Emily flow UA.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.170
And we can get the address of the UAE

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.410
by printing the public who are enough in Iraq tunnel.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.340
So let's go to this URL now.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.420
So as you can see, we have managed to lunch ML flow from the Google Columbian moment.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.440
Now let's copy this entire core From Spider And you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.000
can copy it to multiple cells article pasted in a single cell.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.205
Let's paste it in a single cell.

00:01:58.205 --> 00:01:59.750
And we put, we run this,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.050
we need to ensure this CSV file is accessible.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.925
We can either upload to a CSV file to the Columbia environment here,

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.539
or we can access from the GitHub repository.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.320
Let me access it from the GitHub repository.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.300
Now let's run this cell.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.660
It would create an experiment and log the parameters.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.590
And we got a response saying ML for demo doesn't exist.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.000
It is creating that experiment.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.560
So let's press the space now.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.260
We can see that the new experiment has been

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.750
created and this is the run that we just heard.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.420
So this is how we can run a mail flow from the Colombian moment.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.150
And we can click on this file icon and ML flow that generated the pickle file.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.830
We can see that under this

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.660
directory model.predict L. So

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.540
this is the file that has been created in the Colombian moment,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.910
which can be exported to another environment.
