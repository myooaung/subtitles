00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.340
There are various tools available in the market using which you can easily run

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.780
your machine learning experiments and deploy your models locally and in the cloud.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.260
And Mama, ML flow from Databricks is one such product.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.350
With ML flow, you can work with any liability.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.740
You can build your models and deploy it easily in any cloud environment.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.170
There are currently four key components is shown here.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.730
Using ML through tracking,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.550
you can easily track your machine-learning cleaning experiment,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.135
what kind of parameters you are using and what kind of matrices you are generating.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.655
We'll see that in a demo shortly.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.560
With their models component,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.494
you can easily deploy your model locally and in various cloud environments.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:54.720
Let's dive in and see them in Floor tool in action.
