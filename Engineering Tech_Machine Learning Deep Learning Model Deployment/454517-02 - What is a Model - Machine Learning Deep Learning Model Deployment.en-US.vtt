00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Let's understand machine-learning.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.430
In machine learning, we read patterns from data using

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
a machine learning algorithm and then create a model.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.610
Then we use that model to predict output for new data.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.935
For example, if a model is trained to predict customer behavior,

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:23.310
you can feed in a new customer profile and it can

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.030
predict whether the customer wrote BYOD not based on its age,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.190
salary, and other parameters.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.310
If a model is trained to classify an image,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.735
whether it's a cat or dog.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.845
The new feeded new image_id to predict whether it's a cat or dog.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:41.400
A sentiment analysis Modern can read text

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.750
and predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.500
So what exactly is a model?

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.465
So model can be a class or object or it can be a mathematical formula.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:57.275
And how do you deploy and use the model?

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:01.460
The model can be stored in the file system in binary format.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.440
It can be stored in a database column,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.300
in blog or other formats.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.020
How you can take the model and create a rest API and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.145
make it accessible to applications or what HTTP protocol.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.740
Or you can simply take the modal coordinate,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.940
the widget in another program.
