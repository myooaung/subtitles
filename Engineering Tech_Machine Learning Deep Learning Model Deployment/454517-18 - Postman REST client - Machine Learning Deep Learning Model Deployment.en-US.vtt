00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
We've now installed the postman tool using which we can

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.760
send request to easily without having to create a Python app.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.070
Let's search what Postman pool

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.750
installation download for your operating system.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.685
Once downloaded the condo EXE to install postmen,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:29.055
then Lord medically get loaded.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:33.250
You can sign up using your Gmail Lady.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.330
Let's open postpartum again.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.410
Now let's create a new request.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.950
We'll create a request tape is post recipes that we

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.825
have created for our ML models, expects post requests.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:56.185
And here we'll specify the endpoint URL.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:01.795
And within the body we need to specify the data.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:09.070
We'll put the JSON string a 100,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.090
the body tab, and then select the JSON from the dropdown here.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.800
And it is send request.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.950
We got the prediction is 0.2.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.340
So make sure that Jason is, we'll form our tip.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.575
Using JSON editor online,

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:33.355
you can validate with your JSON string is evalutation.

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:36.310
Simply paste under the core tab,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.920
then click on the tab and you will know whether your JSON is a valid dishonored.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:51.370
Let's now change this values and recorded different prediction.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.750
This is how you can test only your machine-learning rest APIs with the deadening and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.805
collaborate on a VM or on Google Cloud Function using dot post one tuner.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:06.320
You don't need to create a separate by turnip just to taste your rest. Apis.
