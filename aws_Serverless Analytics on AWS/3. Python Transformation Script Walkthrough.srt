1
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:04,716
I thought it would be interesting to go over what's in the

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:08,068
Python script before we create the GlueStack.

3
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:09,150
By doing this,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,657
you'll have a good bird's eye perspective on why all of

5
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:17,523
those Glue assets are created because ultimately they all

6
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,569
lead to the ETL transformations.

7
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:23,986
So if you right-click on the Python script,

8
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:27,219
many times you'll have an integrated developer environment

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,233
named IDLE that comes with Python packages,

10
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:35,230
and then you can just hover over the name of the Python

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,755
script and choose Edit with IDLE, and it opens up this Python editor.

12
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:43,279
If you have another third-party Python editor,

13
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:49,129
that'll work just fine, as long as you can open up and read the Python script.

14
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,808
If you don't have anything, just search in Google for Python IDLE,

15
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:56,937
and down the IDE.

16
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:57,432
So what we're doing here,

17
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:02,955
we are initializing the Glue job for ETL transformation.

18
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:07,647
We are then creating DynamicFrames for the tables that we want to join.

19
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:12,680
We have the sakila_film table, the sakila_film_category table,

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,902
and then what we're going to do is create a third

21
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:19,701
DynamicFrame to hold the join of the two tables.

22
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:24,447
And then in this section, we're just stating the primary and secondary keys,

23
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:28,407
and in this section we're just saying where to put the

24
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:31,491
output of the transformation in Amazon S3,

25
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,904
so that is the join transformation.

26
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:36,744
And then in this last part,

27
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:40,563
we do another transformation where we convert the

28
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,720
data that is the result of the join.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,859
WE change the data type to Parquet format,

30
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,372
so that in the processed S3 zone,

31
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:58,000
the data will be in a format ready to be used in various analytic services like Amazon Athena.
