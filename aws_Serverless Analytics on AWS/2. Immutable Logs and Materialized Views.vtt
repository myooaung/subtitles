00:00:01.382 --> 00:00:02.488
In this section,

2
00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:08.112
I'll put together the Amazon S3 Data Lake design pattern for

3
00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:13.368
both batch and real-time streaming processing,

4
00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:19.071
and explain how invaluable immutable logs and materialized views are.

5
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.449
An S3 Data Lake is where you bring together your interactive

6
00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.972
batch and real-time or stream analytics.

7
00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:32.685
Your materialized view is data stored in a database or something

8
00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:37.386
similar that has modified the raw data in some way and is stored

9
00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:42.099
waiting for further processing in the format your downstream

10
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:43.961
applications would need it to be in,

11
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:51.294
and your immutable log is your raw data in Amazon S3 where you store everything,

12
00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:53.307
throwing away nothing.

13
00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:55.219
Amazon S3 is really cheap,

14
00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.986
you keep the raw data in Amazon S3 in order to answer

15
00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:06.789
unknown business questions that inevitably will come up as

16
00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.139
AI and ML capabilities advance,

17
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.378
as well as being able to have multiple users doing different

18
00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:17.078
processing or analytics on the raw data simultaneously.

19
00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:19.992
Once you AI and ML-ed your apps,

20
00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:25.682
it's important to embed the analysis into your products to improve

21
00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:28.875
customer satisfaction and be integrated into your business offerings

22
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.642
to improve the way you run your business,

23
00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:34.785
such as implementing safety improvements.

24
00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:39.512
Then operationalize the analysis so every person is empowered

25
00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:44.108
with the right insights to make intelligence-driven decisions

26
00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:45.854
throughout every business day.

27
00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:48.896
All this sounds great, right, but how do you start?

28
00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.220
It's a cyclical process.

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.521
First,

30
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:54.371
you build something that has a huge value to your

31
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:56.459
business and your customers in the cloud.

32
00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.256
This also gives you buy in if you need it from business decision makers.

33
00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:01.584
Then,

34
00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:06.173
follow the cycle as you see it on the screen to continually embed

35
00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:09.419
insights that drive actions and deliver value,

36
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.380
keeping existing capabilities while adding new ones.

37
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.309
As you restructure enterprise applications,

38
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.612
the order in which you restructure depends on the complexity of the

39
00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:24.396
architecture and your existing licensing arrangements.

40
00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:29.059
Start with low complexity apps like apps that are

41
00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.434
virtualized or service-oriented architectures.

42
00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:32.916
Then as you progress,

43
00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:37.680
start to decouple highly complex apps like monolithic or mainframe apps.

44
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.919
One thing is certain, avoid analysis paralysis and start experimenting today,

45
00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:49.446
applying AI and ML to your apps and business processes.

46
00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:56.929
To quote Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO, what's dangerous is not to evolve.

47
00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.629
I hope you've learned a lot of valuable information in this course,

48
00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.104
along with the understanding of why to use AWS Glue and Amazon Athena,

49
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:14.091
where to implement them, and how to implement the state-of-the-art technologies,

50
00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:18.847
as well as having an understanding for that everyone today,

51
00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.970
we all have to evolve.

52
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.531
You are now empowered with this new knowledge,

53
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:28.653
and I hope you get started right away AI and ML-ing your apps and

54
00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:32.537
business processes using what you've learned in this course.

55
00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:33.545
Thank you for watching this course.

56
00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:37.467
I hope you had as much fun learning all the concepts and

57
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.645
implementations as I did writing the course.

58
00:03:40.645 --> 00:03:45.947
You guys can always reach me at kim@ dataleader.io.

59
00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:56.000
Go forth, and may the power of AWS Glue and Amazon Athena be with you. See you in the next course.
