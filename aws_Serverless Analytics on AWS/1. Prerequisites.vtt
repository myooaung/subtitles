Hi, I'm Kim Schmidt.

2
00:00:03.526 --> 00:00:10.231
I'll be your instructor for the course, Serverless Analytics on AWS.

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:13.265
I'm president and CEO of DataLeader,

4
00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:19.642
an AWS partner and vendor company focusing on big data

5
00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.241
architectures and advanced analytics.

6
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.975
I'm excited to share with you some innovative,

7
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:30.043
cutting-edge analytics services provided by AWS,

8
00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:33.622
Amazon Athena, and AWS Glue.

9
00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:37.268
These services are not only cutting edge because

10
00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:42.045
they're state-of-the-art technologies, but also because they're serverless.

11
00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:47.519
Having a cloud-native serverless architecture enables you to build modern

12
00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.925
applications with increased agility and lower cost of ownership.

13
00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:57.931
It enables you to shift most of your operational and

14
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.787
infrastructure management responsibilities to AWS,

15
00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:06.385
so you can focus on developing great products that

16
00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:10.134
are highly reliable and scalable.

17
00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:15.050
This initial module will allow you to be prepared to follow along by

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.931
installing the course prerequisites prior to starting the course.

19
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.758
First, you'll need to download the course assets from GitHub.

20
00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:28.216
This download will provide all scripts and other

21
00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:30.890
code-related materials needed for the course.

22
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.488
My GitHub profile is CloudLeader.

23
00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:38.116
When you navigate to the URL on the screen,

24
00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:43.708
you'll see a GitHub repository named ETLAnalyticsUsingGlue.

25
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:46.751
Click the green Clone or Download button,

26
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.309
download the ZIP file to your desktop, and unzip it.

27
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:54.577
We'll be using the enclosed files later in this course.

28
00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:57.853
Next, in order to connect to an AWS database,

29
00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:03.868
AWS recommends using the free third-party SQL client,

30
00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:05.760
MySQL Workbench.

31
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.451
The URL shown on the screen will take you to the Download page.

32
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:16.897
You can use most third-party SQL clients, however, if you already have one.

33
00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:17.839
In the next module,

34
00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.141
I'm going to teach you why you need to learn to work with

35
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:28.000
AWS Glue and Amazon Athena in the cloud. I'll see you there.
