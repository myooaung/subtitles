00:00:01.098 --> 00:00:05.938
So let me summarize what happened in the last demo when we ran the

2
00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:10.694
first Glue crawler and ran our Glue ETL job.

3
00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:16.655
Our Glue crawler crawled the Amazon Aurora relational database and

4
00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:22.958
populated the sakiladb database in the Glue Data Catalog with all the

5
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.674
tables that are in the Amazon Aurora database,

6
00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:32.127
giving it enough metadata and statistics to recreate the database whenever

7
00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:37.527
you want to perform any type of analytics on that data.

8
00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:43.221
The columns in the Glue Data Catalog database tables are the Name,

9
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.982
the Database, and the Location of each table,

10
00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:50.913
in addition to the classification,

11
00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:54.694
which for all of these tables is My SQL because they all

12
00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:58.565
came from the Amazon Aurora MySQL database.

13
00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:05.305
Once the sakiladb database in the Glue Data Catalog was populated with data,

14
00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:07.961
we ran the Glue ETL job.

15
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.295
What you're looking at on this slide is the Python

16
00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:13.393
script that we used for transformation.

17
00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:17.345
This would be a really good slide for people who are learning Python to

18
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:20.737
go back to because I color coated everything for you,

19
00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:25.169
so you can get an idea of what each line of code is doing.

20
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:30.404
The screenshots on this slide show you different views for the Amazon

21
00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:34.241
CloudWatch logs that were the result of running the Glue job.

22
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.866
There's a lot of data there,

23
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.681
so I thought it would be a value to show a few screenshots,

24
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:44.384
so you can see all the kinds of data that Amazon

25
00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:48.001
CloudWatch logs have for your job runs.

26
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:57.000
The next section is a demo section, where we will create a new Glue crawler, and crawl the Parquet-formatted data.
