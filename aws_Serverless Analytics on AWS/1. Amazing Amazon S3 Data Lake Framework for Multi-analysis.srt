1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,392
Now that you have course prerequisites set up,

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:09,962
in this module entitled The State of Analytics in the AWS Cloud,

3
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:14,217
I'll briefly explain the concept of Amazon S3 data lakes,

4
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:19,215
introduce you to the relational database of choice for analytics,

5
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:21,233
Amazon Aurora,

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:25,572
and then introduce you to AWS Glue and Amazon Athena and

7
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:29,038
the business problems that they solve.

8
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,355
At this point in the course,

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:34,566
you'll need a fundamental understanding of what data lakes are.

10
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:40,295
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all

11
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:44,260
your structured and unstructured data at any scale.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,592
You can store your data as is without having to first structure the data.

13
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:55,436
When you use Amazon S3 as the data lake storage platform,

14
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:59,988
you have a complete portfolio of data exploration,

15
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,116
reporting, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence,

16
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:08,909
and visualization tools to use on all your data.

17
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,458
A data lake makes data and the optimal analytics tools available

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,565
to more users across more lines of business,

19
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:20,086
which enables companies to get all of the business

20
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:24,513
insights they need whenever they need them.

21
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:27,065
I'm aware that you'll be learning about Amazon S3

22
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:30,812
object storage in this learning path,

23
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:35,609
but I wanted to quickly review why Amazon S3 is used as the

24
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,812
primary storage platform for a data lake.

25
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:40,314
In the next two slides,

26
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:46,250
I'll quickly discuss Amazon S3's benefits in so far as it relates

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,300
to being the perfect data lake storage platform.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,043
S3 is an optimal foundation for a data lake because of

29
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,789
its virtually-unlimited scalability.

30
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,015
S3 is designed for the 11-nines of data durability because

31
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:06,209
it automatically creates and stores copies of all S3

32
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,995
objects across multiple systems.

33
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:13,893
This means your data is available when needed and protected against failures,

34
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,689
errors, and threats.

35
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,434
You can take advantage of the range of S3 storage classes,

36
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:25,457
moving to a less-expensive S3 class when certain criteria is met.

37
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:29,719
S3 lifecycle policies can be enabled so your data will

38
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,785
automatically transfer to a different storage class without

39
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,742
any changes to your application.

40
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:42,409
You can use Amazon S3 storage class analysis to discover data that should

41
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:46,056
move to a lower-cost storage class based on access patterns.

42
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:51,075
These last two benefits contribute to substantial cost savings.

43
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:55,143
There are many ways to transfer data into S3.

44
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:59,231
Amazon Macie is a security service that uses machine

45
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,225
learning to automatically discover, classify,

46
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:07,085
and protect sensitive data stored in S3.

47
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:12,002
It recognizes sensitive data like personally-identifiable information,

48
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:16,742
or PII, and intellectual property.

49
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:21,251
It's a fully-managed service that continually monitors data access

50
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,989
activity for anomalies and generates detailed alerts when it detects risk

51
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,702
of unauthorized access or inadvertent data leaks.

52
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,897
Amazon S3 has built-in security by design.

53
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:39,885
It protects data with an infrastructure designed for the

54
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,263
most data-sensitive organizations.

55
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,756
S3 provides a wide range of data management features,

56
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:50,573
giving flexibility at an object level while managing scale,

57
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:54,008
configuring access, enabling cost efficiencies,

58
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:57,773
and auditing data across an S3 data lake.

59
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:03,561
S3 data lakes have query-in-place services for big data analytics

60
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:07,208
like Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

61
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:13,604
S3 has event notifications delivered using Amazon Simple Queue Service,

62
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:17,674
or SQS, Amazon Simple Notification Service,

63
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,383
or SNS, or AWS Lambda.

64
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:26,492
It has data protection through versioning, cross-region replication, and more.

65
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:31,059
There's many ways to ensure your data is secure in S3,

66
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:36,160
like multifactor authentication, flexible access control mechanisms,

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,942
access logs, and multiple client and server-side encryption options.

68
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:47,227
Using S3 as a data lake store platform gives you access to

69
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:53,502
numerous AWS analytics applications, artificial intelligence services,

70
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,661
machine-learning services, and high-performance file systems.

71
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:02,307
This means you can run numerous workloads across your data lake without

72
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:07,518
additional data processing or transfers to other stores.

73
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:11,144
You can also bring your preferred third-party analytics and

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,160
machine-learning tools to your S3 data lake.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,194
On this slide is a conceptual representation of most of AWS services

76
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,789
that you can use to build your analytical pipelines.

77
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:28,318
At the bottom are various ways to get your data into AWS.

78
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:32,643
Next in red are S3 data lake services,

79
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:37,266
in orange are the various database solutions,

80
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,048
analytical solutions,

81
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:44,121
and blockchain solutions AWS provides at this point in time.

82
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:48,229
And in blue are the business intelligence and

83
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,894
machine-learning services that AWS provides.

84
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:57,028
I'm not going to explain this slide because it's a lot to take in at this point.

85
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,421
I've included it in this presentation so that you can revisit this content

86
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:06,096
after the course when it'll make much more sense to you.

87
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:15,000
In the next section, I'll cover Amazon Aurora, the relational database of choice when it comes to analytics.
