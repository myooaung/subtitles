00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:02.177
In the next demo,

2
00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:06.469
we'll be creating another CloudFormation stack that builds upon the Aurora

3
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:11.270
stack using some of the resources created by the Aurora stack.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.245
Have your folder that you downloaded from my GitHub repository handy

5
00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:18.446
because we're going to be using the GlueStack.yml script.

6
00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:23.431
So what exactly will be doing in this demo is to create the

7
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:27.822
second CloudFormation stack named GlueStack that will provision

8
00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:33.121
and configure our infrastructure architecture needed to work with

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.365
AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

10
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:40.658
Then we'll review the CloudFormation stacks resources, outputs, and parameters.

11
00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:45.296
And then we'll verify that all assets were created that the

12
00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:47.564
code instructed CloudFormation to do.

13
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:49.173
It's demo time.

14
00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:50.522
From the AWS Console,

15
00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:54.806
making sure you're in the same region that you were in

16
00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:57.231
when you created the Aurora stack,

17
00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:00.859
as well as where you uploaded the Python script to,

18
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.471
find CloudFormation, right-click on it, and open the link in a new tab.

19
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.867
Click on Create stack,

20
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.547
and since we've already overviewed the

21
00:01:11.547 --> 00:01:14.263
CloudFormation script for the Aurora stack,

22
00:01:14.263 --> 00:01:17.390
this time we're going to simply upload the YAML file

23
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.718
from the Select Template page.

24
00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:24.561
So click on Choose File, and then choose GlueStack.yml.

25
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.632
Once it's in the stack creation process,

26
00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:33.028
the name of the script will show to the right of the Choose File button.

27
00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:34.960
Scroll down and choose Next.

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.380
In the Specified Details page, give the stack the name of GlueStack.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.492
Notice under Parameters that the AuroraStackName,

30
00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:48.679
as well as the DatabasePath are pre-populated.

31
00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.625
The DatabasePath is the schema path for crawling the database and table schemas.

32
00:01:53.625 --> 00:02:01.157
If you use the MySQL wild card DBName/% sign as you see here,

33
00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:07.320
the crawler will crawl everything under the top-level database sakila,

34
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.244
populating the Glue Data catalog with everything underneath it.

35
00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:16.209
And then in the S3DestinationBucketName,

36
00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.343
choose a unique bucket destination name,

37
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:23.436
and I chose uniquebucketnamedestination,

38
00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:26.709
but it's going to create this bucket, so you can call it whatever you'd like.

39
00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.876
In the Options page that comes next, leave everything as it is and click on Next.

40
00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:35.608
In the Review page,

41
00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:39.063
look over everything and make sure that everything is the way

42
00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:41.778
you want it to be and there's no errors,

43
00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:47.131
and then click on the little checkbox next to the words that

44
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:51.594
read I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create

45
00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:54.829
Identity and Access Management resources.

46
00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.780
Clicking that saves so much time because AWS provides

47
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.511
this option because if it didn't,

48
00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:09.348
you would be spending a whole lot of time writing the IAM roles and policies

49
00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:13.695
for each AWS service to interact with other AWS services.

50
00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.538
So check that, and then click Create.

51
00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:20.158
Once the GlueStack has a status of CREATE_COMPLETE,

52
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.533
if you check the little checkbox next to the GlueStack,

53
00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:30.112
you can see all of the major resources that the GlueStack created,

54
00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:35.205
such as the IAM Role, a Glue Connection,

55
00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:39.306
a Glue Database, a Glue Crawler, a Glue Job,

56
00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.201
and the destination S3 Bucket.

57
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:48.132
If you click on Outputs, you see all of the outputs that the GlueStack created.

58
00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:52.538
Pretty much most of these are giving names to some of the resources,

59
00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:56.871
but it also includes our S3 bucket name.

60
00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:57.950
If you click on Parameters,

61
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.592
you see all of the parameters that went into creating the GlueStack.

62
00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:07.197
So let's look at some of the primary resources that were created.

63
00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:12.827
Go up to Services, and either start typing in the search bar Glue,

64
00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:17.141
but if it's in your history, whichever way you get to it,

65
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:20.213
right-click on it and open the link in a new tab.

66
00:04:20.213 --> 00:04:23.256
When it loads, it loads in database view,

67
00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:27.967
and you can see right here is our sakiladb database in the

68
00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:33.183
Glue Data Catalog that so far doesn't have any tables in it

69
00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:35.659
because we haven't run any crawlers.

70
00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.655
If you click on Connections, here's our Aurora connection,

71
00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:43.043
and if we click on that, you get more information about it.

72
00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:47.938
If you click on Crawlers, and then click on the Aurora crawler,

73
00:04:47.938 --> 00:04:50.937
you get more information here as well such as the

74
00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:54.474
database in the Glue Data Catalog, the Table prefix,

75
00:04:54.474 --> 00:04:57.007
the Connection, and the Include path.

76
00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:00.367
If you click on jobs, here's our Aurora job.

77
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:04.508
If you check the checkbox to the left of the job name,

78
00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:07.818
you get four different tabs of information.

79
00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:14.031
The History tab lists all the times that this job has run.

80
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:18.338
If I click the radio button, you can see that for that particular run,

81
00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:22.902
I can view Metrics, but let's just click on the Run ID.

82
00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:27.076
This gives you more information about that run and that job,

83
00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.645
where you can navigate by these two links to

84
00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:33.712
CloudWatch Error logs and and Run logs.

85
00:05:33.712 --> 00:05:37.991
Going back to the main job window, and then clicking on the Details tab,

86
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.091
you can see that it has the Script location,

87
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.639
that Job bookmarks are enabled, the Parameters,

88
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.019
which is the destination bucket, and the Connection information.

89
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:51.894
Let's click on Script.

90
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:55.955
This is the Python script that we uploaded to our S3 bucket,

91
00:05:55.955 --> 00:06:00.792
and right from the job interface, you can edit the script.

92
00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:06.660
In the next section, I'll elaborate on each of these Glue assets,

93
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:16.000
what they're going to do in the rest of the module, and the configurations that are important about each asset.
