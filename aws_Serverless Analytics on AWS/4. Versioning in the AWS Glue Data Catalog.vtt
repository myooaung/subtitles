00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:06.145
The earliest challenges that inhibited building a data lake were keeping track

2
00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:09.879
of all the raw assets as they were loaded into the data lake,

3
00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.472
and then tracking all of the new data assets and versions

4
00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:16.781
that were created by data transformation,

5
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:19.307
data processing, and analytics,

6
00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:24.078
thus an essential component of an Amazon S3-based

7
00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:26.537
Data Lake is in the data catalog.

8
00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:32.866
In this section, we'll look a little closer at data catalog versioning.

9
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.222
This screenshot shows the Glue Data Catalog's interface,

10
00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:42.090
highlighting the versioning feature of the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.812
Near the bottom of the screenshot is a section with the title Schema.

12
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:50.202
At the top-right, you can see the button that reads Stop comparing.

13
00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.311
In the lower section under Schema,

14
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.968
you can see that the data catalog is comparing schema versions

15
00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:00.868
for the same table as version 0 and version 1.

16
00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:03.728
It shows the comparison of these versions,

17
00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:07.376
where any differences are highlighted in red or green.

18
00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:11.415
The ability to compare versions in case of errors is an

19
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.115
important feature of the Glue Data Catalog.

20
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.301
Not only can you do comparisons between versions,

21
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:23.460
but you also can completely roll back to any previous version if you need to.

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.915
The next module is primarily a demo module,

23
00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:36.000
where we build everything in regard to AWS Glue. See you there.
