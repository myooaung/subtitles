00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:06,142
There's two types of data catalogs that work with Amazon Athena.

2
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:09,214
I'll explain the differences in this section.

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:14,129
If you created databases and tables using Athena in a region

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,735
before AWS Glue was available in that region,

5
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:24,021
the metadata is stored in an Athena-managed data catalog,

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,488
which only Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum can access.

7
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:32,683
To use AWS Glue features together with Amazon Athena,

8
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:36,649
you must upgrade to the Glue Data Catalog.

9
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:40,904
Athena can only be used together with the AWS Glue Data

10
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:45,136
Catalog in regions where AWS Glue is available.

11
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:50,160
It's the preferred data catalog to use because it provides many benefits.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,275
The update process is extremely straightforward and easily found by Googling it.

13
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,750
Once you've upgraded to use the Glue Data Catalog,

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,752
it provides the following benefits.

15
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:07,020
The Glue Data Catalog provides a unified metadata repository across a

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,457
variety of data sources and data formats with out-of-the-box integration

17
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:17,608
with many AWS Analytic and other services.

18
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:22,790
You're able to use Glue crawlers to automatically crawl your data sources,

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,601
identify data formats, and suggest schemas and transformations.

20
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:32,121
Crawlers can help automate table creation and automatic loading

21
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,173
of partitions that you can query using Athena.

22
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:40,053
Glue's ETL engine generates Python code that's customizable,

23
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:42,288
reusable, and portable.

24
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,680
After your ETL job is ready,

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,536
you can schedule it to run on Glue's fully-managed

26
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:51,287
scale-out Spark infrastructure.

27
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,367
Glue handles the provisioning, configuration,

28
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:59,717
and scaling of the resources required to run your ETL jobs.

29
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:09,000
In the next section, I'll cover Amazon Athena's SerDes data formats and compression formats.
