1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,810
We've been through a lot of information in the last 2 and a half hours,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,700
so let's spend the final couple minutes here highlighting some

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,380
of the key features that we've discussed.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,420
This course is focused on CloudWatch.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,920
There are lots of services AWS that DevOps engineers will find useful.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,540
But if we're talking about even response and monitoring,

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,460
then CloudWatch is our main tool. In various modules of this course,

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,940
we've looked at CloudWatch metrics, dashboards,

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,090
CloudWatch alarms, CloudWatch events, and of course,

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,590
CloudWatch logs and logging sites.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,660
All of these will be valuable tools to DevOps engineers.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,950
We've also spent a lot of time talking about event response. Using

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,980
CloudWatch events, we also highlighted EventBridge.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,350
Remember, everything we did in CloudWatch events,

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,640
you can also do in EventBridge,

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,740
but EventBridge extends event in service to include custom service busses

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,350
and greater integration with third‑party applications.

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,640
We also spent a big chunk this course talking about automation for event

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,240
response. We discussed automation for infrastructure events,

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,300
security events, and briefly, for application deployment.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,730
The key here is to identify the events that you would like to capture and

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,190
use the appropriate tool to capture those events, and ideally, trigger your

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,860
automated response. In one full module and through sections throughout this

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,420
course, we discussed CloudTrail. We said that CloudTrail is enabled by

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,160
default, but we also discussed CloudTrail integration with products like

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,970
CloudWatch and Amazon S3.

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,490
When looking at CloudTrail logs, remember that you're looking at management

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,240
events, so all that API activity that's being generated against your account,

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,570
data events, which record Lambda function events, and events generated against

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,530
the S3 buckets, and insight events. Remember,

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,340
insight events will alert you to any anomalous activity in your account.

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,000
We also spent one module talking about tagging,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,990
which is such an important aspect for our administration inside AWS, we

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,570
discussed cost allocation tags, we discussed how we can use tags to group

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,590
resources using resource groups in system manager, we talked about using

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,200
tags for our software deployment to identify the compute resources that our

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,170
code should be deployed to, and we talked about using tags for

38
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,440
attribute‑based access control.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,600
All organizations should have a good tagging strategy. And remember, we

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,160
can enforce tagging today if your accounts are part of an organization

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,750
using tagging policies We also spent the module talking about metadata,

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,200
and we said that metadata can be used to provide instance details to your

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,710
EC2 deployed applications,

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,780
we said it can be used to provide raw information to EC2 deployed applications,

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,200
and it can be used to provide user data to EC2 instances to configure

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,610
those instances at launch, or if the system properties have adjusted,

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,740
to reconfigure the machines each reboot.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,260
And finally,

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,540
here, if we only take away one piece of information

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,940
from this 2‑hour and 40‑minute course,

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,310
that should be automation is the key to success. In this module, you learned

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,980
about the power of event‑driven automation. We discussed automated healing,

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,040
and we had a look at a brief course review.

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,560
Thank you for spending the last 2 hours and 40 minutes with us.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:09,000
I hope you've learned some new tools that you can use in AWS. My name is Mike Brown, and I hope to see you on other Pluralsight courses soon.
