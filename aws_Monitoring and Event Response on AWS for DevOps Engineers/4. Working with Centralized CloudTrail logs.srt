00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,140
Now that we've demonstrated CloudTrail and CloudWatch integration,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,170
let's finish off this module by discussing centralized CloudTrail logs.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,110
Most companies today using AWS use multiple AWS accounts.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,640
Resources such as EC2 and lambda functions are deployed to

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,280
individual AWS accounts, and each AWS account has its own IAM,

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,940
identity and access management controls.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,500
If we have multiple AWS accounts it's best practice to start

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,700
audit logs from those accounts in a centralized,

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,100
secured location, somewhere where we can secure access to the

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,190
logs so that we can have a dedicated audit team that can read

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,640
and work with logging information,

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,130
but they are stored away from environments where they might be

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,250
accidentally or maliciously overwritten. In this diagram,

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,350
we have an AWS organization. An AWS organization is the top‑level

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,900
administrative unit in AWS. AWS organizations contain AWS accounts, and

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,840
it's into these accounts that we deploy resources. In this example, this

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,080
organization has four accounts, a master, a development and production

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,490
account, and here you can see a separate audit account where all of the

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,740
CloudTrail logs are centralized.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,860
It's this account that we restrict access to, making sure that

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,240
only our audit team has access to this account.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,320
When working with centralized CloudTrail logs it's good to

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,540
understand that AWS organizations are not a requirement.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,890
You could be working with independent AWS accounts and

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,870
still want to centralize their logs.

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,740
Having said that, AWS organizations do make the whole process that much easier.

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,610
We will need to configure the appropriate roles in each

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,870
account so that accounts are able to log information to

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,340
the centralized audit account.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,640
And it's probably beneficial if we enable AWS Single Sign‑On as well.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,440
This way our auditors can log into the audit account,

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,160
but also using their same credentials they can log into other accounts in the

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,740
organization if they need to view additional information.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,970
Finally, it's important that users in the member accounts of the organization,

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,590
such as development, production, and even the master account,

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,990
do not have rights to alter the trails. In this module we have taken

37
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,540
a look at CloudTrail and CloudWatch integration.

38
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,760
We have worked with CloudTrail and shown the process of setting

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,260
up a trail and the resulting logs in CloudWatch. And we discussed

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,200
centralized CloudTrail logs. In the next module we'll be working

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,740
with CloudWatch events.

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:38,000
So join me there and we'll continue on our monitoring and event response journey in AWS for DevOps engineers.
