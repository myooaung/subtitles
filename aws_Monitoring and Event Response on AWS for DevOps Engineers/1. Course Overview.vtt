Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.250
My name is Mike Brown, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.030
Monitoring and Event Response on AWS for DevOps Engineers.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.370
I am a senior cloud instructor working at Firebrand Training in the UK,

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.220
specializing in Amazon Web Services.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.540
AWS is one of the biggest providers of cloud services today.

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.180
Most AWS projects include monitoring, logging,

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.440
and automation, so mastering these topics is vital for anyone working in AWS,

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.490
particularly if you're working in a DevOps team.

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.320
In this course,

11
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.620
we're going to look at monitoring and event response using some key AWS

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.730
services that you will have access to if you have an AWS account.

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.510
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include monitoring event response

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.140
with CloudWatch, CloudTrail and CloudWatch integration,

15
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.040
log management and archiving, automation, and selfâ€‘healing.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.690
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.150
you'll have detailed knowledge of monitoring event response and understand

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.130
the key monitoring and event response services that you'll need to master in

19
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.740
order to be a valuable member of any DevOps team.

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.170
Before beginning this course,

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.070
you should be familiar with key AWS services and have an

22
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.970
understanding of the AWS DevOps tools. From here, you should feel

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.880
comfortable diving into AWS topics with courses on Infrastructure

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520
Automation with CloudFormation,

25
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.640
Continuous Delivery with AWS Tools, and Monitoring and Logging in AWS.

26
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.140
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about monitoring and

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:42.000
event response with the Monitoring and Event Response on AWS for DevOps Engineers course at Pluralsight.
