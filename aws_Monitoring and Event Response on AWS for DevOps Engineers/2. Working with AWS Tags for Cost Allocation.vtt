00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.050
One of the easiest ways to start working with tags in AWS is

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.800
working with tags for cost allocation.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.810
So let's spend a couple minutes just chatting about that.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.620
What are cost allocation tags? Well, cost allocation tags allow

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.910
Cost Explorer to break down your billing report by tag. We can

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.020
map tags to different departments,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.690
business units, or other cost centers inside your organization.

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.420
Maybe you have cost centers based on region, divisions inside

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.110
the company, or based on individual projects.

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.870
When working with cost allocation tags, we can use the AWS autogenerated

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.520
tags, such as createdBy, and we can also use user‑defined tags for cost

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.710
allocation tagging. Cost allocation tags are not enabled by default. They

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340
have to be activated. And once activated,

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.240
you'll start see your bills broken down based on tags.

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.450
Now you might just use the AWS cost allocation tags,

16
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.960
but most of us want to use cost allocation tags to reflect our

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.900
organization's needs. To that end then, we use user‑defined tags.

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.180
These are tags that you define, create, and apply to resources.

19
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.440
Once you've created and applied tags,

20
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
they can then be activated as cost allocation tags

21
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.340
using billing and cost management.

22
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.740
You'll then see those tags using your cost allocation reports.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.340
There are a couple of things to consider. Firstly,

24
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.840
do not include sensitive information tags.

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.710
These tags are going to be displayed on all sorts reports and might be

26
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.020
available to lots of people in your organization,

27
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.010
so any information that you don't want to be shared

28
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.140
should not go into cost allocation tags.

29
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.840
If your AWS account is part of a wider AWS organization,

30
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
then use the master AWS account in your organization

31
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.750
to enable cost allocation tags.

32
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
It's the master account that your consolidated billing account, and

33
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.040
when we enable cost allocation tags through here,

34
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.980
it guarantees that our bill can be broken down based on tags.

35
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.370
Now, an AWS organization is not required to enable cost allocation tags,

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.470
so you can just enable cost allocation on a single

37
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.840
AWS account by AWS account basis.

38
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
When you initially create tags that you then want to use for cost allocation,

39
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.200
bear in mind that those tags might not appear for cost allocation to

40
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.070
use for about 24 hours. So don't expect newly created and allocated

41
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940
tags to be available for you straightaway.

42
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.610
Now, for the billing console,

43
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.640
you can perform a manual refresh, and this will speed up the process.

44
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.990
But even after you've instigated the manual refresh,

45
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.100
it will still take a bit of time for the new tags to appear in the

46
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.400
billing console. When you enable cost allocation tags,

47
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.280
they only started appearing on your cost allocation report from the point

48
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.340
you apply them. They do not appear in early reports.

49
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.550
So when you enable cost allocation tags, you won't be able to go through

50
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.140
historical reports and see those broken down based on tags.

51
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.360
They will only organize reports from the point where you enable a cost

52
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.540
allocation tag and then all reports going forward.

53
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.880
Now we've got an idea what cost allocation tags are, let's spend a few

54
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.240
minutes working with cost allocation tags through the console.

55
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.670
In this demonstration,

56
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.330
we're going to be working with cost allocation tags in AWS. We're going

57
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.440
to be working with the AWS Console, and to follow along with this

58
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.720
demonstration, you'll need your own AWS account.

59
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.620
Now we do encourage you to follow along with these demonstrations, but be

60
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.670
aware anything that you deploy to AWS can incur costs, so make sure anything

61
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.280
you do deploy is deleted when you no longer need it.

62
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.600
If you leave resources enabled and configured when you're not using them,

63
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.440
they will incur costs.

64
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.410
I'm back in the AWS Console,

65
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.140
specifically the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard. And here you can see

66
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.180
some general spending information. On the left‑hand side,

67
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.740
we can see Cost allocation tags, so let's select Cost allocation tags.

68
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.790
Two tabs here, User‑defined cost allocation tags and

69
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.340
AWS‑generated cost allocation tags.

70
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.540
As you can see, most tags are inactive.

71
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.310
If I scroll down to the bottom of the list here, we have

72
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.630
one tag environment that is active.

73
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.940
If you want to activate any of the tags for cost allocation,

74
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460
you can select a tag.

75
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.370
So let's say we select application, and then if I scroll back up, we can say

76
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.630
Activate. And we get this message so we can activate again to confirm. If we

77
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.940
select the AWS‑generated cost allocation tags,

78
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.890
we can see a couple of tags that are activated,

79
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.740
autoscaling:groupName and aws:createdBy. If you've got time,

80
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.660
just have looked through this list to see some of the

81
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.840
autogenerated tags that AWS provider us with.

82
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.160
So let's see how we can use these tags. From the left‑hand side,

83
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.570
choose Cost Explorer, and then launch Cost Explorer. So here we can

84
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.690
see more detailed billing information,

85
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.840
like current month costs and forecasted month end costs.

86
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.930
If we select Cost Explorer from the left‑hand side, and then from

87
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.050
the filters list select Tag, and here we can see the cost

88
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.930
allocation tags that have been enabled.

89
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.040
Any newly enabled cost allocation tags will take a few minutes to appear.

90
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.840
So if I select the aws:createdBy tag,

91
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.540
we get a list of identities that have created resources.

92
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.370
So if I select one of those and click Apply filter, it filters that

93
00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:03.000
apart based on that tag. And if I scroll across here, we can see that this user has spent all of 26 cents in September.
