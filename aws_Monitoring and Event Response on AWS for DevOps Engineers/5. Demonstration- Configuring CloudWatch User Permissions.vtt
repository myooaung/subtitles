00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.940
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to be working with CloudWatch logs

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.440
authentication and access control.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.440
We're going to be working with the AWS console.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.340
And if you want to follow along, you will need your own AWS account.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.850
Now we do encourage you to follow along.

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.840
But remember, anything you deploy in AWS could cost you money.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
So if you do follow along,

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.370
remember to remove what you've created once you finish experimenting

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.440
with it as some of these features may incur charges.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.940
I'm back in the CloudWatch dashboard, but things look a little bit different now.

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.260
I'm in the CloudWatch overview view, but nothing is being displayed.

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.260
If I select the drop‑down here, there are no services that are displayed.

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.100
Also, if select Log groups, we get this error, which is kind of what I expected.

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.740
The IAM user does not have permissions to view log groups in this account.

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.140
So I've logged in here with a user called GLOBOUser1.

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.050
And this user is authenticated against my AWS account,

18
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.540
but the user has not been authorized to work with CloudWatch.

19
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.740
So if I want this user to be a CloudWatch administrator,

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.480
we have to use the appropriate access controls to

21
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.640
authorize this user to work with CloudWatch.

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.520
To that end,

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600
I need to be logged in with a user account that has the permissions to

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.730
work with Identity and Access Management control.

25
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.140
So let's do that.

26
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.370
So I'm back in with my administrative user,

27
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.520
and this time I'm in the IAM dashboard.

28
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.440
I want GLOBOUser1 to be a CloudWatch administrator.

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.340
Now we can assign policies directly to GLOBOUser1.

30
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.540
We can see GLOBOUser1's user account under Users.

31
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.450
But potentially, Globomantics might have several CloudWatch administrators.

32
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.440
So instead, we'll work with groups.

33
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.780
So let's select Groups.

34
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.940
And in here, I'm going to create a new group.

35
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.240
So let's select that.

36
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.400
And we'll give the group a nice descriptive name.

37
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.640
So here, GloboCloudWatchAdmin, and then I'll select Next Step.

38
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.460
It's through here then we can attach policies to this group,

39
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.260
giving the members of the group sets of permissions in my AWS account.

40
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.550
We can use the search option to find CloudWatch AWS managed policies.

41
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.000
So in search, I'll type CloudWatch.

42
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.440
And as I do,

43
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.010
you can see the list of policies get filtered to display any

44
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.840
policy that's got CloudWatch in its name.

45
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.540
If we scroll down a little bit,

46
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.840
here we've got a few policies that might be of interest to us.

47
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.560
We've got CloudWatchFullAccess, CloudWatchLogsFullAccess,

48
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.410
CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess, and CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess.

49
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.090
So I can select one or a combination of these policies to

50
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.840
give this group and therefore members of this group

51
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.590
permissions to work with CloudWatch.

52
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.800
I want GLOBOUser1 to fully administer CloudWatch.

53
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.240
So let's select the CloudWatchFullAccess policy and then select Next Step.

54
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.540
We're shown details of the group we're about to create,

55
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.600
including a list of policies the group will have.

56
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.440
I'm happy with these settings, so I'll say Create Group.

57
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.040
And we can see the group on the list.

58
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.840
Now before we add our user to the group,

59
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.780
let's have a closer look at those policies by going to the

60
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.140
Policies section and filtering for CloudWatch.

61
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.040
So by fiiltering for CloudWatch,

62
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.760
we can see the same policies that we saw when we created the group.

63
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.470
If I select the radio button next to

64
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.540
CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess and then expand that group,

65
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.240
we can see the JSON representation of that group.

66
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.640
We can see this policy has a statement with a list of actions.

67
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.750
Remember these actions equate to APIs then the

68
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.640
holder of this policy can execute.

69
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.940
If we scroll down this policy a little bit,

70
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.740
we can see the effect is allow, and this statement applies to all resources.

71
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.590
If you have time, investigate some these managed policies,

72
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.460
select the policy, expand the policy,

73
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.140
and view the JSON information. Let's go back to our group.

74
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.840
So here we are in the GlobalCloudWatchAdmin group.

75
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.160
There's no members of this group yet,

76
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.240
so let's say Add Users to Group and select GLOBOUser1 and then Add Users.

77
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.210
So GLOBOUser1 is a member of the group, the group has been

78
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.390
assigned the AWS managed policy. So this user should have

79
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.900
access to those policy permissions.

80
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.980
Let's go back to the browser that has the logged‑in

81
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.640
user. So our user is still logged in, and we're still seeing this error message.

82
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.840
Let's try refreshing the screen. And now, GLOBOUser1 can see the log groups.

83
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.940
So now our user is not only authenticated to our AWS account.

84
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.540
This user is also authorized to work with CloudWatch.

85
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.750
Remember, if the AWS managed policies don't quite meet your requirements,

86
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.320
you can create your own custom managed policies with the

87
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.940
different combinations of actions that you need.

88
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.090
Also remember, if I wanted to limit GLOBOUser1 to a specific log group,

89
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.780
let's say the Kinesis log group,

90
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.540
we can do that using a custom managed policy and listing this log

91
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.140
group's IAM in the resource section of that policy.

92
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.540
In this module,

93
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.740
we introduced Globomantics, our customer that we will be

94
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.460
working with throughout this course.

95
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.240
We introduced you to Amazon CloudWatch and some of its key features.

96
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.140
And then we focused in on CloudWatch logs and log streams.

97
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.840
We worked through a brief CloudWatch logs demonstration before learning the

98
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.110
importance of securing access to CloudWatch using IAM users and IAM

99
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.770
policies. In our next module, we're going to be looking at how we can

100
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.790
integrate Amazon CloudTrail with CloudWatch.

101
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:28.000
So join me there, and we'll continue on our event response and monitoring on AWS for DevOps engineers journey.
