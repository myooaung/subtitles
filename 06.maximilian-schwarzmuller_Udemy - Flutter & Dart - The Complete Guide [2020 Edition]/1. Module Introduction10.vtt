00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.990
Thus far in this course, we always worked locally in our app or with that, I mean we always stored data

2
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.880
locally in the app. We never sent it to a web server or fetched it from there,

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.240
besides the image, the network image maybe. Therefore in this section, we'll have a look at how we can generally

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.690
store and fetch data in Flutter apps and how the web, sending HTTP requests is connected to that

5
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.590
and then of course we'll learn in detail how you interact with a web server from inside your Flutter

6
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.220
app, how you send HTTP requests to store data on a server or fetch data from a server and there of course

7
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:48.380
in the database, so that your data persists across app restarts, app reinstallments and can also be

8
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.960
used or the data of your app can also be used across multiple devices and therefore for multiple

9
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.730
users of your app.

10
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.160
Now of course, sending HTTP requests typically also takes some time

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.080
and in that time whilst you're waiting for something to happen or for some data to arrive, you might

12
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.220
want to show some progress indicator or some loading spinner

13
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.730
and therefore in this module, we'll also dive into how to handle that and how to update our user interface

14
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.060
whilst we're waiting for something to happen.

15
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.480
Last but not least, when working with HTTP and when sending requests, things can also go wrong if

16
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.500
we have errors,

17
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.400
if we fail to send a request, anything like that and therefore in this module, we'll also learn how

18
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.860
to handle errors, how to show error messages to the user and so on,

19
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.790
so plenty to cover. For this module, we'll use the same app, the shop app we worked on in the last two

20
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.950
course sections and attached to this lecture, you therefore find this latest snapshot

21
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.400
of that app so that you can also take that snapshot and continue with that in case you haven't followed

22
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.060
along or you simply want to start on the same state

23
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.930
as I start.
