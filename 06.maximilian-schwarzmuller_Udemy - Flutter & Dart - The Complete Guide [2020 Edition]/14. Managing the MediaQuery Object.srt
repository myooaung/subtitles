00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,680
To wrap up this responsiveness part, one additional note. Whenever you're using media

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,250
query a lot like you're doing it here multiple times in the same widget tree,

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,370
it's actually recommended that you don't use it like this but that instead, you simply store

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,000
that media

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,180
query object in a variable.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,340
So here at the start of your build method, you can simply add a new variable up here,

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,230
media query and then simply store the result of MediaQuery.of(context) in there and in all the places

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,710
below that variable where you use MediaQuery.of(context), like here in the isLandscape variable calculation

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,940
or here for defining that transaction list widget or then of course also down there where we calculate

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,490
the size of this container and then of this container, in all these places and I selected them all together

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,640
with the help of my IDE,

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,330
so in all these places, you then just want to use your media query variable. So that way, you still use

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,810
that media query but you don't recreate that object and tap into it and tap into a new object all the

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,280
time which simply costs more performance and can lead to unnecessary re-render cycles,

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,090
instead you set up one connection, get the media query data once and store that in one object and then

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,670
you reuse that object throughout your widget tree or throughout your build method here which is more

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,370
efficient and since you're in one and the same build method, this will never change whilst you're running

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,180
in that build method.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,820
So getting the value upfront at the start of the build method makes a lot of sense

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,440
and whenever this is rebuilt because the orientation changed for example, then build will run again

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,650
and therefore, you will create a new variable with a new value.

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,940
So defining it here at the beginning makes sense

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,140
if you're using it multiple times throughout the build method. Of course as you will see, if we save this,

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,050
everything still works as before.

25
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,240
So it's really just a more efficient way of getting, storing and managing your media query data.
