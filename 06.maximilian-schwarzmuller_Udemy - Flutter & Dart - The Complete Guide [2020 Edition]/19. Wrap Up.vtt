00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.990
So in this module, we worked with a lot of native device features.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.070
We finished with maps but throughout

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.860
the module, you also learned how to work with SQLite database to have an on device database for

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.300
data that you want to share

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.880
for this user on this device, obviously it's not a database you could use for data that you want to share

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
with other users because it's only running on this device but you often have data that belongs to a

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.610
certain device or a certain user

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.570
and then, you can use the SQL database if it's a bit more complex than just a token or something like

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.320
that which we stored in shared preferences earlier, SQL or this database simply allows you to store

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.600
more complex, more structured data. Besides the database and the maps,

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.490
we also had a look at working with the filesystem to store our files and specifically, to store an image

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.490
because you learned how to work with the camera, with the image picker plugin here and in general, you

13
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.160
learned how to work with plugins, how to ensure that you set them up correctly to manage permissions, to

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.610
restart the app after you added a plugin package and therefore, you hopefully gained a lot of knowledge

15
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.670
that is helpful to you in your next applications.

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.570
Now obviously, we could just scratch the surface on all these packages,

17
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.480
there is so much more you can do with maps, so much more you can do with the camera and with SQLite

18
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.320
package and therefore, the official documentation of these packages or of the Google Maps API

19
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.650
is the place where you should go if you plan on building an app that heavily utilizes Google Maps or

20
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.230
that does more advanced things with SQLite but with the knowledge gained here, you should have all

21
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.380
the fundamentals you need to build these more complex apps.
