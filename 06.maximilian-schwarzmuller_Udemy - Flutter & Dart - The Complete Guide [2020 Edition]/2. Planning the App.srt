1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,830
So just as before in earlier sections, let's plan the app we're about to build in this module.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,680
Now the app we'll be building will not be too complex, it won't have too many widgets because I really want

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:21,430
to focus on these native device features. So we will have one screen of course where in the end, I want

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,180
to output a list of places because the entire app we'll build in this module

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,090
will be all about managing great places we found.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,000
Now what makes up a place? A place should be defined as basically a title but then most importantly, an

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,750
image and also, the location, a snapshot on the map

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,840
so to say. So in this list of places, we'll have a couple of list elements of course,

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:53,050
let's say here with an image preview of the image we took, here of the title and then here of the

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,740
address of the place so that we have all that here.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:04,030
Of course we can tap such an item here to be taken to a detail screen where we maybe also show the

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:14,370
image, also show the title and the address and also give the user a show on map button here,

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,220
something like that which simply opens up a full screen map where we can then see the place on, something

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,620
like that.

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,870
So this is the idea here for the detail section,

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:29,750
of course we also need to be able to add places and for that here of course, we'll have a plus icon in

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,050
our appBar which takes us to a brand new screen of course

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,570
and on this screen here, we have a title input, not too fancy,

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,410
that's of course something we saw before but then, we'll have an image preview and next to that, a button,

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:59,480
take picture, maybe a bit more beautiful than here but we'll have such a button next to this preview

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:07,720
here and we'll also have a preview of the map snapshot or of the part of the map that shows our place

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:15,970
because we'll have two buttons here where we have a pick place button which allows us to pick a place

23
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:24,880
on the map that opens and a user location button which will auto-locate the user and take that location

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,710
as the place then,

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,970
so two different ways of choosing a place.

26
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,010
Now the app will be a bit more beautiful than what I drew here but in the end, we'll learn or you'll

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,950
learn how to work with the camera and with maps and what you don't directly see here, of course we'll

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,780
also store the data,

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:54,130
so the images are stored on the file system of our device for example so that they survive reloads of

30
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:05,380
the app and our place data in general, that will be stored in a SQL database, SQLite database

31
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,160
here on our device so that all the data is stored on the device and not on a web service.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,410
I showed you how to send data to a web service, how to make HTTP requests,

33
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,550
now we'll focus entirely on working with on device features.

34
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,360
So let's dive in.
