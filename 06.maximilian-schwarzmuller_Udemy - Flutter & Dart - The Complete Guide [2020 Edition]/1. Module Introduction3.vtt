00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.050
In the last course module, we had a thorough, a very thorough look at all the important basics of Flutter

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.050
and Dart.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.380
Now when you're building Flutter applications, things will occasionally go wrong.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.270
You'll have errors and in addition thus far, we only tested our app on an Android emulator

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.240
but in reality, you of course want to test your application also on iOS simulators and on real devices.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.340
Therefore in this module, we'll have a look at how you can run your app on different platforms,

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.920
so on Android and iOS and on real devices and how you can test your app there. We'll also have a look

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.540
at error messages because things will occasionally go wrong,

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.400
you will have some errors in your code and reading and understanding error messages and fixing errors

10
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.530
is a crucial part of development,

11
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.280
so we'll have a look at that.

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.750
And then there sometimes also are errors without error messages, because they might be logical errors

13
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.820
in your code which are hard to spot

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.150
and fix. For this, we'll have a look at the Visual Studio Code debugger which you can use and how to

15
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.560
use it to walk through your code in detail and have a look into your code whilst it is running, to really

16
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.530
understand where a problem might be stemming from.

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.210
Now that all helps us with fixing issues in our code but sometimes, the UI doesn't look the way it should

18
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.590
look or we're not sure whether we're updating some part of the UI unnecessarily and for that, you will

19
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.680
learn how to use the Dart DevTools and the Flutter inspector, which are tools that allow you to visually

20
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.890
debug your app, so understand the user interface and why it looks the way it does look and also get a

21
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.760
brief insight into how to debug or measure performance and get a feeling for that.

22
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.910
This is it for this module,

23
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.840
let's dive right in.
