There is an important value built into Dart which we hadn't had a look at yet.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.310
We had a look at string values between the quotes, at integers, doubles and so on

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.350
but what we hadn't had a look at yet is the null value.

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.920
Null simply is a value built into Dart which you can use if you might generally expect another type of

5
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.500
value,

6
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.840
let's say you have a username and that is Max

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.410
but then something in your application happens and you want to reset that to an uninitialized state

8
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.490
so to say and in such cases, you can set this to null.

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.040
This does not violate the rule or the inference of username being a string,

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.970
so just to prove this, if I would assign a number here, then actually here I would get an error because

11
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.540
a number is of course not a string, an integer is not a string.

12
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.070
Null is assignable here even though it's of course not wrapped between quotes,

13
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.540
null can basically be assigned to any type,

14
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.560
so no matter if you normally expect a string, integer, double, whatever it is, null can always be assigned

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.130
and you often assign it to reset a variable, to reset the value in a variable, to indicate that you have no

16
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.900
value yet, anything like that.

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.400
You can also use it in boolean comparisons.

18
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.600
So if you have an if check and you want to find out if username is set, you could check if username

19
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.140
is not equal to null for example. That would be something where you would also use null because right

20
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.650
now if I don't assign a value, this would for example be null, the default uninitialized state is that

21
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.330
this is null

22
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.740
so then such a check here could be useful.

23
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.130
So using null to reset values or in checks to make sure that you have a value and you're not in an uninitialized

24
00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.520
state can be very important and Dart will use it throughout this course and therefore null is a value you should

25
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.090
be aware of.
