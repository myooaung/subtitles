1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,730
There are a couple of core phases when it comes to building an app.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,430
Now of course, this here now is just my view, it's not the single correct way of building an app but it

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,530
is a way that worked for me and that I think makes a lot of sense. When you're building an app,

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,310
the first phase always is the idea phase.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,180
Now maybe you already have an idea

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,900
but even then as you will see, I'll dive deeper into this in a second,

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,310
you'll have to check a couple of things to ensure that you're really building an app that your users

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,540
want.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,650
The next step is the planning phase,

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,570
you got an idea,

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,590
now it's time to plan the app, plan some general things but also sketch the app and model your data.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,160
These are crucial parts, sketching the app means that you decide which screens you want to have, which

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,770
main widgets you'll need

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,020
and that you also come up with a design idea for colors and fonts and images you want to use and modelling

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,390
the app means that you plan which kind of data your app will use,

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,750
that also is important because you'll have to decide whether you need to store that on a database,

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,690
how that data should look like, how it should flow through your application and so on.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,850
Once all of that planning is done, it's of course time to develop

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,850
and typically, that will be the largest chunk of the time you allocate to this of course. You write your

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,270
code and that's an iterative process, which means no matter how well you planned it, you will probably

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,570
change some things there,

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,190
you will write code and then you always should test it

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,560
and based on your testing results, you will change code, fix bugs, add new features, maybe implement something

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,990
differently than you planned it because during testing, you'll find out that you're not liking it.

25
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,580
So this here, developing and testing, that's a super important part obviously.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,120
Now once you're done with that, it's time to optimize your app and

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,420
with that I mean that you explore optimization strategies,

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:58,840
so scan your code for possibilities of improving it, for example by extracting widgets, by using const

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,270
constructors, things I covered in this course and also beyond that, things which you'll learn about in

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,340
the official docs and other blog posts,

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,430
certain patterns other developers are sharing, things like that, of course always test your optimizations

32
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,990
though to make sure you're not breaking the app and they really have an impact.

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,170
Then it's time to publish the app and that also involves a couple of things, it's not just a technical

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,290
process of publishing as you will learn

35
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,130
and last but not least, maintenance.

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,830
Once your app is published, you're not done,

37
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,000
now you need to listen to user feedback, improve the app, release patches and so on.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,390
Now let's have a closer look at all these phases therefore. The idea and planning phase is kind of combined,

39
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,470
there you should decide what you want to build.

40
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,290
Now maybe you already have an idea but then you should still check what the market is,

41
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,120
which competitors do you have?

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,560
What are other apps doing?

43
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,640
What could your app do better?

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,190
Who are your users?

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,030
What are your users expecting?

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,080
What's their budget?

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,330
Where do they live?

48
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,290
Because all these things influence the app you want to build.

49
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,230
It influences how you monetize it,

50
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,000
if you plan on monetizing it, the region where your users live

51
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,990
also influences whether you want to localize your app, how important the size of the app is, how

52
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,060
fast the mobile phones or the

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,030
devices your app will run on will probably be.

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,300
So plan all of that carefully because it's super important that you build the app for your audience

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,880
and not an app just for your own personal phone.

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,150
Also decide on the core features you want or you need to offer based on the market and the audience

57
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,140
you're targeting and more.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,130
These are the core questions you should answer and on Google again, you can find a lot of discussions

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,940
there, a lot of resources that help you do that planning and there is not a single right path.

60
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,480
It always is something that takes some experience and where you might need to check something for app

61
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,110
A but not for app B

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,270
but these are some rough thoughts you should definitely have.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,930
Now thereafter, it's time to sketch your application and

64
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,770
that means that you should sign it,

65
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,540
build a wireframe model, which means that's kind of a technical layout, it's not so much about colors

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,140
and fonts, it's more about which screens do you have,

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,530
how are they connected,

68
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,240
what are your main widgets and so on.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,730
But all of course work on the design and the graphics, the look and feel of your app - Which colors do

70
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,000
you want to use? Which fonts? Which font sizes? Which images?

71
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,560
How should the app be structured? And sketch the screens and the main widgets of your app

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,270
so that you have an idea of how the screen should look like, which are the core widgets you will need to

73
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,650
build and how all of these are connected. Also consider the navigation,

74
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,630
so how users get around in your app and how data should flow through your app, which data you need on

75
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,700
which screen and that's of course tightly connected to the data modeling phase then. What are your main

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,600
data models?

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,980
Do you have products, users, shopping carts, orders, whatever it is,

78
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,720
think about that and think about the structure of these models, which fields, which properties do you

79
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,610
need in there? Plan your main classes and properties and methods

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,430
you want to have and how you want to interact between these models.

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,350
So think about data dependencies, dependencies between your data and also data sources,

82
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,940
where is your data coming from?

83
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,780
Do you want to store it in a database?

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,400
Which data do you want to store? All of it or just some data?

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,360
Which structure should it have in the database?

86
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,500
Which kind of database? Do you use your own REST API backend or do you use a service like Firebase?

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,720
These are all the things you have to answer here

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,710
so that your app, if it needs it, also uses a backend that suits your needs

89
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,530
and of course even if you need no backend, you will still probably work with some data on your app and

90
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,380
you should make sure that you have an idea of how that data is structured.

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,750
Now you can certainly also plan all of that perfectly and that really depends on your nature, what you

92
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,970
personally prefer and also if you're working in a bigger team and on a bigger app maybe. If you're

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,010
working on your own project alone, you probably need to do less planning because you can often switch

94
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,030
strategies and spontaneously implement something. If you're working in a bigger team, more planning needs

95
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,700
to be done but then you typically also don't do all the planning alone.

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,610
Still, even if you're working alone, you should have a rough idea,

97
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,720
it's absolutely okay if things changed thereafter but you should have a basic plan.

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,870
Well and then you can enter the developing phase. There you need to implement your planned layout, your widgets,

99
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,390
your screens, navigation, your data models, all of that but also as I mentioned, deviate from the plan,

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,020
it's absolutely normal to do so. When I plan applications,

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,810
I have nice plans but then when I start working on it, I decide that something would look better if I

102
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,480
would build it like this or that this data should actually be connected to some other data

103
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:47,390
even though I didn't plan that initially. So definitely deviate, your plan should be something to build

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,000
up on, not the final structure you absolutely have to adhere to.

105
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,800
Also consider creating a prototype

106
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,940
first, a dirty first version, a version which works, which has all the core features but which maybe is

107
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,230
ugly or not battle tested which still might have bugs and then improve your app

108
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,370
step-by-step.

109
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,920
The cool thing about development is that you can always work on your code, so you don't need to think

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,870
about every single widget for five days and then write the code once and you may never change it,

111
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,340
start writing code and improve it over time because that will make sure that you get something on the

112
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,790
screen,

113
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,010
you stay motivated and you find bugs faster actually

114
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,170
and that of course goes hand-in-hand with the testing phase,

115
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,810
that's not a phase after development but whilst you're developing. Test your code manually and on different

116
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,420
devices and certainly test it whenever you change something big.

117
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,680
Test it on different devices, different emulators, real devices and emulators

118
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,900
and as many devices of different screen sizes and performance as possible, also explore automated tests.

119
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,330
I didn't cover them here but automated tests are basically tests where you write code which then runs

120
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,630
to test your code.

121
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,170
That can sound strange and it doesn't replace manual testing but it can help you,

122
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,780
It is simply a way of quickly running a bunch of tests which you have pre-written whenever you change

123
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,690
something to quickly evaluate if that change breaks something immediately.

124
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,480
The official docs get you started with that automated testing and it's certainly something you should

125
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,750
dive into once you're a bit more advanced and you're feeling good writing Flutter applications.

126
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,240
Now we enter the publishing phase,

127
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,990
we're done with the app, we're happy with it,

128
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,450
we also optimized it,

129
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,310
I left that out here, goes hand in hand with testing but as I mentioned before, optimize your app, so make

130
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,170
sure you're following best practices, you're using const constructors, you're splitting your app and

131
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,340
widgets,

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,400
you're making sure that build doesn't run too often and so on, so do all that optimization and then you

133
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,290
can start publishing.

134
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,080
That means that you should add icons and make your splash screens look good, that you want to polish your

135
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,550
app so again do some final testing, some final optimizations, make sure that the app is fun to use and

136
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,850
it looks good and then set up the store page in the Google Play store or the Apple App Store and that

137
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,350
will take a lot of work.

138
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,800
You need to add images there that make people want your app, you need to add description text that

139
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,830
really make your app look good.

140
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,100
It's like a shelf in your supermarket,

141
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,870
you want your product, your app, to look attractive,

142
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,500
so definitely put a lot of work into that.

143
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,740
It's too easy to be exhausted by the development time and then you just quickly throw some images in there

144
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,630
and quickly add some text.

145
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,810
That's bad because if your app doesn't look great in the stores, people might not use it,

146
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,420
so definitely spend time on that.

147
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,590
Also again, think about your audience when you set up the store pages.

148
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,420
What does your audience want to hear?

149
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,580
Who is your audience?

150
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,860
How do you best target them with images and texts you use there? Now and after publishing as mentioned,

151
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,620
you enter the maintenance phase. Listen to user feedback and improve your app, fix bugs and fix them

152
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,710
quickly and transparently. Communicate with your users, have clear and understandable patch notes where

153
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:15,370
people understand what you changed, why you changed it and that they get a feeling that you're caring

154
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,500
and that you're working on fixing issues quickly and that you're maybe also adding new features people

155
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,160
are requesting and keep an eye on analytics and potential crashes which are reported to you, for example

156
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,670
through the basic App Store analytics or also with dedicated analytics packages which you can pack into

157
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,100
your app.

158
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,540
Now there are a lot of concepts in here which will make more and more sense the more advanced you are

159
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,760
and they are easier to use if you're more advanced,

160
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm just throwing some thoughts out there which hopefully helps you build amazing apps

161
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,720
and if you have an amazing app, don't hesitate to share it with me, share it with us here,

162
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm super interested in seeing what you're building.
