00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.600
To round up this application as it currently is before we dive into responsiveness to make it look

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.270
good on other device sizes and to make it look good on

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.650
iOS, I want to revisit this list of transactions because at the moment, I feel like it looks a bit cutoff,

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.190
both on the top and at the bottom.

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.970
Now first of all to make sure it looks better on the bottom, here on our transaction list widget, we can

6
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.400
of course do something to change the height of this container.

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.130
Keep in mind that this transaction list widget is used in our main.dart file, in our state class there,

8
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.260
here as part of this column where we have the chart and then the transaction list.

9
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.850
Now you learned what you can do to make sure that this takes all the height it can get in this container,

10
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.110
in this column I should say. We can wrap it with flexible and Flexfit.tight or therefore also just

11
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.650
with expanded. We can even wrap expanded here around our transaction list widget as we use it here or

12
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.730
since that's basically the same, inside of the transaction list around that container

13
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.500
because in both cases, it's the direct child of this column then, our widget here is just a wrapper around

14
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.380
these other widgets which are actually printed to the screen,

15
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380
so therefore it's the direct child

16
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.540
either way. I'll use it here, since we can then immediately see that it belongs to this column here and

17
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.680
therefore, I'll wrap this in and expanded widget here, my transaction list and

18
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:45.380
if we save that, we now get an error though. We get an error which basically means that it's having problems

19
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.880
expanding here

20
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.040
and why is it having these problems?

21
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.490
It has these problems because in the transaction list, we have our ListView here

22
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.690
and as you learned earlier in this module, the ListView has an infinite height and

23
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.010
that means that if we have various items, various transactions, the ListView is configured or is always

24
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.200
configured to have an infinite height and if we have transactions, we display this ListView of course

25
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.370
and previously we controlled that with height 300 here.

26
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.550
Now that height of this container is overwritten by our expanded widget which wraps our transaction

27
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.370
list and which therefore wraps this container with height 300

28
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.390
and as you also learned earlier in the course, expanded forces the child to take all the available

29
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.800
height it can get,

30
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.660
in this case in a column.

31
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.300
Now if we force a child to take all the height it can get and our child in the end is a ListView which

32
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.090
takes an infinite amount of height,

33
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.500
then we have exactly the problem we have here,

34
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.510
we're telling it take all the height you can get, all the available space and at the same time our child

35
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.360
says okay I take everything, I take an infinite amount of height and these two pieces of information don't

36
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.670
fit together, which is why we can't reuse expanded there.

37
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:12.830
What could we do though to still make sure that we take the available remaining space here with our list

38
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.740
view?

39
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.110
Well we'll later, in the next section, learn about a way of calculating how much height we have 

40
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:29.390
available and then we can manually calculate pixel values, percentage shares of that total height to use

41
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.840
a fixed height on our container here but actually derive that fixed height dynamically on the available

42
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.880
height which we're now trying with expanded but expanded works a bit differently, it's not setting a

43
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.600
fixed pixel height, it's telling the child please take all the available space. Later when we can

44
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.060
calculate a fixed height but change that fixed height depending on the viewport height, then we'll have

45
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.450
a tool to make sure that we can actually take up the available space and at the same time, not run into

46
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.010
this issue. For the moment, we can't do this and therefore, we'll have to set a fixed height and so

47
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.490
to simply have a bit of a better looking app right now, I'll set a fixed height of 400 here, which means

48
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.690
that here now this is getting cut off a bit further down and we can kind of maybe use 450 and of course

49
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.020
this now only looks good on this device.

50
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.690
That's the problem here

51
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.440
and if we had a bigger or smaller device, it would not look good but that's exactly what we'll tackle

52
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.740
in the next course section where we will actually not hardcode this to find a value that works for this

53
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.700
device but where we can exactly calculate this for all kinds of device screens. Still, for this device, this

54
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.940
now looks better and I hope it's clear or I could convey what the issue here is with expanded and the

55
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.750
ListView. With that, I think the app is looking good, we can certainly work with that,

56
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.930
let's add one other transaction to see whether everything is working correctly with our changed list

57
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.680
height here. If I do this,

58
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.720
yes we can scroll here,

59
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.900
we can scroll the overall page of course, that only scrolls the size of the chart in this bottom container

60
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.250
however and in that container,

61
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.200
we then have an extra scroller with our list.

62
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.850
So that is all looking good, is all working great as it should,

63
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.510
we can delete items that's also working. With that,

64
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.000
that's it for this module and we'll next have a look at how we can adjust this in a more flexible way

65
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.910
to different device sizes and to different platforms.
