00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
Over the last course lectures, you learned all the core basics

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.780
you need to build amazing Flutter apps and actually, already a bit more than just the basics.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.340
After all, we had a look at responsiveness and writing adaptive applications. So that is all super important

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.790
and gives you a solid set of skills to build Flutter apps.

5
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.530
In this module here, we'll dive a bit deeper into Flutter,

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.420
have a look at some behind the scenes stuff, like for example how exactly it rebuilds the user interface

7
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.110
and what you can do in your code to make that more efficient

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.720
and we'll also have a look at a couple of other advanced features or niche features which we need in

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.320
Flutter apps from time to time. In detail,

10
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.930
just as I said, we'll have a look at some of the under the hood stuff Flutter does, which is of course

11
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.410
not directly important for you because you don't have to manage that under the hood stuff yourselves

12
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.630
but it's (a) always good to know how the tool you're using works and (b) as you will learn, there are some

13
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.810
things you can and should maybe think about when writing code because you can then improve the way your

14
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.730
app works and most importantly, improve the performance of your application.

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.820
That's the transition to the second block or the second important concept or topic we'll have a look

16
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.930
at

17
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.260
in this section, writing good Flutter code. We'll explore what good code means and then what you can do

18
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.490
to improve your code quality and make sure that your app runs good and runs performant but also that

19
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
that your code is readable and maintainable.

20
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.010
And last but not least, throughout this module, we'll also have a look at a couple of advanced Flutter and Dart

21
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:58.070
features, advanced not really in the sense of super difficult to use but niche

22
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.060
or not always required but good to know and good to be able to use to improve your apps and to really understand

23
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.500
what's happening in your apps.

24
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.820
So this is a very important module as it will take you from I know how to write a basic Flutter app

25
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.220
to

26
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.450
I know what Flutter does and I can now use that to write more advanced apps.

27
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.050
Of course, it's by no means the end of the course, we'll have a look at a lot of other core Flutter features

28
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.000
but this is now another important step in your journey to becoming a Flutter developer.
