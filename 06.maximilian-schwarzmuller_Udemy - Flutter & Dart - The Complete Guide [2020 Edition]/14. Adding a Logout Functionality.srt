1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,050
Let's now come back to that auto login and also to the logout functionality. You just saw that I was logged

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,120
out automatically when I tried to go somewhere when my token expired and that happened because in the

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:23,140
main.dart file, I'm already checking isAuth to decide which home screen to render and this simply returned

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,850
false

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,360
when I tried to switch my page because the home screen is always something which is checked when you

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,760
navigate somewhere, it always checks whether you want to go to the no home screen and if it then finds

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,900
that you're going to a named route in the routes table, it will go there

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,340
but the home screen is always checked as well and that is why the AuthScreen was actually rendered.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,240
This is not entirely the flow I want though.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,640
I don't want to go to a different page when I try to navigate, when my token expired, I should immediately

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,130
be logged out and the auth page should pop up in my screen basically instead of waiting for me to navigate

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,110
somewhere.

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,420
In addition, I want to have a logout button here in the drawer so that I can manually logout

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,180
and then of course on the other hand, we want to make sure that when the app restarts, we actually automatically

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,100
log the user in as well.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:21,620
With all that, let's go to the auth.dart file and let's add a logout method as a first step maybe.

17
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:29,140
So here, I'll add a new method which will not return anything which I'll just name logout and have a

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,800
very simple setup here. I'll basically reset the token to null, I'll reset the userId to null and I'll

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,480
also set the expiry date to null, everything is reset and thereafter we call notify listeners.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,930
Now we can trigger that logout method from inside our side drawer. So here in the app drawer, we can add

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,720
a new entry for logging out and for that, I'll just scroll to the end,

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,100
copy that divider list tile set up here and add one more of that and here the icon I want to use is

23
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,160
exit to app which is this exit icon as a text, we can display logout.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:16,770
And then here of course, I'll not use the navigator like that and instead here, we can simply use provider

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,870
of and

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,900
now I want to reach out to my auth class,

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,520
so therefore we need to import providers of the dart here and with that imported,

28
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,380
I also need the provider package to use my provider here and get access to the auth object.

29
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,750
So here, package/provider/provider.dart also needs to be added and with that app both added, down there I

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,780
can reach out. Don't set up a listener, I'm not interested in listening, I just want to be able to call

31
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,860
the logout method there to clear all my data. Let's give that a try, let's refresh and then let's login

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,060
and give logout a test run.

33
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:05,450
So here, quickly login like that,

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,210
here I am

35
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,910
and now let's open that drawer and let's click logout and we're back on that screen, which looks good

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,980
to me. So that's working but if you have a look at the debug console, we also get an error there and that

37
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,420
error here is coming from a modal scope.

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,900
Essentially the problem here is that the drawer was still open and this hard switch of widgets led us

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,510
to this error. The solution is simple,

40
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:43,180
you simply also call navigator of context pop here to close that drawer and if we do that, do a full

41
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,560
restart and therefore the debug console is also cleared, let's try that again,

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,740
let's login here and then open the drawer, logout and we have no error.

43
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,820
So that's an important change here that we close the drawer as well. With that we can logout,

44
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,040
now the next step is to make sure that we automatically logout if our token expires instead of waiting

45
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,770
for the next navigation to then accidentally logout.
