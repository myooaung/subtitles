00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.400
So let's install Flutter then and the installation actually differs between MacOS and Windows. For the rest
1

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.100
of the course,
2

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.830
the code we write and so on will be the same, but here for the installation it differs.
3

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.330
So therefore in this video we'll set up Flutter and all the surrounding packages and dependencies
4

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.790
we need for Mac.
5

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.790
And in the next video we'll do the same for Windows.
6

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.340
So if you are a Windows user you can simply skip this video and if you are a Mac user you can skip the
7

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.300
next video.
8

9
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.330
So let's proceed with the Mac setup then. On flutter.io
9

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.980
you can simply click on "Get started" and then choose "Install" on MacOS.
10

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.600
By the way if you are on Linux the steps are pretty much the same but you can also click on "Install
11

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
on Linux" to see them in detail.
12

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880
And that's in general what I would recommend.
13

14
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.220
Go through these steps in detail.
14

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.730
The good thing is you can read them here and I strongly recommend following along here and reading these,
15

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.210
whilst you also watch this video or whilst you are going through the installation process, because a)
16

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.550
some tiny steps could change over time and b) this is a great way of resolving issues since there might
17

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.720
be something you overlook in the video which you can then simply read about in this article.
18

19
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.540
So let's continue.
19

20
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.170
First of all let's check the system requirements.
20

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.630
Well we need the operating system MacOS obviously, enough free space on our disk and then we depend
21

22
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.320
on these command line tools which actually should all be available by default.
22

23
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.190
Now Git might not be, so it is a good idea to download it before you get started.
23

24
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.590
You can simply search for "Git" on Google and then actually pick that first or actually that second
24

25
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.950
link to find the downloads page.
25

26
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.380
And there simply choose MacOS or Linux depending on where you are on and then the download should start
26

27
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.610
automatically.
27

28
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.370
If it doesn't you can simply click here obviously and this will download an installer through which you
28

29
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.220
can simply walk to install Git,
29

30
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.650
which is a version management system, on your machine.
30

31
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.740
Now you don't need to use that version management system but Flutter uses it behind the scenes,
31

32
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.010
this is why you need to have this available.
32

33
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.950
Once you got Git installed with the help of that installer you can download, which I showed you a second
33

34
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.510
ago,
34

35
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.370
you can proceed with these steps. And the next step is to actually download Flutter.
35

36
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.710
Now at the point of time that I'm recording this the latest version is 0.3.2 beta,
36

37
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.680
chances are that when you're watching this, there's a higher version available, but the code we write
37

38
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.270
will still be the same.
38

39
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.510
So download the latest version you're seeing here of course.
39

40
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.900
Now I'll go with this one, simply download it to your machine and this can take a while as you can see it's
40

41
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.890
quite a big file.
41

42
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.130
So I will jump forward to the point of time where this already is downloaded.
42

43
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.140
The installation just finished for me,
43

44
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.570
you can now simply unzip this and you can do that with the command you see here.
44

45
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.130
Or simply well click on that downloaded file, simply open it in the folder where it was downloaded,
45

46
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.460
simply click on it down there and then unzip this.
46

47
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.750
Now this can take a couple of seconds of course since it's a rather big file.
47

48
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.080
Once it is unzipped you have this Futter folder and now you should copy this somewhere where you want to
48

49
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.860
store this.
49

50
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.810
Now this Flutter thing here is an entire toolset,
50

51
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.410
it's the SDK,
51

52
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.670
the software development kit you need for developing Flutter apps.
52

53
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.570
It includes a lot of dependencies Flutter needs,
53

54
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.580
so this is really a central package a program you should store in your machine and you can copy it wherever
54

55
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.530
you want on your machine.
55

56
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.390
Now I got that tools folder where I want to have it so I'll just drag it over there.
56

57
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.290
And now with Flutter added to that folder we can proceed with well the installation or with using it.
57

58
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.210
So the Flutter tool is actually a tool we execute from the command line.
58

59
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.540
Therefore we need to add it to our path.
59

60
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.240
The path is basically a global variable which ensures that the Flutter program, or which ensures that
60

61
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.700
any program, can be accessed through the command line. And we wanna configure the Flutter program to be
61

62
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.870
found there.
62

63
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.440
Now to found there we could execute this command in the command line if we navigated into the newly
63

64
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.250
created Flutter folder or we do something which is seen a little bit further down the article.
64

65
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.930
Here we update our path permanently.
65

66
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.190
Now how does that work.
66

67
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.230
For that you should go into your user folder and there,
67

68
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.020
you need to turn on the setting to see hidden files.
68

69
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.630
You should then see that bash profile file.
69

70
00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.590
Now you can simply open that with the normal text edit app or with any text editor of your choice.
70

71
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.250
If you are using the text edit app, then just make sure you're viewing this in plain text mode not in rich
71

72
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.420
text mode.
72

73
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.850
So if you open this then, let me make it a bit bigger,
73

74
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.430
you can edit this file and this basically configures path settings for your terminal for your command
74

75
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.830
line tool on Mac or Linux.
75

76
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.190
Now we want to add something here.
76

77
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.880
We want to add this line which you can find in the installation steps.
77

78
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.220
Simply add it at the bottom and we need to replace this part here with the actual path,
78

79
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.870
the folder path to the Flutter tool on our machine.
79

80
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.160
Now that of course depends on where you dragged it.
80

81
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.780
For me it can be found under users,
81

82
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.910
then my username,
82

83
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.780
then there is a development folder and then there I created a tools folder. And again you really have to
83

84
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.500
pick your path there where you dragged that Flutter tool. You can view that also by clicking on get info here,
84

85
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.180
then you can see where it's found.
85

86
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:13.980
In my case users or username, development, tools. With that simply save that file and thereafter open
86

87
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.370
your normal terminal app on Mac or Linux.
87

88
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.270
Once you did open it, you should be able to run flutter doctor.
88

89
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.740
Now this is a tool which will also check if you need to do something to make Flutter work and it should
89

90
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.860
at least do something,
90

91
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.650
If you set up your Flutter installation correctly.
91

92
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.490
By the way the fact that my installation is 30 days old, we can ignore that here because we know we
92

93
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.030
just downloaded the latest version, 0.3.2 in my case, so this is all fine.
93

94
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.950
Now this is already looking quite good here because I actually have a decent setup.
94

95
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.920
I'll still walk you through the remaining steps here though.
95

96
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.320
So we updated our path,
96

97
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.690
we now ran flutter doctor too.
97

98
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:05.610
Now what we need to do is we need to configure our system to be able to build iOS and/or Android apps.
98

99
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.430
For that,
99

100
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.750
if you want to build iOS apps, if you want to test your app on iOS and ultimately build it for that
100

101
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:21.230
platform, you need to install X-Code which is Apple's development IDE but also an absolutely required tool
101

102
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.940
for building iOS apps even if you use Flutter and no native code for that.
102

103
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:34.260
So install X-Code by downloading it from the Mac App Store. And once it got installed you need to make
103

104
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.290
sure that you can use to so-called X-Code command line tools. And this can be done by simply copy and
104

105
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.830
pasting this command into your terminal so you can simply run this.
105

106
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.600
You might be prompted to enter your password there.
106

107
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.620
And then it might or might not do something depending on whether you already configured this.
107

108
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.530
It might prompt you to accept the license.
108

109
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:04.640
Once you've completed this step you can continue to step number three and execute this command to accept
109

110
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.470
the license agreements of X-Code build, which is the build tools we're going to use.
110

111
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:15.360
Now here you can simply scroll to the bottom which can be sped up by hitting space a couple of times.
111

112
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.630
And then type agree down there.
112

113
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:26.220
Now with that out the way we can continue and we can bring up the iOS simulator which simply is an iPhone
113

114
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.250
running on our machine.
114

115
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.430
It can be started with this command,
115

116
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.430
you could also start it from within X-Code by the way.
116

117
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.840
But I will simply start it with this command:
117

118
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.220
open -a
118

119
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.590
Simulator with a capital S.
119

120
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:47.140
And now what this should do is, it should bring up this iOS simulator here.
120

121
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.710
Now this is the device running.
121

122
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.800
You can change the type of phone you're emulating here from that menu device and then iOS and then
122

123
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.580
choose your favorite device here.
123

124
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:04.260
And now with that up and running, what you can do is, you can start your Flutter app by running flutter
124

125
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.350
run in the command prompt.
125

126
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.310
Now for that we need a Flutter app though right?
126

127
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.700
Because right now we only install Flutter but we haven't set up a Flutter app, a new project.
127

128
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.940
So let's quickly do that and for that you should first of all navigate into the folder where you want
128

129
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.510
to create your Flutter app.
129

130
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:28.530
Once you navigated into that folder where you want to create your own you Flutter project run flutter
130

131
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.520
create and then the name.
131

132
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.190
For example first underscore_app. Important:
132

133
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:40.350
This project name must not contain dashes or whitespaces, it should be using underscores instead.
133

134
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.490
Or be one word only. Hit enter,
134

135
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.950
and this will now set up a new Flutter project in that specified location and use subfolders which hold
135

136
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.930
that project to be precise.
136

137
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:59.110
Could take a couple of seconds and once it's done you can navigate into this newly created folder.
137

138
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:04.150
In my case it's named first_app and then hit flutter run.
138

139
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.720
Enter this.
139

140
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.350
Hit enter and with the iOS simulator up and running,
140

141
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:16.540
you should be able to see that Flutter app on that iOS simulator momentarily. The first built or the first
141

142
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.130
time you run
142

143
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.380
this can take a couple of seconds longer by the way.
143

144
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.710
Here we are, now important keep that process running.
144

145
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.490
Don't quit it.
145

146
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.370
You could quit it with CTRL + C, but you want to keep that running so that you can always rebuild
146

147
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.950
your project and instantly ship that new version to the device whenever you change something in your
147

148
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.120
code.
148

149
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:45.130
So with that you should see this, your first Flutter app running on the iPhone. And you can hit that plus
149

150
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.010
button to see a counter that is incremented.
150

151
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.890
This is an app the Flutter tool created for you,
151

152
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.900
we of course didn't write any code yet.
152

153
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.620
Now that's cool and we will actually edit this a little bit to see how we can well work with that first
153

154
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.520
Flutter app.
154

155
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.480
But obviously we all want to build for Android right?
155

156
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.530
So let's go back to these installation
156

157
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.510
docs, we're done with the iOS setup, the simulator at least.
157

158
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:16.800
Now if you wanna deploy to a real iOS device, you can follow these steps here.
158

159
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:24.400
You will essentially need to plug in your real iPhone, then also again execute these steps to install homebrew
159

160
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.810
and then these extra tools which you need to be able to ship your app to a real iPhone. And once are
160

161
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.710
done with that.
161

162
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:39.460
You can continue with these steps and you will need to do some tweaking in X-Code to be able to ship
162

163
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.530
your app to your real device.
163

164
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:48.460
Now that is something I'll come back to later in this course, when we will actually test this on a real
164

165
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.350
device and also deploy the app at the end.
165

166
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.070
But again feel free to already go through these steps,
166

167
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.760
they're really simple if you want to run this on a real device.
167

168
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.750
Now I'll move on to Android for now and for that we will need Android Studio just like X-Code is the
168

169
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.340
official ID and contains all the built tools for iOS apps,
169

170
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:16.450
Android Studio is the same for Android. So click that link to be forwarded to the download page of Android
170

171
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.240
Studio.
171

172
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:24.160
And on that page it should automatically present you the MacOS download, so you can simply hit download
172

173
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.260
Android Studio here, accept these license agreements and well then download.
173

174
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.870
Store this in any folder of your choice.
174

175
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.040
And this again is a little bit of a bigger file.
175

176
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.330
So let's wait for this to finish before we continue.
176

177
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.140
Now the download did finish.
177

178
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.900
You can then simply execute that file and it will launch an installer for you.
178

179
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:54.560
Let me also close the iOS simulator here. Now and that Android Studio installer is pretty straightforward on
179

180
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.010
Mac just drag that into that applications folder.
180

181
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:06.630
And this will copy or install that tool in that folder which again will take a couple of seconds since it
181

182
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:13.560
also unpacks that folder. And once you are done with that let's go back to the Flutter installation
182

183
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.640
page.
183

184
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.180
When you're done with that you need to start Android Studio and go through the set-up wizard to configure
184

185
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.370
everything and install everything you need.
185

186
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:29.280
Now you could also be getting a security warning that the opening of Android Studio was blocked because
186

187
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.170
it was from an
187

188
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.460
well from the internet not from an identified developer.
188

189
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.260
You can then open it anyways
189

190
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:43.910
through the Mac security and privacy settings and ultimately this should bring up this set up wizard.
190

191
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.650
Now click next on the first screen, click custom on the next screen.
191

192
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.190
Next
192

193
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:54.650
again, now here you can choose your editor theme you want to have the light or dark one.
193

194
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.970
You don't need to use Android Studio as an editor for this course.
194

195
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.400
And actually I won't.
195

196
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.390
But you can.
196

197
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.960
So I'll go with darcula here, but that is totally up to you.
197

198
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:11.300
Now on the next screen make sure to also check Android Virtual Device here under the installation options.
198

199
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.470
Default installation
199

200
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.870
path then should be all right.
200

201
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.100
Click next and finish.
201

202
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:25.460
And now this will download a bunch of things and install all the SDKs and tools you need to develop Android apps
202

203
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.610
and these will be used behind the scenes by Flutter,
203

204
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.060
which is why we need them.
204

205
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.170
So let me fast forward until this is also done now by the way,
205

206
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.900
this can take a couple of minutes.
206

207
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.950
So don't worry if it takes a bit longer.
207

208
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.450
It downloads and installs quite a lot of things.
208

209
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.230
Now the setup finished for me here so let's click Finish and thereafter you can click on open an existing
209

210
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.080
Android Studio project.
210

211
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.110
Now they're simply navigate to the folder where you just created your new Flutter app.
211

212
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:05.650
In my case that's that first_app folder, select the whole folder and click Open. And this will
212

213
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.450
bring-up Android Studio with that project open.
213

214
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.350
Now when you open it for a first time it will actually scan that folder.
214

215
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:20.760
So let's wait for this to finish and it should actually suggest you two things down there.
215

216
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:26.860
It finds something about a plug in and there you can simply expand this and click on configure plug ins.
216

217
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.720
It actually also shows you something about the Dart files,
217

218
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.170
we ignore this for now.
218

219
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.550
So now choose that Flutter plug in and click OK and thereafter click
219

220
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.660
yes to also install install that Dart plugin for which it's asking up there.
220

221
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.090
Thereafter simply restart.
221

222
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:54.950
Now once you restarted you may get a message at the bottom here regarding ID and plug in updates if
222

223
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.090
you don't that's fine too.
223

224
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.710
In my case I do get one.
224

225
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.860
So I'll simply update now to install the latest versions of all the SDKs and build tools I might need,
225

226
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.650
and that again will get downloaded which again will take a couple of seconds.
226

227
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.680
And now with all that done let me click Finish here.
227

228
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.640
And now this is our Flutter project,
228

229
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.470
now I will open this in a different IDE where it's also a bit easier to read in a second.
229

230
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.090
For now we won't work on that code here.
230

231
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.740
Instead let's run this on an emulator.
231

232
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.610
For that,
232

233
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:33.820
we can simply go to Tools and then AVD Manager, that stands for Android Virtual Device.
233

234
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.240
Let's open that tool.
234

235
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:42.570
And here I actually got some pre-configured devices you should at least have one that Nexus or some
235

236
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.190
other device which is created with the installation.
236

237
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.640
You can always create a new virtual device by clicking that button here at the bottom and then
237

238
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.870
you can choose which device you wanna use, let's say the Pixel 2. Continue, choose your API version.
238

239
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:04.650
Now typically the highest one is a good choice or the one selected by default I should say not necessarily
239

240
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.540
the cutting edge one but this one click next.
240

241
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:18.060
again. Now here on emulated performance you should choose the hardware emulation for a faster emulator.
241

242
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.110
The other settings should be fine,
242

243
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.820
simply hit finish.
243

244
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.360
And this should create that new emulator and you can then start it by clicking on that play button on
244

245
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.200
the very right here.
245

246
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.610
Now it will bring up your Android emulator.
246

247
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.750
Now we can of course use that emulator to run our Flutter app there
247

248
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:42.840
too. And to run it what do we need to do is to go back to that command line where we previously already
248

249
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.850
ran it on the iPhone and repeat that flutter run command.
249

250
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.950
If you still got the old one running which you probably don't have if you shut down the old simulator
250

251
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.010
you can always quit the running process with CTRL + C.
251

252
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.040
So let's hit flutter run to run it on our Android emulator,
252

253
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:08.160
once that emulator did boot up. And it will built the project with the help of the Android SDK that was
253

254
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.470
installed together with Android Studio.
254

255
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.810
And that first built process can again take a couple of seconds.
255

256
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.120
Subsequent ones will be faster and now it should be up and running.
256

257
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.030
Let's do it.
257

258
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.990
And there it is.
258

259
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.080
This is our device and this is our Flutter app and we can click the plus button to increment this counter.
259

260
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.860
Awesome.
260

261
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:34.320
So this is how we install Flutter and run it on both the iOS and Android emulators.
261

262
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.050
Now if you want to run on real devices you can follow the steps outlined in the documentation.
262

263
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.960
But of course we'll also run together on the real device later in the course.
263

264
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.150
For now let's focus on the editor with which we're going to work on this code.
