00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.600
So time for some styling,

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.240
let's add some padding around the GridView. That's pretty easy because the GridView itself has a padding

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:20.010
argument and there, you can pass good old EdgeInsets.all maybe of 25 to add a padding of 25 in all

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.710
directions around the GridView and we can add const here to again make sure that this never is rebuilt.

5
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.750
With this simple change,

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.490
now we have some spacing around our categories, which doesn't look too bad. As a next step, I want to

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.860
work on a general theme and also bring in my own font. For this in the project,

8
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.900
I'll first of all add a new folder, assets

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.360
and again that's just one possible way of naming this. In there,

10
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.750
I'll add a fonts folder and attached, you find a zip file with some fonts where I'll use some of them

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.820
in this module.

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.160
So simply drag and drop these extracted fonts in there, as you see again, I got two different fonts here,

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.090
Raleway and RobotoCondensed in various versions, in a bold, very bold version, regular version and so

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.350
on

15
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.870
and as you learned we now need to register these fonts in a pubspec.yaml file in order to use them.

16
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.080
So in the pubspec.yaml file, you can stroll to the area where you have some dummy fonts code set

17
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.760
up already

18
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.380
and now we can adjust this for Raleway for example, which is one of the fonts.

19
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.250
It can be found in these assets/fonts folder and there, we have a regular version of it but we'll

20
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.880
also have a bold and very bold, a so-called black version of it.

21
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.500
So that's the normal version but then we also have assets/fonts/Raleway-bold here

22
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.560
and that will have weight of 700 and now we can copy that and add it one more time

23
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.410
but now we can point at Raleway-Black.ttf which is another file we have in there and Raleway-Black

24
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.090
gives us a font with a weight of 900, which is even bolder or thicker than this one.

25
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.480
Now that's one font,

26
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.540
let's copy it and add another one,

27
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.160
make sure you got the indentation correct here by the way, in case you're not sure, you can always download

28
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.950
my source code which is attached to multiple lectures per module and always to the last lecture of each

29
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.190
module to compare my pubspec.yaml file with yours for example because indentation really matters

30
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.810
in this file and can mess up your application if it's wrong.

31
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.380
And with that, let's add the second font, RobotoCondensed

32
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.450
and there, we also go to the assets and fonts folder but then it's named RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf

33
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.600
and then we also have a bold version there,

34
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.480
we also have a light version there,

35
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.210
so let's add light here. For light,

36
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.450
the weight is 300 and we have yet another version,

37
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.740
so let's copy this one and that's actually the italic version and there, we have no weight but we

38
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.500
have a special style, the italic style.

39
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.660
So these are now all the fonts registered,

40
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.320
now we can start using them and let's start using them in the main.dart file. In there,

41
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.680
we set up our theme and right now the theme is pretty simple, it's just the blue color. Of course,

42
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.640
I'll leave it totally up to you which theme you want to use.

43
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.240
I however will not use blue as a primary swatch but pink and as an accent color, I will go for amber

44
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.330
because I think that pink-amber combination really doesn't look that bad. I'll also change the canvas

45
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:49.580
color to a custom grayish look from the RGBO constructor here on color and there, I will use

46
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.610
values 255, 254, 229 and 1

47
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.940
and of course, these are just some colours I came up with,

48
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.750
you can definitely adjust this and tweak this to your personal likings.

49
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.090
I want to set a default font family of Raleway, that's one of the fonts we added

50
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.890
and I also want to set up a general text theme here.

51
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.240
For that,

52
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:26.040
I'll use theme data light and then access the text theme there and then use copy with here, to again replace

53
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.180
some parts of the default text theme with my own settings.

54
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.770
Now you can always change whatever you want to change of course,

55
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.830
I want to change my body here,

56
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:46.350
both body1 and body2 to a text style where I override the color to a different color,

57
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.490
basically an almost black, very dark grey, with values of 20, 51, 51 and 1 used here in the RGBO

58
00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.080
constructor and besides body1, let's do the same here for body2 and it's pure cosmetic of course,

59
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.050
you don't have to do that.

60
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.490
And I also want to adjust the title here and give that a text style, where I set the font size to let's

61
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:20.360
say 24 pixels and the font family to RobotoCondensed which is that other font we added. With

62
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:30.180
that, back in the category_item.dart file where we have a single item in our grid, for the title here, I want

63
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.690
to set this style to theme of context, getting access to the global theme,

64
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.320
textTheme.title to use my general title style for this title. Now since we added a font, quit your

65
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:59.420
running development process or your running app with this red square and simply restart it without

66
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.850
debugging, also here with start without debugging, I just use the shortcut to bring it back onto the

67
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.410
device but now with a new app bundle that includes the font files and with that, we should hopefully see

68
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.270
our new colors and new fonts in effect there.

69
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:21.690
So let's wait for that to finish and I'd say this doesn't look too bad. Of course, feel free to tweak

70
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.150
this to your requirements but I'm quite happy with that, though

71
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.510
there is one thing which I do want to change, is maybe bring down that title text theme a bit to 20

72
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.680
pixels instead of 24 and instead add a font weight of FontWeight.bold here, to make it a bit bolder,

73
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.130
yes I think that looks quite decent.

74
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.310
So with that, we have our categories here,

75
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.910
we have our categories screen set up. Now of course, we're all here because we want to be able to tap

76
00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.520
on a category and then go to a different screen where we can see the recipes for that category.

77
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.170
So how do we make that work?
