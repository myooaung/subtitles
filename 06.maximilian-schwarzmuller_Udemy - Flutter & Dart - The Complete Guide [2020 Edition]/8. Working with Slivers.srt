1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:08,530
Besides the hero animation, there's another kind of animation or behavior you might know from some applications

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:16,660
and that is that you don't always have an appBar like this right from the start but only once you scroll

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,830
down on the screen,

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,460
the let's say image here becomes the app bar, so there's a nice animation between the image and the app bar

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,730
and that's also something which is fairly simple to implement with Flutter and I want to implement it

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,130
here on the product detail page. For that, let's go through the product detail page and in there,

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:46,600
the first step is that you replace your SingleChildScrollView here with a custom scroll view because

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,840
you basically need more control over how scrolling is handled because different things will now be scrolling

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,120
or we need to do different things when we scroll,

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,170
we need to change that image into the app bar, so kind of transform the image to the app bar and of course

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,910
that should be smoothly animated.

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,990
Now that sounds super complex but again, Flutter has got you covered.

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,660
We don't set up an appBar anymore because instead, we'll now manually animate a widget from our body

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,920
into the appBar over time and the custom scroll view here actually doesn't take a child but our list

15
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,130
of slivers.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,140
Now that's a strange word, in the end slivers are just scrollable areas on the screen, so parts on the

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,790
screen that can scroll.

18
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,250
Now here, we need different slivers,

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:45,720
we need a sliver app bar which is a widget built into Flutter and we need a sliver list, sliver

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,590
list is basically your list view as a part of multiple slivers,

21
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,200
so in case your list view is a part of multiple scrollable things on a screen which should scroll

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,540
independently and where you want to have some special tricks when they scroll, then you will use sliver

23
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,060
list here.

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,200
Now let's start with the sliver list,

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:15,040
the sliver list needs a delegate that tells it how to render the content of the list. Now

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,230
please note that here, of course we have no list view but in the end that we'll just replace the column

27
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,290
here with all but the image.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,270
So let's grab the size box, this text, this size box and this container.

29
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,040
Let's cut it all from that column and then here on the delegate of the sliver list, you should use the

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,590
sliver child list delegate which you instantiate and which simply takes a list of the items that should

31
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,780
be part of the sliver list

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:50,410
and these are the items I just copied. So let's paste them in there, into this delegate object and that's

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,860
already all for the sliver list.

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,970
Now for the sliver app bar,

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,540
that's the thing which should dynamically change into the app bar,

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,190
for that you need to configure it. You give it an expanded height which is the height that should have

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,360
if it's not the app bar but the image. Now previously there, we used the height of 300, so maybe

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,730
we stick to that, use a height of 300

39
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,520
here. I'll set pinned to true which means that the app bar will always be visible when we scroll,

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,840
it will not scroll out of view but instead it will simply change to an app bar and then stick at the top

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,010
and the rest of the content can scroll beneath that and we need to define the flexible space and that's

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,200
in the end

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,870
what should be inside of that app bar

44
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:45,160
but since it's a flexible space, also how it may change. For the flexible space, you should use a flexible

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,520
space bar

46
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,380
here and now there, we can set up a title and that would be our app bar title,

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,670
so what we had in the app bar title up there,

48
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,800
let's move it down there

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,750
and also the background and

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,930
that's the part which you'll not always see,

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,670
that's the part which you'll see if this is expanded

52
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:13,570
and here, I want to have my image. So it's here where we use this hero widget with the image inside of

53
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,560
it

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,050
and with that, we can get rid of that part down there, of that child with the column and use that hero

55
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,440
widget here as a background because that is what should be visible if this app bar is expanded.

56
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,530
Now let's have a look at this, this is already all.

57
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,760
Let's do a full restart and let's wait for that to reload

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,600
therefore and now let's go to that page here and now at the moment, we can't scroll this page.

59
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,020
What you do see is of course that you see your image here and here is the title, kind of difficult to

60
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,850
read, of course you could wrap this into a container and give this a background color or things like that,

61
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,570
for now here

62
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,920
it will do.

63
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,600
I want to make sure that this page is scrollable and of course it would be scrollable if we had a longer

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,830
product description which we might have in reality, here a little hack just for us to

65
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,290
test this is that I add a sized box with a height of let's say 800, that will add a sufficiently

66
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:16,460
high box at the bottom so that we can scroll this and as I scroll this, you see that this image changes

67
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,660
to the app bar and that's this nice effect which you get out of the box because it's built into Flutter.

68
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,060
And one thing here's the price,

69
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,620
I'm not happy with that look of course, there I want to add text align and set this to text align center.

70
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,010
I need to do this now,

71
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,160
didn't have to do it before because before we had the column which centered everything,

72
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,250
now we're not having that anymore 

73
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,080
so I need to do it manually.

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,660
So this is this effect which is quite nice in my opinion and which gives us a nice look here,

75
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,540
again with only a few lines of code that had to be added.
