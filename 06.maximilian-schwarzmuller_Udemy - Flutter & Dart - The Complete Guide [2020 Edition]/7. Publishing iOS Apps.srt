1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,370
So you learned how to publish your app to Android,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,100
let's now do the same for iOS and again, in the official docs, you find detailed instructions which I strongly

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,220
recommend that you check out to have a written a step-by-step guide.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,740
Now for publishing iOS apps, you need an Apple developer account

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,010
and here, you actually now need a paid account which costs $99 a year.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,940
This is in place to make sure that only people who are a bit serious about it release apps to the App

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,800
Store and there is no way around it,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,720
so to publish to the App Store, you need such a paid account. With that account,

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,730
once you enrolled there into the Apple Developer program and links can be found here in the official

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,710
docs, you can go to App Store Connect which is the first step for setting up your app in the end. You can

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,390
also Google for App Store connect to find a direct link and then log in with your Apple ID which is

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,460
connected to that Apple Developer account for which you're paying.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:07,420
Once you did sign in there, as you can see there, you should open the app ID's page and click on plus

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,280
to create a new bundle ID. You can simply click on the app ID's link here of course to be taken to

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,860
the right page and there, go to identifiers,

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:24,530
click on the plus here and register new app ID. So click continue here, choose the platform which should

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,390
be iOS and then give it a description like great places and choose an explicit bundle ID

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,680
and now here, use that same bundle ID you're using here in Xcode.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,790
So this bundle identifier,

20
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,440
make sure you're using this here as well.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,660
Check any capabilities your app uses

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,180
and in my case, no special capabilities are required here but if you're using any of these features,

23
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:02,050
make sure you check it and then click continue and thereafter, register and that's now step number one.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,250
With that out of the way, go back to App Store Connect where we've been before and click on my apps here

25
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,230
and take on the plus icon here and new app, choose iOS as a platform and give it a name which is the

26
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,040
name that is displayed in the Apple App Store as well, as you can see here, so make sure this is a good

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:31,910
name which gets users to click on it. Choose your primary language which in my case is English here and

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,600
then choose a bundle ID here and it can take a while until your newly created ID shows up here,

29
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,770
so once it does, choose it here. You can give this an internal identifier here if you wanted to, like great

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,080
places and then click create here in the end.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,740
Now this name is unsurprisingly already used, so I'll name it great places course, of course you want to

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,220
find a name here which is not in use already and which describes your app

33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:04,230
well and with that, we created the app here. Now here again, you can fill out the details on this page to edit

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,530
how the app is listed in the App Store and how it looks like there, however we will now continue in

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,050
Xcode.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,470
You'll also find this in the official docs, there

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,160
you should now open your Xcode project, make sure that your display name and bundle identifier is set

38
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,950
up correctly. So click on your project name here,

39
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,150
make sure this is setup correctly and under

40
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,150
signing, make sure that you'll have automatically manage signing checked and regarding the

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,750
build number here, go back to your project code and there in the pubspec.yaml file,

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,600
make sure you set your version here.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,830
The part in front of the plus is the version number that will be visible to your users,

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,720
so when they go to the App Store,

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,340
that's the version 

46
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,770
of the app

47
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,260
they will see. This should of course be a version that makes sense to your users,

48
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,660
so for example if you publish a new version where you have a minor bug fix in there, maybe change this

49
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,630
to 1.0.1, this doesn't look like a huge breaking change and your users will simply see that there

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,270
is a new version which probably just fixed something minor.

51
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,590
You have a bigger change,

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,450
maybe change that middle number and if you have a large new version, maybe change that front

53
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,400
number because version 2.0 certainly looks more important that 1.0.1. So really just change a number

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,400
that makes sense for the size of the change your update brings. The number after the plus here is your

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,830
internal number and you should simply increment this with every new version you're releasing.

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,260
This should be an integer and simply use a new number here whenever you publish a

57
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,000
new version into the App Store,

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,110
that is how you should manage these versions. With all the versions set up correctly here and all the other

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,400
settings also being correct up here,

60
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,730
you can go back to your project, open the terminal there and run flutter build

61
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,850
ios and this will now build your production ready iOS application and it will automatically optimize your

62
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,170
code, shrink it to be as small as possible and sign your app for production. Once this is done, close and

63
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,280
restart Xcode,

64
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,660
so that same project in Xcode of course and now in there, as you see in the official docs, go to product

65
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,800
scheme runner and select product destination generic iOS device.

66
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:27,060
So here, product scheme runner, make sure that this is set and also make sure that product destination

67
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,510
generic iOS device is set here and with that configured, go to product and then archive which in the

68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,600
end also now bundles up your iOS application into an app bundle which can be deployed to the App

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,940
Store and wait for this process to finish and now in that new window which opens up here, select your

70
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,320
project and you can now validate your app or distribute your app to upload it to the App Store and then

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,750
continue from there and publish it from there as well.

72
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,750
Now I will not do that here but that's the next step that you can thereafter publish your app from inside

73
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,950
App Store Connect which we worked in earlier and

74
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,010
that's how you published your iOS app.
