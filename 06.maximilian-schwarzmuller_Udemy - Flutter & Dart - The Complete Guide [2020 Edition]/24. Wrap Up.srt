1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:09,170
So we added a lot of features in this module. You learned how to send HTTP requests, for adding products,

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,500
for fetching products, for updating products, for deleting products.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,460
You learned about optimistic updating and how to do that properly, by storing the old value and restoring

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,120
it if an error occurs and error handling isn't generally something I touched on.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,290
How you can do it with then and catch error or in case you're using the more modern async await syntax,

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,830
with try and catch

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,520
which is also then a thing you might want to add to ensure that your app always runs.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,520
I also show you how you can handle errors in the front-end, like here in edit product

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,810
where in the end if an error occurs, we show a dialog for example.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,450
Now of course, your imagination is the limit here and in most cases, in this course here in this module,

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,820
I didn't add error handling simply because it would consume a lot of time

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:03,350
just to repeat the same logic over and over again but definitely play around with that and add your

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,160
own error handling logic in different places to get a feeling for that. Other than error handling,

14
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,440
we of course also worked on things like showing a loading spinner whilst we're waiting for the data, to

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,180
provide a better user experience and ensure that the user knows that we're doing something, that we're

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,660
loading something.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,070
And with all of that, you should have the features you need to add HTTP functionality to any

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,210
app you're building,

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,250
by the way, no matter if you're using Firebase or not because I showed you an approach that works with

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,760
any API and not just with the Firebase API of course.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,440
So with that, let's next focus on making sure that we actually also have users in our application and

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,730
that we can sign users up and log them in and log them out and all that fun stuff.

23
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,580
We'll do that in the next course module.
