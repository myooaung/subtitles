1
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.820
So now it's really time to get started with Flutter and learn all about its details.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.910
We're pretty much done getting started, in the next course module,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.290
we'll dive into all the important basics of Flutter and you will learn all about how Flutter works, the

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.630
core widgets there,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.310
how you build user interfaces with the widgets and so on, so that will be a crucial module of course.

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.790
Thereafter we'll dive into debugging because of course things can go wrong during development and finding

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.000
and fixing errors is an important part of being a developer,

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.540
so we'll have a look at how that works in the debugging section,

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.430
before we then have a section where we dive deeper into the basics if you will, dive deeper into

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.190
available widgets, into how to style and customize your widgets, how to add more logic to your application

11
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.570
and in general, build more realistic applications.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.430
Now it is worth mentioning that all of these concepts are not just taught in boring theory but that

13
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.580
we build full apps and not just one app throughout the entire course

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
but we do have an app for the basics section,

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.470
we do have a different app for the more widget section and throughout the course, we'll have a couple

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.560
of applications,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.750
some apps only for one section,

18
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.710
some apps which are used by multiple sections to show different concepts. This also gives you the advantage

19
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.380
that if you come back to the course after a while or you want to skip certain sections, you don't miss

20
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.080
a large chunk of a project we're working on,

21
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.470
instead many sections have their own projects and therefore it's easier to get into them. Now after having

22
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.590
a closer look at styling and building more realistic widgets,

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.190
you will also learn how to build responsive and adaptive user interfaces. Responsive simply means that

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.470
you have user interfaces that look good on different device sizes,

25
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.030
adaptive means that your user interface adapts to the underlying platform,

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.350
so to Android or iOS and for example, renders different widgets or a different layout if you want to.

27
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.440
After that, you'll have a solid understanding of the core foundations of Flutter, of the fundamentals

28
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.090
if you want to call it like that and therefore, we'll then dig deeper into the internals.

29
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.180
We'll have a look at how Flutter and its widgets work internally, how the app is re-rendered

30
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.790
when something changes and how you can optimize your code to improve the performance and improve how

31
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.570
your app works. With that out of the way, it's time for a new app and a brand new topic, navigation and multiple

32
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.130
screens. Up to this point in the course, we'll always have worked on one screen only but most apps have

33
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.250
more than one screen.

34
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.540
You might have a product screen and a card screen and a user profile screen

35
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.420
and here, you will learn how to set up different screens and how to navigate between them so that you can

36
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.520
switch pages in your app.

37
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.910
It's around that time that we will also see that for bigger apps, it can get pretty cumbersome to manage

38
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.160
the data correctly,

39
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.080
the data our app or the different parts of our app needs and therefore, we'll then have a look at state

40
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.860
management.

41
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.320
This is a super important course module where we will dive into the different options you have when

42
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.790
it comes to managing data and state which is in the end just a different term for data that changes

43
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.890
you could say. How you can manage that in bigger applications, how you can pass it around effectively,

44
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.920
how you can make sure that when something changes in a certain place in your app, all places that depend

45
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
on it are updated efficiently and we'll have a thorough look at this

46
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.120
in this module and for this, we'll also start a brand new project, just as we did in the navigation and multiple

47
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.000
screens section.

48
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.350
We'll then build up on that and dive into how you can manage user input and forms,

49
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.510
so how you can fetch e-mail addresses and URLs or numbers and have the user enter such data,

50
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.600
before we then learn how to connect our Flutter app to the web because up to this point we always just

51
00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.150
worked on the device but some data needs to be stored in a database in the web and therefore here, you

52
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
will learn how to reach out to the web, how to reach out to such a database and store your data there

53
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.230
or get it from there.

54
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.720
Now most applications also need some form of authentication and therefore, it's then time to dive into

55
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.300
user authentication and learn how you can log users in, sign them up, log them out and manage their

56
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.380
session across the lifetime of your app,

57
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:28.090
really important for many applications of course. After that, we'll have a look at animations. Animations

58
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.450
are a crucial part of applications because they allow you to give the user a better feedback regarding

59
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.970
what changed on the screen and you will learn all about the built-in animation techniques Flutter offers

60
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.860
and how you can use them to create great user experiences and user interfaces. Now most native apps also

61
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.490
need access to certain device features, like the camera, maps, on device storage, things like that and therefore

62
00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.490
this is also something we'll have a thorough look at in this module then. We'll again build a brand new application

63
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.370
for this module here and you will learn how to use the device camera, take an image, store that image, how

64
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.890
to store it on the device and also how to use Google Maps or get the user's location.

65
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.000
Now sometimes, you need some native device feature which isn't built into Flutter, where you have no easy

66
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.370
way of accessing it through Flutter.

67
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.660
Now for camera and maps, that is built in but maybe you have some use case where it's not built in.

68
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.320
Well then, you will also learn how you can run native device code, so Java code for Android for example

69
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.400
or Swift code for iOS, how you can run such code and connect it to your Flutter app so that you still

70
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.750
have one project

71
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.700
but in case it's missing, it's not built into Flutter,

72
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.840
you can actually run native device code triggered from inside your Flutter app.

73
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.440
That's a really cool feature and we'll cover this in this course as well.

74
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.250
Now once all of that is done, it's of course time to publish the app and I will show you how you can

75
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.960
build and optimize your app and then publish it to the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.

76
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.770
Well and with that, we're done.

77
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.450
I'll then round up the course, show you some next steps on how you can continue

78
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.390
and actually also give you a blueprint

79
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.310
you could say, for how you can develop great apps, which different phases are involved and what my recommendations

80
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.350
regarding that are,

81
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.740
so definitely check that out as well.

82
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.460
So as you can tell, there is a bunch of content in this course. I hope you'll like it,

83
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.260
we have a bunch of apps we're building

84
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.520
and by the end of the course, you should therefore feel really confident to build amazing Flutter apps and

85
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.100
build any app you want with the help of Flutter.
