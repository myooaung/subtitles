00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.070
Now that we learned about the important basics that you need to build a good looking user interfaces

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.650
and in general, mobile apps with Flutter,

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.700
now that we had this or now that we had a look at all these basics,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.790
it's of course important that you also learn how you can make these apps and these layouts you build

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.640
responsive and adaptive

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.630
and with that, I mean that you have user interfaces or app designs that work on smaller devices, bigger

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.810
devices and different operating systems. In detail, in this module, we'll therefore have a look at what

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.340
exactly responsive and adaptive means and what it means in the context of Flutter, of developing Flutter

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.260
apps.

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.270
We'll have a look at the core tools you get by Flutter to create responsive layouts and of course, we'll

11
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.480
not just have a look at these tools, we'll actively use them to turn our existing app here which we built

12
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.480
in the last course section, to turn that into a responsive app that actually looks a bit different and

13
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.570
feels a bit different on different device sizes

14
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.720
and we'll also have a look at how we can build platform specific layouts and looks.

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.880
So with that, I don't mean that we handle different device sizes but different device types.

16
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.870
Most importantly, that you can build different UIs for Android and iOS because even though the

17
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.960
general app functionality will typically be the same, you might want a different look on the different

18
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.110
devices and that's therefore what we'll also have a look at

19
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.950
in this module.
