1
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.520
That's it for this module.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.000
Lot of content covered, lot of advanced topics, lot of behind the scenes stuff, behind the scenes functionalities

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.650
of Flutter and how it works.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.210
Hopefully, a module that helps you write clean code and understand how things work internally to optimize

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.970
your apps,

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.840
avoid bugs like here with the key and with the ListView

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.250
but of course I also know that this module can feel intimidating because you learned so many possible

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.960
optimizations and things that happen behind the scenes.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.670
Therefore always remember this point which I showed you, missing a possible improvement doesn't automatically

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.280
result in a bad or laggy app and the same is by the way true for readability and understandability.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.940
You might find code more readable if you have one large widget tree instead of using builder methods

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.800
and extracting different widgets and that can absolutely be fine.

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.710
Your approach should work for you and your team

14
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.410
and of course, you want to improve and optimize performance and you should therefore keep these patterns

15
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.210
in mind

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.230
but it's also fine to go through this module in the course and then over your app

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.810
once you're done with adding the core functionalities or to simply overlook something the first time

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.500
you're building your app and simply fix it later. So don't feel overwhelmed,

19
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.240
simply take this knowledge as a useful reference, this module here as a useful reference and hopefully,

20
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200
you understand a bit better

21
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.230
what's Flutter doing and which way behind the scenes and what you should pay attention to and what you

22
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.540
don't really have to care about.
