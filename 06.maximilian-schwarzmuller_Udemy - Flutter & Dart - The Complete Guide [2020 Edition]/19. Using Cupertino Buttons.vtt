00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.210
In the new_transaction.dart file which is where we defined these form elements,

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.870
we can also replace the text fields here with Cupertino text fields.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
There are Cupertino text fields available and on these text fields, you can also set up a bunch

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.100
of things. You can set up a placeholder text, which would be your placement for the label text here in

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.600
input decoration,

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.570
there you don't assign, so on the Cupertino text field you don't assign a decoration input decoration

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.290
object but you directly have a placeholder argument which you can use to set a placeholder text.

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.650
And in general as always, if you hit control space, you get an overview over what you can set

9
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.460
and that's quite a lot here,

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.510
just as on the material text fields, you can set auto correction, a cursor color. In some details, like

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.730
the placeholder text,

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.470
there are differences but in many places, you can basically control these text fields just as you control

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.020
the text fields on material design.

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.400
I'll not implement it here though because I rather like that material design look and I want to have

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.930
it here in my iOS app too. For the button however, for the choose date button, we can use the Cupertino

16
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380
button instead to see how we could do that.

17
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.890
So instead of that FlatButton, again we can use platform.isIOS and if that's true, I want to use

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.250
the CupertinoButton here and not the FlatButton.

19
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.800
Now important, Cupertino by default has that flat

20
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.310
look. Now here, I'm getting an error regarding platform and you also need to make sure to use the Cupertino

21
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.230
button that you import package:flutter/cupertino.dart into this file as well,

22
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.110
you need to import it into every file where you want to use Cupertino styled elements or widgets. And

23
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.440
to unlock the platform class, we need to import dart:io just as before.

24
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.720
Now we can use both

25
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.210
and now for the CupertinoButton here, you could set a color to add a background to this button if you

26
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.960
want to turn it from a FlatButton into a RaisedButton and now for this button here, we can add a child

27
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.820
and the onPressed listener,

28
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.050
we need both here on this CupertinoButton as well.

29
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.030
If I save this and I restart this app and we go back,

30
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.600
now here we have the Cupertino FlatButton.

31
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.990
Looks pretty similar to the FlatButton for Android but is the Cupertino one, as I can prove

32
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.780
if I go here on my CupertinoButton and I change the color temporarily to colors.blue,

33
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.440
if we do that, now you see we have a blue background here and that can be used as I said to also create

34
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.620
a button which has that RaisedButton look or that with background button look

35
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.910
which of course also have on iOS. Here however, I don't want to have that, I'll leave the default which

36
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.780
correctly infers the color of the text and yes, looks pretty similar but now is the CupertinoButton

37
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.290
which you can especially see if your tap on it, then instead of that ripple effect, it gets this opacity

38
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.630
which you used from iOS buttons.
