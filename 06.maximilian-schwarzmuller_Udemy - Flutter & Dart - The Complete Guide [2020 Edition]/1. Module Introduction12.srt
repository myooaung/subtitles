00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,380
In the demo apps we built thus far in this course, whenever we changed something, so whenever our user

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,850
interface changed and for example we showed a new box or anything like that, that always happened instantly.

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,840
So we clicked somewhere and something popped up or popped into the screen

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,170
and the same of course for removing stuff,

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,660
it suddenly disappeared, it suddenly was gone.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,750
Whilst we can of course do that and build the user interface like this and whilst the app technically

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,700
will work correctly, it often provides a better user experience

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,060
if you animate your things, if you transition between different widget states and with state here I

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,200
mean the thing you see on the UI, so if you transition between the different output so to say

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,450
and that's exactly what we'll have a look at in this section. You'll learn about different ways of animating

11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,870
widgets and animating different things with widgets and we'll have a look at both custom animations

12
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,620
where you have more control and using some built-in animations or some built-in helpers, helper widgets

13
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,090
that help you with certain common transition and animation patterns that are looking good out

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,490
of the box and require only minimal or no consideration to work as intended.

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,170
So let's have a look at what we can do there.
