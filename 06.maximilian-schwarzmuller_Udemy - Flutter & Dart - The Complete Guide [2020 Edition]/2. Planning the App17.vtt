00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.650
As I mentioned, we'll build an entire application in this module. We'll build this shop application, a shop

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.810
where you can both offer your own products as well as shop for products,

3
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.660
add them to a cart and then place an order.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.890
Now for that, we'll need a couple of screens and one very important screen which we'll obviously have

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.430
in this application where I also then want to have a side drawer but more on that in a second, one important

6
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.650
screen which we'll definitely need is a screen that shows all our products of this shop and there,

7
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.400
I want to have a little grid where we can have our products in there, like this, obviously we'll probably

8
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.280
have real boxes and not ugly ones like this one.

9
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.450
So we want to have that shop overview screen here in the application, where we can simply see a list

10
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.280
of the products that exists.

11
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.630
I also want to add a feature where we can favorite products with a little heart icon which we can tap 

12
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910
and if we tap it, it gets filled

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.920
and then here at the top, I also want to have a filter, some icon which allows me to set a filter to only

14
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.740
show favorite or all products.

15
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
So this little feature here, so that we can filter our products and save them as favorites,

16
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.210
that's also something I want to add to this shop and other than that of course, if we tap on a product

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.380
item here, we should be taken to a brand new screen and on that screen here, where we'll have a back button,

18
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.760
on that screen

19
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.660
I want to show the image here,

20
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.610
probably the title of the product

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.920
and then of course, the description text and so on.

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.790
So simply the detail page of every product we have in the shop.

23
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.560
Now one other thing we'll have in the shop is of course a shopping cart. So up here,

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.900
I want to have that cart

25
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.390
icon here, another option in my menu up there

26
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.330
and when we press that cart icon here,

27
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.420
of course I want to go to a new page where I see all cart items.

28
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.770
Now of course, for that we need to be able to add items to the cart and adding items to the cart should

29
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.360
also be possible, either from inside the detail page here where we have an Add To Cart button or directly

30
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.110
here, we can decide how we want to do that

31
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.790
but of course I want to be able to add items to the cart and when they are in the cart, we can view them

32
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.440
here on the cart screen. On the cart screen,

33
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.960
we should have some summary at the top where we see the total amount here, total amount of items we have

34
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.550
in the cart,

35
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.160
so the sum of the values and then below that, probably a list of the individual items where we have the

36
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.850
title and then the quantity, something like this.

37
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.610
So this is the cart and obviously on that cart, we should also have some checkout button somewhere which

38
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.280
allows us to place an order for the items in the cart

39
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.360
and obviously, the cart items here should be deletable and so on

40
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.960
so we should be able to clear them from the cart if we want to.

41
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.640
So a shopping cart will be another important part of our shop,

42
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.230
other than that, of course we want to have orders and orders can be reached here through our side drawer,

43
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.570
that side drawer should allow us to go to the shop, to the orders screen and also to our products which we

44
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.860
can manage,

45
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.230
so our own products which we want to sell. Now the shop, that's exactly this page up there.

46
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.730
The orders, that will be a brand new screen here where we also have that drawer to

47
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.770
go back here to these drawer options and then in there, simply a list of the items or of the orders

48
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:59.220
we placed, where each order has of course a total sum and which we probably then can expand to see all

49
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.360
the items that were part of that order,

50
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.250
something like this.

51
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:09.930
So if we place an order here with the shopping cart, then in the end, that ends up down there in the orders

52
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.820
overview,

53
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.160
so that's also something I want to add. Now

54
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.280
last but not least, for managing the product here,

55
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.380
we'll have another screen in this application of course and that screen we also should be able to reach

56
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.560
that drawer, to go back and so on

57
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.970
and then here in manage products, for one of course, we see all the products we have

58
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.720
here with the images and then the title and so on

59
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.060
and then we have two important options.

60
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.030
One option is to edit these products,

61
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.440
so these are the products we are offering,

62
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:54.440
so our products and we can edit them or we can delete them. Deleting should probably present a prompt,

63
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.770
are you sure? So that we have a chance of avoiding misclicks

64
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.330
but other than that, pressing delete simply gets rid of the product. Edit however, just like

65
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:13.010
a plus button which I want to have here in my top appBar, that should take us to a new screen where

66
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.510
we can edit a product.

67
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:24.470
So in there, we should be able to create a brand new product where we enter a title, a description and so

68
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.710
on,

69
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.320
so that should all be possible there in the end.

70
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.730
Here we can then save this to go back and add the product both to this list here but also of course, to

71
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.700
the overall shop where it's then presented and where people can buy it.

72
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.200
This is the rough overview of the application we'll build.

73
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.430
It's a complete application as you can tell with a couple of screens and with complex interactions between

74
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.680
these screens. We're managing products for example in this screen down there,

75
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.380
then we also need products there

76
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.480
but we also need product information here in the orders screen,

77
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.960
we need it here in the detail screen and we also need product information on the cart screen and then

78
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.380
we have the cart data which we of course manage here.

79
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.070
We have the order data which we manage down there in the order screen and all these complex connections,

80
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.030
that is something we'll have to manage and why we use a different state management system in this module

81
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.420
because if we would manage all these different kinds of data in the main.dart file and in our main widget

82
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.440
there, then we would end up with a very complex main widget which we would rebuild all the time no matter

83
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.660
what changed

84
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.870
and that's simply not that great.

85
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.300
So therefore, we'll have a different state management system

86
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.460
and besides that and that's also really a core part of this section, we'll of course build a complete

87
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.090
application and we'll learn about some new widgets in there which we haven't used before.

88
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.790
So let's dive right in then.
