00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.420
That's it for this module. This module we wrote

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.290
quite some code,

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.940
we had a detailed look at various techniques and features that help you build responsive user interfaces,

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.870
most importantly, media query and that the different things you can query there and you can use there to

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.180
make sure that your app looks good on different orientations and different screen sizes.

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.330
And of course we also had a look at the adaptive, the platform adaptive features where you can render Cupertino

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.940
elements or widgets instead of material widgets.

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.260
You learned that you sometimes or often have to configure these differently and control space as well as

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.770
the official docs are of course your friend when it comes to that.

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.090
Now the cool thing is that we still are in one codebase and one project,

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.660
the downside of course is that your widgets can get rather large, like this main.dart file here.

12
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.280
Now the solution there again simply is to split your app into widgets, build sub-widgets which you can

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.740
use or if possible, build adaptive widgets like here for our FlatButton.

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.150
You sometimes also can build responsive widgets which follows the same idea,

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.090
like here the adaptive widget but which have their built-in media query to return a differently oriented

16
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.570
or different configured widgets based on the screen size. So you can be really creative there

17
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.730
and as always, splitting your app into widgets is never a bad idea, especially if you get very long build

18
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.780
functions which at some point get hard to navigate,

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.340
hard to maintain and hard to understand but the core takeaway of this module of course is to understand

20
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.520
which tools Flutter gives you to adjust your application to different screen sizes and different operating

21
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.030
systems.
