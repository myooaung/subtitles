00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,810
I will not use the Android Studio editor. though you can absolutely do that,
1

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,010
there's nothing wrong with it,
2

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,730
it's a fully fledged IDE,
3

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,420
with the Flutter plug-in you can work in it and if you want to use it you can follow along for the entire
4

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,470
course with that IDE without problems. I'll quit it though,
5

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
because I have another IDE which I like more and that's Visual Studio Code.
6

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,990
You install it from code.visualstudio.com and it's a free IDE just like Android Studio.
7

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,290
It should automatically present you the right download option for Mac and you can simply, well, download
8

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,940
it then.
9

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:46,150
And once you did download it, you will have a file that you can execute and which will walk you through the
10

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,380
installer. The installation should be pretty straightforward,
11

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,510
there's nothing special on it or nothing tricky on it.
12

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,910
Once you did install Visual Studio you can open it, run it and then in the starting screen simply choose
13

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,330
open folder or choose File, Open to open your Flutter project.
14

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,080
So that is what I'll do.
15

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,210
Open that first app folder and this will now open Flutter in,
16

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,250
well, that IDE.
17

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,730
Now I will actually use
18

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,420
this IDE and also this look of the IDE which is the Dark theme.
19

20
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,030
You can change the look under Code, Preferences, Color Themes. But I will install some extra extensions
20

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:39,730
to make working with Flutter a bit more pleasant. And that extension can be added by going to view, extensions
21

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,720
or using that shortcut, or using that sidebar,
22

23
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,090
You will probably see here on the left.
23

24
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,700
Extensions are simply add ons to Visual Studio Code which let's us enhanced the coding experience.
24

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,970
And there you should simply search for Flutter to find the official Flutter plugin or extension. Click
25

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,500
install there and this will also install the Dart extension as a dependency.
26

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,860
Once you did install it you can hit reload to reload
27

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,540
Visual Studio Code with that extension added.
28

29
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:15,190
There's one extra extension I will use throughout the course which is totally optional and that's the Material
29

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,170
Icon Theme.
30

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,510
No that's not related to Flutter,
31

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,830
it just makes the Icons look nicer.
32

33
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,380
I already got it installed,
33

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,320
you can install it from this page and once you did install that but more important the Flutter one, you
34

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,960
can switch back to the Explorer here with that shortcut or by clicking in the menu and you're back in
35

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,440
your project structure. And now you're well prepared to work with Flutter. And for example here in our
36

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,460
main.dart file we can manipulate our first app. For example by going down to the increment counter
37

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,810
method here and changing that counter ++ thing to counter equals counter +2.
38

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,040
This should now increase the counter by 2 on every click.
39

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:06,070
Now the very cool thing is you can hit save here and then go back to your command prompt where you ran
40

41
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:12,300
flutter run and simply hit r with that flutter run process running so don't quit it.
41

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,180
Hit r whilst it is running and it will hot reload your Flutter app which means it will reload on
42

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,530
the fly on the emulator without the need to rebuild it.
43

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,200
If that gets stuck somehow you can press shift R for a full rebuild and reload.
44

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,330
Still with that process running.
45

46
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,320
So let's go back to our app and it looks like nothing changed.
46

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,250
We even have the old counter. But if we click the plus now it increases by 2.
47

48
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,450
And that's already showing how cool it is to work with Flutter and how easy this to develop with it
48

49
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:52,030
with that hot reloading. And this also is the set up I will use for all the course and I will teach you
49

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,310
all about Flutter, Dart and some tricks with the IDE for throughout this course.
50

51
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,590
Now lets see how that works for Windows or if that doesn't matter to you because you are using Mac only.
51

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,040
Let's continue with the course and dive deeper into Flutter.
