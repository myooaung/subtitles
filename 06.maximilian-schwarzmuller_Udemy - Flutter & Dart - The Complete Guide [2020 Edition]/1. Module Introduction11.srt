00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,240
We're getting closer to finishing up this application

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,260
we worked on thus far,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,230
our shop here. In the last section, we made sure that we can store data in the web on a server

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,240
and I use Firebase there as an example but it hopefully became clear that you could work with any API

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,130
and that I just showed you in general how to send requests from inside your Flutter app to the

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,730
back-end.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,570
In this module, we'll now have a look at authentication,

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,820
that means we'll make sure that the users of our app are no longer anonymous and can just use it like

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,360
this which for a shop for example doesn't really work because orders have to be stored for a specific

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,310
user and not in general.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,150
So we'll learn how to add users now and that includes things like adding a user sign up and login, making

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,140
sure that we attach orders to a user

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,830
but also products created by a user to that user and that we also managed the authentication status

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,080
of that user, so that when the user closes the app and comes back, we try to log the user back in.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,040
Therefore in this section, we'll have a look at how authentication works in Flutter apps,

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,260
that's an important part obviously, how does this generally work?

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,220
What's the theory behind that? Then we will implement user sign up and login and we'll then start managing

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,340
that user session and that will also include things like making sure that orders belong to a user but

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,390
also making sure that when the user closes the app and opens it again, that we try to log the user back

20
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,630
in and don't require the user to enter his credentials every time he restarts the app.

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,030
These are all the things we'll have a look at in the section.
