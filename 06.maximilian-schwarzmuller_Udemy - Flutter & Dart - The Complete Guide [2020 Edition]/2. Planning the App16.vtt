00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.020
So let's plan the app

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.420
we're going to build. In this app, we'll,

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.130
well that's the idea of this module, have more than just one screen.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.740
So in our appBar for example, we'll have a hamburger icon,

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.040
this one here which allows us to go to different places of this app because when we tap it, then we'll

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.140
actually open that site or menu here,

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.810
so we'll have a backdrop in front of the rest of the page

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.330
and then here we'll have a link so to say, a button that takes us to the meals page and one that takes

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.120
us to the settings page.

10
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.170
Now the meals page is actually the default which is loaded when our app starts

11
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.470
and we only have it in the side drawer so that we can go back there if we were on the settings page

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.370
but on the meals page, so on our starting page, we'll also have two tabs at the bottom - one basically for

13
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.540
all meal categories,

14
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.380
so all categories

15
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.410
and one for our favorite meals which we marked as favorite because we'll have the functionality in the

16
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.450
app to mark a meal as our favorite.

17
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.420
Now in the all categories area, if that tab is selected here,

18
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.760
we'll have a couple of category items here on that screen,

19
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.420
so something like Italian or veggie and so on,

20
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.260
so we'll have more of these items

21
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:47.500
and when we press one of these items here, then we are taken to a new screen and in that screen, we'll

22
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340
simply list the recipes for that category.

23
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.150
Now there, each recipe could be such a card with an image, a title and some rough information about that

24
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.850
recipe, like how complex it is and so on.

25
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.490
So we'll basically have a list of these recipes here on this page,

26
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.730
a scrollable list of course

27
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.990
and when we then tap one of these recipes, we're taken to yet another page where we see the full details

28
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.460
for those recipes that we have. The image maybe and then we have the ingredients here and then also

29
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.940
the steps it takes to create that dish, that meal.

30
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.100
So that's the general flow here for our recipes.

31
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:44.080
Now when we press the settings here, we're also taken to a separate page of course, on this page,

32
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.830
we'll have a couple of settings, like that we only want to see gluten free meals and for each setting

33
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.170
which we have here, we'll have a little switch here which we can set to on or off

34
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.700
and that's really ugly but these are switches where we can toggle these different filters and the settings

35
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.080
of these filters here, so the settings of these filters, should of course affect which meals we see here

36
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.480
when we are in the category page,

37
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.740
so when we picked a category and we want to see the recipes here. Now we also of course have the

38
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:32.060
favorite tab, so if the favorites tab here is selected, then we still are on this page with the drawer

39
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.010
at the top and the tabs at the bottom but now this favorites tab is selected

40
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:45.230
and here we simply also have our recipes with the image and so on, so this list which we also had over there

41
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.520
but now only the recipes or the meals which we marked as a favorite which we can do from inside that

42
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.550
recipe detail page over there.

43
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.120
So from inside this page here, we can mark recipes or meals as a favorite.

44
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.590
So this is the overall app

45
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.170
we're going to build, as you can see, we'll have a couple of different pages there, a couple of different

46
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.350
screens which we need to connect and where we need to pass data back and forth, like for example the

47
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:23.480
settings we picked here, the filters we picked here would have to be passed down to filter our recipes

48
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.900
and when we select a recipe or when we select a category, we need to pass that info of that category

49
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.960
for example which was picked here to that category screen which shows the recipes for the category and

50
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.770
so on.

51
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.130
So a more complex and therefore more realistic application,

52
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.310
so let's now see which tools Flutter gives us to build such an app.
