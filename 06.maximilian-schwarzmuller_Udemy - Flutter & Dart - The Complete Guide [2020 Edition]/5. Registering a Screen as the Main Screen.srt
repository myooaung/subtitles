00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,880
So how do we tell Flutter that we want to load this categories screen as the starting screen of our

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:17,430
application? You do that in the main.dart file, there in your root app where you set up that material

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,060
app or that Cupertino app, whatever it is, you have

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,350
that home argument which you provide and that points at the widget which should be loaded as the first

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,600
screen in your application.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,220
So home here is a super important argument.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,990
Now you will later learn that there are other arguments on the MaterialApp which also help you with

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,040
loading screens

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:47,550
but home always marks the entry point of your application, the root screen of your app

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,110
and therefore here, we now can point at our categories screen widget

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,070
and for that you need to make sure that you also import those categories screen widget here.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,660
So make sure you add an import path at the top of your main.dart file.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,270
Now since I added this, we can also get rid of my home page of this class and its state,

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,760
we didn't need the state anyways but now also the entire home page is not needed anymore because we load

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,660
a different widget as our starting widget in our app.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,120
Now one important note though before we see that in action, what's missing in the categories screen widget?

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,770
If you have a look at it, there is something missing which I mentioned would be important in every widget

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,540
you want to use as a screen

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,800
and that's the scaffold. Here

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,320
we're returning the GridView but in the end, that would be the content of our screen. The screen itself

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,790
also typically has an appBar and maybe some other things like some tabs

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,590
and therefore here, we should actually return a scaffold widget and that scaffold widget should have

23
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,750
our GridView as a body.

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,710
So let's grab this entire GridView here,

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,190
cut it and add it as a body or as a value for body here on scaffold, like this.

26
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:10,030
Now we can also add an appBar here and that can be a simple appBar where I for now only set the title

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,810
to deli meal or whatever you want to name your app, should be a text widget though

28
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,060
and since we're building it here, of course this can be a const text widget which never will have to

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,540
update when the app rebuilds because the text in there is constant,

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,530
this widget will never be different than it is initially.

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,630
Now with all of that, restart your app and do it with that green icon here because hot reloading will

32
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,460
not work,

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,540
you need to do a full restart and now you should see this here

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,870
and this doesn't look too bad.

35
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,890
We have a scrollable grid of categories here.

36
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,440
Now a couple of things can be improved though,

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,930
this text here doesn't look the way it does,

38
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,390
the overall theme in general doesn't look the way I want it,

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,070
maybe we want to bring our own fonts and some spacing around the grid would also be nice.

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:06,410
So let's work on these visuals next before we then focus on making these categories tappable so that

41
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,810
we can see the recipes for a single category.
