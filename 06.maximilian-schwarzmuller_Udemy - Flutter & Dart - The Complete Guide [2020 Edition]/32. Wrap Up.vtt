00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.450
So we're done with this module, a long module

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.100
but we built an entire app and I hope you learned a lot about Flutter, about a couple of widgets which

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.730
we haven't used thus far and most importantly of course, about navigation and passing data back and forth.

4
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.110
There we added a lot of features and you learned all about the core basics there, like what screens

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.310
or routes pages,

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.950
these are all just different terms for the same things, are. That they are just widgets in the end but

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.350
widgets which you use to control the entire page or at least, a significant part of it. That the Flutter

8
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.150
navigator allows you to switch between these pages with push, pop and replace. That you can use named

9
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.330
routes or unnamed routes

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.760
and of course that you can also pass data between these routes. You can pass them as arguments, either

11
00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.470
directly as an argument to the constructor if you're using non-named routes or via the arguments arguments,

12
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.370
the argument key when using named routes. You can also pass data back and read via a future as you learned

13
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.000
and the data that's really important can be anything,

14
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.530
strings, ints, objects, whatever you need to pass around.

15
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.910
We also use tabs here and you learned that you can add tabs in different ways, at the bottom of the

16
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.450
appBar or at the bottom of the page and the tabs in the end allow you to switch between different stacks,

17
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.620
so there you can't really pop, the same thing was true for loading a page through the drawer because

18
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.960
instead of pushing a page, you simply go there as an alternative to the current page by clicking a tab.

19
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.470
We also had to look at drawers and I spend some words on dialogs and how you can control those with

20
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.860
the Flutter navigator. Drawers are just side menus which you can open and there again, you switch between

21
00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.390
different stacks, at least if you use pushReplacement and drawers, just like dialogs, can also be closed

22
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.330
with navigator pop.

23
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.320
We didn't really use this in this module but we used it earlier in the course. In our personal expenses

24
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.830
app, there

25
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.790
I called navigator of context pop

26
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.930
once we submitted data in our modal bottom sheet to then dismiss this sheet. So pop is not just used

27
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.130
to go back from an existing page you're on but it can also be used to close a modal, like a modal bottom sheet

28
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.850
which you opened, an alert dialog or any other overlay you can put onto your screen with Flutter's help.

29
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.550
With that,

30
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.470
I hope you learned a lot about navigation and of course about Flutter and in the next section, we'll tackle

31
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.440
the issue of state management, which you probably already got a feeling for that

32
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.870
this is kind of a problem, especially in bigger apps.
