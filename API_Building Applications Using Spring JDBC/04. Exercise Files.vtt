00:00:02.017 --> 00:00:04.841
Because not everyone is comfortable with GitHub and

2
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.605
downloading source code that way,

3
00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:11.617
I'm going to first talk about that you can now download all of

4
00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:14.017
the exercise files right from Pluralsight.

5
00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:18.517
Pluralsight subscriptions now include access to everyone that was

6
00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:21.406
previously only available to premium subscribers.

7
00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:26.073
You can download the exercise files by visiting the page for this

8
00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:29.350
curse and clicking the link for Exercise files.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.906
Setup instructions are included in the download and

10
00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:36.017
you won't need to work with GitHub.

11
00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:39.118
But if you prefer GitHub and want to track your own

12
00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:40.809
changes as you go through it,

13
00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.447
I will show you an alternative and download the course with GitHub

14
00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:47.692
if you're already comfortable with that approach and possibly want

15
00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:56.000
to go through tracking your own revisions as you go through the changes of this course.
