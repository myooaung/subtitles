00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.900
To install MySQL, you're going to want to open up a

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.840
browser and navigate to www.mysql.com.

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.940
You're going to see a landing page like this.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.860
The first thing we want to do is go to the Downloads tab and

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.040
scroll to the bottom of there past their commercial offerings to

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.640
the GPL edition, or the Community edition.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to select that and go to the MySQL Community Server.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.730
There's various offerings that they have, such as their

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.260
clustering capabilities and fabric and router.

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.140
We just want the MySQL Community Server.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.080
Now there's a few options or ways that you can download MySQL, and we're

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.970
going to use the MySQL Installer that's web‑based. You'll see options to

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.300
download the complete bundle. We're just going to choose this MySQL

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.470
Installer, and it will take us to two options,

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.340
the 1.7 MB version and the 386 MB version.

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.440
If you're choosing the web version, you know you're going to be connected,

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.920
which is what I'm going to do, then look for the smaller download.

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.670
It may change in size with a future release, but right now that's 1.7

19
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.100
MB for me. I'm going to click Download, and it's going to try to get me

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.430
to sign up for a free account or log in if I have an existing account.

21
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.730
You can do this if you want updates and notifications or access to

22
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.870
their forums, but I'm just going to go ahead and say no thanks and

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.940
start my download.

24
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.330
This will go ahead and download that web installer, which since

25
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.100
it's small it's a relatively fast install.

26
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.720
We're going to go ahead and choose Run, and when this

27
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.210
comes up it will give us the option to install just the

28
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.010
custom installation that we want.

29
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.780
The developer default isn't bad, but the custom installation will allow us

30
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.730
to choose just the couple of pieces that we care about.

31
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.310
So I'm going to choose Custom and Next, and then I'm going to

32
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.400
navigate down to the SQL instance of just the server, so MySQL

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.900
Server 5.7.17, and add that, and then I'm going to add the MySQL

34
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.640
Connector and only the MySQL Connector/J.

35
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.040
And then underneath Applications, we want the Workbench as well.

36
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.830
So I'm going to choose the MySQL Workbench.

37
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.740
So those three files, the MySQL Server 5.7, MySQL Workbench 6.3, and the

38
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.440
MySQL Connector/J 5.1, and go ahead and click Next.

39
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.700
It will go through and download these.

40
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.540
It'll take it a second.

41
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.460
MySQL Server is the largest of the downloads so it'll probably

42
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.060
the last one to finish, but once this is done we can then go

43
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.000
ahead and start installing these and configuring them to run

44
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.540
inside of our application.

45
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.040
The configuration for these will also prompt you if you have a

46
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.020
previous version installed so that you don't potentially write over

47
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.540
any databases that you may have out there.

48
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.940
Once MySQL is done installing,

49
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.830
we'll click Next and it will ask us if we want to configure this instance,

50
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.530
which we do.

51
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.570
So we're going to click Next. Now, I'm going to choose the defaults here.

52
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.740
The configuration type is Development Machine and the port number is 3306.

53
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.060
If you do not want to run on that port for some reason,

54
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.070
make sure you write it down because when we create

55
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.560
our data source in the next demo, you will need to know that port.

56
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.870
So I'm going to leave it as the default of 3306 and click Next, and then I'm

57
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.670
going to add a root password of just password. Since this is a development

58
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.720
machine and it doesn't have any sensitive data on there,

59
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.850
I'm just going to use password and password.

60
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.910
I know it's weak. It's fine because there's nothing sensitive in there.

61
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.680
I'll click Next. Then it will allow me to choose this to be ran as a

62
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.670
Windows service and to start that service at system startup,

63
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.440
which I'm going to click Next on that as well.

64
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.460
I don't want to use this as a document store, so I'm going to leave that

65
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:29.770
unchecked, and click Next and Execute. Now that this is completed I'll

66
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.680
click Finish, and it will allow me to go through and start the MySQL

67
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.370
Workbench after setup. We'll click Finish. And this will go through and

68
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.250
launch a local instance for me, and if you've used the MySQL Workbench

69
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.760
in the past, this has changed quite a bit recently. It has this Local instance,

70
00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.070
I'm going to click on it, and it will bring me into the Workbench. From here,

71
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.640
I can go over in the Schemas navigator and right‑click and say Create

72
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.240
Schema, and I'm going to create one called ride_tracker.

73
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.400
You can choose different collations.

74
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.220
If you are aware of what those collations are, then you already

75
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.170
know what you're looking for, but you can choose if you want

76
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.330
UTF‑8 or some other character set.

77
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.970
I'm going to leave it as the server default and click Apply, and

78
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.080
it will create that schema for me. Click Finish. And for now,

79
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.160
there's no tables inside of here.

80
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.250
I can click on all these, but they're all empty.

81
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.990
So I have ride_tracker and Tables, Views,

82
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.140
Stored Procedures, Functions, but there's nothing in those.

83
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.570
If you used a different name other than ride_tracker, just like that port,

84
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.010
you'll want to write that down because as we go through and

85
00:05:51.010 --> 00:06:00.000
configure our JDBC URL in the next demo, you're going to need that information as well.
