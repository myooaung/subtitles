00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,700
I'm going to stop my server just so it doesn't continue to auto deploy my

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,240
code while we make our changes to our test and controller.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,440
Then I'm going to open up our RestController and scroll down to our

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,270
TestCreate method where you can see we have this line of

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,340
restTemplate.put for our object to this URL.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:35,140
I'm going to change this to say ride = restTemplate.postForObject.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,680
And the syntax for this method signature is a little bit

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,650
different than the other in that we say that we want to post for

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,220
a specific object and then we pass the type of that object in,

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,840
so I have to say Ride.class.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,790
Now we have everything we need in here to accept an object and return that

12
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,940
back rather than get a null response back for this ride.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,780
Now we can go to our controller, and inside of our controller

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:16,040
change our request method type from a PUT to a POST.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,010
Now everything is in place for us to now go ahead and modify our

16
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:31,000
CreateRide. Let's look at what we're going to do to change that to return that object for this create method.
