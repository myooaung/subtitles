00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:06.193
In this module we learned exceptions and how to implement an

2
00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:10.164
exception handler since Spring handles all of its exceptions

3
00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.164
through unchecked runtime exceptions.

4
00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:16.553
Then we added transactions to our application using a

5
00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:20.553
transaction manager and annotations to mark which methods we

6
00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.664
want to be part of that transaction.

7
00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.864
And with exception handling and transactions,

8
00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:32.611
that actually concludes our course on using Spring JDBC to develop applications.

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:44.000
Thank you for sticking with us this far and if you enjoy this course I recommend watching some of the other courses I have on Pluralsight.
