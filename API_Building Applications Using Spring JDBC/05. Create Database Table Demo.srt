1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:06,069
To create our database table, let's go ahead and open up MySQL Workbench.

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:08,769
I wanted to do it from a fresh start-up,

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,069
so in case you'd forgot how to navigate to that workbench.

4
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:17,069
I'm going to go down to my Start button and click MySQL Workbench.

5
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:22,902
And it will pull up this workspace desktop and inside of here you'll have one

6
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,978
called local instance that doesn't really look like a button,

7
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:30,069
but you can click on it and it will actually launch you into that workbench.

8
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,869
Once we're inside of the workbench,

9
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,469
just for good measure and in case you hadn't set yours before,

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,219
right click on your ride_tracker schema and say set as default,

11
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,958
and you'll know it's default if the name of that schema is bolded,

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,180
such as mine under ride_tracker.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,625
From here we can right click on the Table item

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,944
underneath ride_tracker and say Create Table.

15
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:57,069
And this is going to bring up this editor for us.

16
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:01,569
First let's start by naming our Table Name ride.

17
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:06,069
And then underneath here we can start adding columns.

18
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,939
I'm going to add three columns.

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,330
The first one is id,

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,591
and we'll go ahead and say that this is a primary

21
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,122
key and it's auto incrementing,

22
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:21,280
so they don't do a great job of telling you what these

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
checkboxes are without hovering over them.

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,269
So we're going to check the primary key column,

25
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:30,716
the not null column, and the auto incrementing field or AI column.

26
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:36,069
The next column we want to add is the name of our ride.

27
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:39,069
So we'll call this name and it's defaulting to a VARCHAR,

28
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:43,296
so we can go ahead and edit the size of that and say that

29
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:48,614
we want to do a VARCHAR to a size 100 and we'll also

30
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:51,069
select that as being not null.

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,569
Then we're going to add a third column and we'll call this one duration,

32
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,355
it's just the duration of what our ride is,

33
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,355
and we'll make this one an INT.

34
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:03,355
We can use the dropdown, choose INT,

35
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:07,678
and then we'll also set that one as not null.

36
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:11,156
Now that we have everything defined in here,

37
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:15,591
we can go ahead and click the Apply button and it

38
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:17,156
will create this schema for us,

39
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:21,069
and really all this does is take that schema and execute it behind the scenes,

40
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:26,122
but we can go ahead and click the Apply button right here.

41
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:30,016
You'll see a successful message saying that that script was

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,543
ran and it was applied to our database.

43
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:35,069
We can go ahead and click Finish now.

44
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,402
Now we can close that Table editor and you'll notice

45
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:42,373
underneath here that we have a ride table and you can go

46
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,504
inspect the columns if you want to.

47
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:47,547
You can also go ahead and do a select statement

48
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:50,657
here using a select * if you want,

49
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:58,069
but suffice it to say your table was now created inside your MySQL instance.

50
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:06,000
Now let's go ahead and start writing the code to do our unit test and call our controller.
