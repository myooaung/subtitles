00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,680
Now that we have the source code configured,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,040
we're going to install the MySQL database and then the MySQL Workbench.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,230
There are a lot of databases to choose from, and for this course

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,820
we chose MySQL. MySQL is available on every cloud hosting service

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,160
that I've ever used and is a great,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,220
full‑featured database. This course is not a how‑to on MySQL though,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,510
but if you don't have experience with it,

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:36,000
don't worry, we will cover everything that we need to so that you can be successful while using it.
