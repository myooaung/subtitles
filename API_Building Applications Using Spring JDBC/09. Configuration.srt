1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,940
Now that we have our database downloaded and installed and the Workbench,

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,370
we've also downloaded the code sample from either GitHub or the exercise files,

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,390
we can now go through and configure the rest of our application.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,800
We're going to start with adding a couple of Maven dependencies, the

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,140
spring‑jdbc JAR and the mysql‑connector‑java JAR.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,860
From there,

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,240
we're going to go through and edit the jdbc‑config.xml by

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,970
adding a dataSource and the JdbcTemplate.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,960
And then finally,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,840
we can go through and update our RideRepositoryImpl to

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:51,000
include an autowired reference to our JdbcTemplate that we created in our jdbc‑config.
