Using the RestTemplate in Spring, it is quite easy for us to build a

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.440
test that calls our RESTful service in our controller.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.120
This test on this slide will create a ride object and then call our controller,

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.540
passing the ride in. The template automatically handles

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.340
the object by issuing a put call.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's open up our IDE and create both the test and the endpoint for our test to call.
