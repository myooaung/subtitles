Hi everyone. My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my

2
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:13,500
course, Building Applications Using Spring JDBC.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,875
I'm the Director of Development at Software Technology Group

4
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,500
and now a seasoned author on Pluralsight.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Interacting with the database has always been harder than it should be in Java.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,900
Spring and the Spring JDBC framework give us a great alternative

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,500
and make it quite easy to access our data.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,700
In this course, we're going to set up a database in a framework to

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,591
fully utilize Spring JDBC for accessing our data tier.

10
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:44,318
Some of the major topics we will cover are all of the CRUD

11
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,500
functions of data access and retrieval,

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,500
as well as batch operations and exception handling and transactions.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,778
By the end of this course, we will know how to

14
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:59,500
effectively use Spring JDBC in our application.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,711
Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with Java

16
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:07,500
and an IDE such as Spring STS or Eclipse.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:18,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey of learning how to Build Applications Using Spring JDBC, at Pluralsight.
