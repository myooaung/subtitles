00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.953
We are focusing on the D of the CRUD functions, the Delete.

2
00:00:07.953 --> 00:00:12.400
Many applications are historical and don't allow deletion of data,

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.900
thus making the delete functions the least used of the API.

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.400
Although it is quite simple with both,

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.400
we will look at a JdbcTemplate and a

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.900
NamedParameterJdbcTemplate to delete records from the database.

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.900
As with other modules, this demo will be broken into multiple parts.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.567
We are going to start off with deleting a record using just the JdbcTemplate,

9
00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:44.111
which is very similar to what we've done with other

10
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.953
demos using the Update method.

11
00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:49.606
After that we're going to explore using a named parameters.

12
00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.724
Named parameters aren't just for deleting,

13
00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:58.400
but we're going to show how you do that while using

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.900
a NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.689
As mentioned before, the delete is quite simple for us to complete,

16
00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.233
especially having done all of the other CRUD functions in our application.

17
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.900
It is executed using the Update method of the jdbcTemplate,

18
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.090
SQL and the other values being passed in using var args.

19
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.471
To complete this demo, we will add this code into our repository,

20
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.900
a call in our service tier and then the method in our

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.000
controller and a test to call it. Let's try this now.
