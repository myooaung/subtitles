00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,030
Get super quick video I can probably do it in one breath.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,450
Let's try.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,450
OK.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,160
So what we're talking about here is swapping values.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,640
So if we have a list with two items James and Michelle we can swap the values around by using this comma

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,350
syntax so name zero common names one.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,870
We're going to change them to be names one common names so whatevers and names you out we're going to

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,120
put names one there whatevers and names one.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,510
We're gonna put names here or there.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,800
And the effect is swapping them and we get Michelle comma japes and that's pretty much it does so often.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,060
So when do you need to swap.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,970
I'm losing my breath.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,500
OK I can do it.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,480
When do you need to swap.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,090
When you're shuffling things.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,550
So if you had imagined a list of I mean a list of cards which you could model with strings you know

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,610
we could have like a 8 C would be eight of clubs eight D would be eight of diamonds.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,120
Eventually we'll talk about objects and classes but you could shuffle a list full of of cards.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,300
Sorting is another really important example if we're trying to sort a list in place to find our own

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,330
custom sort.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,660
And we have a list of people or numbers or whatever it is and we're trying to do it in place meaning

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,310
that we're not making a new list.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,010
Well then we just need to swap things because that's the that's pretty much all we can do because we're

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,110
not making a new list.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
We need to move things around if we try and move one thing we have to move something else.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,380
So we need to swap and just a lot of algorithms in general that we'll be discussing later on.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,950
So swapping is just a little shortcut that we get where you use the comma instead of a variable assignment.
