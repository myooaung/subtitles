00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.990
A welcome back so far this section has been pretty light on exercises activities.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.340
All that stuff that I try and incorporate throughout the rest of the course and that's not for lack

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.760
of trying it's just that most scraping anything that I could ask you to do is pretty involved typically

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.010
and you need to do it on your own computer and things change in the way that it might ask you to scrape

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.740
might not be there you know a month from now.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.030
So I'm hesitant to make a ton of exercises but I am going to do this one.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.020
And it's big.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.640
It's a project we're going to make a game not the most riveting game but it's going to grab data from

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
a Web site grab quotes and then we're going to make a guessing game where you have to guess you know

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.600
who said a quote and you can't guess it then you get hints about where they were born what year they

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.270
were born with their initials are that sort of thing.

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.130
There are instructions or requirements that you can read in a text file.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.830
I'll go over them briefly.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.590
The Web site we're going to scrape First of all is called quotes dot to scrape dot com.

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.950
This is one of the rare Web sites that encourages you to scrape the point of it is to help people learn

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.500
how scraping works and it has a bunch of quotes as you can see.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.690
Here's one.

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.740
The world is we have created it is a process of our thinking cannot be changed without changing our

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.490
thinking.

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.870
By Albert Einstein.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.610
And if you scroll down you can click next.

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510
And we're going to scrape all of these.

23
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.460
So you're going to keep going forever until there are no more to scrape.

24
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.580
I'm not sure how many pages there are but that doesn't matter because our code will just keep going

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.210
until it's unable to go any further.

26
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.330
And on top of that if we just look at one of these quickly see I won't give away too much.

27
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.760
But you know each quote it instead of a div instead of another day of class you go to quote.

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.900
So that's a good thing to know that you can use to scrape.

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.450
This class equals a quote.

30
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330
So this is the data we're going to work with.

31
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.680
Let me show you the finished the final product how it should work.

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.710
My terminal if I run my file here it starts by going and collecting a bunch of quotes and then we get

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.700
the first thing.

34
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.520
Here's a quote.

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.680
I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library.

36
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.540
Who said this.

37
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.520
Oh geez I have no idea.

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.840
Let's just guess.

39
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.050
How about Hellen Keller.

40
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.980
Here's a hint.

41
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.630
Arthur was born in 1899 in Buenos Aires Argentina.

42
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.420
OK so I don't know that many famous Argentine's from that period.

43
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.540
I'm going to go.

44
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.930
OK so one Perone probably wouldn't say something like that.

45
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.550
He was born roughly nobody 18:00 with Boras.

46
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.990
I think I have to spell it that way the code is set up right now.

47
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.460
I need his whole name so I think it's like this yes.

48
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.010
All right.

49
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.940
Seemed like something he would say some magical realist author that I remember from high school at least.

50
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.950
Would you like to play again.

51
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.250
Sure one more time.

52
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.390
Oh no I had and what I meant to do.

53
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.440
OK so I'll try again.

54
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.280
To the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure.

55
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.260
OK.

56
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.650
Somebody cares about a well organized mind.

57
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.860
I am just going to guess.

58
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.460
Albert Einstein.

59
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.210
I don't think it was him that I'm going to show you how the guessing behavior works or the hint behavior

60
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.010
this author was born July 31st 1965 in Yate South Gloucester Gloucester England.

61
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.010
The UK in 1965 and the UK.

62
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.500
I don't know.

63
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.040
That seems pretty late.

64
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.350
I honestly have no idea.

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.390
Roughly born around then.

66
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.610
Neil Gaiman.

67
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.720
Seems like something a writer would say.

68
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.980
Oh OK another hint.

69
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.580
The author's first name start.

70
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.420
Jay Oakey.

71
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.450
I don't know I'm going to get one more hint here.

72
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.080
Let's just type some jibberish.

73
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.000
Author's last name.

74
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.130
OK.

75
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.440
A Jain are born in the 60s OK I don't want to waste too much time.

76
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.270
I think

77
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.780
it could be her in a Harry Potter book though.

78
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.460
The well organized right.

79
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.010
Let's see.

80
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.190
All right.

81
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.690
And just to show you if I do hit why I won't keep going good I did oh this looks like another J.K. Rowling

82
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.260
quote Lord Voldemort.

83
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.850
Two in a row anyway.

84
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.400
So I keep playing if I want I can type Y.

85
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.380
So that's the general behavior we get I guess based off of a quote We can ask for him or we can make

86
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.300
a guess and then get a hint of wrong and those hints don't go forever so if I just keep guessing incorrectly

87
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.550
you can see there says guess's remaining one and then it tells me the answer was J.K. Rowling.

88
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.620
Do you want to play again.

89
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.400
All right so that's the gist of it.

90
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.340
Let's talk about the requirements.

91
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.080
What you need to do first is write the scraping portion the game logic can come second.

92
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.510
So focus just make a file.

93
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.170
You don't have to call it scraping project up why.

94
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.550
But what it should do is go to quote start to scrape dotcom and then grab data from every quote on the

95
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.480
Web site.

96
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.050
And remember there are multiple pages.

97
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.320
So if you have questions about how to do that.

98
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.000
My hint to you is that you need to use a loop and my strategy would actually to be look at this next

99
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.880
button and you can see it has a u r l but at some point there isn't going to be a next button on the

100
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.210
page.

101
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.860
Here we go.

102
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.290
So on this page there isn't an X button anymore.

103
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.820
I don't know a year from now there might be more quotes.

104
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.060
There could be a next button.

105
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.470
So you don't want to hard code the number of pages you want to dynamically look for that next button.

106
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.700
And if there's an X button keep scrape and keep looping.

107
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.130
Otherwise just break out of the loop.

108
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.750
OK so you're going to scrape all the quotes and for each one integrate the text of the quote Whatever

109
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.810
the actual quote is itself the name of the person who said the quote and then the age of the link to

110
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.050
the person's bio.

111
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.280
So each quote when the author section there's a link that you can click on to get more information about

112
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.810
the author I believe you can see that here.

113
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.540
Let's click on Jimi Hendrix about then we get things like this line where he was born and you know his

114
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.980
name.

115
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.830
And then also this description which I didn't use.

116
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.790
All I all I took advantage of was the born and location where they were born and then their initials.

117
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.060
So you don't have to scrape all of the author information at the beginning.

118
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.660
All you're going to do is scrape all the quotes and then stored in a list.

119
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.640
Then we're going to actually write the game functionality and the game displays one quote just picks

120
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.450
one randomly to the user and asks Who said it.

121
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.010
And then the player has guesses.

122
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.510
If the player guesses incorrectly then we you know decrement the number of guesses that they have.

123
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.900
And if they get to 0 without identifying the player loses.

124
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.000
As far as the Hinske go the first one.

125
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.820
What you should do in this is the rest of the are up to you.

126
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.230
But the first hint you need to make a request to the author's bio page.

127
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.140
So you're going to use that you are that you stored in the beginning when you've scraped all the quotes.

128
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.710
Take that ATF and send a request and get the little thing I just showed right here.

129
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.200
And he described this portion very easy scraping.

130
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.580
There's not much on this page.

131
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.330
You'll extract this and then print that to the user and then for the final two hent it's up to you.

132
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.310
You could do things like the first letter of the author's last first name or the last name.

133
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.410
The number of letters and one of their names or if you want to get fancy you could use this description

134
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.850
but remove all instances of the quote the author's name.

135
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.340
So I mean if it just said Jimi Hendrix right away it would give it away.

136
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.310
But if you redacted it use the name and you found all instances in the description.

137
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:50.670
You remove them or you replace them with whatever you know dollar signs blank was an American guitarist

138
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.520
singer and songwriter.

139
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.680
Just take the first line.

140
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.230
OK.

141
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.770
Let's give you some ideas here just spit ball and that could make for a good game.

142
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.410
And the final requirement is that when the game is over just ask the player if they want to play again.

143
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.630
Should you keep going.

144
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.240
So there will be some sort of loop that you should have for the game play.

145
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.690
And then if the user doesn't want to play any more if they type an or no or quit whatever you want you

146
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.590
break out.

147
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.930
So how do you structure this is up to you if you want to just do a bunch of methods if you want to actually

148
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.760
create classes.

149
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:21.870
You don't have to.

150
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.940
It might be a bit overkill depending on how complex you want to make this but I'm probably just going

151
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.480
to stick to a couple simple methods and a couple loops and keep it simple.

152
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:37.020
But by all means feel free to explore any structure any solution that you'd like or any additional functionality

153
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.220
to give it a shot on your own if you would prefer to do that.

154
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.270
It is structured as an exercise but it also is a big step and we are towards the end of the course so

155
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.930
I think it's OK at this point to have these larger jumps but I'm also going to have a complete code

156
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.240
along.

157
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.700
So if you want to just follow along in the next video I'll start.

158
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.060
I think we'll probably take two full videos of 10 or so minutes each to actually build the solution.

159
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.900
So if you want to follow along do that or just look at my solution if you want some.

160
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.580
But remember the solution I come up with is not the only way of doing it.

161
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.410
So don't you just don't be discouraged if your code looks different.

162
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.850
And I think that's about as long and rambling of introduction that I could give to an exercise.

163
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.720
Like I said this one is a big step.

164
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.490
So take your time and in the next video I'll start with a solution.
