1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,500
All right we're back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,350
So for the next couple of videos we're talking about strengths.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,540
One of the data types remember we are going to revisit booleans and lists and dictionaries.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,970
They get their own sections strings.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,620
There's not quite enough to make it its own standalone section but there is enough that we need to do

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,580
a couple of videos.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,150
So here we go in this first one we're just going to talk about the different ways of declaring strings.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,870
So we saw how to declare strings with double quotes but we can actually use single quotes or double

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,290
quotes and it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,320
But you need to be consistent.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,360
So here's an example.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,130
My other string equals a hat with single quotes.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,960
And then my string equals a cat with double quotes.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,450
So whichever one you use the beginning you have to use the end.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,130
You couldn't use a single and then a double.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,750
So either one is fine.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,170
It really is up to you and what you prefer.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,430
But it's important that you stick to the same convention in your own file.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,160
And when I say it's important it's really just a stylistic thing.

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,800
It won't make a difference.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,510
You can have a string in double quotes and then another one in single quotes.

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,130
It's not going to break your code.

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,720
They'll be equivalent to one another if you try and compare them as well.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,210
So it doesn't really matter.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,400
But you should be consistent.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,080
But along with that when I hop over to my terminal I have Python 3 open.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:29,810
Now as you can see we can do things like name equals coat or name to equals cult and we like that name.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,070
They look at name too and notice that when they returned back to us they actually don't look any different.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,690
So the quotes it's sort of just like a way of getting it into Python.

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,430
But then once we actually print them back or just return them as we did earlier.

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,260
Print name they look exactly the same.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,040
So next I want to show that you can actually use quotes inside of other quotes.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,640
So let's say I had something like this.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,010
Message equals.

35
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:13,060
And then I'll do double quotes he said and then I want to have a quotation inside of this if I tried

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,980
to do this he said hello there.

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,190
What do you think will happen if I hit Enter right now.

38
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,210
Well we have a problem.

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,390
So what I'm trying to do is have a quote inside of a quote you know I'm like I'm quoting he whoever

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,950
that is but when Python reads this it just goes from left to right.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:38,110
And it says OK there's a string called he said and there's a space and then it stops because it finds

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,840
the matching double quote.

43
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,650
So it ends.

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,690
And then it just finds Hello there which is not inside of quote and it throws an error because it doesn't

45
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,680
know what this is referring to.

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,170
So another option would be to use single quotes inside or vice versa.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,120
You single quotes on the outside but we can use single quotes instead of double quotes or double quotes

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,890
instead of single quotes.

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,160
And now if I look at message you can see it says He said hello there and just really quickly I could

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,400
also do the same thing.

51
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,680
Message do message two equals you single quotes.

52
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,570
I am funny.

53
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,150
Inside of quotes mean that's what my friends told me they always do those air quotes and they tell me

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm funny.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,410
And if we look at message two you can see perfectly valid it's using double quotes instead of single

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,060
quotes.

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,680
OK.

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,200
That's all I wanted to mention.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,900
You can use them together.

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,270
There's no problem in that.

61
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,270
But you just need to make sure that whatever you open your string with you close with.

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,440
Next we're going to talk about something that sounds a lot more fun than it is called escape sequences.
