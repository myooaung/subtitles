00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.700
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.140
So we've seen other create files we've seen how to move and rename them.

3
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.310
Last thing we'll talk about is removing or deleting files.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.560
So it's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.880
It's a super quick video.

6
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.800
The command that we need to use is our M stands for Remove.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.360
It's important to note however that this is only for deleting files in the next video.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.540
We'll talk about deleting directories.

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560
It's a little trickier so to delete a file just r.m space.

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.770
The name of a file.

11
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.590
So in this case inside of stuff I type ls.

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.290
There is go to XP and cat picks if I want to remove goat TXI he just r.m goat.

13
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.380
T T.

14
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.060
And now if I type Alice it's gone and all that's left is cat pics.

15
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.660
So just like some of the other Commanche you've seen we can also pass in multiple arguments to be removed

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.380
as long as are all files and we just separate them by spaces.

17
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.430
All right so let me show you.

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.260
I'm talking about here.

19
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.980
I'm back in my dog photos directory and let's go into rusty pick's two files.

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.830
I'm going to start by removing treats that T S T So you can see it's in there right now.

21
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.580
I'll do r.m treats that T S T I type ls and it's gone.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.660
Something to note.

23
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.000
We don't get any sort of warning it's just immediately gone and it's gone forever.

24
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.320
I can't command Zeeuw my way out of that one.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.710
So just something to be aware of unlike when you drag something to the trash.

26
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.010
You know where you can recover it and trash can.

27
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.760
This file is not in the trash can.

28
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.710
So let me remake a new file just so I can show you how to do it.

29
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.820
Two things at once.

30
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.970
I'll call this one test XTi and let's remove test that Pixie and rusty puppy.

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.420
So that is r.m rusty puppy space.

32
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.820
And then the other file name and as many as we want.

33
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.090
We could keep going but we only have two files.

34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.580
So I did that and now we have an empty directory.

35
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.600
Everything is gone.

36
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.960
OK so that wraps up r.m that's all there is to it.

37
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.700
Stands for Remove obliged to remove files but not folders or directories.

38
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.380
That's up next.
