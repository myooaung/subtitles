00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.660
All right.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.500
So far we've seen how to do things like open file read it and close it.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.270
And what I'm going to show you in this video is basically the same exact stuff but just a slightly different

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.720
syntax that's really commonly used.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.530
So it looks like this with.

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890
And then open a file.

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.380
The file name.

9
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.340
And then as whatever name we want to put here assuming it's not a reserve word.

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.910
So in this case file.

11
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.760
So we're not actually saving into a variable ourselves.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.260
Put whatever name we want in here.

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.950
And then inside of here.

14
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.050
After the colon indented whatever code we write will run no matter what.

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.490
So all we have is a file that read.

16
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.540
But the other really cool thing we can do here are actually that we don't have to do is no matter what

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.530
happens whether file to read works or there's an error and things go disastrously.

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.710
The file is going to be closed automatically.

19
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360
We don't have to manually do it.

20
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.420
And so that's why I have this down here file but closed is already true.

21
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.780
We never called it.

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.480
So the with statement is really popular for that reason we just don't have to manually close the file

23
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.090
anymore it's done automatically for us.

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.970
OK.

25
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.440
So back over here I think our file is closed.

26
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.030
Yes.

27
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.520
So I'm just going to reread that file and using the with syntax.

28
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.400
So with Open Story TXI the as I'll call it f just to be different here and then indent and we'll do

29
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.280
a file that read and but which are variable.

30
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.970
Let's call it data equals effort read.

31
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.060
OK.

32
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.300
Hit enter.

33
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.310
If I look at F and we run f dot closed it's already close.

34
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.720
I try and read it gives me an error just like we saw in the last video.

35
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.630
It's files close.

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.610
You can't read it.

37
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.050
I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
And if I look at data here's the data we read in.

39
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.130
So again nice syntax opens a file reads it and then automatically closes.

40
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.800
If you're curious behind the scenes what's actually going on when we open up this file.

41
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.590
So let me do it again.

42
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.730
Open and what they call that story.

43
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.930
Text me if I look at f there's this method called enter.

44
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.630
And anytime we have a with block entry is going to be called and all that this actually does is return

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.720
the file.

46
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.680
The file object so nothing exciting.

47
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.140
But now there's the opposite which is called Exit whenever we have one of these with statements.

48
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.460
When it's done the very end no matter how things went it was good or bad.

49
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.080
There's an error or not it's going to call the Dunder exit method on F..

50
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.020
And so when we call that manually it closes the file.

51
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.890
So this is like an interface.

52
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.320
It is an interface for these with statements.

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.840
So it's not limited to files for opening and reading files.

54
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.620
So we can create our own classes our own objects that can work with with statements as long as they

55
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.120
have an enter and exit method on them.

56
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.890
Enter is called at the beginning and exit is called No matter what afterwards.

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.810
OK.

58
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.080
Now if I run after the exit and we look at f dot closed it's true.

59
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.800
All right.

60
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.620
So you'll see me using this syntax and most people using this syntax pretty much all over the place.

61
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.160
You don't have to remember to close it.

62
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.930
It's a little shorter and more succinct.

63
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.240
And these two operations are related.

64
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.420
So you might as well put them together rather than doing things on separate lines saving into a variable

65
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.260
and all that.

66
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.950
OK.

67
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.570
Next up we're going to talk about writing to a file.

68
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.730
But of course first exercise type.
