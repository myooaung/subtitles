00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.060
Well come back and this video I'm going to just show you how you can test for the existence of a certain
1

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.370
key or value in a dictionary.
2

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.150
So we've already seen that if we have a dictionary and I'll just paste this in if I try and access something
3

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.750
that is not in the dictionary like a key that doesn't exist like address we get an error.
4

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.360
So there should be a way for us to test if instr. contains a key called the address.
5

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.550
And there is it looks like this in just like we saw with lists so we could say name in list and it would
6

7
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670
if it was a list it would return true or false.
7

8
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.520
If the value of name was in there but in a dictionary it only is testing the keys.
8

9
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.440
So if I try that over here we have instructor and we know that name is in there.
9

10
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.740
So name an instructor we get true.
10

11
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.170
And if I tried for something that isn't in there like phone and instructor it gives false rather than
11

12
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.080
throwing an error like we had a peer so we could you know write a conditional statement that said if
12

13
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.850
phone in instructor print phone else print there's no phone number so we can add this logic that will
13

14
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.130
do one thing if a given key is in there and do another if it doesn't exist versus if we tried to just
14

15
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.920
do if instructor phone like this threat well I needed to call in.
15

16
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.920
And then I do.
16

17
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:45.210
You know Prince there is a phone key just like this we get an error because it can't find phone anywhere.
17

18
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.140
So we could replace that with if phone in instructor print.
18

19
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.090
There is a phone key and we'll actually see a dictionary method that we can use as well to remedy this
19

20
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.120
problem.
20

21
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.800
So that's the basics of getting her testing for the existence of keys.
21

22
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.290
But what about values.
22

23
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.780
If I tried to do that see you know four is a value.
23

24
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.180
Python is a value.
24

25
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.040
If I tried to test if they are in instr. right now by doing for an instructor I get false.
25

26
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.510
Even though we know that four is a value in instructor but it's only looking in the Keys.
26

27
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.120
So what do we do.
27

28
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.580
We test dot values.
28

29
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.000
So remember that instructor or any dictionary dot values returned the values.
29

30
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:38.140
So if we just did that right now instructor values and actually in the next section we'll see exactly
30

31
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.880
what this data type is that is being returned.
31

32
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.840
But for now let's just think of it as sort of like a list even though if we if we tested it won't actually
32

33
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.520
say that it is a list.
33

34
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.350
But anyway I can do it not values like that and test if 4 is in there so I can say 4 in and start to
34

35
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.410
adopt values.
35

36
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.430
And if I test for one of the kids like.
36

37
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.580
Name name is not in the values it's in the kids.
37

38
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.310
So you know theoretically.
38

39
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080
Well theoretically we could do this test.
39

40
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.120
And the key is that there's no reason because the default just like this is already looking in the Keys.
40

41
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.730
OK.
41

42
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.190
So that's how in works of dictionaries.
42

43
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.700
If you're looking for a key which a lot of the time is what I'm trying to do.
43

44
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.080
It's more common to test if something exists has a key you can use in but there's also a shortcut that
44

45
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.550
will see in just the next video.
45

46
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.420
When we look at some dictionary methods but you can use an and if you're looking to test for the existence
46

47
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.980
of a particular value you do in instr. dot values get.
