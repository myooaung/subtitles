00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,350
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,160
And this video I'm going to introduce a more intermediate topic with lists called a slice or slicing.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,030
It's basically a tool that's built in that allows us to make copies of entire lists.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,540
But more commonly just portions of just individual slices.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,510
So we could say give me the part of this list from indexed to 10 or give me the part of all of us from

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,120
index 5 all the way to the end and the syntax for slicing is a bit different than what we've seen so

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,720
far.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,350
It's not a method that we call on a list with a dot and then the name of a method like append and parentheses.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,710
We actually use the square brackets that we use you know to access an individual item out some list

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,290
bracket zero gives us an individual element at the first index.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,160
But for a slice we use the same brackets but there are three pieces of information we can provide.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,730
And we don't have to have all of them but we see some examples.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,460
And the first example is where we want the slice to begin where we should start cutting.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,380
Make our first cut to the list.

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,250
The second is where to stop and then the third is the step or the interval.

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,430
Are we including every index every you know skipping every other one.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,060
Just like with range.

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,660
If you watch the range video or we created to start stop and a step we could do odd numbers from 1 to

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,740
20.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,140
The biggest difference is that we're using colons to separate them and square brackets.

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,480
OK so let's take a closer look at the first parameter which is the start point the index where we should

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,120
start slicing.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,360
So here's an example.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,370
We have one two three four stored in a list as first list and the first thing I'll point out is that

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,360
we have to add this colon afterwards.

26
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,240
Because if I just did first list of one it's going to give me the item at index 1 which is 2.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,030
So in order to tell Python where slicing we have to include at least one colon.

28
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:05,190
So even if we're only using the start and we're not including and step you need at least have a colon

29
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,010
and the same goes later once we learn we can do.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,370
We don't have to include a start.

31
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,690
And we can just do an end.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,880
We have to include a call in before.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,070
OK so here's our first example.

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,190
If we slice from index of 1 to the end we get to three and four.

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,720
So it starts right here so 0 1 starts at 2 and it slices to the end.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:37,920
And here's another example we started index 3 0 1 2 3 which is for Item 4 and we got to the end which

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,910
there's nothing afterwards.

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,010
So we end up with a list of just four if we tried to slice from index 20.

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,310
So you know 20 Colan we would get an empty list.

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,830
Python will look for it.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,230
It doesn't find anything at that index but it still gives us a list.

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,250
What's cool about slicing is that we can also slice from the end using a negative number.

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,230
So if you slice from negative 1 we just get the last element in a list or in this example we slice from

44
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,790
negative 3 to the end.

45
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,530
So that's going to be negative one negative to negative three forward.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,340
So two three four.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,160
So if we pass a negative number you get back a new list with that many number of elements from the end.

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,870
If that makes sense and as a quick aside we can also just pass in a colon and that will give us the

49
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,290
entire list.

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,100
It's the same as passing in zero colon.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,940
Let's go to my terminal and I'll make a list of colors.

52
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,810
OK.

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,190
So we have red orange yellow green blue indigo violet Roy G Biv.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:47,390
And if we want to do a slice let's do something from yellow to the end so that index of 0 1 2.

55
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,700
And if we just do index of two of course it gives us yellow.

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,500
But if we add that colon then it goes to the end.

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,830
Yellow green blue indigo violet.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,850
So the note that I added at the end there is that if we do zero colon that will just make a copy of

59
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,600
the list.

60
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,930
And it's actually important to notice or to know that this is a copy of the list.

61
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,360
It's not giving us the same list and we could prove that.

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,160
So if we have colors and then I make colors two equal two colors.

63
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:27,170
Zero colon which we could actually just do colon as well that's the short cut so I'll show you that

64
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,260
now.

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,010
And I look at colors too.

66
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,410
It looks the same as colors.

67
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,810
And remember the way we could test we can do colors equals equals colors too.

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,180
And that's going to tell us if the values are the same and they are.

69
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,960
But if we do colors is colors too.

70
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,480
That's going to tell us if they actually referenced the same thing in memory and they don't.

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,250
We've made a unique copy and it has its own address in memory.

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,470
So when we use is it comes back as false.

73
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,370
OK the last thing I'll show negative numbers.

74
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,160
You know if we go back to colors and we slice from negative into negative to Colin what do you expect

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,560
to get if this is colors I'll hit enter and we get indigo and violet.

76
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,080
So it goes from the negative to index.

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,280
So that's going to be negative one negative two and it slices to the end.

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,520
So indigo and violet Let's now examine the second parameter of slice which is the end point the end

79
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,340
index.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,960
So the first parameter is where to start the slice.

81
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,850
What index to begin the first cut and the second parameter is where to end it.

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,940
And it's important to note it is Xclusive.

83
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,430
So it does not include the last index that we provide.

84
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,240
It's just like ranges in that way but it's not like Rand and very confusing in my opinion.

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
So here's an example.

86
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,660
Same first list.

87
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,830
One two three four.

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,180
And if we slice with colon too.

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,030
So we don't even provide a start point.

90
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,360
It's going to assume to begin at the beginning that the zero index and it slices until index of two.

91
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,310
But it doesn't include index of two because index of 2 is 0 1 2.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,500
That gives us three.

93
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,790
So it slices up until here giving us one common to.

94
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,950
Same thing here.

95
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:23,000
If we slice with Colon for starts the beginning and goes to index 4 which is 0 1 2 3 and index 4 doesn't

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,530
exist.

97
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,600
It's after the list ends.

98
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:32,220
So it gives us everything in the list and then here's our first example of passing and a start and an

99
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,980
end.

100
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,540
In this case we're slicing from index one to index three.

101
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,410
So index of one is included.

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,320
So 0 1.

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,790
So it includes two and it goes up to three.

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,050
And then this is index of 3 0 1 2 3.

105
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,100
So it includes indexes 1 and 2 Give has 2 and 3 so many numbers to talk about.

106
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,200
It's easier with colors but treat this as a reference.

107
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,890
And if we pass in a negative number as the end value into our slice it will end the slice at that many

108
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,870
elements from the end of the list.

109
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,660
So if we wanted the first two elements in the list we could slice from the beginning until three from

110
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,250
the end and we could pass in negative two as a second option.

111
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,470
So here's an example.

112
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,580
In this case if we do colon negative one it's going to go from the beginning which is index zero.

113
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,170
Up until the last item negative 1 which is 4 and it doesn't include it.

114
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,610
So it gives us 1 2 3 or this example goes from index of 1 up to index negative for one non-inclusive.

115
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,110
So that gives us index of 1 0 1.

116
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,180
So we get to 3 and we stop because this is negative 1 here and it's Xclusive.

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,580
So let's go back to colors.

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,010
And this time I make a bit more space if we look at colors.

119
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,310
Let's do a slice from red to blue including blue.

120
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,280
So basically leaving out indigo and violet and to do that with the colors and we could do zero colon

121
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,220
test to make it clear we're starting at the beginning or just two colon and then the index of indigo

122
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,550
so that 0 1 2 3 4 5 just like this.

123
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,020
And that gives us red orange yellow green blue doesn't include Indigo.

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,420
Now if I just wanted a slice from yellow to green.

125
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:32,070
Well what we would do is start off with the first index that's going to be 0 1 2 and it includes two

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,530
so two and we want it to stop.

127
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,260
They get red yellow and green.

128
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,380
So we want to just stop it blue because it doesn't include blue.

129
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,240
So that's going to be 0 1 2 3 4.

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,730
And if we look at this we get yellow and green.

131
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,020
Finally let's move on to the third parameter which is the step.

132
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,790
So it's basically the number to count at a time the interval how many to skip.

133
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,840
It works the same way as the step works in ranges.

134
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,610
Or we could generate even or odd numbers or multiples of five that sort of thing.

135
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,680
So for example if we had a step up to count every other number 1 3 5 and so on.

136
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,860
So here's an example.

137
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,790
We have our first list but this time it includes one up to six.

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,500
One two three four five six.

139
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,430
And notice that we have two colons in a row.

140
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,400
So this signifies we have a start.

141
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,560
There's no end.

142
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,980
And then we have our third parameter.

143
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,640
So if you see this two Kolins it means there's no middle there's no end parameter.

144
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,330
So our start is from index of 1.

145
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,680
So that's going to be 0 1 and we're going to the end.

146
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,220
But we're counting by twos so we get index up to her.

147
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,880
Excuse me.

148
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,430
Index of one index of three and an index of five giving us two for six.

149
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,210
So this example I'm actually just looking at it and it's wrong.

150
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,310
I'll have to update the slide because if we have first list Colin Colin too this means start at the

151
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,470
beginning and go to the end.

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,190
I believe the reason I think I was using the old version of first list which only went up to four but

153
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,200
this one goes up to six.

154
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,770
But if we're counting by twos for the entire list so start at the beginning go to the end come by twos.

155
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,240
It should give us index of zero index of two and then index of four.

156
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,340
So it should be 1 3 5 not 1 3.

157
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
So I'll update that.

158
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,950
OK.

159
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,100
It is updated now.

160
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,020
Steps are useful for getting a certain pattern and a slice but things get really interesting when we

161
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,630
add negative step values.

162
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,710
So for example let's take a look at this first one.

163
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
So we have our first list.

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,050
One two three four five six and we're going from the beginning or from index of 1.

165
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,700
So that's two.

166
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,690
And we're going to the end.

167
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,560
However we're stepping back.

168
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,740
So we go two down to one to the end.

169
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,640
So we reversed the direction rather than going forward.

170
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,860
We're going backwards.

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,800
So we end up with two come a one in a bust Here's another example it works a little different because

172
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,370
we're not passing in a start point we're passing in.

173
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,270
And so our end is index of one which is to remember that end is not exclusive so it wouldn't include

174
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,940
too but because we have negative one.

175
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,570
We're actually going for the end of the array so 6 5 4 3 and then we stop because we hit this index.

176
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,510
So the result is six five four three.

177
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,060
And then finally and this last example we're stepping backwards and we're starting at index 2.

178
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,420
So that's going to be 0 1 2 here and there's no endpoint.

179
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,710
So we're moving backwards from 3 to 2 to 1 with that negative 1 slices are definitely a bit tricky to

180
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,730
wrap your head around especially when you add the negative numbers.

181
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,430
But keep practicing Also it's not a deal breaker for Python.

182
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,590
You'll see them use a lot but if you have questions about them you can pretty easily get them answered

183
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,360
or figured out with just kind of sitting down and thinking through it.

184
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,050
So now that we've practiced with slices Let's see some cool things we can do.

185
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,900
So what we saw from earlier going from the beginning to the end stepping back by 1 0 reverse a list

186
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,350
or a string.

187
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,880
Way.

188
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,930
So instead of using the reverse method we could simply do it this way.

189
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,970
So here's an example with a string.

190
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,000
So I mentioned at the beginning that all of this works with strings so we could do zero zero negative

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,010
1 or just call and call negative 1.

192
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,460
And it just reverses the entire string.

193
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,490
Another thing we can do is modify specific portions of a list.

194
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,640
So here's an example we have numbers 1 2 three four 5 is a list and we can actually set a slice.

195
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,540
So we have numbers 1 2 3.

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,170
So that's going to be index 0 1.

197
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,330
So from 2 up to here 0 1 2 3.

198
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,340
So these two are actually going to update it to be ABC.

199
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,030
So it adds that data here and we end up with one A B C for 5.

200
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,670
All right.

201
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,940
So lastly for just two or three seconds.

202
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,400
Well that's not that's a lie.

203
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:11,870
For like 20 seconds let's just do colors and let's do one of those tricks using Well let's use steps

204
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,900
first of all so let's do colon colon too.

205
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,040
What do we expect from that.

206
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,780
Well it starts at the beginning red and it skips and it goes to yellow to blue to Violet.

207
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,030
And let's play around with the negative one which will reverse it.

208
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,190
It's another way of reversing the list.

209
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:38,900
And finally let me show you something a bit different but still colors zero which is going to give us

210
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,630
red.

211
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,820
Actually that's two longer color that's two colors five which is indigo.

212
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,370
That's a string.

213
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,250
And I actually can change this on it's a bit of a bonus.

214
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,780
And what does this do again to a list or a string.

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,360
It will reverse it.

216
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,980
So if I chain them together it accesses Indigo first and then slices it by reversing it using negative

217
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,080
one at this step and we get our get our Gidney Gidney it's a quick little bonus thing there.

218
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,120
We can do the exact same thing.

219
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,690
So if I did hello like this and then I access the zero character we get H.

220
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,510
But if you Colon four I get opes unintentional there.

221
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,270
Please don't come at me please.

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,840
And you know we could do the same thing that we've seen let's do colon colon three.

223
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,790
It goes from H and then it skips this this and it goes to that L skips to go so that L skips two and

224
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,130
gives us the last oh ok that's enough.

225
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,710
This video has been so long I'm sorry.

226
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,480
There's a lot to cover with slices.

227
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,700
So we're going to get some practice.

228
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,860
If you're feeling lost.

229
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,550
Hang in there.
