1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.710
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.360
So in this video we're just going to take our rock paper scissors game that we've already built.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.220
And if you didn't do that I have started code and if you want to follow along so the game is very simple

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.530
right now it only plays one time.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.300
And what we're going to do is make it more of a game so that it will repeat and we'll start by just

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.860
making it repeat three times.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.490
But we'll end by making it repeat until somebody wins let's say two out of three or three out of five.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.650
Totally up to you how you want to implement it but we'll have it repeat until either the human player

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.390
wins or the computer wins.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870
So it becomes more of a game.

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.300
So here's the starter code.

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.410
This was the final version I made in the Rock Paper Scissors section.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.160
Let's just run it once Python three which they call it with loop.

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.330
OK so enter our choice and say rock not wreck rock.

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.740
A computer plays paper computer went OK.

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.360
So we want to just automate this have it happened three times.

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.870
So that's very simple.

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.050
All that we do is take all of the code we want to repeat and indent it just like that and put it in

19
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.560
a loop.

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:19.280
So our loop will be we could just do for X or a time in range 3.

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.050
So this is the simplest version.

22
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.120
It just repeats three times every time.

23
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.060
So let's clear and try again.

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.290
What do you know.

25
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.540
Forgot my colon.

26
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.120
So they called.

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.080
OK.

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.840
So if they rock and it asks again so is it tied the first time.

29
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.420
And to your choice.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.630
So we'll do four.

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.490
What am I thinking.

32
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.200
Paper so Computer 1 and that's do scissors.

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.250
And then it finishes.

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.770
So already we have a simple game that run three times but it's still still it's still dumb.

35
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.790
No offense to our game but it's dumb in that it doesn't know who wins.

36
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.740
So rather than doing a for loop that repeats a set number of times.

37
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.510
Let's actually make this keep going and tell a human the human player or the computer wins.

38
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.130
So to do that we need to keep track of the number of wins.

39
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.620
So let's do player wins equals zero and computer wins equals zero.

40
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.910
OK so I'll say something like wow the player wins.

41
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.120
It's less than two.

42
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.160
And computer wins is less than two.

43
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.990
So let's do that while player wins.

44
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.600
It's less than two and computer wins is less than two.

45
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.990
We're going to repeat all of this.

46
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.130
So get rid of that for loop.

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.320
Now the thing is we're not ever adding to player win so let's do that now.

48
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.080
So any time down here we see computer wins.

49
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.130
We'll add one two computer wins.

50
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.260
So computer wins plus equals 1.

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.370
If we see player wins I will say player wins plus equals 1.

52
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.880
I'm just going to copy this now.

53
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.280
So next time we see player wins I guess I put you win instead of say player wins.

54
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.440
And same thing down here.

55
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.120
And if we see computer wins

56
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.230
let's go down.

57
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.270
This is kind of messy.

58
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.100
By the way we haven't really seen better ways of refactoring your code but once we learn functions things

59
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.190
will be a little cleaner.

60
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.220
But wherever we see computer wins where else are we set we add one to the computer when to score.

61
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.170
And once again here.

62
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.050
The other thing we should do is at the beginning let's print out the scores.

63
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.830
So let's say print let's do an F string

64
00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.660
player score and we'll add player score or player wins and then we'll do space.

65
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.550
Computer score and do the same thing just so we can see what's happening.

66
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.530
Computer wins.

67
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.360
OK.

68
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.080
Let's see if I have any typos.

69
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.330
Let's see what happens.

70
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.120
So let me clear this make some space and start to zero to zero.

71
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.100
So I'm going to play paper first.

72
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.750
And says it's a tie.

73
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.190
So it's still 0 2 0 this time.

74
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.200
So let's enter paper again.

75
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:39.040
And no computer played rock so oh no I'm crazy computer played rocks or I won swing of emotions there

76
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.820
and you can see the player scores one computer score is zero.

77
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.300
So this time let's do scissors.

78
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.020
The computer won.

79
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.340
So now it's one to one.

80
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.880
So whoever wins this one unless it's a tie.

81
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.730
Let's go with paper again.

82
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.400
To tie.

83
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.730
So it's still one to 1.

84
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.910
This is this is riveting.

85
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.220
Let's do rock.

86
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.700
No the computer won.

87
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.260
And you can see the game finished.

88
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.870
So that's actually pretty good.

89
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.940
I mean it works.

90
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.280
It really changes it adds a whole new dimension to the game.

91
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.870
There's a couple changes we can make though.

92
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.180
The first is that at the end we're never printing out who won two at the end.

93
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.450
We could just add a simple print statement that would say something like.

94
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.400
Final score.

95
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.180
And let's just copy what we had a.

96
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.540
This whole string actually like this and all the final scores.

97
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.130
Player

98
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.600
and computer will be able to see one.

99
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.820
And if we wanted we could add a conditional to say congratulations or I'm sorry.

100
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.640
So let's just do this really quickly test it out.

101
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.310
I'm going to go paper every time.

102
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.900
OK well you can see how I actually did one too many times.

103
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.250
Player one with two computer lost because only one one time.

104
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.720
Cool.

105
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:19.180
So we got a conditional down here or something like if said let's do player score or player wins is

106
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.710
greater than computer wins.

107
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:30.760
Then we'll print can Gretz you one else.

108
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.120
PRINCE Oh no you.

109
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.600
The computer 1 this do that.

110
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.320
OK.

111
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.060
So get rid of the final scores at the end.

112
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.230
And the reason I decided to if player wins is greater than computer wins rather than player wins is

113
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.570
equal to two because right now that's how a player wins or the computer wins.

114
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.450
Is that I want to leave room to actually update this so we might want to play best of three or best

115
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.370
of five.

116
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.890
So what I could do instead is make a variable called winning score and set it equal to two and replace

117
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.600
this.

118
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.160
Hopefully that makes sense why I would do that so now if I wanted to make the game best of five I just

119
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.680
change this or if I want to make the first person to five I make winning score equal to five or let's

120
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.600
say three.

121
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:33.440
So it won't take as long and test it clear everything out and I'll play rock and rock and rock every

122
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.440
time we're getting a lot of ties.

123
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.060
OK.

124
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.280
And you can see that it was the first person to reach three was me.

125
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.300
I had two.

126
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.390
And then I won again.

127
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.060
So my score went to three.

128
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.700
Congrats you won.

129
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.760
OK.

130
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.610
And if I wanted to I could change it back to 1.

131
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.340
No it's just a single game unless it's a tie.

132
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.620
So let's say play paper and I won.

133
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.610
So it's over.

134
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.310
So we've made it a bit more flexible rather than hard coding too.

135
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:07.930
OK.

136
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.600
So the last thing let's add in a break.

137
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.700
So I'll put this back get three wins.

138
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.470
And the reason we might want to add an A break is if the user wants to quit prematurely before you want

139
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.310
to forfeit.

140
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.230
Right now we have to force quit it with like Control C or D and basically end the entire Python process.

141
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:31.750
But what we could do is once the user enters input which where's that happening player because input

142
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.690
right here.

143
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:45.080
Well just you if input equals equals quits or let's even add in put equals Q break.

144
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.490
And that's it.

145
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.100
OK.

146
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.870
So let's try it.

147
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.190
So I'm playing rock.

148
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.400
And then I decide you know what I want to quit.

149
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.670
So I tape quit didn't work.

150
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.170
So what did we do wrong or what did I do wrong.

151
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:07.050
Let's see if off that would be the problem.

152
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.550
Testing input equals.

153
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.430
We need to test it for a variable player is equal.

154
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.390
OK.

155
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.320
So let's do my not so graceful quick.

156
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.860
This is a problem as you can see trying to get out of here.

157
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.170
We want to add quit.

158
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.120
There we go.

159
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.040
So now we have our quit implemented Let's try it.

160
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.230
So we're going to play paper and I decide after two I'm done.

161
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.770
Let's type quit and it says oh no the computer won and that's fine.

162
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.740
There is technically a small loophole here.

163
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.940
If we're tied at the end of the game it's still going to say that the computer won.

164
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:51.840
So we could add in one more thing here would be if player wins equals computer wins.

165
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.220
Prince it's a tie.

166
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:05.010
Now this only happens if we quit the game when it's a tie.

167
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:06.710
Else.

168
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.530
Oh no the computer won.

169
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.080
All right.

170
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.130
Finally let's test it and be done with this.

171
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.130
OK.

172
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.450
So let's say Can I get a tie.

173
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.350
Let's do paper and it's a tie again right.

174
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.200
So it's a tie right now.

175
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.800
Perfect.

176
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.580
So if I type q or quit we get to tie.

177
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.670
Perfect.

178
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.070
All right.

179
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.520
So this is kind of a cool moment for us.

180
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.570
It's the first thing we've built that feels sort of substantial I mean it's a lot of code relative to

181
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:40.330
what we've done you know relative to printing out little Modise in a row and it involves a lot more

182
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:40.750
logic.

183
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:48.160
We've got a big loop that runs potentially a lot of times it might run once but if we're doing a best

184
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.420
of 10 for doing the first of five it's going to run a lot especially if we keep getting ties and draws.

185
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:55.920
Right.

186
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.990
Because if we could use a for loop and just have it run five times.

187
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.190
But if we get a draw then there won't actually be a winner.

188
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.180
Potentially and it will always run five times versus here.

189
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:13.510
If we're doing the best the first three we might have a 100 tie games first and then somebody finally

190
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.130
wins.

191
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.330
Then we added in the chance to break.

192
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.960
If you quit using quit or Q And yeah we printed out at the end.

193
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.750
Who won.

194
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:29.200
So kind of a long video but hopefully kind of fun to make this bit a bit more of a game.
