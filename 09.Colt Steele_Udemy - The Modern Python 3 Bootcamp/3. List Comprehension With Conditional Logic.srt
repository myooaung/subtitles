1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,730
Before we practice with miscomprehension Let's see one more thing that I can do which is quite powerful.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,290
You can actually add conditional logic to our list comprehension using keywords that we've seen before.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,440
Like if and else in our first example here we have a list of numbers from 1 to 6.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,670
It's called numbers and we have two new lists of Odd and Even numbers based on the conditional logic

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,300
at the end of the list comprehension.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,400
So that's right here and right here.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,960
So we're just saying take every now add it to a new list for each name in numbers.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:43,500
If that name divisible is divisible by 2 meaning it's even numbered 2 is equal to zero.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,550
Or in this example no mad 2 is not equal to zero.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,490
So important to know the if keyword needs to come at the end after the name of the list or whatever

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,220
we are iterating through string or a range.

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,030
If you're using an ELSE key word things look a little bit different.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,820
This might look confusing.

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,910
It kind of is.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,300
And it just takes a bit of practice to get used to.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,100
So you might be wondering how exactly do you possibly remember all of this.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,780
Well I kind of forget the syntax a lot especially when we add the else in.

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,620
And I just look it up when I need to you know to build the slide or if I'm using it in code to measure

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,870
it's not too bad to just go find it online.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,450
There are so many posts on stack overflow or tutorials about it.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,750
So I would just recommend that you use.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,890
Be willing to look things up and don't feel like you have to just commit everything to memory immediately

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,440
because engineers get too hung up on the syntax and not the conceptual stuff behind it.

24
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,840
OK.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,160
With that little diatribe over let's look at this example and try and walk through it.

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,270
So there's a start of a list comprehension here but then we have an F and then an else.

27
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,830
And then for I'm in numbers.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,940
So the syntax is definitely different.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,910
But what this will happen or what this will do is it will take even numbers and multiply them by two

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,490
if they're even.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,090
And otherwise the only other situation is that they're odd.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,840
It will divide them by two.

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,500
So for every name and numbers from 1 to 6 if it's even if not made to zero.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,620
Multiply it by two.

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,130
So that's how we get 4 and 8 and 12.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,310
Otherwise divide it by 2 and that's how you get Point 5 1.5 and 2.5 and we can also combine this with

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,810
the in keyword to check for certain conditions.

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,400
So here we're taking a string and turning it into a list with no vowels and joining it back into a string.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,050
If the character is not in the list of vowels.

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,350
So here we have this is so much fun.

41
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,910
Exclamation point with vowels that's a name of the variable and then we're using join which we saw earlier

42
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:01,230
we're doing char for char so for each character in with vowels if the character is not in H E I O or

43
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,870
you then we will join together into the string.

44
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,760
So it will take each item in this list.

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,610
This is going to generate a list and then joins them together.

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,000
So it might help to walk through this example and make some space here.

47
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,530
So remember how just joined works on its own.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:27,700
You do something like this that join and then in parentheses passing a list like one that's two words.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,870
And next year period they're OK.

50
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,730
And it joins every item in that list with an empty string.

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,820
But if we added a space or dot dot dot it joins them with that whatever we call it on it's a string

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,600
method.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,740
So that should be review.

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:57,010
But then when we pass this in this list comprehension The result is this list right here.

55
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,850
Basically we're removing all vowels from this is so much fun.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,240
So for each character in that's why this is so much fun string.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,210
If a character is not in a IOU then we'll add it to the list.

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,050
So we end up with this list.

59
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,430
There's no vowels.

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,300
And then we join that together using an empty string.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,310
And that's how we get this.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,790
It's something like that.

63
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,550
All right.

64
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,120
There's a lot to list comprehension.

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,990
I know it might be overwhelming.

66
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,990
So we have some practice after this video get some practice get some experience with them.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,890
If you have questions lingering on any of the examples I recommend you try running them yourself and

68
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,370
tweaking them and see what happens.

69
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,590
It's easier to walk through and try and piece together how things work.

70
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,170
So as I mentioned not to freak you out too much but try to get comfortable the syntax.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,810
You don't have to memorize everything.

72
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,480
You know you don't have to be able to do a list comprehension with a if and an else condition right

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,150
away.

74
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,740
But when we do push on we get to things like dictionaries will be using their own kind of comprehension.

75
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,560
Same thing with set.

76
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,070
And so it's good to get the fundamentals down now.

77
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,650
OK.

78
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,620
So good practice post questions if you have them and don't panic.

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,180
This is this is really cool part of Python in my opinion.

80
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,260
So don't let the newness of it depress you discourage you.

81
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,960
How about that.

82
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,360
All right.

83
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm going to be quiet.

84
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,150
Goodbye.
