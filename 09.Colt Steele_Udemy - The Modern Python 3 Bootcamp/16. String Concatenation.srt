1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,710
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,200
So next in our string of string videos very funny I know we are talking about something called concatenation.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,280
So a quick video.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,350
Basically this boils down to adding two strings together.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,420
What happens when you have a string in a plus sign and another string.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
And the answer is probably what you'd expect.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,200
It just shows the strings together.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,150
So here's an example.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,350
I have two strings one called string one is equal to your and string two is equal to face.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,960
Now if I make a new variable called string three or I could just print the result out and I make it

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,370
equal to string one plus a space plus string two.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,490
Well I get your space face kind of right.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,240
If we didn't have the space here then it would just Chevon together as your phrase one word.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,420
But we had that space in because we want that space so it says your face anyway.

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,990
That's really it.

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,910
To the basics of concatenation.

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,880
But I'm going to add on a little tangent in just a moment but let me hop over now to our terminal and

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,640
I'll just quickly demonstrate a common example.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,660
Let's say your ASCII user username equals and this is me asking a user what's your user name and they

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,620
type in the answer and we're simulating that.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,170
So maybe they say blew the cat that's my cat's name.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,300
Then we might want to add a little greeting that says Hello there and welcome to the game.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,590
And then comma and then I want to add in username.

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,150
So that's all I need to do.

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,630
And that plus sign but I need to pay attention to that space because if it's not there I don't get a

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,150
space it's not catastrophic if there's a comma but it could you know make things really hard to read.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,510
So we had that space.

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,450
All right.

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,500
So that's the basics of concatenation.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,440
You can do it multiple times you could do a plus b plus Z and we get ABC.

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,230
Now this brings us to an important point which is what if I tried to do eight plus.

32
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,380
Hello.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,260
What do you think will happen.

34
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,160
And there we go.

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,290
We get unsupported operand types.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,360
So Python basically goes through this it's having a great time.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Like OK 8 we're dealing with integers and plus.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,870
OK that's an operator for an integer ridable I had two numbers.

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,310
So we're working with numbers great.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,170
I'm expecting a number expecting a number.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Oh no what the heck is going on.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,060
This is a string.

43
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,380
It doesn't know what to do.

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,860
So it doesn't do anything it gives up.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,470
I mean what would you expect it to do.

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,070
I guess theoretically it could turn 8 into this string eight and give us eight.

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,480
A low but it doesn't do that obviously.

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,990
So you have to be aware of the context and with concatenation at least you need to be working with strings.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,070
So if we tried to do something like you know a common example we'll see in a little bit we'll make a

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,760
guessing game.

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,130
We ask the user what's your guess and they might say My guess is nine and then we want to print something

52
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:12,310
out that says your guess of let me add quotes in here your guess of 9 or whatever they guessed.

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,690
UPS Plus guess plus is wrong if we want to do this.

54
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,480
We're going to encounter that problem because guess is a number and it's going to try and add number

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,960
to string to string and either quotation mark or parentheses excuse me.

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,380
But either way it doesn't work because we're working with strings and and we can't add them together.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,690
OK so just be conscientious that there's a solution we'll see in the next video.

58
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,380
The only other thing I'll point out there's an operator that we haven't seen called plus equals.

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,090
It's just a nice little shortcut when you're reassigning variables.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,410
So here's an example.

61
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:58,680
We have string one is equal to ice and I am updating it by adding in Creem spaced cream using plus equals

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,880
that makes a new value of string 1.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,000
Ice space cream.

64
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,290
So rather than having to say string one equals string one plus ice plus cream I'm able to just say plus

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,250
equals.

66
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:19,050
So I could do name equals colds and then rather than if I wanted to add my last name onto this rather

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:27,360
than doing name equals name plus Steele like this whenever you see name equals name plus or variable

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,200
equals the same variable name plus you can replace it with plus equals.

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,050
Just like that name plus equals still.

70
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,660
Now if I look at name it's called Steel.

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,580
So this is concatenation in action but it's not limited to strings.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,360
I could do people because ninety nine and then say people plus equals one.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,230
And now I look at people and it's 100 and with numbers we also have access to things like minus equals

74
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,310
So let's go down by 10.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,730
Look at people now.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,730
So it's taking the value of people and subtracting 10 and re-assigning that two people could even do

77
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,030
multiply or star equals.

78
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,520
Now we look at people and it's 900 and now at this point the word people just looks weird and looks

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,620
like it's spelled wrong to me.

80
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,110
And staring at it too long.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,870
But really this is about concatenation adding two strings together.

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,830
And then this thing at the end about plus equals it's just a nice thing that you'll see me use just

83
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,400
to save some time.

84
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,970
But you do not have to know about or don't have to use.
