00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,810
Welcome back in the last video we talked about how we're using sequel like three as our database is

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,460
lightweight.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,260
It's easy to use and learn and it comes pre-installed on many machines.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,890
So let's let's go through the process of checking if you have it installed.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,460
And if you don't let's follow the steps to actually install it.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,340
Now I will preface this by saying that the people who will have to install it most likely are some Windows

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,370
users and my windows machine right now I only have one at home.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,100
It's completely broken.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,770
I just got it out to see if I could record the installation video with it.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,220
I can't get it to turn on.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,440
So if you are using a PC and you do need to install it I'm going to link you to another video just because

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,780
I want to get this content out and I don't know how long it's going to take for me to actually get my

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,530
PC working or buy a new one.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,780
So with that warning out of the way here's how you can check if you have it installed in your shell

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,170
if you type sequel 3.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,730
You should get something like this and you're prompted change to say sequel lite if it doesn't if you

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,770
know for example if I take this type sequel light instead of sequel 3 it doesn't know what I'm talking

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,240
about.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,300
So that's all you need to do to test it.

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,960
Sequel 3 and then now you're in the prompt.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,040
You'll notice things change and to get out of there you can do control d or quit quit quit.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,020
Yes.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,290
OK so that's what you need to do your test if you have it.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,670
If you don't have it then what you need to do is install it.

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,970
So if you go to sequel.

26
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,230
ORG it's not the most beautiful Web site ever.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,280
You can go to download and it's honestly not very clear.

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,990
The steps you need to go to actually install everything.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,790
They just give you the file to download.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,400
But to get it set up so that you can actually type sequel like in your comment.

31
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,450
Well geez.

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,080
Sequel three prompt others a little more work.

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,830
So I looked around to see if there's any good text tutorials I couldn't find anything very good and

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,130
nothing very recent but this video is well done and it walks you through basically all that you need

35
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,010
to do to install it.

36
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,860
So I'm going to link this tells you if you're on Windows which version to download where to extract

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,800
the files how to name things so that at the very end of the video you can type Seacole light and it

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,470
will load.

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:22,680
Oh and also I should mention that for some of you the prompt will be sequel light on certain PCs and

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,110
on on Macs it's usually sequel 3.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,520
So make sure you try both of those before you go through the steps of installing.

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,850
OK.

43
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,450
So go ahead give it a shot.

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,060
Installing it if you need to.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,140
I know it's going to be annoying but remember it is the least painful of the databases to install.

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,040
And then once you have that working in the next video we'll go over the basics of the syntax and if

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,060
you do not if you aren't able to get it to work I still recommend that you watch the videos on connecting

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,740
to a sequel database because it will apply to other databases.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,760
So if you do have post-arrest installed from a different course for example you could take what I teach

50
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,830
you and sort of you can't copy and paste it and get it to work with postscripts but you could tweak

51
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,690
it and just have to alter a couple of lines in order to get it to work.

52
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,520
So I wouldn't give up entirely if you do run into trouble but we'll keep an eye on the Q&amp;A and see if

53
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,490
those installation instructions are problematic or not.

54
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,040
OK.
