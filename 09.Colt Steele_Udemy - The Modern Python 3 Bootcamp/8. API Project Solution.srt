1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,700
So this video will be a solution video to the previous exercise.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,520
Building the dead dad joke 3000 program and all start by just making a new file called jokes.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,180
Why.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,960
And the first thing we know we need to do is important requests and we're going to have you know requests

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,910
get something and we're going to say we're too variable and we're going to ask the user for input.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,770
So where should we start.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,470
How about we ask the user for input.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,200
Let's just call it term and we'll be get our inputs.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,470
What would you like to search for out a space the end make it a little nicer.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,670
And then let's leave it alone for just a moment.

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,120
Let's make our request and you are all we want is I can has that joke dot com slash search.

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,900
So I'll make another variable called you or well make this a string and we don't need the query string

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,770
at the end.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:09,030
We just want slash search and from here we're going to pass in you Earl and let's see if the response

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,880
to a variable.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,070
So we'll just call it rez equals requests get.

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:23,430
And we could just do our print Raz dot and we could start by doing text like this because remember right

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,340
now we're not asking for Jason we're going to get him back.

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,830
And let's see what happens.

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:39,530
Would you like to search for dog and eventually go all that javascript teenage female that comes back

21
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,050
that the browser would do something with.

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,220
So now let's change it up and actually ask for the Jaisalmer version which the way we do that.

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:57,140
Remember we have headers and we want except application slash Jaison by the way if you wanted to know

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,700
more about that and exactly how it works.

25
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,920
Go to the API documentation and it says API response format all API endpoints follow their respective

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,450
browser URLs but we adjust the response formatting to be more suited for an API based on the provided

27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,150
header and the header is except excepted except headers text slash him.

28
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,020
The default response format.

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,370
So that's what we just got.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,540
Application slash.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,870
Jason that's what we want.

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,470
So this says you know you can specify what you want which we already knew because I showed you that.

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,130
But just so just to be clear if you didn't know that you could find it out here.

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,480
So we want applications slash Jaison.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,550
And now if we try and print red text it doesn't matter what we search for it.

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,640
You can see what we get is the Jason response by the way.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
We're not searching for anything.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,020
So I think it just gives us 20 random jokes and or I think if just all of them and put them on pages.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,540
But anyway.

40
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,180
So this right now is a giant string.

41
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,310
So we need to turn it into Jaison and that's nice and simple.

42
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:09,580
All we do is use the dot Jason method at the end so I'm going to put these on new lines to make it a

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,750
bit easier.

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,700
Put this down at the bottom just like that and we can actually just tack on Jason right here so we could

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,220
make a new variable and call it you know Jason Raz equals red J song.

46
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,590
Or I could just change it on at the bottom like this and I prefer it this way because all we want is

47
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,210
the taste on that comes back.

48
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,880
So let's try it.

49
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,530
Oh we're not printing anything.

50
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,040
Let's print dress now which should now be the Jason version.

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,760
And this is now a python dictionary.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,620
And so we have things like current page limit next page previous page results.

53
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,110
What else.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
Search term status is a bunch of things we have.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,980
So now let's hook up our search term and to do that all we need to do is take the user term right here

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,530
add a comma and then do harams equals and the Parama we want is term which is this is not up to us.

57
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,790
This is how the API is set up.

58
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,610
But this part is a variable.

59
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,020
And we can just specify term and I know it's kind of confusing They're both called term.

60
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,090
So we could change this to user input maybe.

61
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,640
And then here we'll have user input.

62
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm not a fan of shortening that an extra letter doesn't hurt.

63
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,990
OK so now the search term is going to be user input which is the same thing as doing term equals and

64
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,650
then whatever the user inputs.

65
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,290
Let's see if it works.

66
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,490
Oh we actually need to search for something now.

67
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,550
Let's do dog and it looks like we're getting dumb jokes.

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,510
My dog has no nose.

69
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,690
How does he smell awful.

70
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,620
Where do you heard that one.

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,110
I went to the zoo the other day there was only one dog in it.

72
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,790
It was a shit.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,890
You are very funny.

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,480
OK.

75
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,100
So that's getting us results now.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,450
So here's the next thing is we want to take the jokes out and we want to figure out how many there are.

77
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,190
And we have a couple of options.

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,510
If you notice first of all all the jokes are instead of results as a list.

79
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,270
So we can loop through that list or we could just take that list and figure out the length of it could

80
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,480
definitely do that.

81
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:35,790
So we could start there let's just print Reade's results which is a list and let's print the length

82
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,300
of that

83
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,110
and this will tell us how many jokes we got back.

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,610
So if I search for a dog we get eight.

85
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,950
If I search for something that doesn't exist.

86
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,100
Zero.

87
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,540
So that's one option.

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,570
And we could save that to a variable.

89
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:03,010
Call it numb jokes or something and then do if numb jokes is equal to one if it's greater than one.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,450
If it's equal to zero but there's actually an even easier way if we look at what we get back from the

91
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,430
API aside from results after results and which is right.

92
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,230
Here we have search terms dog statuses 200 total jokes is 8.

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:28,080
So we can take we can take advantage of total jokes and just do this number of jokes equals rez total

94
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,790
jokes and that will now allow us to do things like if nothing jokes.

95
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,240
And where should we start.

96
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,250
Let's check first if it's greater than one let's just do a print.

97
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:58,000
There are many jokes if elif jokes is equal to one we can do a print.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There is one joke.

99
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,660
And then finally we'll just do an else well print.

100
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,720
There are no jokes.

101
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,240
So again we're not even using the actual length of the list of results.

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,460
There's a short cut that we get back from the API right here.

103
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,390
Total jokes.

104
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's see if it works.

105
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm going to search for something where there are no jokes we get.

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,410
There are no jokes.

107
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,120
Let's search for something like dog.

108
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,560
I think there was eight.

109
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,770
So there are many jokes and I don't know what.

110
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,540
There's only one joke for I think.

111
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,900
Oh a flower.

112
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,820
I think we tried earlier.

113
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,500
There we go.

114
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,640
There was one joke for flower.

115
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,510
Cool.

116
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,790
So now what's the behavior we want.

117
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
Well the else part is easy.

118
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,960
Let's just change this too.

119
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,220
Sorry.

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,720
Couldn't find a joke with your term.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,270
And then let's let's do student string and then add in.

122
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:06,400
What is it called user and put like that if there's exactly one joke let's just also print rez just

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,820
like this so we can analyze the the way that the response is sent.

124
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,330
So let's try that again with flour and you can see if there's exactly one joke.

125
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,960
It's still inside of something called results and it's a list but there's only one item in that list.

126
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,320
So it still sends it in a list.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,780
And that's important that our API behave.

128
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,750
This API behaves the same way in a predictable manner because if it just decided to send it not in the

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,490
list because there's only one item then it would break our code if we were trying to check for a list.

130
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:49,570
So what we'll do is print response results zero so that's going to be the first item in the list.

131
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,360
Just to double check that.

132
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,500
So we have this whole thing is response or rez results gives us this.

133
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:04,290
And there's one item so we use zero and that gives us this and then that won't even get the exact joke

134
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,990
just yet if I try it again I type flour.

135
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,990
It's still a dictionary and we need that joke key out of there or the value using the joke key.

136
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,760
Then we tack on joke try again.

137
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,260
Do flour and we get don't buy flowers at a monastery but above the law.

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,940
OK.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,800
So now we need to go to this scenario where there are more than many jokes two or eight or 10 results.

140
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,990
We want to pick one at random and the first thing we'll do is import random and there's a couple ways

141
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,970
of picking a random element from a list.

142
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,620
We could generate a number.

143
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,370
Let's say there's no four items in our list.

144
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:52,200
We could generate a number from 0 up to 3 and then use that to access you know the index randomly or

145
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,060
we can use this special method that we get called choice and choice will take a list and it could contain

146
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,340
you know a couple of things in there and it will pick one thing at random and return it from the list.

147
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,780
So that's what I'm going to do and I'm going to do from random import choice because that's all we need.

148
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,100
OK.

149
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,390
So import choice and then down here I'm going to run choice on what what am I going to pick when there's

150
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,950
many results there inside of results.

151
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,460
And this itself is a list.

152
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,700
So I just want to pick one item at random from that list.

153
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,700
So for example here result's goes all the way down to here.

154
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,630
Pick one thing.

155
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,510
So just specified choice of Rez results.

156
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,650
And notice I'm using this variable in more than one place.

157
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:51,790
It would be better in my opinion to refactor this to make a variable called results equals rez results.

158
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,330
So cut that put that there.

159
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:01,560
And then here I can just access that results variable because I'm using it in two places.

160
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,750
So all I'm doing is just saving into variable so I don't have to access that key value pair more than

161
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,390
once.

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,770
And then choice results if I print choice results just like this.

163
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,730
Let's see what we get.

164
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,980
I search for dog.

165
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,630
All right so I just picked one.

166
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,470
What did the dog say to the two trees bark bark.

167
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,370
Same thing for you.

168
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,140
Again we get a different joke.

169
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,730
Why did the cowboy have a wiener dog.

170
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,350
Someone told him to get a long little dog along.

171
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,580
Get along lawn chair get that one.

172
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,340
So we want to do now is access.

173
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,390
Joke.

174
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,300
We don't want to you know print out the ID and all that extra stuff.

175
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,080
We just want the joke and let's change this sort of thing.

176
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,420
There are many jokes let's be specific let's say I found I need to make this an F string.

177
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:56,160
And what is the number of jokes it's called No jokes so let's say something like I found three jokes

178
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,160
about.

179
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:04,080
And then the term that the user entered and then we'll say here's one.

180
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,170
And then print the joke on the next line and then let's do the same thing here and string.

181
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:18,700
I found one joke about and then put in user input OK let's just test it.

182
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,890
I'll start by clearing my screen.

183
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,720
Let's look for Katz says I found five.

184
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,200
Oh I need to put joke five about cat.

185
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,360
Here's one.

186
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,020
Put the cat out.

187
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,290
I didn't realize she's on fire.

188
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,960
Dog found eight.

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,250
About dog here's one.

190
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,200
My dog used to chase people on a bike a lot.

191
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,970
So I had to take his bike away and then search for something that doesn't exist.

192
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,680
Sorry I couldn't find a joke with your term.

193
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,910
Cool.

194
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:52,750
So let me just fix this an ad I found Gnome jokes and put the word jokes in there.

195
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,800
And that's pretty much it for the base functionality.

196
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,160
And then if we wanted to just print a little header up top.

197
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,880
Remember we just want to import.

198
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:09,900
What was it called pi figured out like that and then we'll make a variable called hetter equals and

199
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,040
it's Pi dot and I'm just trying to remember this.

200
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,300
I think it's fuckwitt format.

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,780
And then let's do dad joke 3000 or something.

202
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:25,220
So tell you what you want to call it and we can just print the head or at the very beginning.

203
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,780
OK.

204
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,650
It works.

205
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,950
And let's look for the jokes about dad.

206
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,460
Oops 16.

207
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:39,030
And to make it colored we could also do imports term color and all we want actually from that is from

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,150
term color.

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:50,250
Import colored and to make that we'll just say header equals colored version of Hetter and then let's

210
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,180
set color to be magenta.

211
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,440
My favorite Well close to purple and then will print Hetter see if it works cool.

212
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,460
It works.

213
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:07,240
A little change we can make is just do a from Piglet for piglet format import figment that I called

214
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,010
it piglet format PI Feigley.

215
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,010
Geez.

216
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,920
OK.

217
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,300
And then here we can just change that down to figure that format.

218
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,330
Also a common question is if we should put these on the same line or not.

219
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,310
And according to the most common Python style guide to actually preferred to put them on separate lines

220
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,420
just make sure I didn't break anything.

221
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,820
Try it one more time.

222
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,160
OK.

223
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,970
Everything looks good do kitten.

224
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,640
You're kidding.

225
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,320
Nope no kidding jokes.

226
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,160
All right.

227
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,270
So that's that.

228
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,890
You know we could put this in different functions but it's pretty short as far as you know.

229
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,410
Twenty eight lines or so.

230
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,210
I don't think it really warrants wrapping things up into different functions but you totally could.
