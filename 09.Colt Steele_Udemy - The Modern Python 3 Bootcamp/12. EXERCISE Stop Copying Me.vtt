00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.410
Next up you have a quick exercise using a while loop.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.130
So this is a use case for a while there that we could not duplicate with a for loop.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.660
So the idea is based off of my experiences growing up with my sisters where we'd play this stupid game

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.380
where you would you know copy one another and mimic everything the other person said.

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.160
So in this case we'll start off by asking for input.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980
Can say whatever you want and then a user enters a response and then immediately we get the same response

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
printed out again back and everything they say is duplicated.

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.390
So basically it keeps asking for input and it prints out the exact same thing that is input and then

9
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.560
if you say stop copying me.

10
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.550
And so Lupino say Fine you win.

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.850
Which is highly unrealistic because with my sisters any time you say stop copying me it would just make

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.050
them copy you more.

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.550
But for our example stop copying me is going to be the magic code that ends the game and game is a bit

14
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.120
of a stretch.

15
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.100
So you aspirin put whatever the input is.

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.100
If it's not.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.000
Stop copying me.

18
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.110
You print it back out and you ask for input again and then you print it out.

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.080
Keep going until the user says stop copying me.

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.650
So go ahead and pause that video pause the video and then I'll have a solution right now.

21
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.630
Here I am again.

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.350
Get up to my terminal and I'll make a new file called this one Sister Y and I'll open it up and the

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.070
first thing will do is ask for input.

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:47.340
So let's have a variable called Message equals input say something and then we'll have a while loop

25
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.510
which will say Well message is not equal to stop copying me.

26
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.710
While that's the case we're going to print message back and if I just read this now what would happen.

27
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.720
Well I would get an infinite loop.

28
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.490
It would assuming that I didn't say stop copying me the first time.

29
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.960
But whenever you enter in like applesauce it will print applesauce a million times an infinite number

30
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.740
of times until your computer runs out of memory or it shuts down or you throw the computer out the window.

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.560
So we've got while it's not equal stop copying me print the message.

32
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.080
So we need to update message.

33
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.930
So I'll ask again.

34
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.500
Message equals input and we could just leave it like that without a prompt.

35
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.550
And let's see what happens.

36
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.800
Go back touch her out here.

37
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.110
Let's go with Python 3.

38
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.600
Sister say something so bananas get bananas back.

39
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.990
I type in Hello.

40
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.520
And then let's do stop copying me.

41
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.570
And it ends.

42
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:07.710
So that works what we could also do is at the end add a message that says ugh fine you win rather and

43
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.810
no types of thing.

44
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.520
I always get the same thing back and I said type stop copying me.

45
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.440
Ugh fine you win.

46
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.360
Rather one tiny refactor we could do.

47
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.650
We don't need a separate print.

48
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:33.150
I could just do message like this where we're using the old version of message remember that input.

49
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.940
Well that was to prompt the only thing about that is that we don't get a space

50
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.180
are you there.

51
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.050
Go away.

52
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.500
Stop copying me

53
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.900
so we could do a little string here if we wanted to put message inside of it like this and then add

54
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.060
a space.

55
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.310
Now if I run say something low I now have a newline afterwards.

56
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.320
Anyway it's just a minor change.

57
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.410
Honestly I don't think it's actually worth it to get rid of that print.

58
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.120
But I will put both versions here.

59
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.640
So let's go.

60
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.680
Copy that one.

61
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.030
And then here I'll go back to the old version which was message equals input in the first line was print

62
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.850
message.

63
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.420
OK.

64
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.350
So we are done with this exercise.

65
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.610
Now we're going to move on and talk about something called break.

66
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.510
It's a way of exiting a loop prematurely.

67
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.320
So that's coming up.
