00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.060
Hey there.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.550
So this is the video where we write our first simple python program and it's going to be very straightforward.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.410
A single line of code called the print function.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.860
Very popular first line to write.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.440
We'll use it a lot in the course it just outputs something to our terminal so we can write a message

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.930
and have it print out in our terminal when we run our app or our program.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.750
But the real focus of this video is on the process.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.320
There's a three step process that will repeat.

9
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.780
It sounds like a self-help book but there's three steps we repeat over and over in this course we make

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.700
a new file.

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.800
We write code in the file and then we have to go and execute the file from the command line using the

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.150
python command.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.010
And on a Mac.

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.580
Tina Python 3 because it already comes with Python installed which is python too.

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.730
If you do happen to watch any of the PC videos I just use Python.

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.040
But they'll do the same thing.

17
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.270
So on a Mac Python 3 and then a file name.

18
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.500
So first we need to make a file.

19
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.140
I'm on my desktop and I'm going to make a new directory just called first.

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
I don't know program.

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.870
And then I'm going to CD into first program and then make a new file.

22
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.780
So you don't have to make your file in the same location.

23
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.280
You can make it on your desktop.

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.830
You could make it in your documents folder wherever it is.

25
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.800
Just remember.

26
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.260
So I'm going to make it in this folder and I'm just going to call it hello world.

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.340
P Why so wife made the file.

28
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.700
I can see it here and now I need to open it and sublime.

29
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.510
So step one was making the file Step two is writing stuff in it.

30
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.370
We're going to use sublime to fill it.

31
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.080
And if you're still not comfortable with the command line you could just go to sublime and do file new

32
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.430
file navigate to the correct place when you go to File Save and I'm already saving it to first program

33
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.130
so I just need to give it a.

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.090
Why.

35
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.580
You know second I don't know why I feel that's going to put it there for me but I'm not going to do

36
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.930
that because I prefer to use touch as I did here.

37
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.160
But now we have to get it open and sublime and we have a couple of options.

38
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.430
We could use Finder.

39
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.250
So we leave the terminal open up finder finds the file drag it over.

40
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.760
You can see I'm sorry the font so small but I can't change this part of sublime.

41
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.840
But it says Hello World Cup why I've opened it up and I could write my code inside.

42
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.020
Now if you don't want to use your mouse if you have the SBO command installed from the last video if

43
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.420
that worked for you you can use that.

44
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.530
It opens it up but if that doesn't work you can always just come into sublime go file open and then

45
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.920
find the file that you want to open like that.

46
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.980
So however you do it.

47
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.800
We need to open this file so you need to make it using sublime or using the terminal.

48
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.840
And then we need to open it using the terminal or Husing supply and we're going to add our first line

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.010
of code which is print.

50
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.360
So this has to be a p y file for this to work print.

51
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.840
And then let's just say hello world.

52
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.620
We can put anything we want in here.

53
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.990
Well virtually we'll see some restrictions later and it will be printed out in our terminal when we

54
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.120
execute this.

55
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.780
So we need to save the file.

56
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.420
Sublime shows you that you haven't saved this if there's a circle there and when it's hit save right

57
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.190
now command s as you can see it change to an X but if it makes some changes.

58
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.740
It now says it's unsaved.

59
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.000
Just make sure you save before you want to run your new code.

60
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.270
So now we need to go back to my terminal and I'm in the correct directory.

61
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.630
If you're not in the same directory as your file you need to change directory and find it UCD as many

62
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.420
times as you need to find the correct file.

63
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.540
And then we execute Python 3.

64
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.120
Hello world Scott P Y.

65
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.760
And this is the third step in the process.

66
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.110
So one was make the file to put code in it three execute it and there we go.

67
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.200
It prints out Hello world very silly.

68
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.630
You know you could add two of them and change this one to be.

69
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.060
Goodbye world.

70
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.720
The shortcut I use there by the way to duplicate was command shift D whatever line you're on.

71
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.760
It will be automatically duplicated.

72
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.730
Very useful in sublimer at least.

73
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.760
So I need to save go back to my terminal use the up arrow to recall the same line and run it again.

74
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.060
So that's it.

75
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.950
The takeaways from this video are one python three space file name a dot y file if you try and run another

76
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.320
file it's not going to work.

77
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.240
It's not going to encounter the Python code that expects and will throw an error but this should work

78
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.760
assuming that there's something in here and there is.

79
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.120
Prince Prince of the world and then goodbye world.

80
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.230
Print is known as a function.

81
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390
We'll talk a lot more about it later on in the course.

82
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.670
We'll read our own functions.

83
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.010
Spend a lot of time with print so that isn't the main focus of the video.

84
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.620
It's really more about the process.

85
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.070
So make sure before you move on that you're able to make a new file and sublime put code in it and execute

86
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.800
it even if it takes you while even if it's ugly you don't do it on the command line like I did.

87
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.770
That's OK.

88
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.620
Just make sure that you can run it at the end of the day.

89
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.160
All right.
