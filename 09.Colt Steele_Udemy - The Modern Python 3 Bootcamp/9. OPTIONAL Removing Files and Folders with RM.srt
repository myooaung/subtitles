00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,500
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,930
So we have two other commands to quickly cover that have to do with removing files and removing folders

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,270
or directories.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,070
Neither of these are going to be essential.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,310
Just like you know creating a file you could do that using your text editor.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,770
You can drag and drop files and folders to the recycling bin to remove them.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,500
I think you can also right click and delete them.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,600
But just to be consistent with what I showed in the Mac section the Linux section I'm going to show

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,500
you how this works using command line using the power shell.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,130
So the command is very simple to remove a single file r.m for a remove and then a space and the name

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,160
of the file.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,980
Unfortunately to remove a directory it is a little more complex.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,300
We have to run this command Ahram.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,540
But we also have to tack on dash our dash f o.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,850
So the dash R means recursive.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,620
If you're not familiar with recursion just think of it as it's telling Power Shell to delete everything

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,330
inside of that folder and any potential contents of sub folders and keep going all the way down until

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,640
it's totally empty.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,410
So instead of just deleting the first level delete every Buffle afterwards and then the dash F O stands

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,610
for force which is telling it to prevent warnings.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,760
Just go.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,570
Just delete it.

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,130
So you do have to be pretty careful with this command.

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,320
It is dangerous if you ran this on your home directory or your root directory and you deleted that.

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,670
I'm not sure if it would allow you to delete your route.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,770
I've never tried that.

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,870
I have no idea what would happen if you tried to delete some folder nothing is going to stop you.

28
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,110
It's just going to go and that's obviously very bad.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,850
So just be careful with it.

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,970
Fortunately it is hard to type this right.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,560
You're not going to accidentally type Ahram and space dash or space dash F O and then the name for directory.

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,100
But you just want to be careful anyway.

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,710
Let's do a quick demonstration.

34
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,440
Look at Power Shell open here.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,600
I've got the gooey here so you can just see in real time what happens.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,840
If I didn't want this Swing's file for example you know I could drag it up there to the recycle bin

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:19,150
or I come over here make sure I'm in the same directory playground and type r.m space Swing's and it

38
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,010
disappears.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,270
I type ls and it's gone.

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,820
It's no longer over here.

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,420
Also if I look in the recycling bin it's not in here.

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,750
It circumvents that it is gone gone.

43
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,460
So be careful.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,970
That's r.m you know I can show you can delete another file called monkey bars.

45
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,930
There it goes to delete a folder as we saw first and need a folder to delete.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,410
So let's delete the entire playground directory that has these two things in it.

47
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,010
And to do that it's r.m.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,940
But then I need to do the dash.

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,810
Our dash f o.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,130
And then this is where it could be dangerous if you typed Tildy for example or an absolute path to a

51
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,520
different directory and you hit enter.

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,400
It would delete it.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,750
I've never tried it and I'm not going to verify.

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,780
I mean maybe there's some sort of protection that doesn't allow you to delete certain system folders.

55
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,510
I kind of doubt it though.

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,700
So be careful but we're going to type the name of that folder which is playground.

57
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,370
There we go.

58
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,870
So P tab will auto complete to dot backslash playground.

59
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:34,090
I hit enter and our window changes entirely because the folder I was in is gone for I type ls.

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,790
There is no longer a playground directory.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,230
So that's it for deleting single files and deleting entire directories that directory playground only

62
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,700
had a couple of files in it.

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,030
But if it had 10 other sub folders nested in a hierarchy they all would be gone and whatever they had

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,990
inside would all be gone.

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,650
All right.

66
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,380
So if you're new to power shell into the command line in general this section could have been a bit

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,420
overwhelming.

68
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,320
I was very apprehensive about putting this the beginning of the course.

69
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,160
If you're new to this I think it could really be discouraging.

70
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,970
So please hang in there.

71
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:16,730
All you really need to know are Ls and PWT and CD and you can combine those three things especially

72
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,340
the CD in LS to move and to find a file so that we can eventually execute it.

73
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,100
Then you're golden.

74
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,520
You can do everything else using your Kuei using subcontext or whatever you want to use which will cover

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,860
in the next section.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,770
After this here's a quick quiz which is just meant meant to enforce some of the things we learned.

77
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,010
You don't have to do it if you don't care about you know the details of creating and removing folders

78
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,830
and files.

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,540
Move on to installation.

80
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,670
Thank you for bearing with me.

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,080
I'll see you in the next section.
