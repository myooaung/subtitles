Hello welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,400
This is just a quick video inserted before the actual content because I want to make it very clear that

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,620
this section is optional.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,760
Yes I said it seven times here.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,090
I just want to be very very clear you do not have to do this section.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,960
It's all on HTP how we work with the Internet within Python how we can request data from an API.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,690
I added it in now because it is a fun topic for people who are interested in it.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,470
It's something that I think can break up the monotony of learning a new concept after new concept and

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,740
just doing a bunch of the smaller exercises you'll learn in this video or in this section how to do

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,770
some more substantial things like send an HTP request to an API get data back parse it as Jason and

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,020
then do something with it.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,500
For some people I think that is exciting.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,580
I know from my previous experience it is an exciting thing but for other people this may seem like something

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,920
that's unnecessary if you don't care about the web.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,230
If you're only passionate about data or you want to get through this course so that you can start working

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,570
on your own project and it doesn't have to do with HTP requests then skip this.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,290
So I don't want to hold you hostage and make you sit through the section because it is longer.

18
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,950
It's not necessarily harder but I have to cover some background information about the Web.

19
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,350
So I just want to be very very upfront.

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,000
Also if you're interested in the web scraping section later in the course you'll definitely want to

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,450
at least run through this section quickly because we have to make requests in the web scraping section.

22
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,210
So we use what we cover and this section anyway.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,080
I will shut up.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:40,350
But just remember optional if it bores you if you don't care if you start that section and then you

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,880
feel like it's not for you.

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,260
No shame in skipping.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,220
I mean there's no shame in skipping in general but I'm officially saying it's OK.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,180
Yeah I'll shut up now and we'll get on with the content.
