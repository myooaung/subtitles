00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,380
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,490
So this video is about moving and renaming files and directories and you might be wondering why they're

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,860
together in one video.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,360
And it's because they actually share the exact same command.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,720
That command is move or M V.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,530
So M.V. again can be used to move files.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,750
It's a little more obvious but it can also be used to rename files.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,630
So the way that it works is that there are two arguments you give it a source file.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,120
The one that you're targeting and then a destination where you want to move it to or how you want to

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,260
rename it.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,610
So if the destination is in a different folder the file would be moved to that folder.

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,390
If the destination is a new name in the same folder it will rename it and if it's both if it's a different

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,250
name and it's in a different folder it will rename the the target file and then move it.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,440
So let's take a look at an example where in the directory cat pics as signified this little arrow inside

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
of cat pics there was a file called faves.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,720
T.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:11,420
Ok so if we write M.V. faves that takes t space goat greatest of all time t XTi.

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,710
But this will do is act to rename faves that t XTi to go to next to you without moving it anywhere.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,020
It's in the same destination folder but you've just changed the name so you can see by the diagram the

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,040
name has been changed.

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,450
If we type LS now from inside cat pics there is no longer a favor x.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,180
It's just gote that text.

23
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,860
Ok so then the second use case is something like this.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,410
M.V. greatest of all time t s t.

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,210
And then rather than providing a new name or providing a different directory.

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,180
In this case the parent directory signified by two dots as we've seen before with the CD dot dot.

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,270
So this will just move the graceful time that takes the file back into the stuff directory.

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,860
As this arrow shows slides and if you type LS now it's gone.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,710
There's nothing in cat pics.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,580
And if we back out one level with C.D dot dot and type LS again.

31
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,430
Now we can see instead of stuff we have the cat picks directory and now the go text file that has been

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,970
moved there.

33
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,590
So that's really all there is to move.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,840
I'd say the trickiest thing about it is just remembering what comes first the target file or directory

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,940
that you're trying to move or rename comes first and then the second argument is the destination or

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,860
the new name or both.

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,520
So let's give it a shot.

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,010
I mean my terminal again.

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,060
I'm on the desktop this time.

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,710
And let's go into my cat photos directory.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,400
I must say I want to rename one of these so I have a file called Kiddie.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,160
One got jpeg and I want to rename it to be something a little bit more expressive rather than Kitty

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,770
one.

44
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,920
Let's take a look at what that file is.

45
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,360
So that's my new kitty still unnamed at this point.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,540
Just call her Kitty.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
Let's rename this file.

48
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,730
Sleepy Kitty.

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
So M.V..

50
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,650
And then the file We're targeting Kitty one that JPEG space and then what I want to rename it to.

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,210
So let's do sleepy kitty.

52
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,970
Jay peg.

53
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,060
OK let's type LS now and you can see there's no longer Kitty one.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,660
J peg.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,330
We just have sleepy kitty J peg.

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,670
All right so that's the first use case and the second one is to move files around.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,130
Let's back out.

58
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,410
I'm going to go to dog photos this time and I have inside of.

59
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:42,360
Let's look at CD Rustie pics or ls resti pics and tell us why it picks OK.

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:49,740
Nothing is in white X so let's move the puppy photo which is inside of rusty pics and put it inside

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,500
of Wyatt pics.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,350
Ok so the way that we're going to do that is M.V. and because we're inside of dog photos right now.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,520
So let me make this a little clearer.

64
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,540
We're in this directory and I want to target this puppydog jpg file.

65
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,290
So that needs to be rusty pick's slash puppydog JPEG use tab autocomplete to help you out.

66
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,150
And then where are we moving it to.

67
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,860
You want to move it to y it picks just like that.

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,550
So let's type us OK let's look inside rusty pics.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,860
It's not there anymore.

70
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,010
What about in white.

71
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,670
There we go.

72
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,720
So we moved that file.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,090
OK let's move it back just to show you and rename it to be rusty puppy.

74
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:49,430
So to do that from where I am right now I'm still on set of dog photos we're going to do the Wyatt picks

75
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,870
slash puppydog a peg and we're moving it to Rusty picks but we're going to add in a new filename and

76
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,280
this time we'll do resti puppy.

77
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,120
Jay.

78
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,230
So previously we just specified the directory and it moved the file and kept the name as puppydog J

79
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,380
peg this time and doing both.

80
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,050
And now let's look at Rusty pics and you can see it's called Rusty puppydog Jay peg.

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,250
And if we look at why it picks there's no photos there.

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,870
OK.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,240
So again wrap this up with Move it can move files it can rename files and it can do both and it can

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,920
do that to directories as well which I didn't show but I won't make you watch me do that.
