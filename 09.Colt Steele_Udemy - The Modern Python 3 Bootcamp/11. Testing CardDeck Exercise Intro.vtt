00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.350
You will come back.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.310
This video is really just an exercise intro along with a potential solution walk through at the end.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.940
Unfortunately I haven't found a way to write tests that will test your tests to me.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:14.940
Coding editor.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.700
So I don't have any interactive challenges yet.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.430
I'm working on a couple ways of getting around it of parsing the output from tests.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.020
But it's kind of precise.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.220
So for now I want to just have something that is more of a substantial exercise.

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.750
OK.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.430
So what we're going to do is write tests for our card and deck class from earlier in the course.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.110
And if you don't if you didn't do those or if you've lost them you need a solution.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.990
You can just start with the demo deck in card or my solution to at least to have them in two files just

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:53.160
to refresh your memory a card has a certain value and deck has a whole bunch of cards in a list 52 of

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.810
them for each suit and value ace through King.

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.810
And there's methods like reset count deal shuffle deal card deal hand.

16
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.580
OK.

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.450
So your task is to write tests and ideally you'll have tests that cover everything.

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.810
So for cards that's simple to just cover and knit.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.880
And then the representation are the PR for deck.

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.830
It's a bit more complex because we have a net.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120
We have our PR we have count.

22
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.240
We were testing the underscore deal method in a couple of different ways.

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.090
If you try to deal when there are enough cards or if you try and deal too many cards then you know we

24
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.800
test to see what happens.

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.400
We also test to see if there's no cards that an error is thrown.

26
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.670
You test that dealing a single card works with Deal card deal hand works.

27
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.830
We see that shuffle works and I will point out that shuffle is a bit difficult to test because of the

28
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.650
randomness.

29
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.410
So you don't need to shuffle or you don't need to test you know that this equals something else afterwards.

30
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.490
It's easier to test that something changed.

31
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.560
So the length is the same but the elements inside are different or they're in a different order rather

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.430
than directly trying to figure out what the end result of the shuffle is anyway.

33
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.640
So I guess I just flashed my entire solution.

34
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.120
If you want to just take a look.

35
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.040
This is really more about the process of writing the tests.

36
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130
So there's a lot here if you want to be thorough.

37
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.370
The actual assignment is to have full coverage for each method on deck and on card give it a shot and

38
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.440
then we'll just walk through my solution.

39
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.900
And lastly I'll show you if I run them you can see you know 12 Tests.

40
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.000
I have 12 test functions that are passing and they all have nice comments and messages cards should

41
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.060
have a certain value.

42
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.810
OK.

43
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220
Count should return a count of the number of cards in the deck.

44
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.020
OK.

45
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680
Shuffle should throw a value error.

46
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.850
If the deck is in full OK.

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.480
And with that all set you loose.

48
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.960
If you want to try this.

49
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.680
All right.

50
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.470
So that's the assignment again.

51
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.760
If you don't have those card classes ready that card deck classes you can just download from this video

52
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.900
as resources.

53
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.670
You can also download my test solution but I recommend that you try writing your test first and the

54
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.260
next video.

55
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.580
I will do a walkthrough of my solution.
