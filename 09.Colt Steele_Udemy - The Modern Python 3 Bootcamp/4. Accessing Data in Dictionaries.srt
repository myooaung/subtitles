1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,430
If you remember in the last section we saw how to create lists and then we had to get the data back

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,370
out using those square brackets the list brackets above the what are they called just above the return

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,770
key.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,150
Well we actually used the same syntax.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,930
So if we had this instructor here this instructor dictionary all we do to get the value out we pass

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,190
in a key.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,590
So this is where the term dictionary comes from or where I think it comes from at least in the sense

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,740
that all this information is stored like a dictionary.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,520
So if you imagine the actual physical dictionary if you've seen one if they still exist in this world.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,540
So let's say I don't know the definition of the word.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,610
I don't know.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,360
Rooster.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,250
So I flip through the dictionary until I find rooster.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,960
That is the key that I have and I'm looking for the corresponding value and then I read in a colloquial

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,440
term for male chicken.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,590
I don't know if I have no idea what the actual definition is.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,690
And but the key thing is that we have a key and then we get a value.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,720
Same idea here but rather than definitions of words we're looking for all sorts of data.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,830
So we pass it in just like we did with lists instead of square brackets but unlike lists where we only

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,140
have numbers you know 0 1 2 3 as the indices.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,790
Those are the keys with a dictionary we can use any any string or a number if it's in the dictionary

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,030
to find the corresponding value.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,750
So we pass in the key and we get a value out or if we look for something that doesn't exist in there

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,510
we get an error.

25
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,200
So let's try it now.

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:42,870
So we have cat and if I want to know cat's age I would just do cat age.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,260
I do need the quotes because it is a string.

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,960
I just do this.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,860
It's going to try and use a variable gauge.

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,620
I could do this though.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,370
This is this is good to know.

32
00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:00,700
Let's say I had a variable called property because the string is cute ok.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,030
I can pass that into cat property so I could use a variable.

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,970
And I get true.

35
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,360
So it's it's basically property is cute we're passing in is cute and we're getting true.

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,000
And if I tried to do cat of some key that doesn't exist like breed I get a key error.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,140
And that's pretty much it to getting data out.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,250
You use the key so the key is always going to be the piece of information that are almost always the

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,480
piece of information you have that you were trying to retrieve the corresponding value blessing.

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,520
And there is a more forgiving way a method will learn that allows us to basically ask if a certain thing

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,520
exists in the dictionary because right now if we weren't sure and we were looking for let's say we're

42
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,910
looking for a property here.

43
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,770
City and city doesn't exist.

44
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,350
It throws an error.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,050
So is there a way for us to tentatively say hey is there a city in there please give it to me.

46
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,470
OK.

47
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,300
So that concludes the intro to dictionaries.

48
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,610
Next we're going to learn about iterating over them looping over them.

49
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,650
It's a bit different than iterating over a list because there's multiple pieces of data we have to worry

50
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,140
about keys and values.

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,100
So we'll get to that.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,750
But for now hopefully this video made it clear how lists and dictionaries are both data structures they

53
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,500
store other other types other or other types of data.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,420
But in very different ways.

55
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,900
And don't forget key value pairs.

56
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,320
That's a big take of a key value pairs.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,340
OK we'll go way by.
