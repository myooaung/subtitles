1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,480
A welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,010
So this video we're going to talk about the different modes for working with files.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,590
We've already seen to that default which is our Which you never actually manually typed but the a default

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,710
value which allows for reading from a file and then W in the last value which stands for right.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,470
And that worked to write to a file.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,010
But the problem was that it overwrote whatever used to be in there and the existing contents are erased.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,630
So there are other modes.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,380
And actually if we go to the built in functions on the docks click on the open there is a chart here

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
that shows you there's quite a few We've already seen.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,650
R and W now we're going to talk about a couple of others just the commonly used ones.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,830
We're not going to talk about things like binary mode but if you are curious just know you can come

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,990
to the docks and not only is there a good explanation of open here but it also goes into detail on the

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,930
different modes.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
But I'll just highlight the commonly used ones.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,750
So first up are we've already seen that doesn't allow you to write to the file to a default value w

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,000
writes to a file overrides or overwrites whatever was in the file before.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,210
Next is a stands for append.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,650
So what append will do is allow us to add contents to the end of a file.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,850
It won't overwrite what used to be in there.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,690
It just keeps adding on to the end.

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,920
So for example we have this haiku that ticks the file already.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,180
And if I ran this code with w it would overwrite it.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,420
But if I simply change it to the letter A and I run the file.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,740
Now I go back to high kuda to 60.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,230
You can see that this was the existing contents.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,470
Right here up until there and then this has everything new.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,260
Oh no I just messed it up.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,630
There you go.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,630
This was everything new that we added in and so it just appended to the end.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,040
And then this is where cursor stops.

31
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,450
Anything else they add in.

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,340
Let's do one more.

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,130
Let's do something simple file that right.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,580
Appending later save.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,590
Rerun go back to our file and it's on the same line because we are in append mode and if we didn't want

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,840
things to be on the same line like this the better approach.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,880
So we just use the newline character.

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,360
But the better approach is to put it at the end here rather than putting at the beginning of whatever

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,590
we add next.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,900
It doesn't really matter but ideally we should have done this.

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,750
Put that new character there.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,220
Run it go back.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,090
OK so it added to the same line but now our cursor is here and in Python I mean not the bottom cursor.

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,060
Now if I did something else like just a simple little happy face.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,460
One more time.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,910
It's on the new line.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,750
So this is append and that works well.

48
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,430
But what if you want it to go back and add something up to the top.

49
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,270
What we could do is use seek right and do something like this file about 6 0 and then let's add another

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,740
smiley face up top.

51
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,380
And so what should happen or what we think.

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,000
Well OK I'm kind of setting it up here but what you might expect to happen is that our cursor and move

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,570
appear.

54
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,030
We had a happy face but because it's append mode it just adds it to the end so we don't actually have

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,160
control over where the cursor is.

56
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,850
It's appending always to the end no matter what.

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,250
So definitely worth knowing there's a shortcoming to append mode that brings us to our next and final

58
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,220
mode which is our plus.

59
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,440
Read and write to a file and we can use a cursor.

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,590
So our plus is really commonly used in my experience at least if you're working with existing files

61
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,360
that already have stuff in them.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,430
If you need to go and make changes or insert things somewhere else in the file rather than just to the

63
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,940
end.

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,540
OK so let's test it out.

65
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm back in the same file as before.

66
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,020
I have the W version retried.

67
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,740
If the A to append.

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,310
Now here I've added r plus.

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,340
I should note I kind of messed up a file and accidentally overwrote the existing contents in between

70
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,500
recording the videos.

71
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,950
So I just added a new line says I was here first and now if we use our Plus I'm just going to leave

72
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:21,810
it like this added using are plus and just a single line open same file our Plus file but right let's

73
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,740
see what happens.

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,720
I run the code.

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,480
Let's go look and look what happened.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,780
Two things to note.

77
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,970
The first is that it was added at the beginning of the file by default.

78
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,770
I didn't have to specify to seek zero to append is automatically going to or by default.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,360
Actually append only can add to the end of the file.

80
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,020
But if we use our Plus it will start off with the cursor at the beginning at zero.

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,040
But we also can move it around.

82
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,460
The second thing you should notice though is that we also overwrote what was here before.

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,310
So you do need to be aware of the fact that if you if your cursor is here and you're adding text it's

84
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,280
not just going to insert your text and then shift things over.

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,690
It's going to overwrite.

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,530
OK.

87
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:12,940
So if we go back now and delete this and just say I was here first again go back here and we can add

88
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,890
this at the beginning.

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:23,530
Let's do a smiley face lets you smiley face and then let's do file but seek to.

90
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,010
I don't know.

91
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:33,780
Let's go to position 10 and do a filed out right and do a sad face.

92
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,470
OK.

93
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,750
So we started the beginning at a happy face.

94
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,010
Move to ten.

95
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,590
Move the cursor over and then write a sad face on the code.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,690
Hop on back.

97
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,100
You can see here's her happy face.

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,810
And here's her sad face.

99
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,460
OK.

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,000
So hopefully that shows the behavior of these different file modes.

101
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,240
So if you are only adding to the end of a file that's all that you're doing and use append.

102
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,680
You don't have to worry about overwriting things you're just always adding to the end.

103
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,730
Obviously if you're just reading you don't even have to specify that if you are solely writing and you

104
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,940
want to overwrite the contents then use W and if you need to be able to update things or overwrite at

105
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,220
will and move the cursor and you can use our plus.

106
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:22,800
Oh and one last thing if we try and do file that right here let me do one more with our plus to a nonexisting

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,970
file.

108
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,090
Like I don't know.

109
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,760
Hello.

110
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,790
T t r plus.

111
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,340
And I just want to write Hello in there like this.

112
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,180
If I run it there isn't a hello to textfile if I run it now.

113
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,740
We actually get an error file not found no such file or directory hello that text t but when we used

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,310
w or for use a actually and I rerun that.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,230
You'll see it actually creates hello that text for me.

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,370
So that's one thing to be aware of our Plus is only going to work with an existing file.

117
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,550
The idea is that you're updating an existing file but with the plus really means versus a it's going

118
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,420
to end w will both make any file if it doesn't find it.

119
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,740
So just be aware of that.

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,010
Oh the joys of file modes.

121
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,600
All right.

122
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,870
So I just added a comment here that says our Plus will not create a file if it doesn't exist and we

123
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,200
are done with this video.
