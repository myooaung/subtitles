00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,320
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,950
Time for a brand new section here all on file IO.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,590
So file input and output.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,770
So we've been working with python files obviously at this point including multiple files that are all

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,410
python files and that's great but this section is all about working with files that aren't python files

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,780
that don't necessarily contain code.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,190
And this is a really well everything's important in this course in my opinion.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,040
But let's be honest some things definitely are more important than others and file IO is crucial if

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,950
you're interested in things like data science or web development for example in data science.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,770
A lot of the stuff that people work on it depends on the project and the company or what they're doing.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,320
But a lot of the time you're working with data sets.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,040
And for example it might be a publicly available data set from the New York City crime statistics whatever

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,010
whoever puts those out there might be a big data set of thousands and thousands of lines in a CSP file

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,830
for example that has all the you know crime data from the last 10 years in New York and you could analyze

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,090
it with Python and spit something out or in web development.

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,040
A lot of the time you know you're working with H.T. mail and Javascript and CSSA files.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,810
You'll need to read those files in from CSSA file into your Python code and then send the contents somewhere

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,600
else.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,070
That's just one example.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,060
Or you know there are people who actually write entire books using Python and Python will generate PTF

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,560
files for example and it needs to be able to make those files and save those files.

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,270
Ok so all that stuff are not going to get into making books and data science just yet.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,980
But let me talk about what we will get into in this section.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,720
So we're going to talk about things like reading basic files in writing basic files so adding content

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,450
in and saving it.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,090
We'll talk about an alternate syntax using the with blocks to read and write to and from files will

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,820
describe different ways of opening a file and some of the nuances around all of this.

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,960
And then we'll focus on two data formats.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,380
The first one is C S V.

30
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,760
So comma separated values very common data format.

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,840
We'll talk about how to read C S V and right to see Esrey files.

32
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,800
And I didn't add this in here but we'll also talk about Jaison javascript object notation.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,840
A really common data format as well.

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,840
And we'll talk about how Jason interfaces with meshes with Python and how to read and write.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,360
All right.

36
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,150
So in the next video we'll dive right in to reading basic files.
