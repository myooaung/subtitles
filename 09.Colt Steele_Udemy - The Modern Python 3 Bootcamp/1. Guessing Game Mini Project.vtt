00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.040
All right.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.780
So this section is going to be really quick just about three videos and it's basically an extension

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.910
or an add on to the previous section.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.350
It's like a bonus pack where rather than just doing some basic loops exercises I wanted to add in some

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650
more substantial things that we can do with loops.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.970
But I felt the last section was getting too long I didn't want to bloat it.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
So this is its own section really about too many projects using loops.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
So the first one is going to be a simple guessing game where a computer a computer picks a random number

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370
and you try and guess it will give you a hint.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.630
If you're too high or too low until you finally get it and then after that we're going to make our rock

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.440
paper scissors game a lot more playable more interesting so you'll be able to actually play against

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.960
a computer it will keep score of who wins and you can do best to add three or you know first person

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.780
to hit five or 10 or whatever it is you can set a milestone and you'll continue to play in a loop with

14
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470
the computer until somebody wins overall.

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.700
But to start and we're doing the guessing game.

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.130
So let me show it to you first.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.800
If I run my solution I'm guessing that's why the computer picks a number from 1 to 10.

18
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.740
And now it's my turn to guess it.

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.730
So I'll start with five.

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.190
So I was too low.

21
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.400
So let's try again this time let's do nine.

22
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.100
Oh I got it.

23
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690
So let me do one more.

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.500
By the way you can see it asks if I want to play again if I want to keep playing.

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.170
If I hit why it keeps going so this time let's get five again too high.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.270
Let's do one.

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.320
I guess that again.

28
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.440
So notice that it tells me too low or too high depending on if I'm too low or too high.

29
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.430
And it also tells me you guessed that you won and I can keep playing and this will keep going forever

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920
as long as I type Y.

31
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.720
But as soon as that type N says thanks for playing and it quits out.

32
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.200
So that's a basic game play.

33
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.270
This is the starter code and really the reason I gave you started code is that we haven't talked about

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.460
how to do random numbers.

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.110
What we did actually talk about it in the more advanced version of the rock paper scissors project.

36
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.660
But if you skip that totally fine.

37
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.620
This is how you generate a random number.

38
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.400
So we haven't talked about modules we're importing really.

39
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.680
So I'm not going to go into it.

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.910
But this is a bit of code we include.

41
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.260
It's part of Python but we don't get it by default out of the box.

42
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.800
We have to reach out and say hey I want that one piece called random.

43
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.410
And then within random there's a function called Rand int and we pass in a start at the beginning.

44
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.810
So a 1 and then a high point 10 and it will generate numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive which drives me

45
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.680
insane because ranges are exclusive but rant is inclusive.

46
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.010
So this every time we call it will generate a random number save it to that variable.

47
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700
So then it's up to you to then ask the user for guesses.

48
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
You need to use a loop to continue asking for guesses while they are wrong while the user has not guessed

49
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.570
the random number.

50
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.820
And as a bonus you don't have to do this but it's good practice to basically keep playing if if the

51
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.610
user enters y after the game is over.

52
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.430
And to break out and you can use break if they type.

53
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.760
And so there's a couple of ways of structuring this but you'll need to use at least one loop and a couple

54
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.630
of conditionals.

55
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.500
All right.

56
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.100
So in the next video we'll go over a solution.
