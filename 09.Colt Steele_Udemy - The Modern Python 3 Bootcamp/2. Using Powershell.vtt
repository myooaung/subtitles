00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.340
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.270
In this video we're going to dive into some of the first commands will open up the power show and start

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.370
typing some code.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
But first I just want to dive into some of the key differences that you'll encounter if you're using

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.110
a PC compared to using a Mac.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.820
So Macs and Linux operating systems basically anything that isn't a PC.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.490
Both happened to be based on something called Unix which means that they share almost all of the same

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890
terminal terminal commands.

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.570
So if you have a Mac and another student is using a Linux machine the commands that you use to make

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.990
to make a new file or to make a new folder are the same.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.810
Unfortunately that's not true on a PC.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.070
Instead Windows has an entirely different kernel which is think of it as the thing it's based on top

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.410
of.

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.900
So Mac and Linux are based on Unix.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.160
Windows has its own kernel and in the past it's always had its own command line syntax totally different

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.080
commands for M-S DOS.

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.500
If you've heard of that and something called command prompt.

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.870
Fortunately for us there is an alternative called Power show.

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.570
So power show allows PC users to type Unix like commands on a PC.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.670
So you don't have to have a Mac you don't have to have a Linux machine to be able to use.

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.690
Not exactly the same but very similar commands to what I'm going to be using in this course and what

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.280
all the other students will be using.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.840
Not to mention the fact that it's what most developers use as well.

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.680
Unfortunately power show now ships with all modern Windows computers since Windows 7 so didn't used

25
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.180
to.

26
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.570
Which would have made this a little more tricky to install it but nowadays your computer should have

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
power shell automatically installed bundled for free.

28
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.900
All you have to do is open up if the start power show will show that in just a sec and then we can start

29
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.450
typing the commands.

30
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.950
So this section is for PC users.

31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.340
They have another section on commands for Mac and Linux users and you'll see that things are very very

32
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.030
similar.

33
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.910
There are just a couple of slight differences so I did decide to break into two different sections but

34
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.130
throughout the course I will be using a Mac but all the commands that I use you'll be able to use on

35
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.000
your computer.

36
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.430
If you are a PC user but I figured it would be better to make a seperate video or separate series for

37
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.890
PC users just so that you can see what it looks like on your type of machine rather than having to watch

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100
the whole course on on a Mac.

39
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.470
So as far as opening up the power show I'm not an expert Windows user I'm just come down here and click

40
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.160
and type.

41
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.100
Power show or power and it pops up and this is it.

42
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.720
This is the power shop.

43
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.940
OK so I can start typing commands right away.

44
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.180
I mean I can type jibberish and I get an error back telling me I don't know what you're talking about

45
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.510
so that tells us there are only particular keywords that we can type in one example.

46
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.660
I'll show you right now is the LS keyword it stands for list and it just shows the contents of the folder

47
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.040
you're currently in.

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.340
And you can see the path listed here in the next video.

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.100
We'll talk more about paths but you can see it here that I am in a directory called Colt in the user's

50
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.230
directory in C..

51
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.020
C-drive.

52
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.140
So if I type LS It will show me the contents of that.

53
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.460
So there's the desktop documents downloads favorites links music wonderkid pictures and so on.

54
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.710
These are the contents of my User folder of the colt directory on this PC.

55
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.860
So what you see will probably be different.

56
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.420
You might have some of the same stuff like desktops and documents and downloads but you might have added

57
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.620
or removed other directories here.

58
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.930
So this is how we launch power show.

59
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.240
But I'll just contrast that with if you use the command prompts.

60
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.870
Which is kind of the windows flavored thing.

61
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.900
This is imitating Macs or a Linux machine.

62
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.550
This is what you get on a PC.

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.280
If I tried to type LS here it tells me it's not recognized as a command.

64
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.170
So that would make for a bad experience if you're following along in the course using the command prompt.

65
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.060
Unless you happen to know it already but I will be using commands like ls on my Mac.

66
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.490
So if you're using power shell you can also use LS When I use it.

67
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.720
OK so on the video here we just opened a power shall we talk about what it is.

68
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.460
It is an alternative to the built in command prompt.

69
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.410
It matches the syntax for the most part.

70
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.960
Not 100 percent but very close to what I'll be using on my Mac so it should make for a better experience

71
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.840
for you to use.

72
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.650
And it's also what most developers on PCs are using these days unless they actually install their own

73
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.750
Unix based virtual machine which is a whole other can of worms to open up.

74
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.460
So for now we're sticking to power show.

75
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.040
This is a python course anyway.

76
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.560
So the focus will be on Python in just a couple of videos.

77
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.660
Will be a python land.

78
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.280
Fortunately.
