00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.590
All right.

2
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.820
So I'd like to quickly talk about the exercises in this course.

4
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.150
As you watch the promo video you saw there are a ton of exercises.

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.090
That's what makes this course unique.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.770
It's what I'm most excited about.

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.110
But I need to make a quick video to explain a couple of things about them.

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
So the Course is full of exercises there's tons of them between quizzes and interactive coding exercises

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.310
should keep you busy for a while but they aren't distributed evenly across the course.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.860
Unfortunately you know I wish I could have Tunder really exciting exercises early on but the way that

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.690
works we just don't know enough at the beginning of the course.

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.930
So early on you know in the intro section right now there's no exercises.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.350
Then we talked about the command line numbers operators and comments.

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.990
We get a few more exercises and they're variables and strings.

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.230
We start to open up a bit and then afterwards that's where the bulk of the exercises are some putting

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.650
this here because unfortunately the beginning for course is really important.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.380
But the main selling point that I've been talking about are how many exercises there are and there just

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.210
aren't as many at the beginning because in order for the exercise platform to work you have to be able

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.760
to write certain types of code.

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.020
You have to know how to write functions and variables and it takes a couple of sections for us to get

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.750
up to speed on all of all those topics.

22
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.270
So please have faith if you're getting discouraged about the lack of opportunities to type code in the

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.290
browser.

24
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.990
I still try my best to make it interactive and somewhat exciting but just keep in mind after this you

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.480
make it to the magical exercise wonderland.

26
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.720
There's rainbows and these emojis and these people doing this thing with their hands.

27
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.830
It's way better.

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.810
So it just takes a little bit but eventually there will be a ton of exercises.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.160
All right so one thing I'd like to talk about is how these exercises are structured.

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.280
So there's tons of them.

31
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.870
You'll see the screen a lot.

32
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.820
You never have to write all your code in the actual editor if you're more comfortable.

33
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.050
You know you can skip all these exercises and just run the code on your own computer and leave the browser.

34
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.960
But if you do want to use the the test that I've written all of these exercises you write your code

35
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.330
in here so there's a prompt.

36
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040
This is one of the simplest ones.

37
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.360
It has to do with functions.

38
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.780
When we talk about functions don't worry about the syntax but write a function called speak Pig that

39
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.950
returns oink.

40
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.390
Yep that's it.

41
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.410
It's a very simple exercise.

42
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.870
So you write your code in here and let's say I don't know what to do.

43
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000
So I get it wrong on purpose.

44
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530
I say I don't know.

45
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.650
This is not a good idea at all.

46
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.620
But let's just say that's what I did.

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.120
That's not real Python code.

48
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.310
But I would click Check solution and it's going to tell me something's not right and what I want to

49
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
show you is that some of the error messages that you'll see early on might be intimidating or confusing.

50
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.900
For example this one I don't know what it tells me is that it's invalid syntax but all this extra stuff

51
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.010
is there as part of the message.

52
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.900
All that is saying is that this is not real Python.

53
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.780
It results in all this craziness.

54
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.350
So if there's ever a point where these messages aren't helpful enough.

55
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.730
I've done my best to add in some helpers to try and guess what you might do wrong so early on you know

56
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.610
there are common mistakes or I try and add scenarios I write code that checks like did they do this

57
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.790
mistake that they do this mistake give them this nice message.

58
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.520
But it's hard for me to anticipate all of those especially when the exercises get harder.

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.170
So just keep in mind that sometimes you might see some crazy errors like this.

60
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.750
And if you ever just need to see the solution you've whether you've given up or you just want you know

61
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.720
to check on something you need a hint.

62
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.470
It's always immediately following the exercise so you Tommy doesn't have a way for you to just you know

63
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.210
download a solution file right here manually.

64
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.530
I had to create a solution file so this is the super quick return exercise immediately after is solution.

65
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.280
They're all named solution so you can click on it there or just click continue.

66
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.150
And it shows us our simple solution so we could take this and then go back paste it in.

67
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.970
And now he can see using that code should take a second.

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.700
Well done.

69
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.830
We got it correct.

70
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.600
OK.

71
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.840
So I just wanted to show you you know how I have this set up you to me is probably was never expecting

72
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.530
there to be so many exercises in a single course.

73
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.060
So they didn't really come up with a great way of me giving you solution code for tons of exercises.

74
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.410
So I came up with my own system.

75
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.090
It's honestly not ideal.

76
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.770
I hope that this will change over time.

77
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.690
But for now you just click continue.

78
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.090
You see the solution you click continue.

79
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.590
There's another exercise.

80
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.110
In this case and after that would be the solution.

81
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.810
And then a video and so on.

82
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.310
So just hit continue if you want to see the solution.

83
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.910
OK.

84
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.560
And then also remember.

85
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.940
Hang in there until we get to all those exercises.

86
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.550
All right.

87
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.590
I'll be quiet now.

88
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.610
Let's get on with it.
