Hey I'm back here just inserting this between videos because I realized I never showed that you could

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,700
have multiple lifts.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,780
And in fact you can have as many as you want in a single conditional statement.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,420
So you need to have one if no matter what.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,400
It's optional to have an else at the end but you can only have one because it's a catchall you know

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,620
otherwise.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,180
But in between we can have as many Ellefson or else ifs as we want.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,140
So here's an example that asks for.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,460
What's your favorite color.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,120
And if the user says purple the clear best color.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,930
You know it's not even up for debate.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,750
We print.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,610
Excellent choice.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,730
But then we have an else if so if this was not true.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,330
Is this true color equal to teal if it is we print not bad.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,130
But if it's not true.

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,730
Move on.

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,550
Try this one is color equal to seafoam will print mediocre.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,110
If that's false color equal to pure darkness.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,790
Well print.

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,190
I like how you think if people pick pure darknesses or color.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,060
Great.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,690
And then else otherwise we'll print you monster.

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,230
So let's quickly try it out.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,680
I have a file called logic up.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,310
Why.

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,450
So what's your favorite color.

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,820
Start with purple.

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,070
Excellent choice.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
How about blue.

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,590
We get ALS because we didn't have an F or Aliff so it triggers the else let's do it again and this time

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,940
till this time we'll do pure darkness.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,890
That's my favorite color.

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,750
I need to actually hit enter on the file first.

35
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,370
Now we can try pure darkness.

36
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,860
I was so so fixated on spelling that correctly.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,140
I like how you think.

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,790
And then finally I think we're missing Seafoam.

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,790
And spell it correctly as you can see.

40
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,920
So I got you monster but just for the sake of being complete.

41
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,620
Here Seafoam.

42
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,520
There we go.

43
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,480
Mediocre.

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,220
And that about sums up this video.

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,290
Mediocre but it's good to know you can have multiple elf's right.
