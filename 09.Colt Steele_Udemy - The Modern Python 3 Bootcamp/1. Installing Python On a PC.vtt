00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.520
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.790
This is the video where we finally get into telling Python for Windows.

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.420
So just to be clear we have a Mac or anything that isn't a PC.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.780
This video is not for you.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.910
I mean you're welcome here.

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.010
Can't kick you out but you're going to see some conflicting information.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.690
So installing Python is actually really really straightforward compared to when I have to show students

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.980
how to install something like Ruby which can be a huge pain especially on Windows machines.

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500
Python however is really straightforward to install.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
It's just that in order to execute it to run scripts you do need to know some of the basic command line

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.120
commands that we talked about earlier in the course.

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.160
So that's that's kind of the tradeoff.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.680
It's easy to install takes just a couple of seconds.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.310
It's basically a click.

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.670
But we have to know how to execute it.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.470
And before we go any further the end goal is that we want to be able to type python in our power show.

17
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.730
So I'm inside power show.

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.390
If you did skip the section because I know some people just want to go straight into installing make

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.460
sure that you know how to open up power show or you have to do a search for it on your computer if you

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890
have Windows 7 or greater.

21
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.700
It should be there.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.930
So I want to be able to type python and get a version greater than three point six point four or three

23
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.880
point six when four are higher which shouldn't be a problem once we install it.

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.790
But if you've never installed Python This should not work.

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.360
It should give you a bunch of read text as if I had typed that it should say the term Python is not

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.060
recognized.

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.980
So to get that command all we have to do is go to Python dot org.

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
And download it.

29
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
So we go to downloads and then this is important.

30
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
We want download for Windows which it should automatically suggests that you have Windows.

31
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.630
But then you want to make sure you're clicking Python 3 point X not two point seventy three point x.

32
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.520
Click that and then run it will take a moment.

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.180
I will fast forward through this and it's really important that you click the button or the checkbox

34
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.220
that says add Python to path.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.740
So make sure you have that checked before you finish the install and then go ahead and complete the

36
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.760
installation.

37
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.110
It will take a moment and when it's done.

38
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.150
Open a power shell again make sure that you're not trying this.

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.130
If you were following along and you tried to run Python in power shell before you installed you're going

40
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.130
to need to make a new window or quit out of power shell and reopen it basically restart the process

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.550
because it's not aware that pythoness now a thing but after you do that you should be able to type python

42
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.270
and then this takes us to what's known as the Python interpreter.

43
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.400
It's a REPL R E P L stands for read evaluate print loop which is what it does it will read the code

44
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.420
in that I type well evaluate it print it back to me and the result.

45
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100
And it keeps going loops.

46
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.520
So this is not where we'll actually be developing applications.

47
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.590
We're not going to type an entire you know Web site or you're not going to analyze some data from a

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.310
CACP file in here but it's a quick way to test things out.

49
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.170
So for example try typing something that is jibberish that isn't Python.

50
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.620
It tries to run.

51
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.580
DK JDA just as Python code and it tells me it's an error.

52
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.190
We'll talk a lot more about all of this.

53
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.160
But Jeff is not defined.

54
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.470
If you tried to type something that is python which really briefly one plus one it reads this and it

55
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.820
evaluates it which is to it print it and then it loops and it waits for me to do something else.

56
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.530
Now I'm going to do one plus two.

57
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.500
And that's also as far as Python is concerned.

58
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.110
This video is about installing it not about the actual language or syntax but just make sure that you're

59
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.890
able to do this make sure that you can type python in your power show and that the prompt changes to

60
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.170
this.

61
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.450
And then you can type whatever you want in here.

62
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.390
It's not the focus and the last thing I need to mention is how you get out of here because this is not

63
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.940
your normal prompt in the power show.

64
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.210
I don't see this path here that tells me where I am to get out of here.

65
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.980
I can type quit with parentheses or I just type quite like this.

66
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.410
It tells me use Quit with friends or controls the plus return whichever is easier for you.

67
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.620
Control-C and return which I think I don't know if that's on Mac as well.

68
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.220
I usually just type quit just like that and we're out of there now and I'm back in power so I can open

69
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.400
it back up by typing Python and then quit.

70
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.210
So we'll be doing this quite a bit especially early in the course.

71
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.390
The REPL the Python interpreter is a really easy way of writing code and seeing what happens.

72
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.690
You don't have to make a new file you don't have to save code in the file you don't have to navigate

73
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.150
to it and then execute it.

74
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.650
You can just go right away.

75
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.310
Cool.

76
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.940
So hopefully that went ok for you.

77
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.810
If not make sure you leave a comment on the discussion board.

78
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.340
Talk about what went wrong.

79
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.990
Definitely copy and paste any error messages that you see along the way.

80
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.040
In order for us to help you because it probably has to do with either the version of Windows that you're

81
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.670
running maybe you've installed Python before.

82
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.390
There's a couple of things I could come up but it really depends on the specifics of your machine.

83
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.550
All right so the next video we're going to get typing our first program.

84
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.330
I warn you it's going to be very simple but it's going to be a real program in a real Python file that

85
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.580
we execute and then that will be our final test to make sure everything is installed and then we'll

86
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.960
move on to actually learning Python finally.

87
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.530
All right.

88
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.050
See that.
