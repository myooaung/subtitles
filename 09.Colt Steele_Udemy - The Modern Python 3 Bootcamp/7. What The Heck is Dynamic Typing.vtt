00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.770
All right one last thing before strings I want to talk about dynamic typing.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.040
So Python is a language that is really really flexible about how we define our variables and it gives

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.420
us the ability to reassign our variables not just from you know nine down to 98 but we could go from

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.830
9 9 to the string none or zero in quotes the word zero.

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.750
So basically it allows us to have variables change types not just values from a number to a number or

6
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.390
string to a string but the actual type.

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.020
So for example we could have awesomeness set to what is this again.

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.320
Boolean capital-T True.

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.400
And I could print awesomeness and it's the pulley and troop.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.280
But then I could change it the same variable awesomeness not a different variable and set it to a string.

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.980
A dog or I could set it to something called none which we haven't talked about yet but none is another

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.820
value.

13
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.400
Notice has a capital and so it's not a string.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.130
It's the way that Python represents the concept of nothing.

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.110
So it's different than zero.

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320
That literally means nothing.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.110
We'll talk more about it when when we get to that point then we have Asinus equals 22 divided by seven.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.430
And the result of that is a float.

19
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.900
So this is just something that it's good to be aware of.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.820
But this is also something that is somewhat unique to Python.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.390
So there are other languages that support dynamic typing as well but there are lots of languages that

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.980
don't.

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.530
So for example languages like C++ are what's known as statically typed which means when you define a

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.670
variable as a boolean it has to stay as a boolean.

25
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.740
And if you want to change it well you actually need to make a brand new variable and you can't really

26
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.540
dynamically change it at all.

27
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.070
So as an example of what that could look like.

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.410
Take a look at this code.

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.890
We have a variable called not awesomeness.

30
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.860
We're setting equal to the number five.

31
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.280
But we actually have to say ahead of time.

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.810
This is an integer it's always an integer.

33
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.260
And in C++ also notice the semi-colons.

34
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.970
It's going to always expect it to be an integer.

35
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.820
So we could change it.

36
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.460
We could change it to seven or 20 year one million.

37
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.420
But if we tried to change it to a string like cool it would throw an error and break our code.

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.440
So that's it for this video.

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
I just wanted you to be aware of the fact that Python is dynamically typed.

40
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.010
You could change data types of variables at any point unlike other languages like C++ where you have

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.290
to define a data type from the beginning and that variable always stays that way.

42
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.920
All right.

43
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.890
Now on to strings.
