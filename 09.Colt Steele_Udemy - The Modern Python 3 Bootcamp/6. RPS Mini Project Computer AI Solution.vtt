1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.770
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.540
So in this video we'll pick random numbers and translate that to a random computer player who plays

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390
rock paper scissors.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.140
So we're going to build on what we already have.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.170
We won't redo all of the game Magic but to actually generate the random number as the hint says here

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.030
you need to use something called Rand ant.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
So if you did google it you would end up here on the documentation.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.250
Or you could end up a lot of places but this is one of the places you would end up and what you see

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.540
here is that there's something called random which is it's a module.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.320
We haven't talked about modules yet so I'm not going to get into the weeds too far.

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.280
Basically it's code that we can include that this comes kind of built in with Python but but it's not

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.650
fully built in the sense that you have to include it yourself.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
So you don't have to download anything you don't have to go install anything.

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.040
You just have to tell Python hey I want to use that one thing in this file.

15
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.360
So it's part of random the random module.

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.980
And let's just do a search for Rand and because there's a lot of things different functions that come

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.600
with random but Rande and so random dot Rand and returns a random integer and it's called.

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.620
And in this case such that it's between A and B inclusive.

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.440
So see that it's less than or equal to Enric Grich less than or equal to be greater than or equal to

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.910
A.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.920
So what we can do is generate one between zero and two for example.

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.810
So then our choices would be 0 1 and 2.

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600
So let me show you how to use it first.

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:38.620
So I'm actually going to open up just Python 3 and if I try and just do random rants from 0 to 2 It

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.400
tells me random is not defined and makes that a bit larger.

26
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.380
So what we need to do first is say I need to import random just like that.

27
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.300
Now I can do just recall that line random rant from 0 to 2.

28
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.320
So it's going to be a random integer from either 0 1 or 2 as you can see it was there we go.

29
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.090
I got to one as well.

30
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.950
So there are other random functions that will generate a random float but we don't want that really

31
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.830
because an integer is much easier.

32
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.110
OK so we're going to use this and write a conditional that says if the random number is zero computer

33
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.290
equals scissors or paper or whatever you want to assign it to.

34
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.800
So I'm going to quit out of here and I'm going to make a new file and I'm going to call this one computer

35
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.010
version.

36
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.280
I just call it v3 to be consistent.

37
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.370
Dot p y.

38
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.160
And I'll open that one up and I'll just start by pasting in our old version and we can go ahead and

39
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.270
delete basically the part where we ask player 2 for input and I'm going to comment everything else out

40
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.370
for now and just start by getting our basic logic to generate a random number to work.

41
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.550
So I'll even comment that all out and the first thing we'll do up top is add that import random so that

42
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.410
we have access to random rant.

43
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.610
OK.

44
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.340
And then I'm going to make a variable.

45
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.810
And I'm just going to call it Rand.

46
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.870
Numb equals random dot Rand int from 0 to 2.

47
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.880
Now to be clear we could do from 1 to 3 or 10 to 12 or negative 5 to negative 7 it's totally up to you

48
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.420
dear to two is the easiest but we just need three random integers.

49
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:32.070
And then what we're going to do is basically say all right if Rand numb equals Let's start with zero

50
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.690
then computer move equals rock and I'll just call it computer.

51
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
So then down here it will be comparing player 1 to computer.

52
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.290
And then we'll do an Elif Rande now equals 1.

53
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.790
If that's the case let's say that computer equals paper and then we can just do an else because there's

54
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:05.030
not any other situation other than two because the way this rant works it returns 0 1 or 2.

55
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.650
And so in that case we'll say computer equals scissors.

56
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:19.960
So let's test this let's just print computer OK so we generate random number from 0 to 2 inclusive and

57
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.310
then we assign a variable computer to be rock paper scissors and then we print out computer.

58
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.480
So let's try it.

59
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.950
Python 3 I call it v3.

60
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.700
OK so we've got scissors scissors scissors paper paper.

61
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.460
Give me a rock.

62
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.120
Come on I know you can do it.

63
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.790
Geez.

64
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.450
Come on.

65
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.480
There we go.

66
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.240
So it is possible.

67
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.630
OK.

68
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.570
So we finally got a rock so you can see those are the three options paper scissors or rock.

69
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.170
OK.

70
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.160
So I mean I stopped doing that.

71
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.500
So I just don't go crazy.

72
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.040
And let's go back to our code and now we need to make some changes.

73
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.170
The first thing that I'll do is rather than player one I'll just call this variable player and then

74
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.440
all my logic down here I need to update the sensitive player one.

75
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.420
We're going to do player and we're going to compare that to computer.

76
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.560
Same thing here.

77
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.480
Well change this to be computer.

78
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.760
Anytime we see player 2 it's computer but otherwise the logic is the same.

79
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.350
And then player 1 I'm just changing the player just for clarity's sake.

80
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:36.450
It might be confusing if we had a player 1 and No player 2 and then we'll update all these messages

81
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.490
in just a moment.

82
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.110
OK so that looks good to me.

83
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.830
The next thing we'll do is update so player wins it's going to copy that and replace player one wins

84
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.930
and then instead of player two will say computer wins and I'm going to copy that and duplicate it instead

85
00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.950
of player 2 wins.

86
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.360
Change it to computer wins.

87
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.950
OK.

88
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.660
So let's just see if we have any errors.

89
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.860
It's always a good chance that we might.

90
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.610
OK.

91
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.490
What do you know.

92
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.730
I'm missing a colon again.

93
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.320
Who would have thought me Missy and Colin.

94
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.920
OK.

95
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.670
Player 1.

96
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.460
Make your move.

97
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.260
I will go with rock.

98
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:27.900
And so we're not really displaying this very well we should we should change this to say computer plays.

99
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.550
And rather than just concatenating Let's use an F string.

100
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.850
So then in here we need our little curly braces.

101
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.750
Perfect.

102
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.460
Let's test it out again.

103
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.210
So I'll play paper this time computer play scissors computer wins I'll play paper again.

104
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.680
Computer plays rock player wins.

105
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.970
So a really simple change we could make is to make it case insensitive and basically all we care about

106
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.890
is that a player could enter in capital R for rock or capital P for paper or all caps.

107
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.660
And there's a really easy way to get around that.

108
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.560
Basically we take all of the input from the player and we turn it into lowercase.

109
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.160
And the way we do that we haven't really talked about this either.

110
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.330
So another sneak preview of where we're going.

111
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.300
But this is a string function that will take a string and turn it to lowercase.

112
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:28.150
So if I opened up Python 3 and I did hello that lower we get hello and lower.

113
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.380
Same thing if I did rock with C K uppercase lowercase is it.

114
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.170
So basically takes everything coming in from from input whatever the user types.

115
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.160
Rock paper scissors.

116
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.550
However it's capitalized.

117
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.340
We turn it all into lowercase and then that's all we need to do because we're just comparing it now

118
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.980
to the string rock here and paper.

119
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.270
Of course we could also turn it into uppercase and just compare it to all uppercase.

120
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.980
Either direction would go up or down to lowercase.

121
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.880
Now one must change we could make.

122
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.570
We can be done here but if we wanted to shorten this even more.

123
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.600
So if you step to the logic so let's say Player 1 or player can be played rock.

124
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.780
I played rock and the first thing we check was that the computer play rock.

125
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.290
And if the answer is no ok then we move on.

126
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.810
So if Coltart player played rock did the computer play scissors.

127
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.670
If so the computer wins.

128
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.700
Then we have an elf computer plays paper.

129
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.490
But what other choice is there for the computer.

130
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:37.230
Because unlike in the previous example where we had two humans so player 2 could have entered anything.

131
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
Computer has only three choices.

132
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.010
It's rock paper scissors.

133
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.250
Exactly that and nothing else.

134
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.530
So we don't even have to check here is computer paper.

135
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.200
We could just do an else print computer went.

136
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:58.270
So that makes sense because again step through that if I play rock if the computer played rock it's

137
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:58.900
a tie.

138
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.930
If the computer played scissors I win.

139
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.430
And the only other option is that the computer wins because the computer played Paper.

140
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.830
That's the only you know there's only three choices.

141
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.600
So we can do that same thing down here just refactor that.

142
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.880
Now some people would argue it's actually better to keep this to be more explicit because now you can

143
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.470
see that this only occurs when computer plays rock.

144
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.790
But other people would say it's better to be more succinct.

145
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.280
And we don't need to have that additional logic totally up to you.

146
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.480
OK so I'll just change this down here to say Please enter a valid move.

147
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.400
See if I somehow forgot another colon somewhere.

148
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:46.200
OK so let's say I play paper computer plays paper it's a tie I play paper again computer plays rock.

149
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.370
This time I play something that doesn't make sense like Jell-O.

150
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.680
Please enter a valid move.

151
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.390
The only thing I would change instead of saying player 1.

152
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.250
Let's change this to player.

153
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.890
Make your move OK.

154
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.910
And one last really quick thing that we can change it for only using rant from random.

155
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:16.430
We can actually change this to be from random import Rand.

156
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.330
And then down here I'm able to just reference Rand.

157
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:25.760
And so it's just the exact same thing but appear I'm only importing Rand and.

158
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.130
And then I can use rand into directly without having to say random dot random.

159
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.520
So minor minor change just make sure that I didn't break it.

160
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.300
Rock and peer push paper computer wins.

161
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.520
OK we're done.

162
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.360
Congratulations.

163
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.700
If you made it through that or if you keep it on your own it's an achievement just to watch a video

164
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.440
this long.

165
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.340
I try to keep video shorter so I apologize if you fell asleep or done with Rock Paper Scissors.

166
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.280
We talked about rent an import.

167
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.130
We will come back to those when we talk about modules.

168
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.840
All right.

169
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.410
Moving on we're now going to talk about loop's so ways of repeating things in our code which would really

170
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.750
help with this game to be honest.

171
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.330
Because right now you play this game once and then you're done.

172
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.810
But what if you wanted to play best of five and keep score and have the game start over.

173
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.040
Well with loop's we'll be able to do that.
