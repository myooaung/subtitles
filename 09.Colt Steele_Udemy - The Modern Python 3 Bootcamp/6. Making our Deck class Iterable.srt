00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,340
A welcome back here is the card and deck class from earlier in the course if you didn't watch those

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,100
videos.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,270
Basically there's a card class.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,500
Each card has a student value and there's a deck class that contains a list with 52 of those cards.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,060
And there's things we can do like shuffle or deal cards off the top what else count we can reset a deck.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,820
That's basically it.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,310
Now what I want to show you is said if I had an instance of deck like this my deck.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:40,320
And then I shuffle it if I wanted to be able to iterate over my deck like I don't know for card in my

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,280
deck.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,500
I want to be able to do something with it like we could just start by printing the card right now that's

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,290
not going to work because Python doesn't know how to iterate over an instance of deck if I tried to

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:52,800
run it.

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,700
I get that deck object is not iterable so because really what would make sense for us to iterate over

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,350
a deck.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,240
We just want to iterate over the list of cards.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,010
What we could do really simply is just define anywhere on here let's do death.

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,360
It turned itself.

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,330
I like to do these on you know all the donder methods together.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,950
It doesn't have to be that way though.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,780
And we need to return something that is an iterator so this is not iterable but it's not an iterator.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,180
If I call it I call it.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,180
It tells me it's turned on iterator type.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,850
So instead we could do it for one two three.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,800
And now if I call this we get one to three so we could replace that set of 1 to 3.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,000
We could replace that with Dot cards.

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,570
And now there we go we are iterating over all those cards.

27
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:03,670
So all we really did by adding this line in here is make it so that instead of having to do for card

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,470
in my deck dot cards.

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,410
Now we can just iterate over the deck directly and it only gives us the cards.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,430
Whereas before this caused an error this is of course a very simple example.

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,690
But it is logical you know in a deck all that we really would want to iterate over our cards.
