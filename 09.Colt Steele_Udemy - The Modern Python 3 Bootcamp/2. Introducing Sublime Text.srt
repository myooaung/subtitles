00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,570
Hey there.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,290
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,850
And this video I'm just going to introduce Sublime Text which is the text editor that I'm going to use.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,200
You definitely do not have to use this but it's a free option that is really really popular amongst

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,050
developers.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,490
Python javascript you name it.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,080
It works with any sort of language.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,540
It's not particular to one and it's really flexible.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,490
It's FREE.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,970
So it makes a really good option for students who are just testing something out.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,220
There are other editors out there that some courses will have you know sign up for a 30 day trial and

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,790
then after that it's 100 200 dollars.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,190
So this is a nice alternative and it's just as powerful.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,440
So it downloaded.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,220
All you have to do is go to Sublime Text dot com.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,520
The link is also included as a resource with this lecture.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,280
Then go to download or on the home page it detects that you're using a PC click download for Windows.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,720
Then you should see this Sublime Text 3 set up wizard.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,380
Complete the process and once it finishes you should be able to come down here into what it is called

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,770
Taskbar type Sublime Text and it should open up for you and it will look something like this on your

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,590
computer.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,900
So it's just a basic text editor.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,180
Oh it's not basic but it's compared to something like Microsoft Word.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,040
You know just as text for not working with images in here we're not working with clip art or whatever

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,850
else it has.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,500
We're just adding in our code.

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,720
But it has some really nice features like syntax highlighting we can change color schemes autocomplete.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,460
So even though we haven't learned Python yet I'm just going to show you some of those features.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,930
Now in this sublime video sort of make a new file which you'll be doing a lot.

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,850
You can do file new file or control and I'll do that now control and.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,300
And then let's give it a name so we can you know go to File Save just like any other app or control

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:55,540
as I will save this on my desktop inside of Culp's code and I'm going to give it a file name.

33
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,700
Let's go with demo.

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,530
And I could do Dot T x t if I wanted to for a text file what we'll be doing pretty much exclusively

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,160
is dot p y.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,870
Actually later we'll will do C S V files and a couple other things.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,850
But why is all we need for Python demo.

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,560
P Why that tells sublime that it should be a python file which will then trigger syntax highlighting

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,380
and some autocomplete for Python but also it's important to put Python code in a python file so we can

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,080
run it.

41
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,480
OK so save and now I can type python code if I type one plus one.

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,410
You can see that the ones are purple and the plus sign is red whereas I just make a new file do command

43
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,810
or control and I do one close one.

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
Python doesn't know what type of file this is.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,400
So you won't see those colors.

46
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,440
A common question I get asked Why is that happening.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,400
Just make sure you save your file as p y.

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,020
Anytime you make a new file you have to save it first.

49
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,410
Other than that you can go up to preferences color scheme if you want to change.

50
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,810
You can also download some other ones but I think these are the ones that come by default.

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,250
That's not bad to go with that one.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Put your code in here save.

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,570
Make new files.

54
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,100
The only other thing you can open a folder which is common for working with multiple files at once.

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,540
I would go and open this entire directory for example and make this full screen.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,770
I now have access to all my files here.

57
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,680
Later on we'll work on projects that have two or three python files that work together plus maybe a

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,100
data file that would need to import.

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,090
We don't want to have to open them all individually so you can use that feature file open folder.

60
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,920
I believe you can also use the graphical user interface and drag a file down to the icon down here of

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,070
Sublime Text and that will open it up just the same way so that's all I want to talk about with sublime

62
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,000
in this video.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,780
It's FREE.

64
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,420
It's nice easy to use very strong developer community and if you happen to be interested in customizing

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,120
your editor the possibilities are pretty much endless.

66
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,750
You can find custom scripts custom color schemes you can download all sorts of tools awesome utilities

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,940
online but I'm not going to go into that because we better get on with Python.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,230
So that's coming up next.
