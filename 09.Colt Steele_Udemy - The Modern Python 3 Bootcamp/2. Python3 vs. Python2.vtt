00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.650
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's quickly chat about Python 2 versus Python 3.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.500
So if you're like me you're probably used to your software updating and changing all the time whether

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.290
it's your phone's operating system your gaming console that happens to upgrade and restart.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.200
Right when you download a new game or your computer your Windows or Mac operating system these things

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.630
change all the time there's always new versions and programming languages are really no different.

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.990
They're always enhance they're always changed.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.440
New features are added in.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.720
It's constantly a process of growing.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.460
So back in 2008 the creator of Python.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.600
Its name is Guido van Rossum was a bit unhappy with some of the really important architectural decisions

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.290
that were made early on in Python and he wanted to change them so he decided to overhaul Python and

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.480
release Python 3.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.150
So this was ten plus years ago in 2008 and at the time the goal was to be for Python 3 to be the present

15
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.620
and future of the language.

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.010
People were supposed to adopt it pretty quickly and stick with it.

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.140
But as you can probably tell by the fact that I have to make this video it was more complicated than

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.710
that.

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.080
And the reason for all the trouble all the controversy is that Python 3 is not backwards compatible.

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.650
So usually when you have a programming language and changes are made it's made incrementally and it's

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.700
made in a way that old code can still run.

22
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.980
So old javascript's written five years ago if you tried to run it now there won't be any problems.

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.770
It won't be using some of the new features.

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260
It might not look as nice but it will still work.

25
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.100
But with Python 3 the opposite was true.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.780
So the all the existing users the existing companies that were built on Python to their code their libraries

27
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.120
everything that they had done up until that point would not work if they were run with Python 3.

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.870
And because of that still to this day Python 2.0 X is still commonly used Python 3 is now very very

29
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.530
common.

30
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.140
But that wasn't always the case because it's taken a while for companies and for libraries to fully

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.330
support Python 3 because it had to be.

32
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.550
It was a decision.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.900
Oftentimes with other updates you just kind of opt into it without thinking.

34
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.000
But going from Python 2 to 3 is a very deliberate choice you have to make if you're on a team at a company

35
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.460
that team had to decide to migrate to Python 3.

36
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.520
So it took a while.

37
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.240
It's over 10 years later and it's still not fully solved.

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160
So this is a little diagram.

39
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.320
Back before Python 3 came out it was one big happy family.

40
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.260
All these developers everybody in the pipeline community was writing Python to point X and they say

41
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.010
hi to each other they send hearts back and forth.

42
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.940
Real happy.

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.790
But then Python 3 came out which was an attempt to make Python great again and there was very mixed

44
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.760
reactions as signified by all of these and Moji here.

45
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.010
It was very very polarizing.

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.420
What ended up happening is that the community was split.

47
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.570
We have this box with a line through the middle and now our happy family has been torn apart.

48
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.750
And if you're someone who's trying to learn Python for a while it's been a little confusing about where

49
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.650
you should start.

50
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.570
There are thousands and thousands of blog posts and articles and YouTube videos where people explain

51
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.760
the difference and talk about why you have to learn Python too or why you have to learn Python 3 or

52
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.060
how to decide if you're new.

53
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.620
It goes on and on and on.

54
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.030
And for a while there really was a lot of ambiguity around it.

55
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.630
Python 2 was definitely the best choice early on.

56
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.910
But things have changed it's just been really slowly very incrementally.

57
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.900
But almost 10 years later Python 3 is absolutely the way to go.

58
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780
The situation has improved a ton.

59
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.160
So what makes me say that well first of all it's just easier in general to learn the most up to date

60
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.010
current standards to learn Python 3 and then go back if you need to work in Python to for some reason.

61
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.880
You can figure out the key differences in the quirks rather than going the other way.

62
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.610
But more importantly most of the main criticisms of things people didn't like just don't matter anymore.

63
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.980
It used to be that all the popular packages all the tools that people would use the utilities that were

64
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.840
written for Python were only written in Python too.

65
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.920
So if you upgraded to Python 3 you were in this frontier land where you couldn't rely on common packages

66
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.050
say you were used to.

67
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.910
That's no longer the case at all.

68
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.300
There's a Web site here.

69
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.990
I'll include the link called Python 3 readiness and it shows out of the 360 most popular Python packages

70
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.490
that are used all the common all the important things that you would ever need to do.

71
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.880
Well not everything but most of the things you'd ever need to do.

72
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.250
They are all supporting Python 3 now out of the top 360 what there's 12 that aren't and you can see

73
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.590
them here highlighted in white but everything else is supporting Python 3.

74
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.910
But this wasn't the case just a couple of years ago.

75
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.480
It was a much different picture.

76
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.930
So many of the older courses still encourage you to learn Python too because at the time that's what

77
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.920
everyone was doing.

78
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.410
But like I said the situation has changed all the popular packages you'd ever need support Python 3

79
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.910
so that's not a that's not a problem.

80
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.090
It's not a question anymore.

81
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.130
But the most compelling reason honestly is that Python 3 is the future.

82
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.210
There's also the fact that Python too is going to be retired officially.

83
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.830
So Python 2.7 is still being maintained now.

84
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.530
But in just a couple of short years in 2020 at some point there's not an official date there's going

85
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.810
to be a time where it's not maintained.

86
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.780
So there's not going to be these two versions going forever.

87
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.690
Python 3 is designed to be the version that lives on.

88
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.960
So everybody who's learning Python to right now is going to have to move over to Python 3 If you're

89
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.360
curious and you want to dive into the differences.

90
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.310
It might be easier once you've learned some Python but there's this Web site that goes into the key

91
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.670
differences between 2.7 for next and three point six.

92
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.410
So one just really quick example I'll show you one of the first things we'll learn in this course is

93
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.990
called the print function.

94
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.680
And in Python 3 it looks like this print and then parentheses and we pass in something to print in Python

95
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.830
to print was a statement rather than a function.

96
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.920
So you didn't add parentheses.

97
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.280
You could do it like this print space Hello world.

98
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.700
In Python 3 you have to add the parents.

99
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.350
So it's a minor difference but you can see if you wrote code in Python too and you didn't have those

100
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.830
Prendes and you tried to run it in Python 3 it wouldn't work because that's no longer valid code.

101
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.540
So if you are a complete beginner and you are deciding I think the case is pretty clear cut to learn

102
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.760
Python 3 at this point all the blog post criticisms that you could still find out there most of them

103
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.600
are old and they're out of date because the situation has changed.

104
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.150
And just remember that Python 3 is the future.

105
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.900
So some like you know I'm trying to sell it to you or something but it just is.

106
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.330
That's not even my choice.

107
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.590
The developers of Python have made it clear that Python 3 is where things are going.

108
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.680
So why not vote in Python 3.

109
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.360
And finally one more picture my cat has a long video like that old grumpy face.
