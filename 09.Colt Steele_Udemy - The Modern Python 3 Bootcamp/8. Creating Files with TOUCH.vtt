00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.610
OK.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.550
So we've seen how to make new directories.

3
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.890
Now let's learn how to make new files.

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
So you might think make directory M-K DA or there might be.

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.670
Make file or make for some something.

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.510
Unfortunately there's not the syntax actually totally different.

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.140
The command we need to use is called touch t o u c h.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.730
So the command touch followed by whatever the new file name and file extension that we want that file

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.310
to be.

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.180
We hit enter.

11
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.030
It will make a new file for us.

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.520
So let's say I'm inside of a cat picks directory seed into it I can run touch faves TXI.

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.190
So whatever I want.

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.970
Whatever file type I want dot doc dot What is it for Excel spreadsheets.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.740
I can't remember PTF dot JPEG whatever it is you can create a new file and this course most of what

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.380
we'll be doing is making new Python files that p y We'll get to that in a moment though.

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.930
So touch whatever the new file name and file type is it entered and it will make an empty file inside

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.700
the current directory.

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.970
And if we typed us we would then see.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.060
Now there's a faves.

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.910
So touch is the magic command.

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.360
Let's give it a shot.

23
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.800
So I'm back here.

24
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.590
I'm inside the dog's photos.

25
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.490
Dog photos directory.

26
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.200
Let's go into rusty picks or CD resti picks and I could make a new file and I'll just call this one

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.180
puppy dot J bag.

28
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.330
So touch puppy dot J peg.

29
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.970
Now making a file like a photo from the command line seems kind of backwards and it is a really weird

30
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.770
thing to do because we're basically making an empty jpeg which you never come across but it is possible.

31
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.100
So you can see I type.

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120
LS I have puppydog jpeg.

33
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.620
Now this is actually something I've never thought about.

34
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030
What happens if you try and open that.

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.910
All right the file puppydog it cannot be opened because it's empty.

36
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.980
So preview treated it like a peg.

37
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.520
It is a J peg it tried to open it but it says it's empty there's nothing to be displayed.

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.490
Interesting.

39
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.670
So let's also make let's do touch treats that TXI.

40
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.600
So they'll make a text file for us and now we have two files a jpeg and a text file.

41
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.810
So like I said most of what we'll be doing is making python files and this is a workflow will follow

42
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.650
all the time.

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.110
CD into a directory make a new python file and then put some code in that file.

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.120
You haven't talked about yet.

45
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.670
That's what this entire course is about.

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.070
And then execute that file with Python.

47
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.360
So we'll get to that.

48
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.050
The only other thing I should mention the name touch Why is it called Touch.

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.610
Well it's pretty bizarre.

50
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.460
I honestly don't have a great answer but touch actually does two different things.

51
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.980
So to explain that let's do an Alice dash L and let's look at puppydog J peg.

52
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.890
So if you look here we have November 28 12:16.

53
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.950
That's the time and date that this was created or it might be last updated.

54
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.200
In this case it's the same I believe it's actually last updated.

55
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.880
So what I can do now if I use touch on a file that already exists.

56
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.410
Touch puppie dad.

57
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.310
JPEG what it will do is not recreate it it won't delete it and make a new file named puppydog peg it

58
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.080
will just gently touch this file and change the last updated time.

59
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.070
I don't know why this is a thing honestly but this touch command has two features two functionalities.

60
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.840
If you use it on an existing file it will just update the time it was last updated it will touch it

61
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.720
nice slow caress but if you use it with a new file name that doesn't exist it will make a new file for

62
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.480
you.

63
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.330
So to prevent touch puppydog jpeg.

64
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.150
Let's do our LS Desch Allegan.

65
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.670
You can see now it says November 28 12 18.

66
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.760
J Paik.

67
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.440
Now I'm realizing it's not the best example because I have no way of proving that it didn't just completely

68
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.910
race and create a new puppy that jpeg.

69
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.460
So if we had some information in these files you would see that it doesn't erase it.

70
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.520
It only updates this time right here.

71
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.690
So kind of a bizarre quirk.

72
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.990
Honestly maybe from a time where people were updating files more often in the time things were updated

73
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.760
it mattered more.

74
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.420
But for the most part I've actually not even for the most part the only time I've ever seen touch used

75
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.060
is to make a new file.

76
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.530
OK so make directory make dear go make folder touch not make file or something thing it's touch.

77
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.660
Unfortunately will make a new file.

78
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.520
You can make any type of file you want.

79
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.980
J peg t s t.

80
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.180
Python javascript.

81
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.910
H Tim L.

82
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.580
C Ss whatever file you need.

83
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.190
You can make with touch and also has that weird quirky feature that if you use it on an existing file

84
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.210
it touches it.

85
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.290
It updates its last updated time.

86
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.080
All right.
