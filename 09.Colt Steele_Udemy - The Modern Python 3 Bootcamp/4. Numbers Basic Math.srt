00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,970
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,810
We're almost done with the math section in this video.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,740
We're going to discuss some of the common important operators that we have in Python.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,670
So here's a simple table on the left side is the symbol that you will use in Python things you're probably

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,040
familiar with at least.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,840
Plus and minus and most likely the star and the slash for division and then over here is the name of

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,900
the operator.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,180
Now these last three I know kind of weird looking.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,600
If you haven't come across them before.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,530
We will get to them in the next video.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,090
But for now she's going to talk about addition subtraction multiplication and most importantly division.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:35,950
OK.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,810
So let's go over to my terminal and I'll open up Python 3.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,410
We already saw we can do things like 1 plus 3 or 40 minus 4.5 and we get a float because we used to

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,810
float as part of the expression.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,330
But what I wanted to call your attention to is what happens when we divide.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,790
So we could do something like 1 divided by two.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,680
What do you think the answer will be.

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,090
These are two integers 1 and 2.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,930
So neither one of them is a float.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,740
What type of data float or integer will the result be.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,000
All right and like get that it's a float.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,320
So in some programming languages this actually would not give you a float and it would round down to

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
zero and just cut off a decimal.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,660
But in Python division always returns a float you always get a float back.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,680
Now there's a way around it.

27
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,530
If you don't want that for some reason I'll show you in the next video.

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,170
But if we do something like 1 divided by three we get 0.3 333 repeating.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,650
So that's division that's probably the most quirky most important thing to point out in this video.

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,780
But I also want to talk about the order of operations.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,950
So if you don't remember the order of operations or math I won't go into the whole thing but there is

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,420
a hierarchy to how these operations do these operators are evaluated.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:08,430
So if we just add something like 1 for us two times five divided by three what happens first there's

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,500
this thing called PEM DOS.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,440
It helps some people remember parentheses exponent multiplication division addition subtraction.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,740
So first would be this multiplication.

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,600
And then this division.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
So we would get 10 divided by three plus one.

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,910
So that's three point three three three plus one.

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,730
So we get four point three but we could also do with just a couple of parentheses completely alter how

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,260
this works.

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,120
So now we do the one plus two first.

43
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,640
So we get three times five.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,500
It's going to be 15 divided by three.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,620
And the answer this time is 5.0.

46
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:41,950
All right.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,690
So I won't for you I promise I'd keep this short but I just wanted to highlight that parentheses work

48
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,450
the same way that they do and just paper and pen math so we can add parentheses wherever we want to

49
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,070
manipulate the order that things are calculated in anyway.

50
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,810
OK.
