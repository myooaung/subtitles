1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,340
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,310
So we have a quick exercise using for loops and ranges.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:14,460
So the idea here it's based off of an experience I had growing up where I had my mom and my dad often

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,880
yelling at me to clean my room and they would say how many times do I have to tell you this.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,910
And so our little program here is going to ask how many times I have to tell you.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,270
And then the user inputs number in this case three and then clean up your room it's printed three times.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,880
So if you don't want to do clean up your room you could just printout Hello X number of times three

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,990
times or five times.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,890
But the idea is for taking number in and we're just going to print something out that number of times

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,000
are very very simple exercise.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,290
But there is you know a tiny catch that you have to worry about any time you're asking for user input.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,730
So give it a shot pause video and then after this I'll have a solution like I don't know two seconds

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,210
from now.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,950
One two.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,530
All right.

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm back.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,280
So let's go over a solution.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,970
OK.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
So I'm going to make a new file here.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm just going to call this one repeater.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,500
Why.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,630
And the first thing we'll do is make a variable.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,130
Let's just call it times equals and then we're going to ask for input so input.

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:22,140
How many times do I have to tell you and a lot of space because I always forget that space and it's

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,250
really gross and you just have to type input and it just goes on to the end without a space.

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,840
OK.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,620
So that will be a string remember.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,940
So let's do times equals inte of times.

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,280
Otherwise we would have the string three and we can't use that in a range because what we want to do

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,560
is then do a loop for and we'll just call it time in and we can't just say for time and times in some

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,490
languages you can do that you could just say for x in 10 or 10 times do this but we still have to have

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,200
a range but we can just do this for time and range Times print.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,870
Clean up your room.

35
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,550
So essentially we'll have a number like five so we can hard code five in here and this is a short cut.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,500
Remember for doing this zero to five.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,170
But if we just pass in five it will work just fine.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:29,650
And just to show that I go run this Python 3 repeater we get clean up room five times and it would be

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,520
the same if we had this OK.

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,730
So let's now go back to asking for times and remember we need to convert it to an int and everything

41
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,740
should work.

42
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,260
Other than that we're not using the time variable because we're doing the same thing each time through

43
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,710
the loop each iteration.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,560
We don't care if we're on the first or the second or the third.

45
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,130
We don't need that number.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,260
How many times have tell you to clean up YOUR him twice about 10.

47
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,710
There we go.

48
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:10,970
The only change we could make if he wanted is to just do it in a room and let's do time let's make this

49
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,170
an F string.

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,280
And put time right there.

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,370
So we get something like this four times zero in every room time one we never hear him.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,610
Time to clean up your room.

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:37,220
And if we wanted to we could shift this over one so we could do time plus one here so that if I type

54
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,390
in five times it says Time 1 instead of time zero.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,240
But really this is above and beyond what we need to do.

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,680
The only thing we want to do is just repeat some string a text and a number of times depending on what

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,070
the user says and that's it.

58
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,400
So I'll put two solutions to this one.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,860
And the simpler one we started with.

60
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,510
OK.

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,100
So next we have a more complex exercise that is hopefully a little bit more challenging.
