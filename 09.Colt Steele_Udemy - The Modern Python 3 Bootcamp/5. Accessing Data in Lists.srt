1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,870
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,440
So this video is all about getting data out of a list.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,570
There's a couple ways we've seen how to create them in the last video.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,410
But the data is just stuck in there.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,070
So to get it out we first have to understand the way lists are ordered.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,210
So here's an example a list called friends with three friends.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,330
Very optimistic for my friend's situation.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,440
Let's just say I wouldn't need a list to start my friends.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,750
I could just get away with an integer is Europe.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,500
So we have three strings here.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,910
Ashley Matt and Michael three items in a friends list like ranges lists always start counting at zero.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,270
So there's an order here that's very important and every of there's an order.

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
The first item is the zero with element that we call it an index it has the zero index than the index

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,330
of mad is one index of Michael is to.

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,520
So that's really really important.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,050
0 1 2 let's always start at zero.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,840
Then if we want to print out a particular piece of data or we don't have to print it we could save it

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,180
to a variable or do something with it.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,220
We use square brackets after the variable name friends and we pass in an index.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,650
So friends square bracket zero is going to go to the friends list and say hey what's the zero with item

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,870
which is actually just like if we did two we count 0 1 2 to Michael and that gives just Michael.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,080
And if we tried something like three which doesn't exist we get an index error.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,580
So let's test that out now.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,900
I'll make a list called colors.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,790
Start off with purple and we'll teal and then let's do orange.

26
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,650
OK.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,640
So to get a piece of data out we use a variable name.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,900
And let's start with getting purple colors.

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,740
Zero.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,480
That gives us the string purple and we can save it to a variable like the best.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,130
Calls colors zero.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,890
Now if we look at the best.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,120
It's purple.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,820
But it's important to note colors is unchanged.

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,650
All this does is retrieve the value.

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,870
We're not deleting things we're not extracting it or removing it.

37
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,010
We are just getting the value out.

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Just like if we had a variable you know X equals 10 and then I said y equals x.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,060
X is still 10.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
What have I done and why is still 10.

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,290
OK.

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,470
I make some space here.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,610
You've got colors.

44
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,870
So yeah if we wanted to access orange it would be to 0 1 2.

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,170
And if we tried something like colors 3 we get lists index out of range.

46
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,320
It's basically Python saying I don't know what you're talking about.

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,830
You're trying to go past the worst same thing like we did 10.

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,530
So you might think that that would apply to negative numbers as well but it doesn't.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,930
So the way that negative number works is that it's going to work backwards.

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,040
So with the same friends list that we have here Ashley Matt and Michael if we did friends of negative

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,400
one it starts counting backwards.

52
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,720
So negative one is Michael and Ashley is negative three so negative one negative to negative three and

53
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,460
we get Ashley but if we did negative four we get the same index error.

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,960
So just to show that let's do colors of negative 1 which gives us orange.

55
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,030
The last item and to get purple it would be colors of negative 3.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,050
So going backwards we started negative 1 going forward to start at zero.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,230
Of course there's no such thing as negative zero.

58
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,160
So we have to start with negative one.

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,830
OK.

60
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,890
So that's the basics of accessing values.

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,570
The next thing I'll show you is a little side note if you want to check if a value is in a list somewhere.

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,850
There's a really easy way to do it.

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:49,700
We use in so if we have the list I can say Ashli in friends and that gives me true just like any comparison

64
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,460
that we've done before with Boolean operations you know quality capitalization matters.

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,440
It has to match exactly.

66
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,900
And if we tried it with Colt is called Friends.

67
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,070
It's false.

68
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:07,010
So let's hop over here again and do colors and let's see if purple is in.

69
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,290
Friends.

70
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,930
Friends colors.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,900
That's true.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,680
But if I tried purple with capital P it's not.

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:26,960
And so we could do things like if teal in colors if that's the case let's do print.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,700
Do you have good taste in colors.

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,070
Get a hit enter and we get you have good taste in colors because inside of colors is teal.

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:48,540
OK so the video here we saw a couple of important concepts the first and most important probably the

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,520
most important part of lists in general is that every item has an index.

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,230
There's an order and they always start at zero.

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,450
The first item has an index of zero.

80
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,530
We can access items out using array brackets.

81
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,950
The square brackets.

82
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,010
And if we try and go past the range we get an error.

83
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,110
We can use negative numbers to start from the end of the array and work backwards to towards the beginning

84
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,480
and then we saw in the very end.
