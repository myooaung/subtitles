1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,390
Pay.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,270
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,840
In this video we're going to focus on Ellis and another command called PWT and I'm also going to talk

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,930
about path's absolute versus relative paths.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,160
But before we get there I want to run through the exact specifics of what we'll be using the power show

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,670
for.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,040
It is a very powerful shell as the name implies there's a lot to it.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,920
We're just going to hone in on a couple of things.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,190
Navigating around creating and removing folders or directories and files and then executing Python scripts

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,270
for that last one we will have to install Python first.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,430
So that will happen in the next section and then we'll be using the command line the Power Shell alongside

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,260
Python.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,790
But to start let's just talk about the operating system file structure.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,590
So for some of you who are devout Windows users this might be review but we're going to go through it

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,770
very quickly.

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,070
So operating systems whether it's a Mac PC or something else.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,210
Organize the content on the data on the drives in a hierarchy a tree like structure with parents and

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,750
children.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,190
Think of a family tree.

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,520
We're probably all comfortable with this idea at this point.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,070
Just having worked with computers you opened up folders you put files on them you can put other folders

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,560
and it's this branching like structure where you have nested folders inside of other directories.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,860
But at some point there is the top level root directory and on a PC that is the backslash it's the root

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,070
directory.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,020
And so we could describe every other folder or file on our machine relative to that backslash to the

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,990
root directory.

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,850
For example if I had two directories inside one called Program Files another called users.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,450
And then instead of users I had another thing called called another directory I would access Colts the

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,500
directory first by referencing the backslash.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,750
And then the next layer down users and then the next layer down cold.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,670
But it's separated always with these backslashes.

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,360
So each layer through I need to add a backslash and you've probably seen this before.

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,740
So to access this the absolute path based off of my root directory is C..

34
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,350
Slash users slash cost.

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,290
Next there's another special name for a folder.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,130
So we saw the root directory the top most level directory.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,350
There's also one called the home directory which has a special symbol used to reference the Tildy which

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,280
is usually above the tab key at least on Mac keyboards.

39
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,110
It's that little squiggly line and that's a symbol that's used to reference the home directory and on

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,770
PCs the home directory is your user directory.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,330
So not the users but your specific your particular user account directory.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,570
And actually it's the default directory that opens up when you open a new terminal.

43
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,470
So in the last video we saw that briefly opened power show and I was already in this directory.

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,060
The name of my account.

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,770
So that will be different for you.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,140
Whatever your username is but that is your home directory so any time you open up power show you'll

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,030
be in there.

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,060
And if at any point you're in the power show and you're not sure where you are.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,260
You can type this other command.

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,520
So we've seen ls.

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,230
There's also PWT print working directory and that tells you the full absolute path of where you currently

52
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,970
are.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,740
So if I was in the stuff directory and I typed PWT I would get C backslash users Colt stuff.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,600
That's the full path that's printed out to me.

55
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,700
So if you ever are lost and you need to know where you are you can use PWT.

56
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,120
OK so back in my power shop you may not need to use PWT that often because by default the prompt shows

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,460
you the entire absolute path.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,910
OK.

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,640
So I have a new shell open here.

60
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,230
You can see it's putting me in the home directory automatically if I type PWT.

61
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,590
It's not that useful because we already see this in the prompt on certain machines other platforms you

62
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,750
may not see the entire prompt by default.

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,220
So PWT is worth knowing about but it's not that commonly used.

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,650
LS However it's really commonly used.

65
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,030
So again that means list and that just shows the contents of wherever we currently are.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,470
So we haven't seen how to move directories yet.

67
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,570
So I'm stuck in the home directory right now.

68
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:23,630
I can type ls and I can type PWT to tell myself I am in the home directory backslash users backslash

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,380
Colt and I can see what's in there but that's it.

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,380
So I will end this video here in the next video though.

71
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,720
We'll actually talk about the command to change directories to move around so we can really start navigating.
