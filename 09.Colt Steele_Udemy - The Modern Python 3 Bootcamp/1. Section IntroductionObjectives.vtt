00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.790
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.180
So this is thankfully the first section where we don't have to worry about installation or getting set

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.600
up.

5
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.530
We can just focus on coding.

6
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.150
All right.

7
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.430
So contrats on making it this far.

8
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.850
So this video as you can see is titled numbers and math really big font all caps.

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.230
I know it's not the most glamorous topic ever.

10
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050
It's probably a little bit polarizing.

11
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.280
If you're one of those people who saw numbers in math and got up from her computer and tried to set

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.840
it on fire I promise I won't be super boring.

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.440
I have two promises actually one said I'm going to keep this short and succinct.

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.050
It's probably going to be the shortest section of the entire course.

15
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.820
Three to four videos and a single quiz at the end.

16
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.380
But my second and more important promise is that there's a really important reason why we're starting

17
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.860
here.

18
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.920
Most of us are already familiar and comfortable with the basics of math.

19
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610
Nothing crazy just simple daily arithmetic.

20
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
We can take that real world math and do the exact same thing in the Python world.

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.010
So it's really simple jumping off point because there's an analog between the real world and Python

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.530
and the other thing I want to mention is that the first most foundational concept that we need to cover

23
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.200
when learning any programming language is how that language actually represents data.

24
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.350
So there's all sorts of data we might care about sales data advertizement data user data.

25
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.880
How do we actually represent that using code.

26
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.470
So of course some of that data is going to be numeric.

27
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.350
We need to store the number of shoes we have in stock or the price for their shoes or the age for a

28
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.850
user.

29
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.320
All sorts of different numbers.

30
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.060
So this is a foundational thing we've got to start talking about.

31
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.650
And in the next couple of seconds to actually continue talking about other ways of storing data but

32
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.330
for now numbers and math.

33
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.210
So first let's talk about our objectives.

34
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.090
We want to start off by understanding the differences between ints and floats which probably means absolutely

35
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960
nothing to you at this point unless you program before.

36
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.160
But yeah it will mean something in a little bit.

37
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600
I understand the differences between it and float two types of numbers.

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.790
Then we're going to work with some simple mathematical operators.

39
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.970
Things are probably comfortable with just show you how to do division multiplication that sort of thing

40
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.760
and point out some of the quirks that happen when you use math and Python.

41
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
And then we're also going to talk about some weirder operators who may not have seen before that are

42
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.780
more Unix programming.

43
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.000
And then finally this one is completely unrelated but it has to go somewhere.

44
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.070
It's just a single short video on something called the comments.

45
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.670
So actually it's nothing to do with math and numbers but it's just an important thing we've got to get

46
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.330
out of the way.

47
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.590
And this is a short section so it got shoehorned into the session already.

48
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.760
So let's get started.

49
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.160
We're going to talk about it in foot in the next video.
