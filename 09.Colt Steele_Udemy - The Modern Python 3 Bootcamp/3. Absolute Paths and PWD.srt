1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,780
Already.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,850
So at this point you should have a command line or terminal installed or up and running on whatever

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,050
platform you're using.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,700
So whether you're on a Mac PC or you decided to go with Cloud 9 it doesn't matter.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,570
But you just need to make sure you have it installed.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,560
Because from here on out we're going to start typing some commands.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,630
So if you skip to this video go back a couple of videos before this and install a command line.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,840
So before we can actually learn new commands Let's talk about the file structure of our computers.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,720
So all computers are organized with directories or folders and then files.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,840
Basically your machine is just a bunch of folders instead of other folders instead of other folders

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,810
in hierarchy so there's an order there.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,870
And what's most important to us right now is that there's a top level directory which is known as the

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,450
root directory.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,880
It's also represented by a slash.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,740
So here it is a visual representation of the root directory which again is just slash.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,390
So all the files in My Computer are somewhere inside of the root.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,560
My desktop is in there my photos.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,320
It might not be directly instead of fruit it might be 20 or 100 folders down the line but eventually

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,910
everything is inside of it.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,400
So computers are organized in a tree like structure where we have folders inside of other folders sort

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,960
of like the branches of a tree.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,130
And I just have two represented here.

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,210
TNP temp and users but in the real world there's probably a dozen or more folders inside of my root

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,910
directory and then inside of the user's directory for example you might have another directory.

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,150
In this case colt you will probably have one depending on your user name for your computer that matches

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,090
that username.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,850
But that's not really the key thing here.

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,530
What's more important is just the basic structure.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
It's a tree like structure where we have a bunch of branches instead of other branches.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,850
And there's a top level thing called the root.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,560
Now why does this route matter.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Well every single file and folder on your computer has what's known as an absolute path.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,710
So an absolute path is just a way of referring to a file or folder based off of its position relative

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,060
to the root.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,000
So for example this colt directory is located instead of users which is located inside of root.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,990
So from anywhere on my computer or whatever folder I'm in I could refer to the absolute path of this

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:25,020
colt file or directory by saying slash for the root users for the users directory and then I add another

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,150
slash in between any other level any layer.

39
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,010
So it's slash users slash code.

40
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,930
And if I had another file or folder after this I would need another slash for every layer afterwards.

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,990
So again absolute paths always start with Slash and then it's just the full path to get to whatever

42
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,060
file or folder.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,940
So next we have a very big broad question Where am I not.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,840
What's your place in the universe but where are we in your terminal.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,850
So when I open up a new terminal window will actually do right now just command and on a Mac I make

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,860
this bigger What directory do I started.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,600
And you might think that I'm in the root directory but I'm actually not by default all terminals will

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,880
open up in what's known as the home directory.

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,620
So the home directory is represented by the till the little key usually above your tab.

50
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,340
You need to hit shift and then whatever this key is above the tab in order to get that till the.

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,420
But that's the default directory on almost every computer when you open up a terminal.

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,410
So it's usually the user name of your account on the computer.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,780
So in this case in my slide it's cold on my actual computer I believe it's called steal but that's inside

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,920
of a user's directory inside of root the slash.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,590
So these are the only two symbols you need to know for directories.

56
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,970
Root is slash.

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,890
And then the home directory which is where pretty much everything that you do in your life is represented

58
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,030
by a Tildy.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,030
So the rest of this on a typical computer is sort of default operating system stuff that we don't have

60
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,370
to mess with ourselves.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,570
And we can actually see when you open up that new window I have a little till the here and that tells

62
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,150
me that I'm in the home directory.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,110
But what if I actually wanted to know the exact absolute path of where I am.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,340
Fortunately there was a command for that.

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,000
So this is our first command.

66
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,880
PWT stands for print working directory and it tells you the full absolute path of wherever you are in

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,550
the command line and we haven't learned how to change directories how to move around.

68
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,240
So right now it's always going to tell you the exact same thing.

69
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,820
So if I was inside the stuff directory which we don't know how to do that just yet.

70
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,910
But if there wasn't another directory instead of my home called Stuff and I wanted to use PWT I would

71
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,950
get SAS users slash cold slash stuff I remember that first flash very important signifying the route.

72
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:57,300
So if I hop over here to my terminal and I just type PWT I get slash users slash cold steel because

73
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm not inside of a stuffed directory yet.

74
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm just in the home directory by default.

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,720
So that's all there is to PWT print working directory gives you the full absolute path of wherever you

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,280
are.

77
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,510
So in the next video we're going to learn how to change where you are but as a quick example I have

78
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,150
another terminal window open and I'm not in the home directory.

79
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,330
So I did some witchcraft.

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,050
You'll learn how to do in the next video to change directories.

81
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:29,660
And if I type PWT this time I get slash users slash cold steel slash desktop slash top secret.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,570
So I'm actually inside of this folder right here has nothing in it called top secret on my desktop.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,850
And the for absolute path looks like this.

84
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,400
OK.

85
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,620
So the next video we're going to learn how to change directories how to move around using the command

86
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,040
line.
