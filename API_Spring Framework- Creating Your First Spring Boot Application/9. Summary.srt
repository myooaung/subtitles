1
00:00:01,161 --> 00:00:01,723
At this point,

2
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:05,082
you should know enough about Spring Boot to take your app from creation all

3
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:08,347
the way to app deployment in a production environment.

4
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:10,635
Here's what we covered in this last section of the course

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,261
and what some of your takeaways should be.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,340
First, Spring Boot uses a containerless architecture.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,170
SharePoint utilizes an embedded container under the covers,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,953
which supports Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow servers out of the box.

9
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:27,705
Spring Boot provides a Maven plugin that can then package

10
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,643
your application as a standalone executable JAR file that

11
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:33,570
can be run anywhere Java runs.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,724
This enables your Spring Boot app to run nicely in cloud environments,

13
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:41,993
and Spring Boot and Spring supports the major cloud offerings.

14
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:42,242
Finally,

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,094
Spring Boot provides a way to package an app as a WAR

16
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:48,035
file rather than a standalone JAR file.

17
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,772
This allows you to deploy the app into an external

18
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,321
container if your need arises.

19
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,030
And that's it!

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,799
Thank you for taking the time to learn Spring Boot with me.

21
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,666
I really do appreciate the opportunity of helping others pick

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,557
up new skills and techniques that can help them with their

23
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:05,135
projects and software problems.

24
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,911
I encourage you to take the time to continue on the Spring framework

25
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:15,000
learning path to get a deeper understanding of each of the framework pieces that we've worked with in this course.
