Hello, my name is Dan Bunker, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.160
Creating your First Spring Boot Application.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.847
I've been building software applications and doing software

4
00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.872
consulting for many years now in the Salt Lake City area.

5
00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.213
Many of the applications that I have built have used Spring Boot.

6
00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:24.404
Why do I use this framework?

7
00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:25.789
Well, that is easy to answer.

8
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.694
Spring Boot makes building quality Java applications fast and easy.

9
00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:31.265
In this course,

10
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:34.234
we're going to learn exactly what Spring Boot is and why you

11
00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.909
might want to use it on your next project.

12
00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.532
Some of the major topics and exercises that we will cover

13
00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:45.921
include containerless architectures, customizing and configuring Spring Boot,

14
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.901
deploying Spring Boot in production environments,

15
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.421
and finally, we'll be building a Spring Boot app from scratch.

16
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.239
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.337
you'll know exactly how to create and work with a Spring Boot app,

18
00:00:57.337 --> 00:01:00.599
which will give you the ability to utilize this framework on

19
00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:04.383
your own on your own real-world project.

20
00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:08.277
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with just some basic Java,

21
00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:12.764
the Maven build tool, and web application fundamentals such as endpoints,

22
00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:15.974
REST, and relational databases.

23
00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:16.526
From here,

24
00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.842
you should feel comfortable diving into the Spring

25
00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:22.805
framework with courses on Core Spring, Spring MVC,

26
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:26.116
and Spring Data JPA.

27
00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:28.906
I hope you join me on this journey to learn Spring Boot with the

28
00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:37.000
Creating Your First Spring Boot Application, course at Pluralsight.
