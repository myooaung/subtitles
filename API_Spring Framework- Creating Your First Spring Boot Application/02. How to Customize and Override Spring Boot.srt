00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:04,147
The good news with Spring Boot is that it provides a lot of ways

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,858
to override and customize your application.

3
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:11,263
In fact, there is more than a dozen ways to set a property value for your app.

4
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,439
The bad news is there is an order of precedence that Spring and

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,079
Spring Boot uses to properly set your values.

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:18,832
If you're not careful,

7
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:22,543
you can have a property set incorrectly if you aren't aware of this.

8
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:26,827
First off, there are two basic places that you can put your configuration.

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,777
You can use something external to the app like command-line parameters,

10
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:33,670
environment variables, or JNDI stores,

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,144
or you can use something internal to your application like servlet parameters,

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,180
property files, and Java configuration.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,208
Keep in mind that your internal configuration tools

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:48,524
can also point to external sources.

15
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:52,061
Since there are a variety of ways that you can set up your configuration,

16
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,843
you should be aware of how Spring Boot handles reading and setting them.

17
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:59,587
Here is the basic order excluding test configuration setup.

18
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,790
The main rule of thumb is external property sources override

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,208
internal property sources with the exception of servlet config

20
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,448
and servlet context parameters.

21
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:14,111
Those take precedence over JNDI, system properties, and environment variables.

22
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:18,202
So here is my advice and a side note on how you should think about properties.

23
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,913
You should pick one internal source, like property files,

24
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:24,239
to set up your application defaults and then pick one

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,330
external source to provide overrides.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,448
This keeps configuration in one of two places,

27
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,705
allows for sensible defaults,

28
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:35,727
and then gives you the ability to use external sources for sensitive data,

29
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:38,126
like credentials and passwords.

30
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:41,275
I'm going to follow my advice in this course and use OS

31
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:45,191
environment variables as the external source and application

32
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,495
property files for the internal source.

33
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:48,207
Coming up next,

34
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:55,000
we'll start working with the basic application property files as our main internal source for configuration.
