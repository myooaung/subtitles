00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,220
Hello again my friend it's been a while.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,740
You've been hanging out with Sam what a great job he's been doing.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,550
Let's give it up for Sam round of applause Thank you Sam for all of your hard work and all of your awesomeness.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,620
What we're gonna do now we're nearly finished we're nearly finished polishing where we are with our

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,690
particular part of the game with our core combat and what I want to make sure is that you've got something

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,160
that really sparkles so that if you're showing it to people if this is a demo to say hey do you want

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,330
to work on this game you want to give me some money for this game I want to do a kickstarter for this

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,000
game whatever it is you've got it to the point where it's not looking like a tech demo so listen to

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,250
me loud and clear on this if you're a programmer and you want people to pay attention to your game it

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,950
can't look like you slept together haphazardly it needs to have a little bit of polish so I'm recommending

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,020
spending an hour or two doesn't have to take a long time to do it and polished your game and what I'm

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,240
gonna do for my game is a little bit of an audit where I'm going to grab a screenshot that allow me

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,020
just have a look at it and say What do I need to do here.

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,540
So it doesn't look so place hollering OKAY.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,140
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IN HERE I'VE lining out as I've been told I've been lining this up so I get most

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,150
of my moment in here you don't have to get your entire level if it's huge but you get something that

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,220
is indicative of yet.

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,940
That is my game that's my level.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,150
And what I'm going to do I'm on windows I'm doing Windows key W and I've got this snip and sketch you

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,380
can do a screenshot.

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,280
There's a million ways to get a screenshot.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,680
You want to get to the point where you can sketch over the top of your image here so you can make some

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,230
notes.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,860
And it's entirely up to you how much effort you do wrong button how much you do or don't put in at this

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,150
stage.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,110
Totally up to you.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,190
You might say Rick I don't care for that stuff.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,030
That is totally fine.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,410
So first thing to note for me is all my trees.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,780
Trees are very same me.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,100
So what I mean by Samy is they all look the same don't they.

32
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,830
So say me I need to get some variation in there some variety I can't just have the one tree asset over

33
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,790
and over and that's a similar thing with my houses in here.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,250
I think my houses look very bland so I need to find some assets switch them out.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,130
I can't have the same house house house exactly the same.

36
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,300
That was just place holder.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,910
Also there's a lack of consistency.

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,330
These two look different which you know we're just using a an asset pack as a free asset pack.

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,350
That was awesome but they look like they belong in different worlds and this is one of the things that

40
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,930
you'll find people on forums will be very upset with you or if you launch your game if you have things

41
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,700
that don't look like they belong in the same world.

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,750
Often that happens with a character doesn't look like it's in the same world as a as a building or a

43
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
tree and environment.

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,220
Okay.

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,960
I think my water needs a little bit of love.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,050
It's looking not very good at all and that and is are supposed to be bridges so I'm going to need a

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,190
bridge asset.

48
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,900
I think that's very important.

49
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,200
I also need to create some sort of story some sort of moment with my environment and I'm not gonna go

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,940
in massive detail at this point we're not at that stage of this entire journey that's going to be for

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,770
other parts of this entire series where we're talking more about level design or talking a lot more

52
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,730
about set dressing.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,730
But I do need a little bit of what I'm going to call set dressing what I mean by that is imagine you're

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,530
in a theater in the theater and you are wanting to show this is a particular medieval theme or it's

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,010
where it where on a spaceship or whatever it is you need some props you need some things so I've got

56
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,850
a blockade at the front here so I need some things that say I'm a blockade at the moment I've got what

57
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,720
two crates.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,940
That doesn't really say on a blockade.

59
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,690
So I need props need props to bootstrap my world.

60
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,550
The other thing a couple of things is my my path is very flat and this is something I see a lot when

61
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,710
people are putting together their prototype level is they have a very flat journey for the player.

62
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,110
Maybe some hills on the side.

63
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,940
We do have some undulations on our journey some ups and downs maybe not quite so Loch Ness Monster as

64
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,810
I've drawn it here.

65
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,220
Hello.

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,120
Not quite yet but we do need to have the playoffs have some elevation and run down something run above

67
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,040
something so it's not just flat the whole way.

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,600
It feels very very basic feels like input that much effort in when the whole thing is just flat.

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,330
So I want to put in a little bit of elevation.

70
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,590
Also we need to have some foliage foliage.

71
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,870
Personally I think this makes a huge difference to some grass like let's put some grass around our trees

72
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,540
so that our game isn't just a big flat round playing with these textures.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,350
These look good.

74
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,430
These textures here you can see the green and the brand that looks good underneath something.

75
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,610
But if it's just that doesn't look so good in my opinion.

76
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,660
Okay so I've done my audit let me just make a note here.

77
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,810
Props is one thing.

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,330
Bland houses.

79
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,340
I needed a little bit with my houses.

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,140
I think this is also number two.

81
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,640
This is also part of the houses the town 3 so trees Samy.

82
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,980
That's a 3.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,590
What else I need here for I needed a little bit of elevation in there.

84
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,560
5 I need some foliage.

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,850
This is not actually the order I'll do it in it's just me making a note at bridges.

86
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,660
There's one down there as well so make this a six four bridges and set dressing that seven.

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,360
Put some stuff throughout town.

88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,210
You know if you feel this is a final level you'll have a new game then you can really put a lot of love.

89
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,920
A lot of effort a lot of work into it.

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,540
Little lanterns hanging off the buildings a little fire pit in the middle of town.

91
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,540
But for me I'm going to put in a medium amount of effort to make it look better than it does now but

92
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,460
not necessarily final.

93
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,510
And what I'll do is I'll show you a little bit of how I'm going about doing that but a lot of the things

94
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,570
you know already in terms of how to do this.

95
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,260
So I'm going to skip through it pretty quickly.

96
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,100
Just so you can see what I'm up to maybe get a little bit of inspiration for your own game and your

97
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,050
own level and your own process.

98
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,230
So great work and I'll see in the next video.
