00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.710
So just a quick video here to show you a little bug in our camera facing stuff go and attack this main

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.260
God and give him a health bar.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
Then I want to show you that as I walk around him the rotation of that health bar is sometimes going

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.560
a little bit skew especially if he rotates quickly all the way around.

5
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.630
And that's no good.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.440
We don't want it going like that and my instant thought when that happens is this could be happening

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.370
in a race with some other update stuff.

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.170
So let's take a look at our camera facing a dot.

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.600
You can see here that the transform of this camera facing components is being updated on updates by

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.920
the camera's position.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.300
Now the problem is that maybe before or maybe after this update we could have other things modifying

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.960
the transform maybe even a parent transform so we could have our character rotating and the rotation

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.850
of the character could happen after we've done the rotation of the camera facing or it could happen

14
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.710
before on a particular frame.

15
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.680
It might change around and that's probably why we're seeing this behavior here where our health bar

16
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.030
is being rotated after we have rotated it towards the camera because what's happening is that the update

17
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.460
of the enemy is coming in later.

18
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.360
So what we want to make sure happens here is that our update is the last thing that happens here and

19
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.730
it's very easy way to do that is to do a late update.

20
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.340
And if we call it in late update and then go and hit play we should almost instantly see that it will

21
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.490
be better if we attack this guard and then run around him in circles you can see now that the health

22
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
bar is no longer being rotated in any way it's just following the character around.

23
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.770
So that's that bug quickly fixed.
