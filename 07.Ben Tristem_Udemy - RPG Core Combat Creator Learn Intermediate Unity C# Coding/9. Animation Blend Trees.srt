1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,610
In this video we're going to add a an actual mesh for our player.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,780
We're going to add a blend tree.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,060
We're going to set it up so that we can preview what happens when our character is walking.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,380
When our character is running so let's jump in and get started on some asset packs for us to download

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,070
first of all so if you want to find against this lecture there's two asset bags zipped up and so download

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,140
those and unzip them into a folder of your choice.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,650
One is the animations unarmed walk and run and the other is the polygon student sample Cindy studios

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,930
two point one.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,370
So what I'll do is unzip those and first of all drag the animations over into my project and then you

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,190
need to click import.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,020
Excellent as that comes in that's pretty quick.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,340
And then the other one is the polygon pack so drag that over on top of assets as well and import all

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,730
of those.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:00,020
Now this the second pack is an expansion or it's more assets from the existing assets that we have already.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:07,390
So it should go nice and neatly into the same folder the Sinti polygon student sample pack.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
I want to take a moment just to talk to you about what these assets are and where they came from.

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,220
There's a replay that shows the usage rights and it says this has been provided by Sinti studios and

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,510
I'm going to show you some details on them in just a second.

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,140
And you can use these for non-commercial use.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,920
So you're not allowed to sell these assets and you're not allowed to put them into a game.

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,000
There's efficient finished game that is selling for money but you can put them into your student project

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,790
and you can share it with your friends and you can use it to improve your skills and obviously go through

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,370
this course with us if you want to use them in a finished project then you need to go ahead and buy

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,080
the pack that they came from the packs that they came from from the provider.

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,490
And that is Sinti studios they're awesome.

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,930
They've helped us out a bunch in the past and they're really good folks are love supporting them.

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,020
Here's some of their assets I'm using if you so I give you this link to their Facebook page in the resources

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,130
against this lecture.

29
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,710
And also I'll give you a link to the asset store where you can find in the unity assets store the place

30
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:09,380
of all greatness I love the asset store where you can find all of this city studio assets I'm using

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,740
the polygon assets and there's tons and tons of different packs and if you're making a professional

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,610
game I think these assets look really slick and they're a pretty good investment I reckon.

33
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,780
And from time to time we get cool deals and discounts from these guys.

34
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,430
So if we do I'll have them as a link in the resources against this lecture as well.

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,300
So hopefully you've downloaded now the assets and installed them or imported them into our project.

36
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,910
Excellent.

37
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,680
Let's go ahead and use them.

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,280
You can see a couple of things first.

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,310
I've got some new layers.

40
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,420
This was from when we created our terrain there floating around a little bit I'm just going to rename

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,990
this new layer as green grass just so I'm not confused in the future and I'm drag it down into my terrain

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,340
textures I think also in our prefabs folder which is the one we're interested in in this new asset pack

43
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,120
the Sinti polygon student sample pack you can see prefabs I've got a bunch more we've got a couple of

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,200
characters and drop them in the scene just so we can have a look at them there's a cool one there's

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,310
a cool one and I was saying before I've got a couple of these new layers that was from when we created

46
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,440
the terrain textures earlier on yours might not be in here I don't know why mine ended up in this folder

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,650
but I'm gonna go ahead and rename them to something sensible and to drag them into the terrain textures

48
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:29,210
folder grass layer and drag that over into terrain textures and the final one which is what's that kind

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,940
of like dirt like dirt layer OK.

50
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,850
They weren't in the.

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,570
The asset pack they just happened to be saved in there for some reason.

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:40,830
OK.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,880
So what I've done I've grab my two characters I'm gonna choose this character on the left which is the

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,440
night or two I think he's looking pretty nifty and we need to go ahead and instead of having our egg

55
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,510
head driving around we're going to have our character.

56
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,580
So it's delete my character and the scene.

57
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,630
Okay ready for action.

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,210
So go ahead and find your player.

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,730
He's a play here for us.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,660
First thing I'll do is reset the transform the place a right click reset just so I know that all the

61
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,910
values are at 0 0 there's no wackiness going on double click on player in your hierarchy that'll zoom

62
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,850
you straight to it.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,690
Now get a phone from my Sinti prefabs folder I'm going to grab character night soldier 0 2 you can use

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,770
0 1 0 0 2 dragon on top of player which will child that to the player so the player is parent and the

65
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,300
character with the mesh.

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,140
In other words the geometry of how it looks and its materials is now the child can go ahead and get

67
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,360
rid of the egg and so by clicking on player will find the capsule right click on capsule remove component.

68
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,420
I'm also going to remove the capsule collider if we need a collider we'll put one on in the future but

69
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,940
right click remove component and then we have the nerve mesh agent.

70
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,260
If I'm clicked on that you'll see it's also kind of underground.

71
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,270
That's because our base of set was changed because of the capsule so click says one and change that

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,290
to zero.

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,340
Now it's at the right height I want to make it a little bit skinnier so the radius I'm going to change

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,130
to point three just so it hugs where the players outline is.

75
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,870
Cool stuff I'm going to click on player and I want to update the prefab for the player so up in the

76
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,910
top right you'll see the overrides button click on that and I'm going to apply all which means all of

77
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,670
the changes I just made to the night into the capsule collider etc are now part of the play a prefab

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,010
so you can see that the night remains a prefab and the player is a prefab and this is code nested prefab

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,040
so prefabs within prefab and it's something that Sam and I are going to go into a lot more detail later

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,030
on in particular when we're making changes to prefabs within prefab.

81
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,130
So for now let's just apply the changes to our player and keep moving on with our basic movement.

82
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,310
But rest assured we are going to spend a lot of time exploring nested prefabs in upcoming videos.

83
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,660
Okay.

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,100
What next.

85
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,740
Well we need to make our player walk and run and move around general locomotion.

86
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,660
So I'm going to show you a couple of pieces of terminology.

87
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,770
This will be a reminder for some of you it'll be a new introduction for others of you if you're new

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,610
to unity.

89
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,430
So what we need to do is add an animated component which assigns animations to game objects through

90
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,690
an animator controller.

91
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,180
We'll talk about animator controller in a moment but just a reminder that when you have any game object

92
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,070
these things that we attach to the game object are components and components give behavior to our game

93
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,400
object.

94
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,050
So we have a transform component.

95
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,260
We have a mesh renderer component I'm just clicking on them.

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,680
That's why they're opening and closing.

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,040
We have a nav mesh agent component and we're going to add another component right now which is an inmate

98
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,050
or I can click on the animator that's now added an animator component and you can see the very top line

99
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,040
is controller and is looking for a runtime animated controller.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,640
What is that.

101
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Well an animated controller is an arrangement of animations and transitions so a transition is going

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,750
from one state to another and we can think of this as a state machine.

103
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,680
I'll show you that in just a moment.

104
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,290
We also need to be implementing animations.

105
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,160
We downloaded a couple of animations in that asset pack that I just showed you and gave to you and they

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,750
are specific pieces of motion.

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,620
Obviously that's what animation is and we're gonna be implementing a blend tree y a blend free well

108
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,240
that allows us to have multiple animations and for them to be blended together smoothly so we can blend

109
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,980
from Idol which is just kind of standing around and wobbling a bit on the spot through to walk through

110
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,550
to run based upon a value that we use to say how fast the play is going so if the player is currently

111
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,270
at at zero then there'll be an idol if the play is currently at five they'll be running.

112
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,800
So let's implement all of these things we've just been talking about.

113
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,010
We have our animator.

114
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:40,730
We need an animated controller so within our assets directory over here I'm going to right click Create

115
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,760
folder and characters ruin the surprise by already having it in there didn't I.

116
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,630
Okay.

117
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:53,450
Of our characters folder double click on that in here and going to right click Create an animator controller

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,840
halfway down the middle.

119
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:01,610
And this I will call character character and we're gonna use his character animator controller.

120
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,500
The thing that drives the animations for probably for the player and for the enemies and for the NPC

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,550
is because there's a lot of commonality everyone needs to walk and move and and run for example.

122
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,810
So we've got a couple of windows that you might not have yet.

123
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,300
We give ourselves a bit more space.

124
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,480
Go to window and animation and find animator and then move it wherever you like I've got mine down in

125
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,080
the bottom here.

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,160
Just a reminder if I haven't told you this already to move you hold a tab.

127
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,770
You can move it and snap at different parts of the screen.

128
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm guessing you already know that already.

129
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,170
And we also need our animator window so window animation animation I might be in a slightly different

130
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,560
spot unit he likes to update.

131
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,690
This is updated recently in the version I'm using so it is loaded with me saying hang on I mean it was

132
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,560
that window that used to be just there.

133
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,530
So animation takes over animator and animation and you get the same set up as may make sure you clicked

134
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,150
on the parameters tab not the latest tab and in the animator you can see you've already got a couple

135
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,890
of states that don't really do much or me much at the moment.

136
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,210
Entry just means this is the very start when this game object and when this animator comes to life we

137
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,700
we are starting off this entry point and going somewhere in the moment is no effort to goes to so we're

138
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,110
going to right click and create state and we'll create from new blend tree.

139
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
So this is creating a blend tree and you can see here if we click on blend free we have an opportunity

140
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,380
to rename this I'm gonna rename this locomotion.

141
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,710
Look everybody doing a brand new dance now locomotion that's an old song reference for those of you

142
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,750
who are old like me locomotion.

143
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,400
Okay.

144
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,410
Doesn't look very interesting just yet but if we double click on locomotion we go inside to the blend

145
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,690
free where we can add some cool stuff.

146
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,640
So when I click on blend free can see I've got this preview tab window it might be down the bottom few

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,980
it snaps down they can drag it up a little bit.

148
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,690
Currently there's nothing going on that's because we don't have any motions we can click our button

149
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,090
here and add a motion field now it's gonna go through on your show you all this but I want you to go

150
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,040
all the way of discovery how to do this yourself.

151
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,270
So here's a challenge for this video to add our motion fields so add three motion fields and I just

152
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,770
showed you here you can click on the plus button add motion fields so add three of them and then using

153
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,580
the selector button that's the little circle with the dot in the middle.

154
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,690
Add an idol a walk and a run to these fields and then the preview window click Place.

155
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,910
This is a preview window that I'm showing you just here before and then slide the blend value seating

156
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,750
and find the blend value to see what happens within our preview window.

157
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,210
Okay.

158
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,480
So it's a pretty simple one in terms of there's not a lot of coding there's no coding.

159
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,440
It's pretty straightforward but just a little bit of finding where things are in the interface because

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,630
having you do it instead of following along directly with me.

161
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,170
So get it to a point where you have a character that has three states that you can blend between by

162
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,750
sliding the slider up and down.

163
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,160
OK.

164
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,470
Hopefully you did that challenge I know is a little bit of a different one to the sort of challenges

165
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,810
we do usually but let's go through it together so you can see what I did adding one adding two and adding

166
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,260
three motion fields click on the selector.

167
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,990
And these are the three animations we downloaded from our asset pack.

168
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,580
If you don't have these make sure you download the asset pack that I've given you and add Idol and then

169
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,160
selector again add walk and then for the third motion click on the selector and I'm going to add humanoid

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,830
run.

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,800
So I have my window here and I click on play at the moment not much is going on just standing there

172
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,320
idling.

173
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,780
Just a note up in the top right.

174
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,850
You can change the speed with which the preview happens you can make it really slow.

175
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,060
That's just changing the preview of the animations and drag this up to once that's playing at the proper

176
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,100
speed.

177
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,200
And I'm found my slider just here on the blend as I drag this up.

178
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,250
He's moving from from Idol to walk to run if you want to see what's going on up at the top here we've

179
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,770
got the blend where one animation is decreasing and the other one's increasing.

180
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,790
So this point right in between.

181
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,450
So it's going to be eight point seventy five which is halfway between the walk and the run.

182
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,180
He's doing a blended walk run.

183
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,650
So this is taking the animations and blending them together which means we're not pumping we're not

184
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,300
just walk walk walk and then all of a sudden pop into run and then pop back to walk walk walk and then

185
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,460
popping into run this blend allows it feel a lot more organic which is really cool means you create

186
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,810
three animations that you get this massive variety this organic feeling to the playoffs.

187
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,130
Okay.

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,960
So that's it.

189
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,810
That's that's what I want to show you in this video in terms of setting up a blend tree stunning our

190
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,620
animation characters not going to do anything yet if you're going to click play is going to be a little

191
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,190
bit broken because we haven't hooked up this relationship in code to say when the player is at zero

192
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,860
speed and when the player is at a greater speed.

193
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,180
That's what we'll need to do in upcoming video.

194
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,820
So great work and I'll see you again shortly.
