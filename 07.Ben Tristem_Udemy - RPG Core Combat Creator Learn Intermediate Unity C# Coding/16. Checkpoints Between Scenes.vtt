00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.100
In this lecture we are going to make it such that when you go through a portal the state that you left

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.840
the last scene in is exactly the same we can see I've got these two guards hanging around the portal

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.900
waiting to kill me because as I went through the portal last time they were chasing me and I didn't

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.340
manage to get rid of them because that is a way that we're saving our state.

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.080
So let's dive in and see how we can save and load when going through a portal so at the moment if I've

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.280
got a guard following me hot on my tail and I go through a portal and then come back that guard is no

8
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.870
longer there.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.120
He's walled off back to wherever he was.

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.770
But even if I had killed him at the last moment and I came back that guard won't be loaded back unless

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.620
I actually hit the load button.

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.600
That's not what we want.

13
00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.440
We want to be able to load back that guard whenever we enter the world so generally what we want to

14
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.830
happen is for these portals to act as checkpoints when we go through one the old world has been saved.

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.710
The new world gets loaded.

16
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.930
How are we going to do that.

17
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.830
Well the best place for that to happen is in our portal CSI script.

18
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.990
We already have all the transition code going on here if we had some saving code or some calls out to

19
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.830
the saving system.

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.380
That would be the perfect place.

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.390
But before we can do that we need to expose that ability from our saving wrapper not our saving system

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.430
because remember that our saving system doesn't know what our default save file is.

23
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.440
So the saving wrapper needs to be the place.

24
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.230
So first of all I'm going to extract the saving method that is currently one line which would get that

25
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.870
component saving system and we call it without default save file and we'll extract that into a save

26
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.550
method that will be public.

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.840
So let's go ahead and extract it and rename to save and I'm going to make it public as well.

28
00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.750
OK so that is now both being called in the whenever the key code S is down but also it will be can be

29
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.240
called from outside of here.

30
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.050
Now I'm gonna do the same thing with the loading system.

31
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.160
Let's go ahead and extract that method and rename it to load and again make that public too.

32
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.790
So these can both now be called from elsewhere.

33
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.940
And one more modification I want to make is to add a start method in here so that we can call load when

34
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.700
we first start our game.

35
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.170
Because one thing we're noticing is that if we start up the game at the moment it was not going back

36
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.150
to the previous save.

37
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.010
But if I hit play now it is taking me back to a previous safe which actually took me through a poor

38
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.290
source.

39
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.860
And the interesting little bug that might not be right but if we go back through the portal you notice

40
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.970
it hasn't gone to that saved location I had a couple of guards standing by the portal.

41
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.310
Now this isn't quite right.

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.580
So let's go ahead and challenge you to solve it by creating a portal system a checkpoint portal system.

43
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.900
So first of all you're going to want to save before you unload the scene because obviously if you unload

44
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.240
the scene there's not gonna be the state in that scene anymore to save and then load after you have

45
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.070
finished loading the next scene that is going to be the time when there's all the game objects in the

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.150
scene so you can put the state back in from the save file and then before positioning the character

47
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.220
that's the important thing because we position the character to the portal location and if he has been

48
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.590
positioned by loading the save file we want to override that with the portal that he's actually coming

49
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.650
through.

50
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.680
It's a poser video and have a go and see if you can achieve this and don't worry if you come across

51
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.620
a bug with your character not being position property properly like we had in the previous lesson lessons

52
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.780
due to the now format agent.

53
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.530
That is something we're going to fix in the challenge solution.

54
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.260
Suppose we didn't have okay.

55
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.970
Welcome back.

56
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.270
So let's see how far we can get.

57
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.540
So first of all we want to get hold of a saving rapper so I'm going to do this where we're getting hold

58
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.010
of at Fader as well as saving rapper and I'm just gonna call it this saving rapper as well just give

59
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:18.420
the variable the same name I'm gonna do a find object of type saving rapper and then we're going to

60
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.530
need to include the using RPG saving namespace with controlled dots or the light bulb.

61
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.050
So the saving rapper now can be called I'm going to call it just after we've done a fade out.

62
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.680
So we do a fade out then we can do the saving which might take a while depending on how much state you've

63
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.940
got in your scene.

64
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.480
So that's happening while with fade out to white.

65
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.010
So we're not going to see any rendering glitches or slow frame rate which is a good thing.

66
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.580
And then similarly we're going to want to load back in after our scene has finished loading we're going

67
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.360
to load from the save file but before we've got the other portal on before we've updated the player.

68
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.130
So let's see if that's going to work.

69
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.660
Go ahead and hit play and it is taking me to a random location.

70
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.110
Let's just go and overwrite that with a more logical safe file that doesn't take me to a random location

71
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.790
say hey these guys are following me if I go ahead and save over here then.

72
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.440
Is that going to work.

73
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.000
No because I'll go through the portal.

74
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It'll save them there where they were just before I entered the portal.

75
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.960
And if I go back through that is where they will still be chasing me and that's okay.

76
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.000
That's fine.

77
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.770
Now let's see whether if I go through the other portal I'm going to go to the top of the level as I

78
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.640
would expect because that's the last thing that happens it updates the players the last thing.

79
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.930
Okay.

80
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.150
This is where we've got the bug that I warned you about where have just been stopped by the hills.

81
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.000
And I think the reason here is that we're trying to move the player with the nav mesh enabled.

82
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.430
Why is the nav mesh enabled you're saying like we've actually disabled it in the player's prefab.

83
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.730
The reason it's enabled is because in load what we're doing in load is we are restoring a bunch of stuff

84
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.430
that we go to load here and we go to restore state and we go jumping through all these hoops to go to

85
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.590
the sables restore state which we've got in the safe entity.

86
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.090
You can see that we are disabling the damage but then we're re enabling it at the end which means that

87
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.640
it is actually enabled by the time we get to our portals update player.

88
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.060
So a more robust way of dealing with this instead of relying on the prefab to have it disabled initially

89
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.300
would be to get hold of an nav mesh component and enable and disable and enable it directly.

90
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.530
So when we're updating the transform we're just going to disable.

91
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.950
And also I've got to include the using Unity engine API namespace in order to do this enable and disable

92
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:50.610
and just copying the lines from salable entity and re enabling the math mesh agents just after we have

93
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.650
updated the players transform.

94
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.090
So it's doing a get nav mesh agent is this right.

95
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.810
No it's doing it on the portal.

96
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.710
So we need to make sure that it's player dot get components and again player dot get component nav mesh

97
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:12.090
agent is being re enabled at the end of it not not remembering that we are on a portal here rather than

98
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.720
on the player.

99
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.840
So let's see if that has now worked.

100
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.680
If I go ahead and hit play I should be taken through to the other level which is where I was and if

101
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:29.820
I go through my second portal I should be transported to the top of the level and if I just run through

102
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.730
this level and say I'm going to take a shortcut through the river which is a little bit naughty as should

103
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.700
not be allowed to do that but the game design kind of allows that at the moment that get rid of this

104
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:49.200
guard he's annoying me so having taken my sneaky shortcut and you can see that those two guards are

105
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.550
exactly where I left them.

106
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.120
So save file and loading file has worked even though I went through a different portal.

107
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.020
Fantastic stuff.

108
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.990
So as I mentioned a couple of lectures ago there is something that annoys me about our saleable entity

109
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.600
and that's the fact that it needs to know about the fact that we want to save the transformers position

110
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.550
for example that has information agent and that it has to do this action scheduler to cancel current

111
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:17.930
action all that stuff doesn't feel like it's the responsibility of the stable entity to know this.

112
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.350
Surely the movement component should be responsible for changing the position.

113
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.700
Surely the health component should be responsible for restoring its health.

114
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.380
That's what we're going to do in the next lecture making each component responsible for its own state

115
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.190
see that.
