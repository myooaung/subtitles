1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,530
In my previous video I mentioned that we were going to jump in and do scripted all objects very soon.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,050
That was a little bit of a misdirection because we have one or two things I want to do before that the

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:21,190
first thing is to solve the problem we have of how to create different animations for our different

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,820
weapons.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,050
So let's jump in and talk.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,990
Animations and get our character when he's swinging his sword instead of what he's thinking how he's

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,230
doing his punch animation.

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,600
We want to do a sword swing animation so let's have a look at our animator if you open up your animator

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,120
we know and have a look at our animator controller.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,020
You can see that we have locomotion attack death all these kind of good things.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,800
What is happening at the moment is in our tax state we have our unarmed attack animation which is a

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,990
valid animation if we want to punch.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,830
How are we going to go about creating a swing for our sword.

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,800
Well we could go and change in here and choose from our animation pack that we've brought in before

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,670
we could choose the sword attack.

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,530
That'd be cool.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:11,410
But when we go and pick up a crossbow when we pick up a mace or a spear then each time we have a different

18
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,130
weapon.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,510
We can't go and change in here beforehand and set up.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,460
We want that to happen at runtime within the game.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,740
Now there's a solution and the solution is the animator override controller.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,740
I've given you a link to this unity documentation here so you can read up about it a little bit more.

23
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,240
What we need to do is let's find our game folder with weapons in it.

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,650
I'm just going to create another folder here which I'll call sword because we're going to need to do

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,830
this for each of our different weapons so we'll check out a clip sword they're going to right click

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,370
and create animator override controller.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,780
Okay.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,360
What does the animator rename it.

29
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,550
First of all before I explain what's going on this will be the sword over ride can roll.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,950
Is what I'll call it.

31
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,200
AKA Excellent.

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,540
So what is it doing well with this override controller.

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,170
You can see here it's taking in an animated controller.

34
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,230
We've got the one at the moment which is our characters so let's go I'm fine in my photo game then characters

35
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,900
I've got my character animated controller so we put that in there and says Great.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,380
This is what I'm going to override.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,150
Now we get to choose which of the animations that are contained within our character animator controller.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
That's what we've got just here.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:36,190
Which of these we wish to swap at runtime when now or is it again just when our sword override controller

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,520
is being used and we'll write a little bit of code shortly that will say which animator override controller

41
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,640
we want to be using at what particular time.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,780
But here we can say well when we're in this sword when we're using the sword override controller when

43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,070
it's overriding our regular character controller we wish to change from an attack 3.

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,780
So to make an armed attack we want to find a sword attacks.

45
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,450
I've just got this sword attack R6 in here.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,940
So I want to say use this particular attack.

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,710
We could change any of these we could change have a different death.

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,260
We could have different run and different Idol et cetera.

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,420
So that's what the override controller is at runtime.

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,170
It's going to swap out this particular animation for the original animation and obviously we're going

51
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,370
to have an override controller for each of our weapons that we wish to look different that we wish to

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,480
have a different animation for.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,200
So let's go and create the code that will use the override controller and side note I've noticed my

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,210
errors that I said in the last video we'd fix in this video.

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,120
Well wait one more video before we fix those.

56
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,950
We'll we'll get to it.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,910
I promise you.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,440
But for now let's go and find our scripts.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,520
We will look at our combat and fighter.

60
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,720
We can put all these things in fighter for now but in a couple of videos time we'll be creating a different

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,270
class which will be the weapon class not doing it just yet because that is what will be our scripted

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,130
object.

63
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,290
So we're getting there I promise you this.

64
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,780
There's method to the madness.

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:06,340
First of all we need to give ourselves an animator override controller variable so let's serialize field

66
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:16,470
this would be animator or override controller and we'll call this weapon override over.

67
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,150
Right.

68
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,040
Got to remember the two eyes in there.

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,840
And again we'll start this off.

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,490
No.

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,610
Now let's find where our spawning our weapon underneath instantiate I'll get a handle to the animator

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:38,240
and animator animator and that will equal get component and of type and a metal OK.

73
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:48,890
So just getting the animator and then what we need to do is set this animator animator dot run time

74
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:57,160
animator controller equal to saving and figure out the rest of this what will equal the weapon override

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:04,240
weapon override is the animator override controller we've just created and we're going to set the runtime

76
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,090
automated controller to be this weapon override.

77
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,370
Let's save that up and just now the little micro challenge for you see if you can complete the rest

78
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,580
of it.

79
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,550
Just pretty obvious change in the inspector here what do you need to do to finish this off.

80
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:17,960
Okay.

81
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,220
Well we go into play out.

82
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:27,280
Funny I play a I'm going to go into the prefab of the player and then on the fighter script we have

83
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,500
the weapon override the weapon override will be let's see in here the sword override controller.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
Drop that straight in.

85
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,460
Excellent save that up I'll save it up click on play.

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,730
I'm so used to saying save it up and click on play in my script.

87
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,160
Let's run over this way civilly and find an enemy.

88
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,980
Click on the enemy and wait on the big swing with the sword.

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,660
Ha.

90
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,180
Then we go.

91
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,780
Awesome.

92
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,120
So we are changing the animation based upon our override controller.

93
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,930
Very cool.

94
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,190
Okay.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,270
Just a straightforward video there introducing the animator override controller so that we have the

96
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,800
pieces we need for the next video where I promise you in the next video we will be jumping into the

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,970
scripting all object for the weapons.

98
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,720
Okay great work and I'll see you again soon.
