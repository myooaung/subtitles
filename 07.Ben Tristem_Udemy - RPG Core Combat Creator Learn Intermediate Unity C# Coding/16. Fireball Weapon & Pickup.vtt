00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.260
Hello and welcome again.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.950
In the next couple of lectures we're going to be making ourselves a fireball projectile a weapon that

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.780
we'll be equipping to our planet to be on a shoot and I've broken it out in a more than just one lecture

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.990
because I was trying to create one lecture and it was becoming massive.

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.330
So I've broken it out into a couple and what we going to do in this video is set up the structure the

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.670
framework of making the weapon having the pick up and equipping it to the player so that we've got something

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.310
we can shoot and start testing in the next video.

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.870
So I'm going to give this to you as a challenge.

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.200
We've done it a few times so it should be straightforward.

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.450
But I want you to be doing this of your own accord.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.580
Make a viable weapon make a fireball projectile.

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.340
Don't worry about what it looks like yet.

13
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.590
That will be the subject for the next lecture.

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.590
For now just duplicate the route arrow prefab and rename that as fireball and start using that mega

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.420
fireball pickup that allows the player to have the the final weapon and then equipment and test says

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.200
he challenged jump in take that on I'll see you back here when you're done.

17
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.660
Okay let's get over into weapons or right click Create a folder and we'll call this fireball and within

18
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.690
the fireball weapon we want to fold.

19
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.160
Sorry when a right click Create weapons make new weapon and we'll call this fireball.

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.840
This is our scriptural object.

21
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.860
We also need to right click Create animator override controller which will call fireball a animator

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.220
to over ride.

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.090
Okay.

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.730
And I've forgotten a few times and I've been prototyping to go and change the controller here so that

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.970
we are using the character controller that we're overriding now while he will put in a some sort of

26
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.370
animation for my character I'm not going to use a star for a wand or something.

27
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.320
I'm just having the fireball come out of his hand.

28
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.180
But you could absolutely put a weapon or a symbol or something in his hand that'd be cool.

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.870
I'm going to select as my animation in here.

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.260
We should have something in our pack which is the item attack.

31
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.700
That's what I'll use if you'd like to see if you've got a weapon or a staff or something you might want

32
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.530
to use one of the other animations.

33
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.090
Now into fireball let's change the animator override to be the final animation to override prefab as

34
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.920
I'm mentioning I'm not going to have a prefab in here but you could absolutely have a staff or something.

35
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.640
Damage I'm going to leave low so we don't kill our dude just yet and projectile.

36
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.170
We haven't made that just yet.

37
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.010
We'll do that now.

38
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.090
Side note I don't think I mentioned I'll just grab one of my enemies and popped him over here and put

39
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.480
his chase radius down to 2 so that we can just do some little play testing and prototyping over here.

40
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.310
Now projectiles we've got our arrow projectile This is our route project I'm going to rename this route

41
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.310
arrow projectile and put a space in between similar what we did with our pickups we've got our route

42
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.910
pick up.

43
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.040
So if our route arrow projectile and then and then so these spaces don't bug me I'm just going to put

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.790
a space between arrow projectile blue and Arrow projectile red.

45
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.420
You don't have to.

46
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.910
I'm just tidying up a little bit and then from the root arrow projectile I'm going to duplicate that

47
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.220
and then rename this to fireball projectile in the future.

48
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.810
I might make this my route and then do a prefab variant of the fireball and prefab variants of this

49
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.110
others but for now I just have this is my my one project Darla work on it.

50
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.880
I'm not sure if I'm going to make other spell projectiles just yet.

51
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.550
So could our fireball projectile where do we need to place that.

52
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.080
Well we need to go to our fireball and then grab our projectile and drag it on over fireball projectile

53
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.190
which is going to look like an arrow.

54
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.680
Side note if you're holding it you drive across the screen the trail from the back of our projectile

55
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.910
you can see how it looks which is kind of cool.

56
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.080
Now let's just drop it in the player's hand to make sure we know it works a default weapon instead of

57
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.960
unarmed.

58
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.890
I will have as the fireball and I think I've missed a step in here let me go have a look at my fireball

59
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.630
weapon fireball.

60
00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.130
What's the range I want to have the range much further say 20 because it's gonna be a distance weapon.

61
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.440
Okay.

62
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.200
Run over to where the enemy is.

63
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.140
Click on the enemy.

64
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.370
Okay any through.

65
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.160
So if you imagine that this is a fireball not an arrow projectile I think it's gonna look pretty nifty

66
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.940
we've got the base functionality in there working pretty well.

67
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.490
I think we will need to slow down the speed of our fireball so we'll do that now.

68
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.030
Projectiles fireball projectile open up that changed to speed down to say 8 and leave everything else

69
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.840
as it is for now.

70
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.550
Because we want a way of visualizing it before we can put our nifty fireball particle system on our

71
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.360
fireball and just double check that this is working okay.

72
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.270
Whoops.

73
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.190
Click on you.

74
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.720
Bam.

75
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.930
Okay.

76
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.410
It's like a magic missile now isn't it.

77
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.290
If you've played Dungeons and Dragons you know about magic missiles.

78
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.890
Very cool.

79
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.460
Now we wanna make a pickup so that we've got all of our functionality in place.

80
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.190
Let's go to our pickups route pickup right click Create prefab variant.

81
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.310
We'll call this fireball pickup in the future we might have this as a spell or as a potion or as a mana

82
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.990
recharge.

83
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.350
But at this point we're working on the weapon functionality as opposed to the resource functionality

84
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.150
to open up our fireball pick up in here you can see that it's kind of empty.

85
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.350
We don't have anything in there because it's by straight on the route.

86
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.090
What do we want to have as our visualization.

87
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.780
I'm going to go to my asset packs fund the Sinti asset pack fund the prefabs and then just control and

88
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.200
scroll to make this slide to go up.

89
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.360
I think I'm gonna use this little flower thing.

90
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.220
Okay.

91
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.600
He's a flower dragged that under fireball pick up and then make it bigger maybe like 3 3 3.

92
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.300
Okay it looks big kind of looks a bit fiery.

93
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300
That's why I chose it.

94
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.530
Little bit random in a way.

95
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.430
And we need to move it over to the left.

96
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.220
So it's roughly in the middle.

97
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.560
Okay.

98
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.060
Roughly.

99
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.290
Good enough.

100
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.440
Back to our scene and find out pickups folder.

101
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.170
Yes there it is drag our newly created pickup which should be in our pickups folder fireball pickup.

102
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.590
Excellent just gonna go back to having my text here.

103
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.100
Fly ball pick up drag that into pickups move it in front of the dude.

104
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.990
I've been here a little bit okay.

105
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.020
And also while we're on the fireball pick up we need to make sure that it knows what it is.

106
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.480
Assigning as the weapons or weapon pickup we will make this the fireball okay.

107
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.650
That should be enough to test it out.

108
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.970
Click on play now currently equipped with a fireball so I have to run over and pick up the sword.

109
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.070
Blink run over and pick up the fireball.

110
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.360
There we go.

111
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.340
And bam.

112
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.650
There we go.

113
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.980
I got everything in place now with our functionality with the exception of the projectile itself which

114
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.390
we will do in the next video.

115
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.050
So great work.

116
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.040
And see you again shortly.
