00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.000
In the last video we're talking about macro details such as placing our buildings and trees and paths.

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.290
This video we're to mount micro details when it comes to polishing the look and feel of our game.

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.980
And that's going to include things like laying down some grass and looking to see where we can add a

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.130
little bit of motion in our world and generally tweaking and tuning things down at the micro level.

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.010
So I'm going to go straight away to the asset store find my good old favorite standard assets click

6
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.480
on import and then from here I'm going to find a little bit of 2D billboards to use for my grass use

7
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.890
my grass fronds.

8
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.040
I think they're going to be cold.

9
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.770
So I'm going to deselect everything and just have a look down here when I find environments.

10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.320
There it is environments just close up speed free under terrain assets.

11
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.110
There we go.

12
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
So we want these billboard textures and I might as well bring in these other surface textures just in

13
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.960
case I want to play around with that a little bit more as well.

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.790
Click import.

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.790
That should put it down into my standard assets folder.

16
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.370
There it is terrains and we've got our grass fronds.

17
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.280
You may have been through this approach before I tend to do this in a few of our courses I think because

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.830
I love terrain I love placing down grass on a bit of a fan of doing it.

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.010
So if you know how to do it already go ahead and jump in as little mini challenge go and create your

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.600
grass and place it around.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.860
But I'm going to show you how I go about doing this.

22
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.210
They click on you to then click on the paint detail scroll on down until you find the Edit Details button

23
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.000
click on that we're going to add a grass texture.

24
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.580
Now I've already got my folder open here with my grass front I'm going to drag that over into the detail

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.630
texture area.

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.160
We can play around with all these values.

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.610
I find it easier to click add and then paint.

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.150
So make sure you select it on your grass front paint something in the scene.

29
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.720
There we go.

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.980
Doesn't look all that great.

31
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.390
I want to change the color and change the size with it already placed in the world.

32
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.960
Now if I double click on this I can change some of these values and that will change what I see what's

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.990
already being placed in the world so to make him a little bit smaller I think.

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.360
Maximum height minimum height maximum with the minimum width.

35
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.360
And there we go change the color of it maybe make them a little bit of a purple greenish blue kind of

36
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.730
thing and just you can generally play around with the healthy color as well as the dry color.

37
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.410
And we go make a sort of a bluey green kind of look to it and you can change the noise Fred so that

38
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.270
you get a little bit of variation which I think is important.

39
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.810
Have the not looking exactly the same click on Apply.

40
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.820
Great job done now I can go and paint these all around in the world before I do that.

41
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.790
I'll show you that we can add another one so add grass texture and I can use the exact same to the billboard.

42
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.780
What is a billboard you might say if you're not familiar with the terminology.

43
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.170
Just means it's a flat.

44
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.320
I mean just exit out of this it means that it is a flat 2D object but as we spin around in the world

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.170
it's going to change to face the camera so always looks like those guys are facing the camera.

46
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.100
Despite the fact if we scroll up above them I'll see if I can do that.

47
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.750
You should be out to see that they are just there's some there they're just flat images that are trying

48
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.520
to face the camera no matter where you are.

49
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.600
That's what a billboard is.

50
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.350
OK.

51
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.060
So back to the point I was making before.

52
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.610
If I can get my camera to behave click on paint detail scroll on down I'm going to add a grass texture

53
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.440
I can add the same one and drop that in once again I'm going to click ad then click on the second one

54
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.380
make sure you do that to a click.

55
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.440
Now once again I can go in now.

56
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.760
I just double click on here to do it and I can edit the details of this to give it a different look

57
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.330
to the look that I've got already for the the first cross that I put in the same sense more of a grainy

58
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.000
kind of look and it's nice and huge and we'll make it a little bit of a yellowy feel.

59
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.770
So I might do some of this grass.

60
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.060
It's like pure yellow.

61
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.300
I'll do that right now.

62
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.590
Make some pure yellow grass and we'll pretend this is like a cornfield or something that you can run

63
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.370
through.

64
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.550
So that is how we get variation.

65
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.890
Once again you know I'm a big fan of variation with the minimum amount of assets but maximum amount

66
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.180
of variation for the player within the game.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.720
So there we go.

68
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.640
Created some grass.

69
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.070
I'm going to go ahead now and finish this and place it around in my world in places I think make sense

70
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.110
like at the base of the tree or along the edge of the road to give some detail to my world you might

71
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.980
want to do the same.

72
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.310
If you're adding grass to your world and I will post a video and be back here when I'm done.

73
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.560
Okay I'm back.

74
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.590
I've added a bunch of grass into my level lots and lots I like the busyness the detail that comes along

75
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.250
with adding grass I've tried to be a little bit logical as well I've got the longer grass around the

76
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.210
trees or around the rocks or fences where people wouldn't have stepped on it.

77
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.220
But along the paths I've made it more patchy to say well people have stepped on the grass and the grass

78
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.780
is not there anymore.

79
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.890
So what I've been up to.

80
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.100
OK.

81
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.410
You might also notice that my skybox is a bit different.

82
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.540
I wasn't really happy with it.

83
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.660
So I've gone and added a new skybox just looking at these little details as I go.

84
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.260
How can I make it look more interesting.

85
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.510
It's going to be the nighttime feel to it the skybox so I think that's giving me ideas of how to make

86
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.670
my level more interesting with lights which is something I'll do a little bit of now I'll find my main

87
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.040
directional light.

88
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.850
I think that's in core directional light and it's turn the intensity of that down a little bit.

89
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.320
Just to give this more of a nighttime feel changed the color perhaps to give it more of a bluey Bluey

90
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.810
kind of feel.

91
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.020
Yeah that's not too bad.

92
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.670
I want to go to blue in this and then click on the lighting tab and see if I can find what's being brought

93
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.330
in from my skybox here intensity.

94
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.720
It's not doing a lot.

95
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.060
I can turn all the way down and it's then rely on the lights I'm going to play some point lights throughout

96
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.480
my scene which I think can be quite interesting you can see I've already got a couple in there that

97
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.500
I've brought from one of my other projects I was fiddling around with I've got a bit of light in there

98
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.300
I think I will have some lighting the scene I don't want it to washed out I wanted to have it more of

99
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.920
a you know it's a reasonably well lit well it town at nighttime just to make it all more interesting

100
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.990
with those lights and fire over here you can save a little bit of fire happening so that does bring

101
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.550
me to the next thing I want to show you that I've been doing if I click here I've gone an added the

102
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.350
effects fire in his eyes you run along you can see you've got the particles for this fire I it's really

103
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.840
cool casting some light I could probably increase that I'll just drop the point light underneath my

104
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.910
Camp Fire so you can see here click on point light if you're not sure how to do that well I'll remind

105
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.710
you right click on the camp fire find light and add a point light.

106
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.370
Simple as that.

107
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.180
You know how to do these things.

108
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.750
There we go.

109
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.550
Point Light I might want to make it a little bit brighter so Oh so I need to click on my inspector I

110
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.110
nearly went and fiddle with my overall intensity lighting that gee that Fry is bright but now I need

111
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.620
to click on inspector find the intensity of my fire here make sure it's a fiery kind of color and yeah

112
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.550
I think that's pretty good and change the range maybe there we go.

113
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.700
Nice bright fire.

114
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.970
For all the people to run past and cast shadows very cool.

115
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.510
And as I mentioned before I've got a couple of these other little point lights that are in these.

116
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.790
What would they be called.

117
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.390
Is it got a name.

118
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.950
It's a brassiere.

119
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.130
I thought that was something that ladies wear.

120
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.610
I think that's something different actually a that's a brassiere.

121
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.390
OK.

122
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.010
They may showing how clever I am not so I'm going to increase the intensity a little bit here.

123
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.990
OK.

124
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.420
Playing around with is giving a weird kind of shadowy thing here.

125
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.990
I think I'll leave that the weed shadowy thing's not too bad.

126
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.020
I had another one I popped over there so I'm gonna go round and place a few of these point lights in

127
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.580
the world find spots like this lamp he or I can put a light on it maybe live with a light coming out

128
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.340
the window just to give that punching a straight world maybe keep it a bit darker around here because

129
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.850
this is the spooky part of town perhaps.

130
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.600
OK so going to finesse my lighting a little bit more if you haven't finished the lighting in your level

131
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.720
now's a good time to do that so my challenge for you is to finesse your lighting and I'll be back here

132
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.250
in a moment to show you what I've come up with okay I've finished the lighting in my world one thing

133
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:09.250
I did when clicked on the lighting tab I changed the environment environment lighting from skybox to

134
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.660
gradient so it's a subtle impact but something that gives you a lot of control when you click on gradient.

135
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.930
You can change the different aspects the the lighting influences coming from Sky and Equator and ground

136
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.300
in particular equator if you change that it can have a really large impact on the overall vibe of your

137
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.820
world and the color that's being brought in.

138
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.490
So if you want to give it a tone or a mood you wanna make it a little bit warmer a little bit cooler.

139
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.690
You can do that by playing around in the environment lighting and changing to gradient.

140
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.990
I've also added some particle effects here and there.

141
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.760
I think it's great to add some particles I've added particle you can see the smoke coming out of the

142
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.060
chimney of a house do that in a couple of places.

143
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.840
The flames on top of my fire sources there to give a little bit of logical explanation as to why there

144
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.800
is a light source happening and I've taken that from the Sinti simple effects particle effect pack and

145
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.240
what we're talking about particles.

146
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.610
There's one little trick that I like to do as well to get a bit of motion and a little bit of filler

147
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.650
in the world to give us a little bit of polish and let's have some a little bit of like fairy dust type

148
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.140
particles follow the player around as they run around.

149
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.150
So I've created previously a little particle system that I'm going to give you against this lecture

150
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.990
as a download.

151
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:31.770
I'm going to drag that into my project now and it's simply called fairy dust particles just import that

152
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.200
yours to use however you like.

153
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.770
That's something that I've created myself.

154
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.700
And if you want to see how it's been created.

155
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.540
Check that out.

156
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:48.920
Let's see fairy dust particles are going to place these firing into places in game and effects straight

157
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.090
into game effects.

158
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.780
I think the right spot for that.

159
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.550
Okay so fairy dust particles grab that so first of all let's open up our play a prefab and then drag

160
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.740
in the fairy dust particles on top of player.

161
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:08.960
You can see we've got these kind of little dust particles things floating around and as the player moves.

162
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.480
This is going to follow but leave a trail behind the player.

163
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.110
So it looks like they're in the entire world but they're just in this little volume around the player

164
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.680
here.

165
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.810
And the important thing here is simulation space is set to world.

166
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.840
You can have a look at my other settings if you want to see how I created this.

167
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.230
You can change the color of course if you want to use this yourself in your own world.

168
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.130
I want to make it a little bit of a warmer type color or.

169
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.920
Yeah I think that's pretty good for me make a little bit more yellow with more dust particles as we're

170
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.570
running around in the world.

171
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.320
So let's see the impact of this.

172
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:46.490
When I click on play now hopefully that has stuck to the player so you can see we've got these little

173
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.840
particles that are floating around swirling in the world might not see your game.

174
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.780
They're reasonably cartoony it suits the nature of my game I think so I quite like it as we're running

175
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.430
around we just see the particles if I zoom out here in the same view you can see that the particles

176
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.320
are around my player but over here they're not in the world.

177
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.720
So kind of looks from the player's perspective like they're in the entire world but we know that they're

178
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.320
just being childish to the player and following the player as a player runs ran.

179
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.240
So in the space of just a couple of lectures we've gone through a whole bunch of things in terms of

180
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.780
placing our buildings and props and making sure that our water looks good and adding particles playing

181
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.950
around with our lighting.

182
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:34.010
These things they they might take you a day or two to add to your game and so they will take a bit of

183
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.710
time but I think the value of putting them in is enormous because when you get there and show someone

184
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:44.460
you gaming like hey look I've got combat the guys can shoot there's hit points it's really fun.

185
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.310
See if you can beat my level adding these little bits of Polish and little bits of detail really help

186
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.020
sell that experience.

187
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.790
You don't need to put in a huge amount of time but just getting yourself some nice assets and putting

188
00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:01.280
in a little bit of love I think can make a massive difference to how enjoyable your game is even if

189
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.540
it's in the early prototype stage.

190
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.080
So there we have it.

191
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.590
Hopefully your game is looking great.

192
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.540
As always I'd love to see some screenshots of some videos of it and I'll see you in an upcoming lecture.
