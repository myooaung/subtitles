00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.610
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.870
It's quite simple really what we're gonna be doing is adding a different cursor when we're over a piece

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.940
of UI and if we click on a piece of UI we're no longer going to be doing the action that was behind

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.240
it.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.450
It has blocked the action and the right cast that got sent through the world.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.300
So let's dive in and see how that's done so when we play the game at the moment we've got curses when

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.680
we go for an enemy we've got curses when we go over the ground and when we're over empty space we get

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.420
this none cursor as well.

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.720
Well I'd also like to have here is a cursor for when we go over UI.

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.400
Now at the moment our UI doesn't really have a background in the future we will have more elaborate

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.620
UI will have health bars and stuff like that and we want to have our cursor show that if we click here

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.630
nothing's going to happen.

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.060
And we also want it to be the case that if we click here nothing happens.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.040
So I'm going to create a little bit of a contrived scenario here because we don't want to dive into

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.140
UI just yet but we do want to make this possible to show us the kind of issues we might have.

16
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.070
So let's open up our HUD prefab under.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.630
For me it's under game UI and I'm going to open up the HUD prefab go over to my scene where I have my

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.750
hud and I am going to pull in just a black rectangle to be the background for that HUD.

19
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.180
So I'm going to take this 3-D not No.3 object I want a UI object and it's just going to be an image

20
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.340
which I'm going to rename to background and I'm going to put this image up to the top left I'm going

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.190
to anchor it to the top left as well and I'm going to reach scale a few things.

22
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.640
If you think in a box like that and I'm going to change the color of it by going to the image and changing

23
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.310
the color I'm not selecting an actual image.

24
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.410
And then I can put it underneath the text by actually moving it up in the hierarchy slightly confusingly

25
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.320
and I'm just going to recenter things a little bit and I even might try and make this a little bit opaque

26
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.640
so we can see behind it.

27
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.980
So let's see if that's possible.

28
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.160
Go to the color and change the alpha yet I can make it slightly.

29
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.220
Transparency is not what I meant.

30
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:16.760
Rather than opaque so we can see now that in game we have got this this view we've got this health bars

31
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.490
and whatever.

32
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.200
And what we'd like to happen is when we're mousing over that we cannot click through and we ultimately

33
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.390
are going to have a different cursor as well.

34
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.260
So we're going to go over to visual studio code and we are gonna go to our player controller C.S. class

35
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.850
and I want to go to our update method where we are checking first of all if the player is dead then

36
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.680
we are interacting with combat then we're interacting with movement actually before the players even

37
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.150
dead.

38
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.590
We can also interact with UI.

39
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.050
So we want to be checking that cursor.

40
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.870
So I'm going to do an if.

41
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.950
Let's see first of all we want to say if this basically want to say can we interact with UI and we're

42
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.740
going to create a function for that in a second.

43
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.410
And if we can interact with UI then we do nothing else.

44
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.240
We don't interact with combat or movement nor do we need to check if our character is dead and that's

45
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.500
just remind me of something.

46
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.850
If the character actually is dead what cursor type should we be showing on anything that isn't UI.

47
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.560
We should probably be using that none cursor type.

48
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:29.210
So I am going to go ahead and put a return in here nice and early where we do and if returned just the

49
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.300
same as before going to expand it out with a few brackets and I'm going to make a copy of set cursor

50
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.040
and put that in.

51
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.540
So if we're dead we have the set cursor type none.

52
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.060
If you wanted to have your own special different type of cursor for this situation you could have a

53
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.280
cursor type of type dead maybe has a skull and crossbones if you try and click anywhere that isn't UI

54
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.360
obviously you want to be able to click on UI because you want to be able to reload the level or whatever

55
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.850
it is you give them the player the option at that point to do something with the UI usually in this

56
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.530
kind of game.

57
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.180
So we're going to create that interact with UI method and we're going to have a look at how we want

58
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.480
it to work.

59
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.500
Basically we want to return true or false depending on whether we are hovering over a piece of UI.

60
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.870
Now how does that actually look.

61
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.010
Well for this we need to use Unity's event system which is kind of what handles all the clicking with

62
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.620
UI and we're doing event system.

63
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.940
Looks like I need to include something yet I need to use Unity engine dot event system to get this and

64
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.540
then it's going to be event system dot current.

65
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.740
And then it's going to be dot is pointer over game object.

66
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.400
Now that's confusing because you'd think OK is it over game object is over a game object in the world

67
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.560
is over a game object right.

68
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.590
Well this actually just refers to UI game objects that because we're dealing with the event system.

69
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.620
What it's saying is is this over a game object that is a piece of UI.

70
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.980
Confusing I know but that's what it is.

71
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.100
And it returns a boolean.

72
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.060
So if if it's over some UI then we are interacting with UI.

73
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.450
If it's not over UI then we are not.

74
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.980
So we can go ahead and play to try and test it out see if we are getting that sort of behavior.

75
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.200
I would expect now that if I click somewhere in the UI nothing happens.

76
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.600
But what I'm also seeing is that nothing happens if I click anywhere else which is obviously no good.

77
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.210
Now why is that happening why is it that when I click somewhere else I'm also not being able to interact

78
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.810
with you I and the culprit actually here is the fader because the fader is a piece of you.

79
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.340
Let's go and have a look at our scene just convince ourselves go back to the main scene.

80
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.710
In fact let's go ahead and hit play so we can see what's been put in the world in spawned don't destroy

81
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.570
and load persistent objects we've got a fader and the fader is a canvas so it is a UI object it responds

82
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.900
to UI clicks and such like which obviously is not really ideal.

83
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.850
So what we're going to do is we're gonna go find our Fader prefab so that's going to be over in game

84
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.140
core fader.

85
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:16.910
And in this prefab you'll notice that the canvas group here has both intractable and blocks recasts.

86
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.340
Now if we actually switch off both of these what we're going to get is that now there is no way to essentially

87
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.500
click on the fate which is fine we don't need to click on the fader but also it is going to make sure

88
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.960
that we can click through to the world which is just what we want.

89
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.550
Fantastic.

90
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.860
So in here I'm gonna be able to click into the world which is just what I wanted.

91
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.530
But if I am here over this piece of UI I cannot click through the UI.

92
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.770
Now that's obviously a little bit confusing because it looks like I can still move I still got my movement

93
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.970
cursor showing up when I'm over that UI fact it depends whatever else I had before.

94
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.040
So if I am over this garden then I go over the wall.

95
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.980
It keeps that cursor so it's not being updated while I go over this game object this UI game object.

96
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.570
So it's time thought your challenge to change that cursor over the UI so you're going to add a new cursor

97
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.780
type for UI specifically remember where you need to do that set the cursor at the right time i.e. when

98
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.440
you're over the UI and not when you're not over the UI and set up a cursor on the player prefab so that

99
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.300
you've got something that looks different.

100
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.400
Pause the video and have a go.

101
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.980
Okay so I'm gonna dive back in here into Visual Studio and The Player controller and first of all I

102
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.890
want to add to the enum make sure when you're adding to the E names that you do this to the end because

103
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.140
actually it comes under the hood.

104
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.700
Just integer values.

105
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:48.870
And that is what is serialized by unity so if movement was one and you go and insert something in here

106
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.950
then everything that was previously movement now becomes this new location which is a little bit confusing.

107
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.420
If you end up in that situation where you thought your movement cursor was one thing and now it's all

108
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.710
swapped around.

109
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.290
So what we want to do is just add to the end because it's going to be 0 1 2 and 3 3 obviously hasn't

110
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.250
been used yet anyway because we didn't have it in the enum.

111
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.100
So adding to the end up in arms.

112
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.380
That's important.

113
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:21.360
Now what I'm gonna do is create a UI cursor in here and I am gonna go ahead and use it in our interact

114
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.290
with UI function.

115
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.600
So at the moment we're just returning this boolean but what I want to do is in the case that it's true.

116
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.440
I want to actually set the cursor going to turn this into an if statement that says if the event system

117
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.810
is over a pointer object then we're gonna want to want to do two things First of all we're gonna want

118
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:46.680
to set the cursor to cursor type of DOT whoopsie daisies and Dot UI like so and then we are going to

119
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:54.420
want to just return true because well we are over some UI and we can interact with UI ultimately answering

120
00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.020
that question of the boolean of the interact with UI boolean so then we want to do return false.

121
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.390
In the case that this if statement wasn't returning already that should pretty much block UI for us

122
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:15.810
but we do need to go and add in a cursor so I'm gonna go to the characters player prefab and on the

123
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:23.100
player prefab scroll on down to where we've got our player controller and we've got add different element

124
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.460
types.

125
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:30.110
Now I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate that element type of nun and switch it over to UI and I'm gonna

126
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.390
want to find a new nice cursor.

127
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.800
So let's go ahead and select this cursor.

128
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.520
I've got something for UI and then let's have a look.

129
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.110
What can we do.

130
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.060
I'm gonna go for white for UI now that makes it slightly confusing on movement.

131
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.730
I think let's see if there's something more appropriate for movement.

132
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.870
There might not be at this time.

133
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.590
I'll try this.

134
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.160
Crosshairs for movement.

135
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:59.490
Instead so selecting the player again into D selected it and moving these crosshairs for movement and

136
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.820
then probably I can keep the cursor is white.

137
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.100
Yep I think so.

138
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.310
Let's go ahead and hit play now.

139
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.790
So I'm seeing the crosshairs when I can move to a location.

140
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.740
I'm seeing the sword when I can attack when I'm over the UI.

141
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.320
I get a UI cursor a white UI cursor saying I can interact with this UI.

142
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.580
Fantastic.

143
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.640
Now in the next lecture we are gonna be looking at how we can make weapon pickups intractable and in

144
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.080
the process of doing that we gonna create a really generic system for any component in the world to

145
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.000
be intractable and set the cursor type so I will see you in that lecture.
