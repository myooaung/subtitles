1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,860
Welcome again my friend in this video.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,910
We're gonna make an art show.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,170
We're going to shoot arrows and those arrows are gonna have a spiffy trials coming out the back of them

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,750
to make them really easy to see on our screen.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,760
So let's jump in and get started.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,140
Okay.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,410
Just to recap where we are now.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,220
This is our arrow.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,810
We shoot.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,900
Balance pretty bland.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,360
Not very exciting so let's resolve that the first thing I'm going do is you know I need to get my speed

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,750
of my arrow how I want it so I'm gonna go into my arrow projectile prefab and turn the speed.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,370
I think I can turn off to 20 and then just check that this is good because when we're creating a trail

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,180
to come flying off our arrow we want to know that we've got our speed settled in a way we're happy with

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,250
it.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,880
So yeah it feels like a good I can see it flying across the screen.

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,990
It feels pretty quick.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,390
I like it.

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:49,640
Okay.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,370
So I'm gonna have my arrow speed my projectile speed at 20.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,630
Now within my arrow myself a bit of space here that will click on simple arrow.

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,070
Okay.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,760
So within here we've got our arrow we've got our collision boxing to add as a new child under arrow

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,420
projectile right click and go into effect and we have something here called trail.

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,740
So we have our trail first we're going to do is turn down the time because this is like a particle system.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,770
This is how long things will be emitted for on our trial.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,010
Before I show you exactly what's going on the trial will turn it down to say point to.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,670
Yeah that looks.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,430
Now if I grab the handle this is selected on trial so I grab my selection handle here move it right

30
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:30,730
and left.

31
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,400
You can see as I move along there's a trial that comes flying along behind doesn't look very arrow only

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,460
at the moment.

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,180
So what we want to do is decrease the width of it it's to be at the moment so the width at the moment

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,180
you can see here and our selection is one we can change the curve on it.

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,650
I'm going to have this starting point down at say point three.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,350
Now when I move it around I get still pretty big but that's okay.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,110
So I want to have the middle of my trail a bit fatter.

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,810
So on ours our curve graph here I'm going to double click to make a new point in the middle and then

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,410
double click to make a new point down at the end drag the first point down to around about point 1 and

40
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,810
drag the middle point down a little bit and drag the end point all the way down to the end see how that

41
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,770
looks when I slide it along so simulate how the arrow would go like bells we shoot along the screen.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,430
Okay.

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
That's looking okay.

44
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,910
I think I want to make sure that it's back in the zero point on my Z axis or wherever it is that I want

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,700
the trail to be appearing if I want the child to be at the back of the arrow.

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,700
You might want to have it a little bit forward so you can see the front the shaft of the arrow maybe

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,810
the trial is coming out over the feathers however you want to do that.

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,470
But now when we get back into the game and click on play Let's see if this is worked.

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,810
Run run run run run over to my enemies I might move an enemy so I don't have to run so far and click

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,790
shoot and you can see this trial's coming out the back of my arrow which is really cool and you can

51
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,750
shoot it at the moment you can see I've got a kind of narrow and then a little bit of fat in the middle

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,580
you can tune it to your heart's content and you can make it a little bit shorter or a little bit longer.

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,070
I would change that by decreasing or increasing the time I'll just while I'm here.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,740
I don't think we need to receive shadow so we'll click that off doesn't really matter but we'll click

55
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,940
it off just so we're not putting a bit more strain on the system.

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,250
Next thing I'm going to do in this lecture is make ourselves an answer and then we're gonna make ourselves

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,150
a different variant of the arrow so that the Archer has he's shooting a different arrow that we're shooting

58
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,080
at him just to give a little response to the game and it gives us a chance to do a little bit more with

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
prefab variant.

60
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,010
So scroll down to the game folder find characters open that up looks like some of these things on in

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,760
their photos.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,350
Tsk tsk because that may or Sam probably Sam he tends to do these things doesn't he.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,860
Okay.

64
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,270
Drag them into their photos.

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,930
The truth is it's me and we all know it.

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,810
I might make a will leave characters where it is okay.

67
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,750
So within enemies this is our enemy prefab we know what our enemy prefab looks like.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,080
Just drop it in there to show you again what I'm going to do is right click and find where are we upping

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,880
create.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,770
And we will create a prefab variant to your character.

71
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,970
Then we go enemy and we have this enemy variant which I will call ARCHER Okay.

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,230
So just to be clear Archer is a prefab variant of enemy.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,610
Let's open up our Archer have a look at the arch I'll do two main things in here.

74
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,910
One will give the Archer a different color just so we can distinguish it from the other enemies.

75
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,810
So where are we.

76
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,140
There we're looking at now Sinti assets.

77
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
Let's see Sinti assets.

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,060
Where are you.

79
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,870
There we go.

80
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,400
Sinti looking for materials and I think I will make this guy black.

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,790
No make it red.

82
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,380
You can change whatever you want to your heart's content and then the other thing we're going to do

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,800
obviously is to do.

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,810
To give the Archer a bow.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,170
Okay.

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,120
Now the Archer has a bow.

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,220
Cool now back over into the game.

88
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,370
Let us drop in one of these new awesome arches into our world.

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,730
Standing here.

90
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,750
Front and center so we can have a little battle with the archer.

91
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,540
Okay cool.

92
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,130
He's got a bow we've got a bow.

93
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,520
Let's just check that all the things work properly.

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,530
Run run run run run and he's going to shoot me.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,590
BROWN Yeah you can see his trial happening.

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,580
Bit of a problem when I stand here he's like oh I guess I shouldn't shoot anymore but how we can shoot

97
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,390
you and you can't shoot us.

98
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,170
That is pretty cool for about two seconds but the player would be I think get pretty bored with that.

99
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,190
So there are a few things here I want to give you as a challenge to tighten up this whole archery experience.

100
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,290
Basically make out Archer more rad so to create two projectile variants.

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,530
So each script hated a variant of an enemy one to have a base projectile and have two variants of that

102
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,320
for me.

103
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,170
I'm going to make one of them read and one of them blues so if you want to figure out how to make your

104
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,920
trails red and blue you can you can do other sorts of variance if you want.

105
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,620
We've got just a white trail on our arrows at the moment.

106
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,370
I'm gonna make one red and one blue and then to create a second bow scripted I'll object and to give

107
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,220
the enemy Archer one of the bows and the play the other bow obviously one bow is going to have one of

108
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,960
your projectiles associated with it.

109
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,840
The other bow is gonna have the other one and then finally to tune the enemy archers shooting behavior.

110
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,590
So he's a little bit cleverer about how he behaves when he's got his bow and arrow and shooting and

111
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,820
so there is your challenge.

112
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,430
Take that on.

113
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,470
See you back here when you are done.

114
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,670
First step is I'll find my projectiles.

115
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,280
We've got our arrow project dong and a right click Create prefab variant.

116
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,650
I will call this arrow projectile red and then same thing again on Arrow projectile right click.

117
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,600
Create prefab variant and I will call this arrow projectile blue.

118
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,490
Let's double click on one of these I'll start with blue.

119
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,740
What do I mean by blue.

120
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,640
Well we'll find our trail and you can see here color.

121
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm gonna have my color go from the first point so I double click on the little what's he said.

122
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,090
Dude Dad I think that's technically a dude down the bottom there and we'll make it bluish in color and

123
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,760
just move it a little bit long so it stays blue blue blue blue and then fades away into white I think

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,750
is going to look neat.

125
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,850
And speaking of fade the top one I'll double click on this single click on that sorry and make a little

126
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,430
bit more transparent so it's going from a solid to more of a see through trial and down the back of

127
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,100
the arrow.

128
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,830
Okay that looks pretty good.

129
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,530
Now I'll go over and do similar on the red arrow double click on that into the trail.

130
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,090
Okay change the first part.

131
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,260
Click on that double click on that.

132
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:56,780
Make it more of a red color and then move it along a little bit and then give a little bit of transparency

133
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,900
up at the top.

134
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,760
Okay cool.

135
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,850
So now we have a red projectile and a blue projectile.

136
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,580
They're exactly the same except for their color trail.

137
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,620
Now over into weapons we've got Bo.

138
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:16,770
I'm going to rename this first scripted object to Bo with blue projectile projectile Bo blue projectile

139
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,600
and then I'm going to control D to duplicate.

140
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,300
And Bo red projectile.

141
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay.

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:32,060
And then on the blue projectile clicking on that we can go and find where our projectiles dragging blue

143
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:39,450
projectile and then on our both red projectile.

144
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,110
We will drag in our red arrow.

145
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,580
There we go.

146
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,560
Now we need to go back to our player and the players default weapon is blue projectile so bow with blue

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,040
projectile.

148
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,590
Cool.

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,450
That's the one that we'd renamed jump over to our Archer.

150
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,700
Where are you Archer.

151
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,700
Boo right TV show Archer.

152
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,790
Have you watched that show.

153
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,630
One of my favorites characters enemies Archer double click on Archer to get into the prefab.

154
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,740
We don't want the blue.

155
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,000
We want to change that to be the red bow red projectile.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
Awesome.

157
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,100
Okay now let's see what happens here when we run up to the enemy.

158
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,280
He shoots at us bound that's a red projectile we should hit him but it's a blue projectile.

159
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,350
Yes the battle of good and evil evil.

160
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,840
A song of ice and fire if you will.

161
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,100
Fantastic.

162
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,480
Okay.

163
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,930
And then the other thing we're going to do is make out after a little bit clever with how he behaves.

164
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,110
Let's have a look in the arch a prefab one thing we want to do where are we looking here at the A.I.

165
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,290
control Chase distance.

166
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,780
I'm gonna put that really high and put it's a 25.

167
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,490
Now it's probably a bit too much 20 which says Chase distance if you had a weapon he'd run towards us

168
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,840
get to the point where his weapon range says you can now attack and then he would attack.

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,140
If we put a massive Chase distance and we also have the same weapon distance the same then he's not

170
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,810
going to actually run it'll just be he starts shooting because the moment he starts his chase I says

171
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,390
Yes chase that will be yes.

172
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,920
Not shooting.

173
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,840
So he's now 20 which is cool we need to go and find the bow that he's wielding so bow with the red projectile

174
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,070
and change the weapon range there to 20.

175
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,570
Okay.

176
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,020
Why didn't I call it enemy bow and play a bow.

177
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,990
Well we might want to give the player the red bow at some point.

178
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:31,470
So I wanted to keep it specific to the weapon as opposed to specific to the use because the use itself

179
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,810
might change whereas the color is not going to change or the structure of the weapon itself.

180
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,100
Okay.

181
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,540
So now is shooting and is run all the way back here.

182
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,370
Oh boy.

183
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,200
Yeah.

184
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,020
Can I shoot at him.

185
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Who's got the big Ranger because the enemy has a slightly bigger range.

186
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,760
That way we can't just sit there and pick him off.

187
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,370
But now we can have this epic battle.

188
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,690
The trials look a little bit hokey a little bit overdone but I like that I can see them on the screen

189
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,090
now.

190
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,000
I might consider making the trail a little bit shorter.

191
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Let's just do that now so I can show you that when we change the trail the the arrow projectile that's

192
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,850
gonna change both of our prefab variants.

193
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,320
So the trail just gonna pop this down to point 1 5.

194
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,740
I think they're just us not quite so massive on the screen.

195
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Now when I go to shoot at the enemy we both should have a slightly shorter trail.

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,350
Yeah looks pretty consistent.

197
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,310
I think.

198
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,790
Shoot that guy over there OK.

199
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,240
Excellent.

200
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,580
So I think that's cool.

201
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,590
I like it and the homing missile it's a little bit we'd have a homing missile missile.

202
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,250
I really personally love it.

203
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:41,490
To be honest but you could add a little bit of logic so that you can dodge the arrows but you know I

204
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,550
like the idea of not being out of dodge the arrows.

205
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,670
I think that is a better way for our gameplay point of view.

206
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,300
We might need to speed them up a little bit so it doesn't look quite so homing missile ish but it's

207
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,910
as designed at the moment so awesome.

208
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,390
Great work.

209
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,470
Hope you enjoyed this video.

210
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,020
If you came up with some nifty arrows that you'd like to share with us please do share in the community

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,090
and I'll see you upcoming video.
