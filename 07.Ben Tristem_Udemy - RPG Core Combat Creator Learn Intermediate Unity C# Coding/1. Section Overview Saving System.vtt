Hello and welcome to the saving section in this section.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.150
We are going to be looking at how we take the state of that game and serialize it into a binary file

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.630
so that when we open the game later on we can these serialize it back into a game and put all our player

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.230
positions back to normal the health remembered kill off the characters we've already killed and so on

5
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.550
so forth so that when we move between levels also we are going to have a solid experience of having

6
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.020
changed the world.

7
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.350
So let's have a look at how it looks in the prototype.

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.830
So if I go ahead and hit play I haven't got a save at the moment but as soon as I start I will have

9
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.690
created a save or soon after I start I will create a save system save file.

10
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.530
Now what I want to show you is that if I go and beat up a character over here so beat up this guy and

11
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.040
kill him then he is doing damage to me as well as me having killed him off.

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.600
So the player over here has got some health taken off him the number of health points that are left

13
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.410
available to the player is that look health he's got a hundred and seventy health.

14
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190
So I'm just going to leave the level now

15
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.790
and then return back into the level.

16
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.860
So this has done a scene load.

17
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.680
So basically everything was lost and had to be regenerated.

18
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.290
You can see that the character I killed he's still dead.

19
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.010
And if I look at my character he has got still 170 health points.

20
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.340
Now also the position of everybody is remembered.

21
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.910
So this guard is going to chase me now all the way to the portal and if I go through he is going to

22
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.770
still be there when I get back and things won't change I wouldn't really have escaped him for long.

23
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.360
So I come back and here he is still beating me up and I can beat him up to a pulp until he's dead.

24
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.550
And when I came back through he would still be dead.

25
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.060
That's the whole point of this section and it's going to teach us a lot of interesting stuff about binary

26
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.350
and how C sharp is actually storing a lot of our data.

27
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.950
So let's dive in and see how it's done.
