00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.050
In this video we're going to start the process of giving giving the player a bow and arrow and having

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.410
him wield it in his left hand because our animation plays from the left hand.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.630
So let's jump in and make ourselves a left handed.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.380
Let's start by bringing in an asset pack.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.230
I've given you some weapons against this lecture game to have TV weapons just download that and unzip

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.040
it and then drag in the asset pack into assets that will give us our usual dialogue and if I have restructured

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.230
everything nicely which I tried to do just a moment ago yet we'll have our game def TV assets.

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.840
For now we're focusing on the simple bow and we need to have the bow so that we can start our journey

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.300
of making projectiles which is going to be awesome.

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.800
Now let's have a look at the animations and I'll show you why we need to have left handed left handed

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.970
animations in our game.

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.580
So where are we the animations by explosive.

13
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.900
And then we have our two handed bow and then drill down into that find the one that looks like the animation.

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.410
If you don't see the preview it might be hidden.

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.180
I'm going to change the avatar to the unity model just Central a little bit here and then when I click

16
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.230
on play it slow down.

17
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.080
By the way you can see these holding it in his left hand and shooting with his right hand which is normal

18
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.260
for right handed to do if you're shooting a bone arrow.

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.100
So let's give ourselves some functionality.

20
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.820
We had to do that.

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.190
I'm going to jump over into my scripts into the fighter script.

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.270
Let's see combat.

23
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.440
And then fighter and I think weapon as well will be the two of you using yet again.

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.490
So now find a script where we've got our hand transform.

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.760
Let's give ourselves a concept of two different hand transforms here a left and a right where all the

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.830
places we're using hand transforming.

27
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.680
Here you can see we've just got it in here where weare equipping the weapon.

28
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.050
OK.

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.860
So it's just in the one spot we're using it.

30
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:55.110
So I'm going to rename this EF 2 and call this right hand transform okay.

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.540
So that will have changed my other sitting down below.

32
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.550
And I will you know I'll copy this and we'll make ourselves a left hand transform.

33
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.160
So very clear we can say where is the right and where is the left left hand transform.

34
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.430
Now let's scroll down where we do have our right hand France from down here and see what's going on.

35
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.280
So over and our weapon class we're going to want to spawn and we'll have to pass in the right and the

36
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.580
left.

37
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.310
So let's just give that functionality here and then we'll go over into the spawn method and and create

38
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.200
the place for us to put our arguments.

39
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.210
But for now we'll pass in the right hand transform come a left hand transform and we'll get all sorts

40
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.270
of errors here most probably Yep save that up jump over into our weapon script where we have spawn we're

41
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:49.200
looking for the hand transform all changes to right hand transform right hand transform come on trance

42
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.580
form and then out lift and transform.

43
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.270
There we go.

44
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.890
Actually that's getting a little bit massive slice to say right hand and left hand in here because we've

45
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.500
already defined it as a transform.

46
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.550
So I think we'll know what we mean when we say right hand and left hand with a weapon as well let's

47
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.230
give ourselves the ability to say whether the weapon is a right hand or left hand.

48
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.260
How do you think we would do this.

49
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.090
What sort of variable would we need to define whether it's right hand or left hand.

50
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.390
We're gonna need a ball.

51
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.810
So we will serialize field.

52
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.550
This will be out of type ball and we'll call this we'll say right handed because I think mostly to be

53
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.860
defaulted to right hand to say is right handed usually with a ball we try to say is so is it this and

54
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.110
then we can have a yay or nay and we'll define this as true or initialize this is true.

55
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.610
Now we've got our red squiggly line in here.

56
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.020
Can you figure out why that is.

57
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.660
We were looking for just one hand transform.

58
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.050
Now we're looking for two.

59
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.650
We've got this notion of Is it right.

60
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.370
Yes or no.

61
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.420
True or false.

62
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.610
How do you think we can change our instantiate to use the right hand if we should be using it or the

63
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.220
left hand if we should be using it.

64
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.820
I'm going to start off by defining a variable of type transform that I call hand trance form and then

65
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.440
I'll have a little if statement in here if is right handed then what do we want to do.

66
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.310
I scrunch up my syntax here not putting the curly braces although I know it's often good habit to do

67
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:19.590
that in case we have a second line then hand transform transform equals right hand that we've passed

68
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:30.970
in now else we will have hand transform equals what left hand you guessed it and there's even tighter

69
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.860
ways we could write this but for now I think that's really clear we can see exactly what's going on

70
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.720
some hand transform if we have our right handed bullies true then use the right hand.

71
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.710
Otherwise use the left hand right.

72
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.140
I think that's pretty clear.

73
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.070
Save that on.

74
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.790
Let's jump back over into unity now and just have a look at our fighter so jumping to core on player

75
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.720
so the right hand and we have a left hand and what we've probably broken our enemies as well so let's

76
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.460
just go and find the right hand on the player so I'm going to jump inside the play a prefab and scroll

77
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.010
down open up the right hand and while I'm here I'm going to open up the left hand left hand's connected

78
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.580
to the transform.

79
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.940
OK.

80
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.560
There we go.

81
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.440
The right hand the left side is back up to play I find the fight to drag on in left hand the left hand

82
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.420
transform and obviously we put the right hand in the right hand transform Okay jump back out of player

83
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.660
I'm also gonna go find my enemy let's form one of our enemies where are you enemies there's an enemy

84
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.020
in there somebody the enemy prefab doing the same thing here.

85
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:45.120
Finding the right hand cool and dragging over into the right hand transform and then find the left hand

86
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.200
where you left hand and drag the left hand into the left hand transform.

87
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.000
Okay now so do a little bit of a test to see this has worked I'm going to find one of my weapons here

88
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.220
I'll find the.

89
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.910
But a bit of where are we down here weapons sword the sword on our scriptural object I'm going to turn

90
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.460
off is right handed and then our sources on the ground as a pick up so let's see what happens when we

91
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:16.010
run over and pick up this sword that and it's in the left hand and it's all arranged in a bit of a wonky

92
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.170
way so the way we've structured our code is saying each weapon is only going to be right hand or left

93
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.250
hand we're not going to say some characters are right handed and some are left handed it's gonna be

94
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.270
based upon the weapon.

95
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.610
So really this left handed functionality is for the bow and arrow and we're not going to have different

96
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.250
setup for right and left handed swords at this point in time I'm going to click right handed back on

97
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.750
excellent.

98
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.170
So now we need to make ourselves a bow so we can put it in the left hand and have the player run around

99
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.930
look look sensible and this is going to be your challenge to create a bow we've created weapons a couple

100
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.590
of times now so create the bow game object create the bow script the ball object create the bow animator

101
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.420
override and get the position incorrect for the left hand with the bow so there's you challenged take

102
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.410
that on see you back here in the moment okay.

103
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.530
Weapons right click Create folder.

104
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.970
Call this a bow and within our bow and a right click.

105
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.440
Create a weapons make new weapon.

106
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.860
This will be a bow script bow object within here what's the animator override that will be something

107
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.500
we haven't created gets right click Create and a meta override controller.

108
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.140
This will be called bow override.

109
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.930
I keep forgetting what I call this what I call this in sword.

110
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.660
Sword override controller Okay.

111
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:39.400
Bow I'm going to call it Bow animator over ride because animator is the keyword here that's gonna have

112
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.320
me remember what's going on I'm also going to change my sword to sword.

113
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.660
Animator override.

114
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.080
There we go.

115
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.950
So a bit of consistency back to Bo Bo animator over idea.

116
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.780
That feels good.

117
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.050
When I click on that what's the animated controller.

118
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.650
Well it's gonna be our character.

119
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.740
And then in terms of the bottom animation here the unarmed attack instead of that's gonna be the two

120
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.420
headed bow attack.

121
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.360
Delightful.

122
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.190
There we go.

123
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.210
So now we have our bow.

124
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.460
We can successfully select our bow animator override the prefab.

125
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.690
We haven't made our prefab yet.

126
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.530
We'll get to that in a moment.

127
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.360
Demi John I will make it 10 will play around with this a lot more later on and range that's an important

128
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.480
one make it five for now.

129
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.600
So we've got it further and we switch off our right handed.

130
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.890
Okay.

131
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.290
Now we need to make ourselves a bow game object couple of ways we can do this how shall I do it this

132
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.870
time round you know I will do it similar to the way I did it last time I will go and find the characters

133
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.890
left hand boop boop left hand just there and I'll make a game object so right click Create empty I'll

134
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:48.940
call this Bo go and then the bow I will drag down into my weapons my bow weapons double click on that

135
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:55.800
to open up the prefab looking good so far and then find my simple bow prefab drag the simple bow underneath

136
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.840
the bow.

137
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.910
Pay special attention to the transform looks like it's way off in Never Never Land reset that you see

138
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.840
this is generally in the player's hand we need to make it bigger make it a little bit fatter on the

139
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:13.260
z axis just so we can see it more easily now we go blink looks pretty good click on play so that we

140
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.950
can mess around with the positioning OK it looks not too bad just rotate him this way rotate it that

141
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:26.460
way rotate it this way I think this is gonna be okay story in bouncing around he's got Antony's pants

142
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.980
as we would say in Australia maybe we'll say that every way is at a saying he's got a saying where you're

143
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.730
from aren't in your pants means you kind of bouncing around on the spot that looks fine good enough

144
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:44.040
for now and we can finesse it later on I can let you finish it to your heart's content that looks like

145
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.540
how one would hold it.

146
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.280
Okay so as we did before click on the simple bow and then find the transform right click copy component

147
00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:03.250
click out of play mode come back into our bow prefab simple bow inside our bow and then right click

148
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.120
Place component values and that should be pretty good.

149
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:15.340
Now when we come back into the game we'll go up to the character so play our sorry player find the default

150
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.130
weapon changed the default weapon to the bow Oh and sorry he's also got that boy that I haven't deleted

151
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.920
so we delete the bow that he has in his hand and then over onto our scriptural object to make sure that

152
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.900
we tell him the equip prefab he's going to be the bow bow you know it shouldn't be called Beaujolais

153
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.320
it should be cold equipped bow sorry to everyone who's been yelling at the screen saying We coded equip

154
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.980
sword Rick so let's call it a cooked bow.

155
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.700
Excellent.

156
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:51.750
So now in our of object we can change this to e quips Oh excellent check on our player that we have

157
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:59.310
the bow is a default weapon yes I've switched that on now when we run around Piper we have a bow.

158
00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.780
Excellent.

159
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.300
And make my screen a bit bigger here.

160
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.080
We'll see what happens when we get in a spot we had to shoot the guys.

161
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.820
What animation.

162
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.690
Yeah it plays that animation it looks a little bit wacky we do need to adjust the bow a little bit but

163
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.000
for now it's pretty good.

164
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.140
And to change the script the bow object on the bow.

165
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.900
So the weapon range is 10 just to see how that goes to make sure our weapon range is actually working

166
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.470
as intended.

167
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.090
Click on it dude.

168
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:24.420
Yeah.

169
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.000
There we go.

170
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.270
But Ang bloop okay.

171
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.400
A little bit of gangster sideways bow action happening there.

172
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.720
Okay.

173
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.260
That is it for this lecture.

174
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.430
We'll make ourselves a bow pick up in upcoming video and also will resolve this whole shoot has no receiver

175
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.730
if you see that don't worry about that.

176
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.860
That is something that we will take care of.

177
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.680
Not coming videos right stuff and see you again soon.
