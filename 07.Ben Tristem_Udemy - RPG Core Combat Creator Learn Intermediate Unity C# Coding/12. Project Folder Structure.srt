00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello and welcome in this lecture we are with me Sam.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,270
Rather than Rick and we're gonna be talking about folder structures and the folder structure that we're

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,580
gonna be using throughout this course and why it makes sense for us so at the end we're gonna end up

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,280
with a nice clean folder structure.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,560
You can see the top level of our assets folder structure is pretty neat and not very many folders and

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,240
even the second levels as you can see over here in this left hand side of the page is looking pretty

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
good and sensible.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,980
And I'll also explain why it is laid out this way and what's the reasoning behind it was for us and

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,870
how you might come up with your own folder structures for your own projects.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,930
Ivan so over the course of the past section we have got to this folder structure is kind of evolved

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,750
out and Rick has been heading in this sort of direction.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,600
I just want to take a minute to step back and tidy it up a little bit and talk about some of the decisions

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
that we're making here and why we're going down this route with the folder structure.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,050
So first of all let's have a little chat about why you'd have different folders at the top level by

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,150
the top level I mean here at the root of assets we've got things like asset pack characters game scenes.

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,690
What's a good reason to have a folder up here at this top level.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,100
So one good reason is if it is for a decent different discipline for example our scripts folder has

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,370
a good reason to exist here because it is for programmers.

19
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,660
For example you might have a different folder for models for designers et cetera.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,400
Also different organization usually different disciplines require different organizations within the

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,170
folder structure.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,060
So you start with a different folder at the top level and then within that you can have a different

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,650
layout depending on the different disciplines and needs.

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,660
That's what I mean by different organization of folders and then another good reason is if there's too

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,300
much nesting if you have got to go folder within folder within folder to find an asset that you use

26
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,000
very very regularly it's a good idea to bring some folders out to bring it out to the top level so that

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,790
you can more easily access stuff you don't want to be going drilling down all the time.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,050
It's no good just having one folder at the top level if you have to always click into it for example.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,270
So these are the reasons behind our folder structure I'd like to take a sec to have a look at the particular

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,370
folder choices that we've made.

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,810
The first one that stands out is the script as I've said this is for programmers and the content of

32
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,500
it is code.

33
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,030
So let's have a look at that.

34
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,140
Let's check this is correct.

35
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,480
We've got scripts and inside it we've got code that seems right enough but then I've said the structure

36
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,950
is by namespace or by feature.

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,370
So we'll talk about namespace is later on don't worry about this.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,920
But by now we'll just think about features.

39
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,790
So what kind of features have we got here at the moment we've got a movement feature a movement kind

40
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,580
of feature space and we've got the follow camera which is more to do with.

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,030
Well I do know it's more of a kind of core of an RPG.

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,680
So I'm going to move these into folders already I'm going to create some folders one for movement and

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,220
all the scripts to do with the movement feature will go in there at the moment we've only got one but

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,680
we will have more and a word of warning.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,710
At this stage because if you have this script that we're moving around open in Visual Studio code while

46
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:24,360
you're moving it somewhere else it can lead to you saving in Visual Studio code into the old location

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,090
so make sure you close any scripts and Visual Studio code before you start moving them around.

48
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,410
And then we're going to add a new one for kind of core features of the new folder called core and I'm

49
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,630
going to move the follow camera into that.

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,250
So that's what I meant by that layout.

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,120
We're gonna have scripts program at content and the namespace feature.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,030
So the idea here the reason we're dividing it by features is because we want to minimize the dependency

53
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,950
between different features.

54
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,810
We don't want movement having to depend on lots of other features because it makes it a nightmare for

55
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,520
us to code when we need to go and change how movement works if we have to be thinking about how combat

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,450
works and how all these other things work.

57
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,550
So that's the reason for splitting it down by feature.

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,440
And it's also logical and an easy way to find your scripts.

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,310
Then we have got the game folder which is going to be mainly for the designer.

60
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,730
If you don't have a design if you're the same person it's when you're putting on your designer hat and

61
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,410
deciding to do some design work and the contents of this is gonna be prefabs and scriptural objects

62
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,740
and other unity configurable type things.

63
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,720
Stuff that you create in the Unity Editor basically.

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
So we've got this game folder.

65
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,430
And at the moment it has got prefabs in it's got a follow camera and it's got the player.

66
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,200
And what else have we got.

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,750
We've got these characters folder which at the moment contains the character controller Well I would

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,490
say that is something the designer creates as well particularly the animation flow and things like that.

69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,340
So I'm going to stick that character's folder under the game folder to tidy up a little bit then you'll

70
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,440
notice the player is also a character and what I've said on this line is that the structure should be

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,230
by entity previously with the scripts we're doing it by features and movements et cetera by entity is

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,120
more like saying by the characters by the weapons by the players and so on and so forth.

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,100
So at this level of structure in the game we're gonna have the characters we might have another folder

74
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,080
for weapons like that and then potions cetera and things like that.

75
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:34,950
And also I'm gonna have a kind of core folder because we want to put our follow camera in core and our

76
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,190
player in characters because that's the logical place for it to be.

77
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,470
Now you can organize characters further if you've got lots of assets that are relating to the play you

78
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,060
might put it in a player folder but we're gonna leave that until a little bit later.

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,220
Now the next thing is the scenes folder.

80
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,210
This is where the level designer lives again.

81
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,460
Maybe if it's just you putting on your level designer hat when you're going to do some level design

82
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,370
that's where you can put scenes to terrains NAF measures things relating to a particular scene or used

83
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,220
by just the scenes not used kind of across scenes and things like that and the structure here is pretty

84
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,850
simply going to be by scene.

85
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,270
So we've got our scenes folder and under that we've got a sandbox folder the scene sandbox is not in

86
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,040
the sandbox folder.

87
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,270
I think that's fine again because too much nesting means that when we need to get to the common things

88
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,150
like the sandbox scene it can make it hard to get to.

89
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,030
So I'm leaving the scene which is most access outside but any assets relating to that scene go inside

90
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,540
the sandbox folder and there is one asset that has slipped the net.

91
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:44,350
It's this new terrain asset which is actually should be called something like the sandbox terrain and

92
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,650
we can put that sandbox terrain in the sandbox folder of the scenes folder.

93
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,590
So if we added more scenes in here we would add more folders.

94
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,520
I think that makes quite a lot of sense.

95
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,360
Let me know what you think then the next choice is for the for having a UI folder.

96
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,110
I'm going to create this UI folder even though we don't have any UI to put in it yet.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,040
This is where we're going to put different screens so inside the UI folder you might have a folder for

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:22,990
the pause menu you might have a folder for the what else we might have.

99
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,870
The in venturing and so on and so forth.

100
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,420
That's what I mean by organizing it by the different screens then the asset packs.

101
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,800
This is pretty self-explanatory when you important asset pack our asset packs will automatically go

102
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,750
into the asset pack folder if you bring in your own asset packs I recommend you move them into the asset

103
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,800
pack folder.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,010
The idea here is that we don't touch anything that goes within these asset pack folders.

105
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,080
We don't add anything we don't remove anything we don't change anything because if we do when we want

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,050
to update asset packs it'll be really hard for us and we have accidentally done this with the terrain

107
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,700
textures asset pack.

108
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,510
So you see these four assets here are layers they're layers for our terrain and because they relate

109
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,750
to the scenes I'm gonna take them over to a common folder.

110
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,900
In scenes we might want to use it between scenes for example I'm going to create a folder called shared

111
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,370
in the scenes folder and go back to those terrain textures and pull them over into that shared folder.

112
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,040
So now we've left our asset packs untouched in their original state which means that if you need to

113
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,930
update them because we will provide updates to these packs we'll be providing more textures more animations

114
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:45,020
et cetera then you can go ahead and do that and finally a note about audio and models we're not producing

115
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,060
them as part of the course.

116
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,260
So we're not going to be putting them in these audio and models folders but for example if we go up

117
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:00,790
to the rate of assets you might create a folder for models you might create a folder for audio and if

118
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,690
you create any of your own voice acting you might put stuff in audio.

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,570
If you do any of your own modelling you might put stuff in models and leave the layout of those folders

120
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,670
entirely to you whatever makes sense.

121
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,350
I'm going to delete them though because we don't have anything to put in there and we're likely not

122
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,300
gonna be using them ourselves in this course okay.

123
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,290
So that is the summary of our choices.

124
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,370
Hopefully you're following along maybe you did some reorganizing of your own stuff but now is the time

125
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,680
for you to really think about the organization of your own project.

126
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,530
So I'd like you to take a moment to tidy up your own project look through see if anything is different

127
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,750
from ours maybe if you have another project somewhere sitting around that you think was really messy

128
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,950
you'll go and try and apply some principles to that.

129
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,080
So not even the project we've done so far but a different Unity project you've had.

130
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,140
What structure works for you.

131
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,130
Think about the particular project think about the particular needs of the project.

132
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,410
I strongly recommend you don't touch assets though especially for this course because we will be updating

133
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,390
things like animation packs and it'll just make your life easier and then celebrate being organized

134
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,720
than you maybe you go and share your organization over on the forum what you've chosen.

135
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,890
Give us some feedback about what you think about our folder structure and whether you've chosen to do

136
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,840
anything different and the reasoning behind that.

137
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,200
So I'm just gonna go straight on to the next video here.

138
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,680
So after this video has finished go and do your organization and come back and follow the rest of the

139
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,060
course.
