1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,230
Hello and welcome to the cause.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,770
I'm Rick.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,500
This is Sam.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,070
And from time to time you might see Ben as well.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,270
We are remastering this entire course.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,580
Super excited.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,920
We got a lot of feedback from our students for how it could improve this course in particular too.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,990
Well to get to the point to have less refactoring and to get to the best way to make an RPG.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,660
So unity I've released Unity 2000 eighteen point three now which includes nested prefabs which is a

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,670
really awesome feature that's going to completely change the way we make our RPG.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,900
That's another great reason that we want to remaster is to show you how to use nested prefects to the

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,270
best effect and it'll save us a lot of time in the course process.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,170
And that will mean that we'll be able to include new features that weren't in the previous iteration

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,930
such as saving such as World progression and such as player progression through increasing of experience

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,820
points and increasing stats.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,300
So that's all stuff that wasn't in there before that we can now include as well.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,960
Awesome.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,160
And just a reminder this is an intermediate course which means we're not going to go through the Unity

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,100
interface and show you what a hierarchy means and what the inspectors are all about.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,220
I'm not going to be going through the basics of C sharp in terms of this is what a function is and this

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,170
is what it means to have a return type.

22
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,520
If you have a foundation in unity you do understand some C sharp then dive in.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,540
Have a great time.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,710
If at any point you get a little bit stuck then you might want to go and check out our complete unity

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,050
3D course for a bit of a refresher on a catch up or to get up to speed and then come back into this

26
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,510
course to continue onwards and upwards.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,060
Yep.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,660
And so in this section Rick and I are going to be taking you through the setup you're going to need

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,960
getting all the tools installed that you need if you don't have them already we're just gonna be double

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,840
checking that we're all in the right place ready to get started.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,060
And I'm also gonna be giving you an overview of the architecture of the whole RPG that we're going to

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,860
aim towards so that you know where everything fits into the bigger picture.

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,930
And then in Section 2 Rick's gonna get you started with actually creating the movement of our RPG a

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,140
very cool mechanic.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,450
Cool.

36
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,200
And one last piece of logistics is where moving the existing content the content that is there now in

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,540
the course ever an archive course which you will have access to forever.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,000
And if you've been taking the course in the past all that content is still there.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,430
As we produce the new content will be unpublished in the old content.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,780
So as we create Section 1 we'll turn off the old section one as we create Section 2 we'll turn off the

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,720
old content as things go along at some point you're going to bump into where our new content is being

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,320
created.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,480
And the old content exists and we'll have a couple of videos in there just explaining you've reached

44
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,430
the point you've reached the point of no return which is where our new content is ending.

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,980
Rest assured we're adding new content every day we're pumping it out as quickly as we can so that this

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,890
new amazing content is fully fleshed out as soon as possible so that I think is all for now.

47
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,080
So let's jump in and get started.
