00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,320
We are going to be adding a little health cheats to allow us to more easily play test our game so if

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm running low on health as I currently am from all this volley of arrows I go and eat my pumpkin.

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,180
And you can see it added 20 to my health.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,010
And just like all the other pickups it responds and at the moment it's a bit of a hack.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,370
And we are going to do proper health once we do inventory which will be in a different course.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,650
But here for now this allows us to play test and restore some health to the player as we are playing.

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,990
Let's dive in and see how to create this little hack

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,130
so one feature of the game.

10
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,780
We currently don't have is the ability to heal.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,660
Now this is something that we're going to have more of once we have potions and inventory and stuff

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,750
that we'll do later on in future courses.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,180
But for now I do want to put in a little healing cheat that allows us to get through the level even

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,800
when there is going to take a lot of damage from our plan.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Now the way I'm gonna do this is by changing our weapon pickup to allow us to also gain health when

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,270
picking up a weapon and potentially for it not to have a weapon at all.

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,680
So this will mean that we'll be able to create a healing pickup.

18
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,950
So let's go ahead and create that pickup first of all I'm going to go to the game pick up folder and

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:36,810
create a new variant off of my pickup and I'm going to call it the health pickup and then with this

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,470
health pickup I'm going to open it up and I'm going to find an appropriate mesh so the appropriate mesh

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,520
I want.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,030
Let's have a look.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,380
We go in the center pack and that prefabs.

24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,300
And I think I'm going to use this pumpkin.

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,710
So I just dropped the pumpkin underneath my health prefab scale up a little bit because I think it's

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,790
quite small.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:05,510
And then I can move my spear collider to the center of the pumpkin like so and maybe move it up a little.

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:14,740
Saying OK now I have got myself a prefab that I'm going to go and drop into the world as my health potion.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,830
But we don't have anything that looks like a potion.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,670
OK.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,610
Now what I'm going to do is in this health pickup I'm going to remove the weapon.

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,540
So that's going to say basically I'm not going to be arming a weapon when I pick up this pickup.

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,560
Instead what we want to have is some health that it's going to restore.

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:41,340
So I'm going to find my weapon pick up a script don't say yes and I'm going to add a new serialized

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,400
feel to just before the respawn time and just after the weapon which is gonna be a float which is the

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,940
health to restore.

37
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,840
And by default this will be zero.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,330
So most weapon pickups will not restore health but we can choose to have one that does.

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,120
And the reason I'm doing this rather than creating a new class is that I just don't want to deal with

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,210
having to recreate all of this hide for seconds.

41
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,940
Business especially when it is just both of these things that are a bit of a hack waiting for us to

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,250
have proper drops and inventory.

43
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,960
So I'm not going to go ahead and recreate it.

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,140
We're just going to get around it for the time being.

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,910
Now what I want to do is in app pick up instead of taking fighter as the thing that we want to take

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,610
in we're gonna need something more general because we also want to get to the health component.

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:40,690
So I'm going to take in the game object which is going to be the subject and this subject we can then

48
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,750
do subject dots and get component fighter for it when we want to equip the weapon.

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,500
And that means that in the place we're calling we have to change it.

50
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,600
Currently it's a collider so we can do other dot game object.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,090
It's gonna be the subject of the pickup and when we are handling a recast it can be the calling controller

52
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,430
game object is the subject.

53
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,710
Now what we're going to do is let's see.

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,810
We want to make sure that we only equip the weapon.

55
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,650
If it's not no.

56
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:26,190
So if weapon is not know then we're going to equip it to the fighter then we are going to say if the

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:36,750
health to restore is greater than 0 well then we can do a subject dot gets components health and for

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,520
this we're going to have to include ourselves a new guy has to use the attributes but that's okay because

59
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,470
in the combat system we have use health before we've referred to health.

60
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,350
It's just the other way round that we're not allowed to do.

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,530
And then what we want to do is call a heel method which we don't currently have.

62
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm just gonna do this optimistically as if we did have the heel method.

63
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,050
Again the heel with the health to restore.

64
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,320
Simple as that.

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,030
Now your challenge is to go ahead and create a heel method that most importantly will not let you heel

66
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,420
pass the maximum number of health points.

67
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,710
So pose a video and have a go.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,060
So my first step is going to be to control dots to generate that health method.

69
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,480
And I am going to find where it has gone and done it that's gone and done it up here just above the

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
on enables.

71
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to take it down to just below take damage.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,750
Make it public rather than internal and what we're going to do is essentially exactly the same as our

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,710
take damage families remove this log message from take damage.

74
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,720
We don't need that anymore and we're going to be updating the health points to the health points plus

75
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:05,500
the health to restore plus health to restore and we're no longer going to be taking the maximum of this

76
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,090
and zero because we want to limit it.

77
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,370
So we're going to do the opposite.

78
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,830
We can take the men of this value that we're incrementing to and the max health points because we don't

79
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,260
want to go over the max health points.

80
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,190
So taking the minimum of those two which should keep us below the max health points now that should

81
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,820
do the trick.

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,620
Let's go over in two and a game and see.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,870
So well I would expect is I currently have max health.

84
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,120
I click on the pumpkin and my health doesn't go up I'll go and get beaten up a little bit by this God.

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,950
So he does some damage to me and then I go and collect my pumpkin and.

86
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,180
Well I didn't have any health restore a set up in my health prefabs so let's set that to 20 like so

87
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,330
and try that again if I pick up the pumpkin.

88
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,650
I don't get any health increase because I'm a maximum health.

89
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:08,710
We're going to get beaten up a little bit so my health decreases past 20 lost and I'll pick up the pumpkin

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,980
and you can see it is just shot up by 20 health points so we've got.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,470
And if I stay on the spawning spot you can see I can get keep getting that pumpkin to increase my health.

92
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,550
So that kind of leads to this mechanism where I can play the game by just diving in doing stupid stuff

93
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:36,760
get myself absolutely hammered but then I can go back and just sit on the pumpkin and wait for it to

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,960
spawn and have all of that health come back to me.

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,190
So it turns the game into a bit of a waiting game which probably isn't the mechanism you want.

96
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,720
You probably want to have to go buy health potions and then you've got a secret stash of them and you

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,600
have to keep reloading but that's okay for now.

98
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:59,650
This is just to allow us to play test more easily to come back here give ourselves health have it taken

99
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,720
away by enemies and so on and so forth.

100
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,070
Let's summarize in this lecture we've created our health pickup which is basically just a hack for now.

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,250
In the next lecture I'm going to be handing over to Rick who is going to be doing a little bit of designing

102
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,640
up this level and sprucing it up before we polish off.
