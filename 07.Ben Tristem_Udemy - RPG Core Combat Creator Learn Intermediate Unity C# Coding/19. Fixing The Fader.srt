00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,530
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,540
In this lecture we are going to be fixing a pesky feeder bug in which you can easily get stuck with

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,960
a fader that is completely white.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,340
Now currently I have got that fixed.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,880
So what should happen is if you go through even if while the fader is still Fading Out you go back through

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,440
the portal to another level.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,430
Then you'll see that the fader still works the fade out is happening very slowly because we wanted to

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,430
reproduce the bug.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,770
Let's dive in and see what that bug is what's causing it and how we can fix it.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,290
So before we can fix the shader bug we need to fix another bug which comes about because we haven't

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,390
got an event system in the second scene.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,040
Now if you've already fixed this then you're not gonna be able to reproduce this bug.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,400
But if you don't know what I'm talking about then do follow along.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,150
First of all I'm going to go ahead and delete my save file to make sure that we're all starting from

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,600
the same place and maybe go ahead and do the same thing yourself.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,040
Now if I go and play and go over in to my second sandbox level then we are going to get an error right

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,850
off the bat that is saying that there is a null reference here.

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,550
This interacts with UI call is basically saying this event system not current is null.

19
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,290
There is no event system.

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,830
And the reason for that is that at some point when we added UI in it added an event system into our

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,550
sandbox level but it didn't do it into all of our levels.

22
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,470
So we want this to be in all our levels.

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,480
The easiest way to do that is to add that to the persistent object prefab.

24
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,500
So I'm going to copy the event system and go and find that persistent object prefab and paste it in

25
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,640
as a child of that prefab there.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,190
Make sure that saved and now we can delete it from our sandbox level because if we go ahead and hit

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,650
play it will be added in two events system mega.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,670
You can see we've loaded into our second season with no problems.

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,860
So now I want to show you a problem that we're having with the fader that many of you have noticed and

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm going to show you how we can exacerbate this problem first of all.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:12,290
So if I go to my portable prefab and have a look at the object there we've got some failed times and

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,350
we've got a fade out time and a fade in time and particularly the fade in time is the one I'm interested

33
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,450
in I'm going to extend this to 10 seconds to make this bug really really obvious.

34
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:31,010
And if I go ahead and hit play then what we should see is that when we go across to the other level

35
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,880
and to the sandbox level then it is fading very very slowly over 10 seconds which is what we would expect.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,610
And now this should make the issue really really obvious.

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,630
If we go over back into sandbox too and while that fade is still happening we go back to sandbox one

38
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,380
you will notice that the fade back down doesn't actually finish doesn't occur and we stay get stuck

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,760
with this white screen.

40
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,200
So what is going on here.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,650
Well if I close all of my tabs so we've got a clean slate I'm going to show you that in The Fader we

42
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,990
have a potential issue What happens if while we are fading in we call fade out.

43
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,960
Well both of these code routines will be running at the same time which is problematic because they'll

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,650
both be trying to increase or decrease the alpha and neither of them will ever finish because they're

45
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,310
cancelling out each other.

46
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,890
And one of them may win or may not win but they're trying to work against each other.

47
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,810
And this while condition will never be true because they'll never get to their target values over time

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,350
which is sad and not really what we want.

49
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,880
So what we do want to do actually is to make sure that when one fate is called any previous fade ins

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,660
or fade outs that were in progress get canceled that the last one basically gets cancelled and the latest

51
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,360
call is always what is going to happen.

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:09,050
So we can achieve this by turning this body of fade out in to a car routine that we start here in the

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,380
fade.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,520
So we start the fader car routine in here and we store that car routine and we store the reference to

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,760
the car routine that's running so that in subsequent calls we can make sure that we cancel it before

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,570
starting.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,270
That's the idea here.

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,290
So how is that going to work.

59
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,090
Well we have to pull out something that we can actually start here.

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,810
First of all because if I just comment this out for the time being what we want it to look like at the

61
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:52,390
top level is that first of all we cancel any running code routines then we are going to run the fade

62
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,900
out code routine and that's it.

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,910
That's what it should be doing.

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,970
So the fade out code routine should be doing this bunch of stuff but we know that to start a car routine

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:11,760
we have to call start code routine and pass in something that's a is an I in numerator returns and I

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,890
numerator.

67
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:20,890
So that's what we're going to do as we go to create a new private function that returns in numerator

68
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:30,570
and it is going to be called fade out routine again taking the float time as we have done before and

69
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,470
we'll just take that body that's basically going to be and new fade out routine.

70
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,160
So basically wrapping that functionality into a car routine and keeping track of the car routine here

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,480
locally so we can cancel it.

72
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:52,680
So we need to call to fade out routine with our time and notice that start routine actually return something

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,410
we've rarely done anything with the handled is routine returned here but the return type of start carotene

74
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,220
is something called Car routine.

75
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:08,190
So we can store that we can keep a member variable on Fader called Code routine and this can be the

76
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:18,140
currently active fade like so and we're going to set the currently active fade to start car routine.

77
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,550
It'll start off as being null though however.

78
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,930
So we set the currently active fade like so and that is the first comment done we're starting the car

79
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,740
routine but we need to be able to cancel this car routine as well if it exists.

80
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,100
So this we're going to do as follows we gonna say if the currently active fade is not.

81
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,580
No because we don't want to be doing anything with a no car routine.

82
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,490
If it is not now then we want to stop said car routine in its tracks.

83
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,670
So current act fade we stopping and then we're going to go ahead and replace it with the new car routine

84
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,280
that we're starting that is this fade out routine.

85
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:04,830
And finally because our fade out returns and I in numerator we need to wait for that car routine to

86
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:13,860
finish which is easy because all we have to do is yield return the current active fait so that fixes

87
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,640
the issue and is gonna remove the comment it fixes the issue for fade out.

88
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:25,610
Now your challenge is to go ahead and make it work for fade in in exactly the same way pose a video.

89
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,620
Have a go OK.

90
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,130
Welcome back.

91
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
So we're going to give this a shot.

92
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,720
So the you could just do it by copying and pasting.

93
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,250
But what I want to show you is a way that we can make this a little bit less code repetition.

94
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,620
So I'm just gonna call this fade out routine just fade routine instead and we're going to have a float

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,410
target which is going to be our alpha target.

96
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:58,190
And so in our while loop we're basically saying while the alpha target is not approximately equal to

97
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,470
this the alpha is not approximately equal to the target.

98
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,710
So we've seen approximately equal before it's math f dot approximately like so.

99
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,210
So what we're saying is the alpha needs to be approximately equal to the target.

100
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,510
While it's not in fact approximately equal to the target that is when we are going to stop.

101
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,540
And I also want to do is make it so that we are moving towards our target at all times.

102
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,710
Again there's a math f function to this called move towards.

103
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,320
And what it takes is the current value.

104
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:38,840
So we can take the alpha as current value and then it takes the target value which is in our case the

105
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,660
target here that we've given it and then it takes the max delta.

106
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,080
And that max delta is what we've got here is the delta time divided by time.

107
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,900
So it will stick that in here and then we can just assign it rather than doing a plus equal just assign

108
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,800
it to the alpha.

109
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,900
So now this function will work in both directions if we set a target of zero.

110
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,930
It is going to move towards zero if we set a target of 1 it's going to move towards 1 it it's going

111
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:16,090
to do this at the delta time divided by time so that now can be used as private routine can be used

112
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,480
in both of our fade functions.

113
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,430
So I'm going to have a look and see well okay.

114
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,010
So now this code is pretty much identical.

115
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,900
We need to make sure that we're calling and new fade routine with the target and the time.

116
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:40,270
But we want to actually pull all of this out in to just a simple public function that returns I numerator

117
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:48,730
public I in numerator and it's just going to be fade and it's going to take a again the float target

118
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:58,100
and the time again which is a float like say and that is going to be the body of it.

119
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,240
And we can pass.

120
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,060
Now we have the target to pass into the routine you see.

121
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,550
So this does automatically stop the car routine before going on and that just meant that we didn't have

122
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,340
to duplicate this code lots of times.

123
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,370
And now in our fade out and fade in all we need to do is return not yield return because the result

124
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,820
is going to be an eye numerator of fade.

125
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:26,600
Again with that this time if it's a fade outs we're going to have one and it is long time.

126
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:33,950
So we're targeting one which is maximum alpha so that basically we are completely the fade cameras are

127
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,720
completely visible and then fade in is going to Target Zero.

128
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:47,750
So that should now do the trick with less code repetition and also making sure that our Fader does not

129
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,900
get stuck like it was getting stuck here so let's jump into the ante and give it a go.

130
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,250
If I go across the scene and while it's still fading go try and go back you'll see that it canceled

131
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:05,910
the fade did my fade up and now it's doing the fade down with no problems whatsoever so in review what

132
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,880
we have seen in this video is how we can keep track of car routines that are running so that we can

133
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,940
cancel them if needs be that's helped us fix the fader.

134
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,910
We've also seen how we could merge together our two failed routines and remove some duplicate code by

135
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,320
using the math f move towards function.

136
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,910
Now there is still some issues that can happen if you go between portals quickly and we're going to

137
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,750
deal with that and see what that issue is in the next lecture.

138
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,160
See you then.
