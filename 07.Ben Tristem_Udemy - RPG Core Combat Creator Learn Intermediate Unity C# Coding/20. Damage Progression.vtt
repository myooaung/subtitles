00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.210
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.950
In this lecture we're going to increase the damage as we level up so you will see with this guy I'm

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.900
attacking it takes me about five hits to kill.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.080
Now that levelled me up and if I go and attack another grunt it only takes me four then it takes me

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.430
three hits then two then one and find them a beast that kills them all in one hit.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.930
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

7
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.500
So one of the things that's not fun at the moment in our game is that as we progressed through our levels

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.230
we don't get any tougher.

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.620
We don't beat those enemies quicker than we used to.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.170
And that's something that is very typical of an RPG and something we want to implement.

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
So what we're going to do in this lecture is we're going to make it such that the entirety of your damage

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.680
is based upon what level you currently are in the following lectures we're gonna look at modify a systems

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.030
that mean that if you pick up different weapons that's going to tweak the damage that you do as well

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.130
so that you have two mechanisms to adjust how much damage you do what weapons you have equipped but

15
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.480
also what level you are.

16
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.220
So we're going to start off this journey in fighter where damage is done.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.270
We're going to go and look for the place where damage is done which is in the hit event.

18
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.370
So on hit and what we want to do is instead of getting the current weapon damage this is where we want

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.110
to get the damage from the base stats instead.

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.260
So we're going to do a get components base stats and I think we'll need to include a the correct modules

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.270
so using RPG stats that's okay for fighter to use the stats in fact it probably should.

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.680
Then we'll use our parentheses and then we aren't going to do a get stat from there and we're going

23
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.990
to use a fictional stat that hasn't yet been created.

24
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.710
You're going to create it called damage like so and where's the other location that we need to know

25
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.460
about the damage.

26
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.410
Well actually the projectile needs to know about damage as well because if we have a look into launch

27
00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.200
projectile in our weapons CSI script you can see that the damage is getting set on the projectile instance

28
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.880
here we've got set target gives a weapon damage but it uses the damage of the weapon.

29
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.770
Again we don't want to use damage of the weapon we want to tweak that based on what our stats are.

30
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.440
So we're going to have to pass in the calculated damage here to launch projectile.

31
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.410
So I'm going to add a float here called calculated damage and we're going to use the calculated damage

32
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.340
instead of the weapon damage when setting the projectile instances set target and then in fighter we

33
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.070
need to use that damage too so let's pull this out where we are calculating the damage I'm going to

34
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.370
pull it into a local variable and I'm going to put this local variable just before the if statement

35
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.390
so that we can use damage in both instances or both sides of this if both if we are launching a projectile

36
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.450
or if we are taking damage immediately because it is a handed weapon.

37
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800
Now one other thing I want to do before your challenge is go to the health component make it easier

38
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.630
for us to see that we aren't progressing with damage that is improving for us so they're going to do

39
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.560
this in two ways.

40
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.520
The first one is I'm going to go into take damage and I'm going to add a print statement in here and

41
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.030
I'm gonna get it to print first of all the name of this game object.

42
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.520
So it's gonna be Game Object object Dalton name followed by took damage and then colon and then we are

43
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.710
going to have the actual damage that was taken which is here in there take damage.

44
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.480
So that's the damage that was taken that was just gonna print that out so that we can see whether we

45
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.550
are changing the damage based on having leveled up and another way I want to do this is that at the

46
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.910
moment our health points are shown in terms of percentages and I think that was okay and maybe that's

47
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.260
how you want to show it and maybe that's how you want to show it in a health bar.

48
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.400
But in terms of having it here for us to debug I think could be much more useful if they actually told

49
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.830
us the health points and the max health points.

50
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.850
So I'm going to try and tweak the class to do that now.

51
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.300
If you think you can tweak the class to do Max Health points and health points on the display then do

52
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.320
try and do that you're going to have to use both the health display and the enemy display.

53
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.660
You're gonna have to change both of those.

54
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.400
So pools we didn't have a go if you want to take on that challenge.

55
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:21.350
If not then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go public return float called Let's see you get health points

56
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.780
which should be easy because we're just returning health points like so.

57
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:39.000
And then we're gonna do a public floats get max health points and that is going to return.

58
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.920
What is it going to return.

59
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.790
It's going to return one like get percentage.

60
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.710
It's going to actually just return this from the base stands.

61
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.090
It's just gonna patch it through.

62
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.690
Now you might be wondering why not just get the base stats.

63
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.490
Well you could get the base stats but then our health display needs to know about too many other classes

64
00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.530
and it's more fragile that way because if suddenly we change the way base stats works it's going to

65
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.150
trickle on through to all these things.

66
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.850
So we ideally keep dependency is low and we do things like this which is called forwarding where you

67
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.980
actually have one of the dependencies of the class forward the method on.

68
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.190
I mean it makes sense to ask health what its max health points are.

69
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.950
So why not have a method that then forwards it on.

70
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.480
And if we ever change how Max Health points is calculated we don't have to worry in all the places that

71
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.390
we're using it.

72
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.810
So we're going to use how Max Health points and health points and then go into health display and we're

73
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.590
gonna tweak it.

74
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.320
So instead of having a percentage it's now going to be one number followed by second number by the way

75
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.050
you need to use one in order to have it do the second argument that we're going to fill in here in case

76
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.070
that doesn't make sense.

77
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.500
You'll see in just a second we're going to get health points and then the second argument of the string

78
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:57.020
format is going to be health dots get max health points like so and now what you're seeing is I just

79
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.320
need to get my curly brace correctly there.

80
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.290
So we've got format than these.

81
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:10.310
The first argument is 0 and formatted with 0 decimal points and then the second argument is 1 again

82
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.690
formatted with 0 decimal points that's what it's telling us and it's going to write it with a slash

83
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.720
between it.

84
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.050
Now I want exactly this code over in the enemy health display as well.

85
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:28.400
So in a copy that go over to enemy health display and paste it in there instead of the string format

86
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.380
we were doing.

87
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.030
So now if we go ahead and play it we're not going to be able to go ahead and play because of this line

88
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.770
here.

89
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.410
So I'm just going to comment it out for now and I'm gonna do a float damage just equals five for the

90
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.590
time being and then we're gonna go ahead and play and see whether that's working as you can see I'm

91
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.930
starting from the beginning here pick up some sort of weapon attack this guy and you can see it is showing

92
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.080
the health points in absolute terms not as a percentage so we can see that it's going down by 5 every

93
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.860
single time.

94
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.180
And then you can see what our health has increased to when we have leveled up which I think is much

95
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.280
more informative for us when we're debugging right now so your mission well if you wish to accept it

96
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.500
is to add a damaged stat.

97
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.070
At the moment we have that commented out code make it work by adding to the enum.

98
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.390
Adding to the progression a progression of damage for each level of your character classes and then

99
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.290
test it against your enemies and see how it feels and whether it makes your game just feel more awesome.

100
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.910
Pause the video and have a go.

101
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.460
Welcome back.

102
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.500
Let's see if we can make the game feel more awesome.

103
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.060
That's not something I want to do.

104
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:45.040
I'm gonna comment this code then I'm going to implement over in the stats C.S. in the enum I wants to

105
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.370
implement instead of having experience to level up.

106
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:55.660
I also wants to have a damage in the inner so that's going to add something else it makes our code work

107
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:04.270
over here but also if we go and find our game folder and our core and then our progression asset then

108
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.210
what we should be able to do is duplicate one of these elements.

109
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:13.270
So I think health has got enough levels in it that I'm going to use that as a template and duplicate

110
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.810
that so I get another health element and I'm going to switch that down to damage.

111
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.140
Now this would be way too much for doing damage.

112
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.960
They were going to start off pretty puny at doing about 5 damage then we can work up to I don't know

113
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.990
7.

114
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:38.170
Then we're gonna go up to 10 and then we can start accelerating 10 maybe 15 damage and then 20 damage

115
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.800
right at the end.

116
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.100
So you absolutely trounced these folks so their health is 20 so at the end you get two hits to kill.

117
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.860
Maybe this is a little bit slow.

118
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:52.210
So actually off screen I've gone and changed these numbers so that initially we have five hits to kill

119
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.210
then four hits the kill three two.

120
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.750
And finally one hit to kill an enemy a grunt at level 1.

121
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.430
So that's how I've decided to set my damage you might choose to pace your game slightly differently

122
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.390
and Rick's gonna go over how we can pace our games much better in a dedicated video.

123
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.680
So let's have a look at how this plays now.

124
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.720
So I'm going to pick up why I've got a weapon actually so I'm gonna go and actually use the sword.

125
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.870
Looks like we have an error here because the given key was not present in the dictionary.

126
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.340
That's because I forgot to add damage for ACT guards as well.

127
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.000
So that's why it is giving me that problem.

128
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:32.160
So let's go ahead and add damage for God's so they would go.

129
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.350
I have added damage both for the archer and for the grunt if I go ahead and hit play now.

130
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:47.020
Hopefully it won't keep pausing and if I pick up a sword go and attack this guy there we go.

131
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.990
Then you can see how much damage I'm doing.

132
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.760
I'm just doing a damage and it's going to take me five hits to kill him.

133
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.960
Indeed it has.

134
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.760
And then I level up and we want to see how long it's going to take me I'll kill someone who is not an

135
00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.470
archer class.

136
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.820
This Archer is not actually an art classes of grunt class.

137
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.520
2 3 4 hits to kill and he's dead.

138
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.650
Now let's get this guy see whether he's going to take a few hits one to three hits to kill.

139
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.500
Yeah one two hits to kill Yeah.

140
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.070
Bam.

141
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.540
Ah.

142
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:16.890
Yeah.

143
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.250
I'm knocking them out now because I'm level 5 and they're a puny level 1.

144
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:29.090
That's the kind of feeling we want in an RPG is just that feeling of power increasing in power and leveling

145
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:35.360
up so as I said the problem with this system is that it's entirely based on our level doesn't matter

146
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.710
what weapon we pick up.

147
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.210
So in the next lecture we're going to look at how we can make an extensible modifier system that's not

148
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.980
going to only work for weapons.

149
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.160
It's going to work for any item that you might equip or pick up.

150
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.800
It can give you bonuses to any stat and say your health maybe your damage you could add stats for agility

151
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.880
whatever you like.

152
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.040
He's gonna be able to give you flexible bonuses both percentage wise and additive.

153
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.860
Next March we're going to do the additive ones though.

154
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.730
So see that.
