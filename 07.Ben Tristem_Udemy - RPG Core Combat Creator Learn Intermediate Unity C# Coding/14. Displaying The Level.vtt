00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.970
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.230
Not much to be said about this lecture.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.990
We're going to be adding a level display.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.280
You know the drill it's going to be a challenge.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.280
Let's dive in so just another short lecture on creating a display for the.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.460
Level again this is just gonna be a challenge right off the bat for you folks to create a level display.

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.060
You're going to add it to the heart you're gonna draw from health display and the others such as experienced

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.490
display we've done before and you're gonna add a getter from base stats.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.730
So pause video and half ago okay.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.280
Welcome back.

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.260
So I'm gonna start with the getter in base stats.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.650
Basically we've got actually we've already got get level so we don't even need to create one.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.650
So fantastic.

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.280
I'm going to go in to our experience display.

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.520
I am going to duplicate that class over in unity so Gates's stats folder find experiences play control

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.140
control D to duplicate it then we go to our experience display we want to rename it actually it wants

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
to be the level display instead.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.290
And then what we're going to rename level display as the class we are not gonna be getting the experience

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.800
but mistakes.

20
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.100
Instead we're going to get base stats and I'm going to call it as such base stats we're going to be

21
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.990
getting that from the player still because we're both interested in the players stance and then using

22
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.800
base dance we are going to base stats don't get level and that should basically do us so we're gonna

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.500
get the level s the text.

24
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.690
So finally we've got to out the huddle done this in the reverse order to I put on the slides but oh

25
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.290
well we're going to duplicate these labels we are going to shift and down shift key to keep things aligned

26
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:59.950
then we're going to rename it to the level label and remove that one at the end and then I'm going to

27
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:11.140
rename experience to again level value and again to change the text from XP to level and then we could

28
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.240
put a more reasonable representation of the UI again level five something like that then I'm going to

29
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.590
change out this script screens B instead of experiences playing and or move that components instead

30
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.370
I'm going to add the level display components and let's go ahead to hit play see if that works.

31
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.060
So I'm imagining Yep initially we are level 1 noob we hit this guy our experience points should go up

32
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.360
to 100 we a level 2 noob and we can go and bash some archers so I'm gonna go and bash them arches over

33
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.320
here whack whack whack and I died because I didn't have enough health but you get the idea it should

34
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.670
work.

35
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.230
We've set up a display you've done this before and congratulations you've done it again now in the next

36
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.150
lecture we're going to try and fix that issue where we're going just try and store damage instead of

37
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.540
health so that when you level up you effectively fill up your health bar from the bottom and get more

38
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.980
health see that.
