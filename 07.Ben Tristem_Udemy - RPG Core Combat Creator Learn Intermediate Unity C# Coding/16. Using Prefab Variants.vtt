Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.920
This lectures all about prefab variance so you can see we've got two variants here in the scene.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.950
One is my play that I can move around.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
That's one difference between them but they are both doing the idle animation so that's one similarity

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.940
between them there's more differences and similarities such as I can attack this guy but I cannot attack

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.840
myself if I try and click on myself I cannot attack myself which is cool.

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.110
I also have a different health to this guy.

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.660
So if I click on the player and look in the inspector at my health component I've got 100 health the

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.990
enemy instead has 15 because I just took a punch out of him.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.970
But he had 20 to begin with.

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.920
So differences and similarities being shared through our prefab variance system.

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.930
Let's dive in and see how we can do that so at the time being what we've got is a set of prefabs that

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.120
are currently all the same because we've made no modifications in the enemy or the player.

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.850
Obviously that's not how we want things to go.

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.310
We want the player an enemy to be different.

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.130
And one of the first ways we want them to be different is in their look.

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.740
In fact let's go up to the scene first of all and put our new prefabs in the scene because what we've

18
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.020
currently got here this play prefab is not what it seems if you go and select it it's actually pointing

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.100
to the character.

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.400
So if you have the player selected again go to the prefab and click selecting the inspector up on top

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.990
right.

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
And selects what it's actually pointing to and that is the character.

23
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.990
So this isn't what we want.

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.410
We want the player in here it's for the player prefab in looks identical for now.

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.350
And our enemy should be this enemy prefab and we can go ahead and rotate it around to face us so that

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.860
when we go and punch him up things are happening.

27
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.520
Now I want my enemy to be different to my player so well I might be tempted to do is go into my enemy

28
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.050
prefab open it up by double clicking on it and then I might want to delete this character night soldier

29
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.830
link to this sub prefab nested prefab and you'll see it says cannot restructure prefab instances children

30
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.830
of a prefab instance cannot be deleted or removed and components cannot be reordered so we can't remove

31
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.940
components we can't remove game objects in a child so well we can remove components you can't remove

32
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.940
game objects.

33
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.900
So what we have to do is if we want different prefabs in here which is fine we're just going to have

34
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.560
to remove them from the parent.

35
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.410
So the aim is to delete it from the parent but maintain it on the enemy.

36
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.200
So we might try and copy it from the enemy so we've got it in our copy buffer then go to the parent

37
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.380
and remove the prefab link from the parent so it won't be in the enemy or the player.

38
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.290
So you can check that out in the enemy it's not there and in the player it's not.

39
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.850
So we're going to try and paste that prefab that we have in the copy buffer back in but you'll notice

40
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.850
that this is currently not linked it's not linked to the prefab because copying and pasting it doesn't

41
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.410
preserve that link it would seem.

42
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.870
So instead we can go back to where we got it from in the first place which was our asset pack folder

43
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.880
since the polygon assets and the prefabs and we can pull in the assets that we used which I think was

44
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.320
the character one you can might be using it the other way round which is fine and let's just check that's

45
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.940
within our capsule correctly.

46
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.400
So that seems okay to me.

47
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.850
Or go ahead and look at the game.

48
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.780
Yeah we've got a player but the enemy is invisible so the enemy wants to look different.

49
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.880
So let's go into our enemy prefab which is currently empty and let's drag in the other prefab from our

50
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.720
asset pack to this guy with the helmet.

51
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.140
They both have helmets.

52
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.590
This guy's got more of a round helmets and the other one's got one with a brim.

53
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.890
And now if we go back to our scene you can see that they're both standing there in the scene but they

54
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.590
both share a route which is quite cool.

55
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.480
So now if I go to my game folder two characters again you can see that the character preview has nothing

56
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.210
to show because there's no models in there but the enemy and player are looking different.

57
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.140
So this is fun.

58
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.220
This is cool.

59
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.810
Now what happens when we actually play the game.

60
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.820
Can I go and beat up the enemy No.

61
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.620
In fact what's quite interesting is for a start my camera's not moving that's easy to fix that's just

62
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.040
a follow camera hasn't got a target set up but four seconds if I move then the enemy tries to move there

63
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.840
too.

64
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.650
And that's kind of weird.

65
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.350
So I'm going to leave that as a little challenge for you to figure out if you can stop the enemy from

66
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.260
moving when we're moving and the other thing is is that elbow.

67
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.060
There's a bunch of scripts on enemy old that need to be moved across to our enemy and potentially to

68
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.300
both characters for example health might be some property that you want on both the player and the enemy

69
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.550
combat target might be something that you want on the player or the enemy again.

70
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.300
Have a think about that do you want it on both.

71
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.080
And how about capsule colliders do you need that in order to be able to attack the enemy or attack you

72
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.540
for them to be able to attack you so you can have a think about these components that are on any old

73
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.210
as well they're just a little tip before you do this challenge remember you can always copy a whole

74
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.820
component by going to the cog next to the component and doing copy components and if you then want to

75
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.800
paste that whole component somewhere say I wants to do combat target on play I'm not going to but say

76
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.470
I did then I can hit a cog next to any of these components in here and do paste component as new now

77
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.330
create a new component and paste all of the values that you already had there so you don't lose any

78
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.240
of the configuration you already had.

79
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.500
It's a great way if you need to move things between prefabs and you don't have an option to do so because

80
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.360
they're not linked to the parents and you can't just apply to parent for example.

81
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.720
So that's going to be your challenge to migrate the enemy old and eventually delete it.

82
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.850
So the enemy isn't controlled.

83
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.680
That's one thing that should happen when you click around the enemy shouldn't follow your mouse obviously

84
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.640
investigate all components on enemy old and move them across were either into the character or into

85
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.250
the enemy.

86
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.460
Have a think about that and also you might want to have a look at components are in character and see

87
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.090
whether they all belong there or whether they should be moved across to player and moved basically down

88
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.940
so they shouldn't exist on player that's just a little hint there.

89
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.510
So a video and have a go OK.

90
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.470
Welcome back.

91
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:34.340
So what we're going to do first the moving around that's happening because we have the play controller

92
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.760
script up at the character level being shared between both.

93
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.510
So you might be tempted to remove it at the enemy level but really if we took anything else of character

94
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.770
it would also not be player controlled only the player is player controlled.

95
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:55.040
So I'm going to remove it from the character level of our prefab wing so open up the character go to

96
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.820
the player controller script in the inspector click on the cog copy component first and then I'm going

97
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.750
to remove the component.

98
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.970
Now I'm going to go to the player and I am going to add that on to the player variants of the prefab

99
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.990
by clicking on the cog and pasting the component is new at the top level of that prefab and you can

100
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:24.500
see this shows up as a modification a component that is added on this player prefab variant.

101
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.710
So that should stop it moving around.

102
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:33.220
Now if we click anywhere in the world only our player moves and not the enemy.

103
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.430
That's good.

104
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.960
Now our next pain is that we can actually attack the enemy why is that we just move through the enemy

105
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.290
a few reasons.

106
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.170
That's going to have a look at enemy old and see what it's missing.

107
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.870
So one thing that's missing is a combat target that might be a reason for not being able to get there

108
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.440
get to it.

109
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.140
And the health where does a combat target belong.

110
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.210
I reckon that belongs on the enemy because we can't target the player itself.

111
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.690
So it should belong here on the enemy.

112
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:07.650
I'm just going to go ahead and paste the component as new on when I have the enemy prefab open and that

113
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.060
adds it isn't it as a variation on this particular enemy prefab.

114
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.350
Now it goes to the enemy old again.

115
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.580
What else do we want.

116
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.740
Probably want the health script.

117
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.950
Where should that belong in a copy component.

118
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:25.940
I think it should belong in character because both we and the enemy share the fact that we've got health

119
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:33.110
so paste the component as new and I might change this value so I might change it to 100 as a default

120
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:40.490
but then go into the enemy and click the cog next to the health script and paste the component values.

121
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:46.310
So the enemy has a default health of 20 and you can see that has been overridden again in this variant.

122
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.800
So the enemy will have 20 health but we will have 100 because we stick with a default from character.

123
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.090
What else an enemy old.

124
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.910
Few other things not sure that we need them.

125
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.650
Let's go ahead and hit play and see whether we do okay.

126
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.700
I try and click on the enemy it's still not working.

127
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.340
The reason for this is because I recast isn't hitting the enemy because we need the capsule collider.

128
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:13.970
So if I copy the component the capsule collider component not just the enemy that needs it.

129
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.290
Or is it maybe because at the moment we're only using it for that right cast if we need it for something

130
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:24.270
else we might add it on to the character as well or move it up to the character rather.

131
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:30.110
So I'm gonna paste this capsule component as it comes to collider as new and hopefully now we should

132
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.860
be able to click on this enemy and start punching it.

133
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.850
Perfect.

134
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:41.360
So he's now as you can see he's even playing that same idle animation because fundamentally we have

135
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.490
the same animator right up in character as an animator defined somewhere.

136
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.450
Here it is and it is using the same controller now.

137
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:55.370
Note that if you are using different models and you need a different Avatar then you might need to override

138
00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.500
the avatar in the enemy but you'll still be using the same animator controller.

139
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.180
So all of our animations are automatically share all the fighter logic is shared.

140
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:11.120
We just need at the moment an enemy A.I. to drive the fighter logic but we'll get to that in the next

141
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.290
section.

142
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.420
So great stuff.

143
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:21.010
We now have the enemy and the player all based off of one root prefab and we can delete this old enemy

144
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.970
we don't need him anymore and we've got ourselves to cool looking characters.

145
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:33.540
I will see you in the next lecture where you're going to be bringing in some death animations.

146
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:33.960
Have fun.
