00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,790
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,350
We're going to be working on making sure that our weapon choice is saved between scenes.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,630
So I've got a sword in my hand if I walk through the portal and come out on the other scene you can

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,280
see I still have that sword my hand if I changed weapons in the scene and went back the weapon that

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,570
I have will be remembered.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,070
Let's dive in and see how that's done.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,510
So we want to be able to save our current weapon which is a state variable in the fighter class.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,830
So the way to do this as we know or if we've already seen is to use the I save a ball from the Save

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,440
namespace and that's going to allow us to tell it how to store the state of the current weapon.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,930
But also how to restore the state of the current weapon so if we go ahead and try and include I save

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:56,400
a ball it's going to ask us to include the RPG saving namespace and it's going to ask us to implement

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,390
the interface.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,830
So I'm going to go ahead and get the default implementation of the interface which should be somewhere

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,320
down at the bottom here.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,030
And we've got our capture state and our restore state so capture state.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,320
We just need to return something that tells us what the current weapon currently is.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,750
Now the easiest way I think of doing this at the moment and bear in mind we will do this in a better

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,920
way in part to once we have full equipment.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,960
We need to remember all the different things that are equipped or in your inventory.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,350
But for now what we're going to do is we're simply going to return the name of the current weapon weapon

21
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,810
in our current weapon prefab.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,510
So we're going to do current weapon and Dot name.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,680
Now your current weapon could be no.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,480
But usually that's an error because we should instead of having a null current weapon we should have

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,780
an unarmed current weapon.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,220
So I'm going to go ahead with just assuming that current weapon is never none.

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,230
It might be unarmed but it's still a weapon.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,600
Now that's basic going to say OK.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,390
So I'm going to save the string which is the weapon name in to our capture state.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,280
So the object and then when we load up the game again that's what it's going to give us in this state

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,270
object in restore state.

32
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,490
So we're going to have to implement that.

33
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,090
You're going to have to go ahead and do something with this state object which is actually a string.

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,350
It's just more general because we can't rely on it being a string in general for our interface.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,000
So what we've got here is we've got the state which is the current weapon name and you've got to go

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,980
ahead and restore it.

37
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,750
So that's your to do using this resource load setup up that we've used before.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,370
Go ahead and restore the weapon of your choice OK.

39
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,760
Welcome back.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,560
So no challenge right there because I thought it was easier just to show you.

41
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,460
So we're loading this weapon here.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,720
We're not doing it from the default weapon name.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,210
So we're doing it from the state.

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,900
We're going to use the state as the best to cast that to a string and we're going to store that string

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:03,570
in a string called weapon name and then with the weapon name that's what we're going to load from our

46
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,680
resources load brings us up with the weapon.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,170
And finally we want to try and equip the weapon that we found from our resources.

48
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,590
So that should do the trick.

49
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,650
And I want to also go ahead and just fix up what we've got in start because we do want it to actually

50
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,340
load at default weapon again not this string thing.

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,910
So going to remove the string and going to remove it from the serialized field as well.

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,270
So we're just loading it from a normal resource link.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,430
But I do want to point out that we've got potentially a race condition we're going to see this in a

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,020
second when we go ahead and test test this out.

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,770
So I'm gonna go ahead and play and see whether we can save what we had in our hands.

56
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,440
So I've got my sword here.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm going to go ahead and save now if I go ahead and load the game again what I should have is that

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,620
I should appear back with the sword but it doesn't seem to have happened what happens if I go ahead

59
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,260
and hit L4 to load the game from the safe game that Gary actually has given me the sword.

60
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,160
So what's going on that why when I loaded it didn't give me the sword.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,470
So we actually have a race condition because what's going on here is that the restore state is getting

62
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:22,890
called in start from somewhere inside the saving system but also we've got our start We're equipping

63
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,500
a weapon so we're overwriting the choice of the saving system potentially by equipping this weapon.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,590
So what I want to do is just put a little guard in here that says that if the current weapon is not

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,550
equal to no or sorry is equal to no then we want to equip our default weapon.

66
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,140
Otherwise the saving system's already done its job and we don't need to do anything.

67
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,600
So that's what I'm going to go ahead and do if I go ahead and play at this point.

68
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,520
We should hopefully see that we appear there with our sword has remembered the sword with the equipped

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,360
thing.

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,310
And if I go through into the next world hopefully I should remember the same thing.

71
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,230
Yep and there I am with my sword in the next world.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,960
So we're now successfully saving our weapon from world to world.

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,690
But I want to show you that there's still a kind of funny issue because our pickups we will have better

74
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,390
pickups by the way we'll be able to drop items.

75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,290
But what happens if I can pick up the flower and I pick up the sword.

76
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,900
Well I can't go and pick up the flower again.

77
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,350
I didn't drop the flower.

78
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,150
It's not in my inventory I can't equip it or anything like that.

79
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,420
So what I would like to be able to do is just make these pickups respawn themselves automatically just

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,040
to hide that problem for now.

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,220
Later on we are going to have pickups that we are able to drop that we're able to put into our inventory

82
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,990
and so on and that will fix that problem.

83
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,620
But for now we're gonna have respawn balls which is gonna be the subject of the next lecture and I'll

84
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,040
see you there.
