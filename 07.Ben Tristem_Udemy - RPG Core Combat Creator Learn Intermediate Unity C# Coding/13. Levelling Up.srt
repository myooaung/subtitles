00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,950
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,410
We are going to be leveling up so down here.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,060
I've currently got some debug showing me that I'm a Level 1 noob.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,260
I go and attack this enemy I'm going to gain some experience points 10 experience points and you can

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,800
see here my progression that 10 experience points is the amount required to level up at level 1.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,800
Sure enough down on my debug I have got myself to level two.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,080
We're gonna figure out how to calculate this in a reliable way and then how to use it to look up our

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,140
stats such as health.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,850
Let's dive in and see how so.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,870
At the moment the level at which we look up a stat is fixed but down the line what we actually want

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,070
is for that to vary depending on the experience.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,160
That means we're going to need to calculate our level.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,890
So I'm going to create a new function inside of base stats.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,780
It's going to be a public function that returns an int which is gonna be the level and it's going to

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,210
be called get level and it's just going to calculate the level from the experience points.

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,680
And just to be super clear it's doing this by replacing the starting level.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,840
So starting level isn't going to be used anymore.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,310
We're going to be calculating the level entirely from the number of experience points you've got.

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,830
So one thing we're going to need to do is get hold of our experience points.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,650
So it's going to be a gets components.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,810
It's going to be experience and we are going to need to include a module for that.

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,640
It's in resources at the moment but you might notice that creates a circuit dependency and I kind of

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,470
realized that experience isn't a resource it's really part of stats.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,940
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over to our project and I'm gonna go in to the code to the resources

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,430
and move everything to do with experience from there into the stats folder instead.

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,010
Now I'm going to have to open up experience afresh from its new location and what we've got here.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,090
So now hopefully get experience should be working correctly.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,940
We should be able to do a get points on it.

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,340
Oh yeah.

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,540
One thing we're gonna do obviously is move its namespace.

31
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,440
So it's now going to be in two states rather than in resources.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,240
And now what we should have is experience.

33
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,760
Yep and we can do get points and that is going to be the current XP.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,630
So now save that isn't it.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:32,000
So it's a float current XP and we've got to ask ourselves what are we going to do with this current

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,930
XP.

37
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:41,120
Basically what I would like to do is find a way of saying look at the stance of our player and figure

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,240
out from the stats what his XP should be.

39
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,920
So this is how I propose we do it.

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,560
We introduce a new start kind of thing the experience that is required to level up.

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,900
So at level one you might require 20 experienced total to level up to the next level at level 2 you

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,810
might require 30 experienced total to level up to Level 3 and so on.

43
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,250
So let's just have a look at how we would calculate from this information what level we're currently

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,060
at.

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Let's say we have 10 experience points this one's an easy one.

46
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,470
We are on level 1 initially and we don't have enough experience to level up so we don't go anywhere.

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,180
Second one.

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,530
Basically we got experience 40 Well let's think about this algorithmically how would we do this in the

49
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,120
algorithm we'd say Okay first of all we're going to check the first level and it's got 20 experience

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,850
points we've got more experience points than that.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,370
So we can level up we've got to level 2 30 experience points we've got more than that we can level up

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,680
3 we've got more than that or equal to that so we can level up again.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,330
So this is going to be level 4.

54
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,120
We don't have 50 experience points so it must be level 4.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,860
Basically what we're doing is we're waiting until we find something that has more experience points

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,970
than we have got.

57
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,960
So we're just going through to find something that's got more so in the first case we found that we

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,590
will level one.

59
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,780
Second case we've found that we are Level Four.

60
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,910
What happens if we have got 60 experience points well then we don't find any level that has more than

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,200
us.

62
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,370
Therefore we must be one level above.

63
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,360
So we want level above the maximum which is five.

64
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,380
So we're Level Five.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,370
If we've got 60.

66
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay.

67
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,470
So that's how we're going to be calculating experience points.

68
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,030
So a few things we have to do first of all we have to introduce a new start going to create a stack

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,600
which is going to be the experience not the reward but to level up.

70
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,380
Okay.

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,060
And we're going to add that in to our progression particularly for the character because the character

72
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,980
is going to be the only one that can level up in my game.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,180
So the character is going to duplicate the Health Stat going to right click on Element Zero duplicate

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,740
array change over to experience reward and then let's give some sense sensible rewards and just gonna

75
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:55,740
have a 10 20 30 40 and then I'm going to stop there and delete the last element of that array so that

76
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,800
we can test out basically all of these levels we should be able to go from level 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 and

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,140
then finally we should get to Level 5.

78
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,090
So that's what we're hoping for.

79
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,890
Now there is an issue in here.

80
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,090
Oh yes experience display is in the wrong namespace.

81
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,230
Got to move that one to I think that should be the only issue we're having there.

82
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,060
Yep.

83
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,290
Now obviously get level is not yet finished.

84
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,940
So let's crack on with this one.

85
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,340
So if you think you can do this you can create get level in the algorithm that I described on the slide

86
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,950
then do go ahead and give that a shot.

87
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,250
If on the other hand you would like to see me do it then watch on and we're going to do it.

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:42,690
So the first thing we're going to need actually is to have in stats we're going to need nice stats in

89
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,870
progression.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,930
We need to find a way of knowing how many levels there are for us to look through.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:57,870
So I'm going to create a new public int called get levels and it's going to have to take the stat and

92
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:05,940
the character class and it is going to just return basically and I look up the length of this levels

93
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:13,010
array so against return levels dot length and just to be safe.

94
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,250
We're going to make sure that the look up has been built before we start.

95
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,820
So we've built the look up and then we get the look up character class stat and the length of the levels

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,510
array.

97
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,650
That's what we need.

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,510
And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a for loop.

99
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,280
Basically we've seen this before it's going to flip over all the levels that we have available in our

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,620
experience stat.

101
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,430
So we're going to start at Level 1 again to go up to let's see.

102
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,520
So we're going to do a progression.

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,800
Dot gets that and it is going to what status against need is gonna need a stat dot experience to level

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,750
up and it is going to need the character class which is our current character class.

105
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,370
I'm going to pull this out seeing as it's a little bit large.

106
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm gonna bring this into its own variable control dots introduce local variable the variable I'm going

107
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:16,040
to rename to something useful such as Max level and actually you'll notice I did get stats.

108
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,050
What I want to do is get levels.

109
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,220
So that should return an int is the max level.

110
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,100
And actually that's not the max level that is the penultimate level because the max level is one more

111
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,700
than that once you've achieved those experience points.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,570
So we're gonna call that penultimate level.

113
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,430
And if we're less than or equal to the penultimate level in this for loop why am I starting with a capital

114
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,770
letter.

115
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,410
Let's go with a lowercase letter there.

116
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,740
Penultimate level so we're less than that in the levels or equal to that then we are golden we can actually

117
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,470
look up that stat because remember we've only got like one less.

118
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,430
As I saying here.

119
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,580
So if I got a Level Five here we're only gonna have four in the array.

120
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,840
That's why it's penultimate level.

121
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,500
So basically what we're saying here is that we need to get the experience required to level up within

122
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,800
here.

123
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,430
And if we've got that experience or rather if we don't have that experience that's the level we're at.

124
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:21,870
So what we're going to do is get our current XP and we want to compare that to what is it to the progression

125
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:32,010
don't get a stance and we don't get levels get stat complete the right thing and it's the experience

126
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,130
level up character class and the level that we're currently looking at.

127
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:47,500
So this is going to give us the experience XP to level up and that is going to be a float.

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,100
So you've got an XP to level up then what.

129
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,670
So how are you going to compare that to our current XP was saying that if this XP to level up isn't

130
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:06,440
greater than the current XP then what we want to do is just return the current level like so otherwise

131
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:13,640
what we're going to do is if we've passed through all of the levels up to and including the penultimate

132
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,840
level what we want to do is return the penultimate level plus one which is the ultimate level that's

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,670
what we essentially did here when we said 60 gone through all of these.

134
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,700
None of them are greater.

135
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,510
So we must be one greater than the penultimate level plus one.

136
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,610
So that is how we are going to calculate get level.

137
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,250
Now what I want to do is just put in some debug.

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
So we're going to have an update method in here.

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,550
Put my curly braces on the second line and what I'm going to do is basically put a print statement that

140
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:53,840
prints out get level but big portions because this will work for all the enemies as well.

141
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,610
Once at the moment so I'm just going to put in an if statement or do a game object or tag equals player.

142
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:05,410
So if this is the player we are going to print out our level just a little bit of debug stuff we're

143
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,670
going to delete this by the end of the lecture.

144
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,030
Now let's go in and hit play and see.

145
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
We've got some errors.

146
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,920
Let's have a look.

147
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,980
What is the problem.

148
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:22,370
Looks like I've named my four variable a little bit wrong I wanted it to be level not levels so that's

149
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,340
probably why it is complaining let's go ahead and play now.

150
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,220
Silly me looks like I have forgotten that I've actually put the stat here as experience reward I wanted

151
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,210
experience to level up.

152
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,140
That's why it's not finding the key.

153
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,610
Go ahead and hit play now instead of experienced to level up.

154
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,880
I've done the right thing.

155
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,290
I've got zero experience starting out and I'm at level 1 that's what the log is telling me.

156
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,100
If I go and kill this enemy let's see first of all I should go up to level 2.

157
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,350
Yes I do I get 10 experience points I go to Level 2 Let's go and kill another enemy.

158
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,220
So this Archer over here he is going to be dust.

159
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,470
He's gonna be toast.

160
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,850
I whack him a little bit and I'm level 30 which actually puts me up to level four as you can see here

161
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,970
because four thirty is the level up for Level 3 so we go straight up to Level 4 straight away they're

162
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:18,170
bashed this guy and just want to check my last thing is correct I go up to Level 5 which is one more

163
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,770
than the levels I've got and experience to level up which had a penultimate level.

164
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,960
So my calculations are now working just to recap what has happened.

165
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:34,040
We are getting the penultimate level by querying how many things are in this level array then we are

166
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,330
going over all the levels from one up to the penultimate that's done by doing this for loop and then

167
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:48,440
we are getting the experience to level up for a particular level and we're checking whether we have

168
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,680
got less experience than that.

169
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,270
Basically because if we've got less experience we stop and that's the level that we're currently at.

170
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:02,090
If we are not held back by any of these restrictions then we are going to be one greater than the penultimate

171
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,880
level.

172
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,600
So it's time for your challenge to use the new level that we have calculated.

173
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:14,030
Well I'd like you to do is look up the stats by that calculated level and what if they have got no experience.

174
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,700
What if for the example of enemies there is no experience component.

175
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,400
How can you calculate the level.

176
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,470
Then have a little head scratch and saving come up with something okay.

177
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,980
Welcome back.

178
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,380
So the trick is that when they are enemies we don't calculate the level at all we can just keep using

179
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,780
the starting level.

180
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,150
So what I'm going to do is going to adapt get level to do that.

181
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,240
Basically we're going to say that this get experience I'm going to pull that out as a local variable

182
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,750
and I'm gonna say that if the if this is null.

183
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,400
So if experience equals no then we're just gonna go ahead and return the starting level instead.

184
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,380
And that just exits early from asked get level we don't do any other calculation that is required requires

185
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,260
the experience.

186
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,910
Otherwise we get the current XP and we move on.

187
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,920
So that sorts out that question and finally we just need to replace our starting level in get start

188
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,540
with the current level and hopefully that should help us out.

189
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:18,820
So if I go ahead and hit play now zero XP let's go ahead and bash this guy and you can see my health

190
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,230
is going down quite phenomenally and actually just jumped down a little bit further so our level is

191
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,970
correct it jumped down.

192
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,960
Why did it jump down.

193
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,970
Let's think about this the way we're currently doing health is that we've got these health points right.

194
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,610
So I've got a certain amount of health points based on what I started with.

195
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,780
Maybe it was 50 health points right.

196
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,530
And those were going down as I was being hit.

197
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,470
Then what happened is as I leveled up the maximum possible health I could have jumped up to 100.

198
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,600
So suddenly the percentage has gone down because my health point stayed where they were.

199
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,910
The percentage went down.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,620
That's something we're going to have to change.

201
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,380
We're going to have to track instead.

202
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,770
Maybe the points that we have lost the health points that we've lost as opposed to the health points

203
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,890
that we have still got that way when we go up in health.

204
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,440
We are going to essentially gain health points and kind of heal ourselves a little bit which is how

205
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,810
I want my game to work.

206
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,140
That's something we're going to do in later lectures but in the next lecture we're going to solve the

207
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:22,190
immediate problem which is that we have no display for what level we are actually at.

208
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,890
And that's what we're going to fix next.

209
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,380
See that.
