00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,620
In this lecture we are going to set up some triggers that allow us to switch scenes so when I walk into

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:19,470
this switching area this portal area I end up being taken to Rick's new lovely corridor scene so hopefully

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,880
this is going to be a little bit of revision for you folks on how we load scenes in unison.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,860
Let's dive right on in so as Rick mentioned in the last lecture we want to create a portal between these

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,210
sets of gates.

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,080
How are we going to do that.

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,280
Well the key is going to be triggering some code.

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,730
So we're going to want a trigger very much in the same kind of setup as a cinematic.

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,130
So we're just gonna rush through this quickly.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,260
We're going to go ahead and add an empty I'm going to rename it to portal and on here I am going to

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,410
add some components to add a rigid body because we need that to deal with getting our events to make

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,870
sure the trigger gets events.

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,390
So we're going to use a switch of gravity.

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,910
Add is kinetic so that it doesn't try and move around with physics and notice that we adding in rigid

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,550
body to the triggers here.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,780
You could add the rigid body to the player instead and that might be something to think about doing

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,830
in future.

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,220
For now we're not going to I'm going to add a box collider here as well.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,500
Now notice this is not showing up because it's in some random location a great way to sort that out

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,790
is to make a prefab of our portal.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,040
Now where is a good place for this.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,750
I think it's quite core to have a portal so I'm going to put our portal prefab into the game core folder

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,870
and then I'm going to remove my scene and bring it back into the scene by dragging on to the scene view

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,560
so that it is positioned in a good place now I'm just gonna rotate it and modify the size so that we

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,860
can't help but go through this portal when we walk between these gates which is the idea after all.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,210
So there we go.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,300
That's nice and big and should do the trick.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm going to save the scene and we're going to leave those sized parameters not applied to the prefab

30
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,680
but other stuff we're going to want to apply directly to the prefab so I'm going to open up the prefab

31
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,850
so that we don't forget to apply it basically because that's always a problem.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,150
Oh yes.

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,450
One more thing we're going to want is to add the letter to be ignore recasting on our portal prefab

34
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,190
and then we're going to want to add a script for us to call saying going to create a new folder here

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,870
called Scene management.

36
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,140
And in that I'm going to create a new model behavior called portal C S and I'm just gonna skip over

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,040
the bit where I write out the boilerplate code which you know has to do by now Model Behavior call portal

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,720
in the scene management namespace reflecting exactly how we've set up our scripts.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Now in here I want to do an on trigger on trigger enter in particular is that's where we're going to

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,830
trigger off a loading up of the next scene.

41
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,920
So here I'm just gonna put in a print statement which should tell us whether our portal has been triggered

42
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,450
or not.

43
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:08,890
And I'm going to not forget to add this portal component to our portal prefab go back up to the scene.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,260
Let's hit play see what's going on.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,040
Can we trigger off this portal by walk into it.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,930
It is not showing me Day has triggered.

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,160
So why is that.

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,690
Have a look at the portal check a few things.

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,530
The box collider is not in fact a trigger.

50
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,250
So let's go into the prefab and make it so is now a trigger and let's try it one more time.

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:41,430
I am noting some other errors will get to these in a second okay it did get a portal trigger notification

52
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,560
so that seems to be working as we would like getting a portal trigger each time we step inside that

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
portal.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,030
Cool.

55
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,800
So the next bit is going to be a challenge to you.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,080
But before we do that there is this reference script unknown on this behavior.

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,130
So what's that.

58
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,850
If I go to the intro sequence you may have worked this one out for yourself.

59
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,970
But when I deleted whatever the fake I think it was the fake playbill director I forgot to remove it

60
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,110
from this game object.

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,370
So it's called Broken reference.

62
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,420
We're just going to go ahead and remove this components again.

63
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,300
And that should make that error go away.

64
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,340
Let's just try one more time.

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,710
Yeah.

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,770
No such problems this time.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,690
Now notice that we are also getting triggers when it's not the player going in we know how to deal with

68
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,650
that.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,600
So time for your challenge to load the correct scene.

70
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,170
So fill in on trigger enter and the player should be the only thing that sets it off otherwise we're

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,080
going to be switching scenes all the time and I'll be absolutely no good.

72
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,520
Try and keep your dependencies to a minimum so don't try and include that basically try and include

73
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,560
no name spaces if you can get away with it.

74
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,340
And if you're thinking cool I know how to do that then go off and do that and maybe you can do a little

75
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,680
bit of YouTube a little bit of Google research YouTube research whatever to see how to load scenes if

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,520
you've gone a bit rusty on that if you don't and aren't quite sure wait for the tip and the tip is that

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,990
you want to be using scene manager dot load scene pulls a video and have a go at the challenge okay.

78
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,650
Welcome back.

79
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,030
So as we said we want to check that where the players.

80
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,650
Let's put an if statement in here.

81
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:28,570
I'm going to just check that the other object were colliding with DOT tag is in fact equal to plan.

82
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,550
And if that's the case then we can proceed to try and change the scenes.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,040
That's going to be seen manage.

84
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:41,360
What was it scene manager dot load seen.

85
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,160
Now you might have to include a namespace for this.

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,400
It's going to be a unity engine dot scene management.

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
And that will now work.

88
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,780
And then we've got a few overloads followed seen that we could choose from so we could get the one that

89
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,680
does it based on the scene name as a string.

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,810
We could do it.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,990
That's another string one more string ones but there's ones that have the build index.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,240
Now I'm kind of of a mind to go for the build index ones because we then rename a scene.

93
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,270
We're not going to have issues with having to rename everywhere.

94
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,550
OK.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,260
So I'm gonna add a serialized field that allows us to configure the portal as to which scene it's going

96
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,770
to load.

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:30,030
So it's going to be an int and it is going to be seen to load like so and by default we will start with

98
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,000
a minus one which should throw us some errors if we haven't decided what to do with it.

99
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,620
What we haven't actually configured our portal.

100
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,900
So that should be basically it's almost there.

101
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:49,830
We need to set up the scene indexes so to do that we need to go to I always forget where this is so

102
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,430
it is a file build settings and then we can drag in the scenes from the project view.

103
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,940
So if I go to my scenes folder and grab the first sandbox scene then sandbox too so you'll see that

104
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,700
sandbox one has got the index zero sandbox to go index 1.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,390
That's what we want to know because now when we have our portal selected we've got this scene to load

106
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,930
and we want to make it seen one said we load Rick's a lovely scene so I'm going to go ahead and save

107
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:26,970
that and see if when running into it we're going to trigger it to load a scene bam we have.

108
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:34,260
So to recap we have created a portal game objects way of handling the trigger event and loading a scene

109
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,780
of the back of it using a build index.

110
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,530
The next lecture we're going to work out how to make things a little bit more sophisticated than this.

111
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,430
But first we're going to need to know a little bit more about coatings or do a recap at least.

112
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,190
So I'll see that.
