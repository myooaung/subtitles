1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,120
Let's wrap up this quick design section by finishing off our one point five page DDD to the best of

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,010
our ability.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,500
So I want you to open it up again and we've already completed the top part.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,800
The Game Summary now this is the point where you say what's my game.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,090
Just go with your gut here and write out to the best of your knowledge at this stage.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,470
And I was really early you haven't prototype your game you're not really sure what's going on.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,180
The point of this whole process is write something down and have it change how it evolve have it iterate

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,350
over time you want to get something at the start where it's going to paste in what I've created for

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,190
mine to give you an example of what I'm writing in here so project Dragon.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,940
So at this point I don't even know the name of my game that's totally final I'm going to tell you an

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,290
idea that I've got at the moment is a Diablo style RPG with the absurd humor of Monty Python once make

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,880
this a tiny bit bigger on the screen and the Holy Grail.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,170
So straightaway I'm getting my player experience in there which is all about absurd humor making the

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,010
play laugh.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,760
The game is set.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,870
So next up I'm talking about where it set the location the the time theme if you will the setting.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:09,610
The game is set during the grubby phase of the medieval era when brave sir knights were bold and foolish

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,220
and the unbelievers peasants reeked of cabbage.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,350
I'm just trying to be funny that may or may not be funny but trying as our unlikely elderly hero so

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,900
I'm starting to think about who is my hero.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,420
Now we haven't flesh this out in our GDP.

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,030
I've got a point down here which is our central story theme we're gonna talk more about the protagonist

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,210
and the antagonist are the hero and the baddies and the story theme later on in the course.

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,570
But for now I just want you to know give you a gut feel for who your hero is.

25
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,540
For me I want my hero to be old.

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,840
That's the funny part of my life.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,610
He's his old geriatric guy.

28
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,740
Maybe he's a he's a past hero someone who's a has been.

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,840
Maybe he's just a dirty stinky old peasant guy who's like what am I doing here.

30
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,150
But I think that's going to be funny.

31
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,310
I must battle the Queen's soldiers so I'm having a stab at who is my enemy.

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,450
Maybe it's the Queen.

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,710
I think it's the peasants versus the the Empire kind of thing.

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,940
What we that Star Wars kind of thing the unlikely hero that I'm going from there so maybe the queen

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,540
is the enemy and the queen soldiers and the grotesque monsters by finding sorry I said you must battle

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,040
the Queen's soldiers and grotesque monsters by finding ancient weapons levelling up your character venturing

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,740
to far off lands using special wizard magic.

38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,690
This is me trying to be funny and clever again known as metal map fast travel and seeking answers the

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,320
ultimate riddle.

40
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,540
Who am I and why a dragon such jerk.

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,850
So this is the game summary.

42
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,380
Give this your best shot.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,220
Do a little bit of your player experience a little bit of the setting a little bit of who your hero

44
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,930
is a little bit of who the enemies are and a little bit of kind of what are you doing in the game.

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,800
What are you up to what's your purpose.

46
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,680
So they're the they're the bits that the construction of your summary so give it your best shot now.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,000
Even if you've got no idea just put something in.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,600
And as time goes on will improve it and we'll update so pose a video now and write a game summary okay.

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,810
Welcome back and great work.

50
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,270
We've already put in our core player experience and next up the central story theme.

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,470
I mentioned a moment ago.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,600
We're going to talk a little bit more about story later on why.

53
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,860
Later on and why not now.

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,900
Well when you're making a game like this you've just got to stop making it get into unity.

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,340
Start prototyping things playing around with things get your character moving because that's what all

56
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,540
these ideas will come to you when you're seeing your game come to life.

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,680
If you spend your time thinking about story at this point there's a very good chance you're going to

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,030
get stuck and never make your game.

59
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,020
I've seen that a lot.

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,150
So for now I'm just going to say unlikely hero.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,150
That's the story.

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,150
It's an unlikely hero going on his journey to be the hero.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,190
And you might know it.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,220
You might want to think more about it.

65
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,330
That's cool but just a sentence here on what your story is and we'll talk about it more later on design.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,940
What is going to be the cool thing about your game when you're playing it.

67
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,420
Is it going to be you know really great combat system.

68
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,910
Is it going to be really it's a game about crafting.

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,810
Is it going to be a game where there's tons of of dialogue and stories and choose your own adventure

70
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,650
style branching storylines.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,870
If you're already like oh this is what I would like to have my game be all about from a design point

72
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,360
of view.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,110
Then you can put that in now.

74
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm gonna say putting the player in absurd absurd absurd slash funny slash ridiculous situations.

75
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,680
Okay so it's not about the greatest combat ever it's not about an amazing crafting system.

76
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:36,400
It's just about I'm going to have the player flight fight a flying pig or attack a talking radish.

77
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm not sure what it is yet but that's what the game's going to be about and when I'm designing the

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,880
game that will be the coolness of it.

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,510
And so pause the video now and write down what you think your design pillar might be for your game and

80
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,860
next up we have a remarkable city.

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,860
What this means is.

82
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,290
What about your game is going to have it stand out and have one person turned to their friend and say

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,710
well you have to play this game we have to look at this game.

84
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,720
This is more than just why is my game fun interesting great game to play.

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,270
It's more than just what's the experience.

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,820
It is.

87
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:14,390
If someone watches a 10 second video of your game why are they going to say Wow and again for me it's

88
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,240
the same theme I'm hitting over and over.

89
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,090
Absurd humor.

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,150
So when I show that 10 second video it's gonna be something ridiculous.

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,760
When people talk about it it's going to be something ridiculous.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,130
An example of this is I've been thinking about this for a while.

93
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,950
I think a cool name for my game could be the dirty old ho.

94
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,910
Now you might look at that and say What are you talking about Rick.

95
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:46,580
So h o e the word HIV is a farming implement and it can be dirty and it can be old but in English the

96
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,720
word ho is also kind of a rude naughty word to say someone who has relationships with other people for

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,220
money.

98
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,620
So it's got that double meaning it's a little bit edgy it's a little bit mature but it's absurd.

99
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,520
It's setting the tone for my game so I'm not gonna put that into this document at the moment it's not

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,200
needed but that's the kind of thing that if someone sees the name of my game and it's the dirty old

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,660
hurry they're gonna go What are these idiots on about.

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
This is very juvenile.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
I like it.

104
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,180
So it's not going to appeal to everyone but I'm looking for people who are immature like myself and

105
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,150
Sam and Ben.

106
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,520
So that's what I'm going for.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
So remark ability for you could be.

108
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,560
The graphics are going to be amazing it could be massive worlds it could be a never seen before combat

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,370
system.

110
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,190
It could be your game is played completely in the dark.

111
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,940
It could be that there is no hero.

112
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,420
You like the showing in the previous video flower where you're playing is the wind.

113
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,680
That's very remarkable.

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,580
And again this is gonna be something that won't come to you straight away you're going to discover it

115
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,860
as you prototype your game but just have a guess.

116
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,740
Now what could your game have about it that is so special that makes it remarkable so pose a video and

117
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,300
writing a remarkably okay.

118
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,600
The other thing I like to have personally in a game design document is a little piece of production.

119
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,430
Production is making of the game.

120
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,620
I know this isn't design but what's the anticipated Steam early access launch dates in other words.

121
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,660
Give yourself a little bit of a deadline.

122
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,890
When are you going to get the game done for you.

123
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,910
It might not be early access launch date.

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,340
It might be when am I going to put it on the App Store.

125
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,420
It could be when am I going to have my prototype finished or if my demo to go and show people for investment.

126
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:31,820
So for me I'm going to put in here end of 2019 just I I don't know how long it's going to take to make

127
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
it but I'm giving myself tons of time to say.

128
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,880
That's when we would launch it.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,930
End of 2019.

130
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,130
So again putting something for you that's meaningful that's a date of when I'm actually going to get

131
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,530
this thing done and then the feature development prior is this is a tough one if you don't know what

132
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,990
you're building yet but for me I'm going to paste in what I've got already mapped out here because I've

133
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,440
already put it quite a bit of thought into this because I have to teach it to you guys.

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,500
So for us it's real time combat is number one all the required arpeggios abilities and stats strength

135
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,380
and constitution and experience points.

136
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,790
That's coming in next level building and game progression that needs to be in there branching dialog

137
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,300
system and then inventory loot usable items.

138
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,460
The main point of us doing this again in our one point five page GTD is to say you've got to start somewhere

139
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,310
and you've got to know what is more important than what else.

140
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,470
So if you've got inventory and loot and usable items is your number one thing you like.

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,860
That's what my game is all about.

142
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,240
That is what's gonna be amazing for my game and you know what if I don't get to dialogue that's okay

143
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,170
not a problem.

144
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,520
So if you've got enough of the feeling of what you'd like to have in your game what the priorities are

145
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,900
then you can put something in here.

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,790
If not if you like why I'm just following along with you Rick.

147
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,160
So that's cool.

148
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,380
Just putting exactly what I've got in here or leave it blank.

149
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,830
If you want.

150
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,360
This is not a super important thing for you to do at this point but I want to show you the process I'm

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,040
going through so that in the future you can be making your own games using the process that we would

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,030
use in a professional studio and then reference games.

153
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,880
I showed you a video a little while ago where I talked about Amber as go out and talked about Amber

154
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,800
but Ember is a good one that I like battle hot legacy Diablo Torchlight 2.

155
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,310
These are games that I've been using as reference games in terms of the the flow the style the artwork

156
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,840
the gameplay and it's good to have reference games in here so if an outsider is looking in this document

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,620
and saying you know what I've read all this stuff but I kind of don't get what your game is you can

158
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,440
say well it's kind of a bit like battle hot legacy meets Diablo and Torchlight 2 an ember.

159
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,710
But as I've got at the top here Diablo meets Monty Python so it's all funny.

160
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,700
It's like oh okay I know these games all it's that kind of game.

161
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,070
Sometimes it's really important to allow people to pigeonhole your game a little bit.

162
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,360
So this is what I've got in all of my one page one point five page DDD at the moment.

163
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,460
You can see what's one point five pages because I can never seem to squeeze it into one page.

164
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,530
That's why it's one point five or not one.

165
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,300
So I'd like you to do as your challenges to finish your first draft of the GDP.

166
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,050
If there's gaps in it no problem.

167
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,300
Do your best finish of as much of it as you can.

168
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,360
And then once you've done that please share it with our community share a link or share a screenshot

169
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,520
of your one point five pages pasted in let us know what you've come up with so that we can have a look

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,700
at it.

171
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,170
There's a link against this lecture where you can go and share your one point five page GDP.

172
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,560
So please do share it with us and I'll see you again real soon.
