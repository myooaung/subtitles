00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,940
Hello again my friend and this video we're starting the process of what I think is pretty critical call

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,820
to an RPG is some mac and someone in the face.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,410
So let's jump in and implement an attack animation state.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,710
OK.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,370
First thing for us to do is to grab some animation so I've given you an animation pack that you can

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,830
download animations by explosive.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,420
So just unzip that once you've done that drag that over into your project.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,200
From here we can click on import and that brings in animations by explosive you can see the read me

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,130
with usage rights.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,570
This is another one of those for noncommercial use you can use it as a student however you like but

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,130
please don't try to sell it and to make money out of it if you want to do that you can buy.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,330
Yes it's from this creator.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,840
I just want to show you quickly what they've got some really cool stuff there's a free animation pack

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,190
that they provide RPG character Magnum animation pack free.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,540
I've given you a link against this lecture for that.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,540
And also if you want to have a look at their full animations like the full kit and caboodle then there

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,930
is their full pack RPG character mechanism animation pack lots of really really useful animations in

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,910
there for an RPG.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,510
Now if you're curious I wonder what's in this asset pack.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,200
Then you can have a look at by clicking on the package preview.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
This is in the free pack and then opening it up to see what's going on in the animations you can see

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,020
all these or the two handed animation.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,490
So in other words if the characters running around with the two handed sword or there's the unarmed

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,660
animations as well and you can see that there's a whole variety of stuff in here things that we don't

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,020
need what are we using John Paul or rolling or strafing but there great animations for you to have access

26
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,970
to so just again thanks to these guys for letting us use their animations.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,690
And the one that I've given you is a tiny tiny little subset of the paid for PAC that they've allowed

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,710
us to use.

29
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,530
So what we need to do here is to create ourselves a new animation state to create a trigger by clicking

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,020
on the little plus sign here.

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,490
So make sure you're on the parameters tab and selecting trigger and then to hook up some transitions

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,440
and that is a little summary of the challenge for you.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,900
So ad and attack state in the animated controller create transitions in and out of attack and to create

34
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,800
a trigger called attack and then to test that that trigger works.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,880
So there's a challenge.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,570
Jump in I'll see you back here when you done Okay first thing let's create a state right click bit too

37
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,540
hasty there click on empty.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,090
Change the name so tap on it and then tap up here again.

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,760
And then what should we call this attack.

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,860
A double T AC K attack.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,750
And then we need to select an animation.

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,050
You know what.

43
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,180
Let's preview it first let's see what they're about.

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,050
So how do we do that.

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,150
Well find the animations and I'll look in the unarmed because we don't have a weapon at the moment so

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,930
I'm looking unarmed.

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,800
We will have a weapon soon but that's coming in upcoming elections.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,610
Now look here if I want a preview say this one I open it up find the gray symbol with the the white

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:50,910
arrow.

50
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,640
That's the animation symbol.

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,500
Now over on the right hand side the inspector you can see down the bottom.

52
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,180
It's been hidden for me.

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,910
Drag that up when you click play nothing happens.

54
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,100
But if we drag in our player into the preview window we get our player in there now and I can click

55
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
on play and preview the animation.

56
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,460
And then what.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,340
That looks pretty good.

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,540
It kind of looks like he's punching in the midsection.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
That's a bit of a dirty low blow.

60
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,230
I think that matches our character nicely crotchety old man.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,040
That's going to be doing a groin punch.

62
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,310
OK.

63
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,000
Fantastic.

64
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,330
So we have an animation that I like so click back on the animation state click on our selector and then

65
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,800
unarmed attack L3.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,820
That's the one we want.

67
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,710
Leave all the other intel as it is.

68
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,440
Now we need to make some transitions.

69
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,220
So click on locomotion right click and make transition to attack and then again right click from attack

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,830
make transition back to locomotion.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,350
Now I'm going to click on the Arrow or the line that's coming from locomotion to attack just put my

72
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,810
preview out of the way.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,140
And we need to have some mechanism from getting from locomotion to attack and that mechanism is going

74
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,540
to be a trigger.

75
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,750
So click on the plus over here and we find trigger mean of course attack with a small a and then still

76
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,050
while clicked on our transition line here I click the plus under conditions it's not forward speed.

77
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,930
It is attack.

78
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,800
We're looking for.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
And that will be the trigger because we have this trigger condition.

80
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm going to turn off has exit time.

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,880
We don't need an exit time from locomotion exit time basically means when the animation has finished

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
doing its thing.

83
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,210
But if we're constantly in the Locomotion state until we trigger an attack then this exit time will

84
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,870
never happen.

85
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,470
So going back the other way however we want exit time to be clicked because we say once the attack is

86
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,290
finished then go back to locomotion for now.

87
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,640
That's the way we'll do it.

88
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,980
So let's click on play see if this has worked.

89
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,290
How do we preview it when we don't have any code.

90
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,090
Well we clicked a little button here boink good punch and you click off it again and then click on and

91
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,710
that triggers the punch on and off.

92
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,250
Excellent.

93
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,680
Now I want to show you something very quickly Warren here.

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,560
If you look at the transition going from locomotion to attack you can see under settings that we've

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,110
got a transition duration of point two five.

96
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,610
I'm gonna change that to zero.

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,550
Get out of play mode so it sticks.

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,090
Change it to zero.

99
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:12,240
And now when I click on play and click on my trigger it's going immediately into both into the punch.

100
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,950
So does that look good it kind of snaps in if you wanted to have that snap look about it then that's

101
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,200
all cool.

102
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah I think I'm gonna have this snap.

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,300
I think that looks good.

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,620
Now if we're transitioning out you can see that we've got a under settings we've got a point to 5 transition

105
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,660
if I was to put that to zero and to snap straight from attack back to like locomotion or back to idle

106
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,000
you can see that snap looks a little bit yucky.

107
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,060
So I'm going to leave this as the point to five that it was so that it's a little bit more blending

108
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,490
this is the blend from attack to locomotion is blending between those two animations that it blends

109
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,260
back nicely.

110
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,730
I think that looks pretty solid in the next video we'll hook it up so we can trigger this from our code.

111
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,160
Great work and I'll see you again soon.
