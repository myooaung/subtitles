00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,150
In this course Sam and I will be using Visual Studio code as our editor.
1

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,440
So if you'd like everything that look the same as us then we're gonna go ahead and download that now
2

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,020
and install it. In the past.
3

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,730
If you've been on our other courses you may have seen us using Visual Studio 2017 community or a different
4

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,230
version of Visual Studio.
5

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,270
They'll both work.
6

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,030
You can use any code editor you'd like for this course.
7

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,070
But if you want things to look the same as us then go ahead and grab Visual Studio code now by clicking
8

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,230
on the link that I've given you against this lecture you can find the link or you can just copy what
9

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,390
we've got the top or you can search for Visual Studio code download.
10

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,100
So click on the free download.
11

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,310
That'll take you to a page with a bit more information and also start your download.
12

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,220
Visual Studio code is open source which is great it's very clean it's very easy to use one of the main
13

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,710
reasons we're using it in this course is it looks the same for Mac and P.C. users.
14

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,570
So we wanted to give everyone a consistent experience so once it's downloaded click to install open
15

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,490
that up click Next yes I'll give Microsoft my first born child, whatever its asking.
16

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,830
Now take note of where the installation process wants to put it for me it's putting in my users Rick
17

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,150
app data local programs Microsoft Visual Studio code, Ok i'm just going to copy that so I've got it
18

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,100
for reference in a bit in case I need it.
19

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,750
Jump over.
20

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,710
Next Visual Studio code.
21

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,410
This all looks pretty good and click on install.
22

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Now it's gonna take a moment or two to install.
23

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm going to pause the video now and I'll be back here when mine is installed.
24

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,990
Okay i was actually pretty quick.
25

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,680
Just a 15 second process launch Visual Studio code yes we want to do that because there's a couple of
26

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,170
things I want to show you in terms of our set up that's quite important.
27

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,810
Maximize the window here.
28

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,310
Okay.
29

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:52,760
Just a quick intro you can see we've got our tabs over on the left hand side here and then a panel which
30

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,930
is going to give us some information.
31

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,450
This is where our code will be once we've got some code a little welcome thingamajig in there.
32

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,090
Get rid of that.
33

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,180
So few pop ups I'm just gonna exit out of those for now and what we need to do is add a couple of extensions
34

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,950
or at least make sure they are added.
35

36
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,690
Now I've added this already because it's from a previous installation and what you need to do is make
36

37
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,030
sure sure you've got C sharp for Visual Studio code that should come default if you don't have that
37

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,760
then you can search for it up here.
38

39
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,720
C sharp and that should take you to Microsoft.
39

40
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:30,080
Microsoft's official C sharp extension and then the other thing we need to have is unity code snippets.
40

41
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,500
So again you can search for unity code snippets up at the top so click on the make sure you clicked
41

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,200
on the extensions tab and then search for that.
42

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,760
I'm using the one by Kleber silver and it is unity code.
43

44
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,780
So click on that and then click on install and that will go through the installation process
44

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,820
to install that.
45

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,730
Now you might go and look if you click back on your extensions here.
46

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,830
I'm just gonna remove my search from the search bar.
47

48
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,180
Show me what is installed.
48

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,310
If you don't see it in there after installation you might need a close down and then reopen Visual Studio
49

50
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,010
code and then the unity code snippets should be there.
50

51
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,880
Why do we need that.
51

52
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,600
While So when we type in things like start it auto completes or it knows what on trigger enter means
52

53
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,160
so it understands the unity code and it can help us and give us hints and clues to do with Unity code.
53

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,560
Also while I'm here I'm going out to edit  to file Preferences Settings.
54

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,060
I've got a search bar at the top here.
55

56
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,270
We're gonna look for code lens shows code lands controls whether the editor shows code lines I'm gonna
56

57
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,200
turn that off.
57

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,730
I won't go into a lot of detail about what that is but that gives a little extra clutter within our code
58

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,940
that I'm going to turn off in the future if you want to play around with it you can.
59

60
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,000
But now I'm going to turn that off and the other thing I want to search for his format on paste and
60

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,880
make sure format on paste is turned on so it controls whether the editor automatically format the pasted
61

62
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,350
content.
62

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,670
So just pretty set up a little bit gives it indentation and always good things want.
63

64
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:04,760
So there the two changes to the settings that I've made as well as the two extensions that I've added
64

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,640
into you Visual Studio code.
65

66
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,680
The last thing we need to do is to tell unity that this is our editor of choice so I'm going to go and
66

67
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,180
find my Unity hub and open that up.
67

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,250
That's what we installed in the previous video.
68

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,820
Open up your unity hub.
69

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,330
You can open up just any of the projects that you've got.
70

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,310
Or if you don't have a project already just click on new and from new you can give yourself a name the
71

72
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,830
location and the version I'm using twenty eighteen point three point three.
72

73
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,510
It's going to leave it all pretty default here.
73

74
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,820
Create the project I'm going to get rid of this later on this is just so we can go into unity and give
74

75
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,130
ourselves a setting within our preferences there to make sure that we have visual studio code setup.
75

76
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay so this is going to take its 20 or 30 seconds to load up I'm going to pause the video and I'll
76

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,200
see you back here in a moment.
77

78
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,450
Once my project is loaded okay.
78

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,840
Now if this is the first time first time it's open up might have a couple of things in here tmp imported
79

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,540
has to do with text mesh pro, I'm going to close that window just because I don't need it and jump up to edit
80

81
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,380
preferences within preferences we need to click on external tools and then external script editor.
81

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,890
I'm going to look for visual studio codes not in there so I need to browse for it.
82

83
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:22,120
I remember I copied my installation point before which was users, Rick, Application Data,  local, programs Microsoft
83

84
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,190
Visual Studio code that's open that up yours might be in a different spot if you chose to install it
84

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,240
in a different spot.
85

86
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:37,750
That's where it is for me on P.C. and then just double click on code and now it's changed to visual
86

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,170
studio code as my preferred editor.
87

88
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,620
Excellent close that down.
88

89
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,140
Make myself a C sharp script in here.
89

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,710
So just click on assets right click Create C sharp script call it test and then double click on Test
90

91
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,550
if it's all gone according to plan it should open up visual studio code maximise the screen, you can see we've
91

92
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,120
got a pop up down here I'm gonna ignore these for now this might be something we need to pay attention
92

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,410
to later on but for now it's going to dismiss this message you can see we have tabs up the top all should
93

94
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,100
be looking pretty familiar and if you want to minimize this window on the left here you can drag it
94

95
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,750
around like that and the final point I'll make is that we asked our community would you prefer for us
95

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,780
to work in a dark theme or a light theme and it was pretty much 96 percent of people said please use
96

97
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,030
a dark theme so here it is we're using a dark theme might be a little bit different a little bit unusual
97

98
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,860
if you've been following our other courses we've been using a white theme but I think it should be I
98

99
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,460
think you'll get it.
99

100
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,660
This is an intermediate course I think you'll be out to accommodate the fact that it's a dark background.
100

101
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,800
Okay so that's it.
101

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,350
We've set up visual studio code we've got unity pointing towards it correctly we're all ready to go
102

103
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,730
so in the next video Sam's going to give you a rundown on the architecture that we're going through
103

104
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,530
in this course and in our project.
