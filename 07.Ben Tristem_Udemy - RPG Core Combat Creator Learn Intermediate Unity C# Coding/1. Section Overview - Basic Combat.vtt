00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.340
So just a quickie really to show you what we're aiming towards in this project now because I haven't

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.450
finished the section I can't show you how it's going to look at the end of the section but I can show

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.440
you the beginnings of my prototype which are going to involve clicking to move.

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.610
So we're gonna click up move within range and start attacking with this ridiculous over the top kind

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.990
of left arm hook and we're doing that with a spaced repetition interval and I can cancel it anytime

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.300
by clicking over anywhere else in the world.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.650
So only when I click on a target does it move within range to attack.

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.930
And if any point I click away even when I'm running towards it I will cancel my attack like the chicken

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.330
that I am but there is going to be more to it than this.

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.270
We are going to be doing click to attack against a video in the animations and we are repeating the

11
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.560
animations you saw there it was doing with a bit of delay.

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.870
We gonna be doing all of that.

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.120
We're gonna be dealing with damage dealing and death as well of the capsules that the capsule will probably

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.100
just disappear by the end of this.

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.490
But don't worry we will make this into a system later down the line that works both ways so the capsule

16
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.430
will be an enemy that can attack us back.

17
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.220
That will be the subject of the next section but in this section we're going to get just this whacking

18
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.350
stuff and doing damage to work.
