00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,170
Welcome this lecture we're gonna be fixing another race condition that could happen if you move between

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,470
your portals very quickly and you have a particularly large large fade wait time.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,550
So let's dive in and see what that bug is and how we can fix it.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,320
So there is still a potential race condition in the portal script.

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,770
Now if we go and have a look at it the issue that we had here was essentially that at the same time

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,720
we could have two co routines being called and that wasn't a very good idea.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,810
Now if I open up the portal C.S. script then what we're going to see in that script is there are lots

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,650
of opportunities for two transitions to be going on at the same time.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,350
Let's have a look.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,760
Now basically whenever you're evaluating current scenes for potential race conditions you only have

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,530
to look at the yield return statements because these are the only places where something else could

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,650
be happening because the execution control from this transition function is being handed over back to

13
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,660
unity.

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,930
So in this first yield return the fader fades out.

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,120
Could anything else happen in this time.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,330
Well yes potentially what could be happening here is that while we're fading out and before we saved

17
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,120
or loaded the level our player could move away and go into a different portal instead.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,280
And then that could trigger another transition that's going to be racing with this transition to load

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,860
a different scene.

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,470
Obviously we don't want that sort of thing to happen.

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,960
Let's see.

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,570
Let's evaluate some more of these yield returns.

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,120
So the loading async there's not really much that could be happening while the scene is loadings.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,920
That's probably quite safe.

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,390
This yield return new wait for seconds.

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,880
Well while we're waiting for that time we loaded up the new level we've saved it.

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:02,390
We're now waiting and we could potentially go back into the portal at this stage and that would trigger

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,810
another transition while that portal is still around.

29
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,870
Remember this portal has not yet been destroyed so that could potentially lead us to having some issues

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,480
as well.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,820
That's not something that we want.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,530
So how do we prevent that source stuff and let's see what does this actually happen.

33
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,750
Is this something that I'm just inventing.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:28,390
Well one way that we can exacerbate the issue is if you open up the portal prefab and change it our

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,660
fade out we're going to put back down to about Point five.

36
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,970
But our wait time we can put up to ten seconds.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,480
And because that's going to wait with a completely white screen I'm also going to make a little tweak

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:48,440
to our Fader script where instead of fading out to one alpha we're going to make it slightly transparent

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,300
of point five.

40
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,960
So we can still see what we're doing in here and can make that point five F because it wants a float.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,910
So let's try this out.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,140
If I hit play what I'm expecting to see is the following I try and go through a portal.

43
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,150
And while it's waiting with this alpha I go back through the portal.

44
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,400
Okay.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,670
Nothing's happened there but what if I go back again then I am transported into some weird location.

46
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:25,040
Now I'm hypothesizing that this is because of a portal still being alive that should not have been there

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,740
any more so when it is going to try and find its corresponding destination portal it's actually finding

48
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,650
a portal that should have been destroyed.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,500
And so it is putting us in a weird location so we can delete my safe folks that save files now Borked.

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,830
As a result of that.

51
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,480
But what should the fix for this kind of thing be.

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,650
Well really what should be happening is that while we're going through that portal transition the player

53
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,030
should not have control and shouldn't be able to get themselves in this mess in the first place.

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,820
So my challenge to you is to remove control from the player.

55
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,900
Now let's talk about where that should happen.

56
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,580
We should remove the control straight after we trigger this portal.

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,900
So before any of the yield returns.

58
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,640
So this is the first you'll return this fade out.

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,460
Remember we said while it's fading out we could go into a different portal so we want to remove control

60
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:24,490
here and then remember that once we load a new scene there is going to be a new player in that scene.

61
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,810
We want to remove control from that player straight away as soon as that scene is located.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,650
We want to remove control from that new player.

63
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,950
And finally when do we want to restore that control.

64
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,210
Well we only want to restore that control just before we destroy this portal again.

65
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,230
It's fine if we restore it here because that last yield return is already done so we couldn't be running

66
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,080
any other code in between this restoring control so restore control can happen here.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,910
Now that is because again there is no code can run between these two lines because we haven't got a

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,420
yield return.

69
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,330
So Paul's video and have a go at seeing if you can remove and restore control.

70
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,120
And remember that we have done this before in the cinematic control remove supposed video and have a

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,180
go okay.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,870
Welcome back.

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,460
So the way we're going to do this is actually I'm gonna go and have a look at how we do it in the cinematic

74
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,090
control remover.

75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,170
So I've got it here.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,240
And first of all we're getting the plant by tag.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,960
Yes that sounds like a sensible thing to do.

78
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,250
And we are then getting hold of the player controller component.

79
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,780
So let's do that.

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:46,320
Let's first of all get hold of the player then do a get components where we're getting the player control

81
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,790
oh we don't have access to the play controller yet.

82
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,730
So we're gonna have to add a namespace.

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,990
Is that a sensible thing to do.

84
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,520
Always remember to ask yourself is it sensible to have this scene management depend on the control namespace

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,170
which is what we're gonna have to include.

86
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,880
I think it is.

87
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,690
I think it's quite reasonable I don't think the control namespace depends on scene management so there's

88
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,480
no circular dependencies there.

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,520
We're going to store this player controller and I'm going to store it as a variable called a player

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
controller locally

91
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
like so.

92
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,110
And then this player controller we can remove control from it by doing play controller enabled equals

93
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,890
false.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,950
So there is no control possible at this stage.

95
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,610
Now what we're going to do is we're going to have to remove control again after loading the scene.

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:41,880
Remember that you have to find the player again because it's a new player in a new scene so I'm going

97
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,050
to actually name this new player controller in here just to make things super clear with disabling control

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,600
and then and without a last comment.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,710
This restore control.

100
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,860
We are just going to go to play a controller enabled equals true so that the control is returned to

101
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,880
the player once we have gone through our different fades.

102
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:10,350
So what I would expect to see now is if we go ahead and hit play and then we go through our portal I

103
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,260
expect to see that I can't move until this fade out has completely happened.

104
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,530
Takes 10 seconds and then if I go back through it's not giving me any issues whatsoever.

105
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,250
Okay so now the only thing left to do is restore things to how they were before.

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:32,250
So let's go to our portal and let's just restore this component reset the components to its originals

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,550
or maybe not everything to its original so let's set some sensible times.

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,220
The wait time I think we were saying well let's see what we had as our defaults in the portal C.S. our

109
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:53,560
fade in time is going to be about 2 seconds the wait time is going to be about point five and that should

110
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,930
be okay for the portal.

111
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:01,900
Next we want to make sure that our Fader code is fading out completely so fade to 1 and let's just check

112
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,010
that everything is working as we'd expect.

113
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,720
So come into the world and then we go between portals it fades out and it fades as back in over the

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,460
course of two seconds and until that fade is complete.

115
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,040
We are not able to do anything which I think is better means we can't get ourselves into any problems.

116
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,370
In fact there is one thing that I find slightly annoying about moving between scenes now is that that

117
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,860
fade out time is quite long and does prevent us from moving for a bit too long.

118
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,550
So what I'm gonna want to do instead is instead of yield return and waiting for the fade in.

119
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,030
I want to re enable control immediately and or rather just fade in and relinquish control and let the

120
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,080
CO routine run in the background.

121
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Now in order to do that we need to change the way these co routine functions work.

122
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,700
Instead of returning an AI numerator we want them to return a CO routine directly.

123
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,190
And basically we can still yield return that car routine and other coatings.

124
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,770
Which basically means that we wait for that car routine to finish but it will now just run independently

125
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,010
without having to be yield returned.

126
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,310
It doesn't have to be yield return but if it is it will wait.

127
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,730
That means we need to change the return types of all of these fades so they return a car routine and

128
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,920
then crucially we are changing this yield return to a simple return of the currently active fade car

129
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,220
routine and that is what makes the difference is because now we're not yield returning here.

130
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,000
We don't actually have to yield return the whole function in order to get to this statement.

131
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,980
Now this statement just runs it returns a car routine that has been started in here.

132
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,600
And then if we yield return it great.

133
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,060
If we don't yield return it will go on running.

134
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:56,410
So that means that we can now remove the yield return from our Fader dot fade in and then it will go

135
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,150
subsequently on straight away.

136
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,320
As soon as it is started that currency and it's going to go on and enable control which means it will

137
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,070
be able to get control back immediately.

138
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,070
So let's go ahead and try that.

139
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:13,810
If we move between worlds now it's still fading but we can move around and because of the protection

140
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,970
we put in place on the fade it doesn't matter if we start another fade a while that fade out still happening

141
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,790
it just cancels the fader and does a fade up and fade down just as we would expect.

142
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,510
So I think that's just a little bit neater.

143
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,190
Great stuff.

144
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,280
So in this lecture we have figured out how we can stop these portals racing against each other and how

145
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,820
we need to be careful sometimes when we have yield returns because these are opportunities for other

146
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,560
code to be running so we need to think about what could happen in those yield return pauses and whether

147
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,030
that could conflict with what we are trying to do.
