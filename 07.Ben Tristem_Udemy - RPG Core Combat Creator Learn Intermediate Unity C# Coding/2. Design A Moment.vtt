00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello my friend.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Welcome again.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.630
This is gonna be a bit more of a game design conversation in this video.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.740
We're gonna be talking about moments I'm going to give you more information on what I think a moment

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.230
is.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.920
And I'm going to challenge you to come up with a simple gameplay moment for your prototype as you have

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.820
it at the moment.

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450
So couple of bits and pieces here in the words of Rick.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.990
A good RPG in my opinion consists of a series of different interesting moments which require the player

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.850
to make meaningful choices.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.800
The important point here is that they're different and I'm going to do a little bit of sketching here

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.610
for you.

13
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.510
I'm going to hit windows w I want a piece.

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
People often ask me how do you get your drawing thing Rick it's just sketchpad.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.280
Windows WD to get that.

16
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
So if we have a very simple level layout so we're going from a this is where we first into the level

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
to be and this is a linear level we don't talk a lot more about Level Design later on but this is just

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.620
linear.

19
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.430
You going from A to B and you've got a little bit of a path.

20
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.450
You need to go through a little bit squiggly but the player can't really deviate.

21
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.400
They don't have choices with the path.

22
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.790
They just have to follow it to get from A to B.

23
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.020
Now along the way we're giving the player stuff to do and when we give the player stuff to do.

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.870
Often this is creating a moment something that's going on.

25
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.570
So for example a change back to the blue actually let's leave this on Blue.

26
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.150
So for example at the very start there might be a bridge that the player needs to cross to enter into

27
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.830
the area and then after they cross this bridge they're entering and here after they cross the bridge

28
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.490
maybe they come to a town and the town's got some houses in it and then after the town there's a say

29
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.270
a forest.

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.650
This is me trying to draw some trees here.

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.540
So the forest just pretend they look like trees.

32
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.440
It looks like a house.

33
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.810
What's going on here anyway.

34
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.360
Okay tree.

35
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.720
There we go.

36
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910
That's how we draw a tree.

37
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.000
And then after the trees maybe you get to a lake after the lake pay.

38
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.160
Perhaps there is.

39
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.650
All right.

40
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.210
Now the forest again just because I'm feeling so good about now I know how to draw these triangle tree

41
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.930
things.

42
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.400
And then after that you might come to a big arena area where there's some sort of you know battle that's

43
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.980
happened.

44
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.680
And then at the end you've got a cave and inside the cave is how you exit.

45
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.130
Okay.

46
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.070
So that's that's how level we've created it was a pretty good level.

47
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.460
I like it from a to b.

48
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.810
Now as we go along we're giving the player things to do things that we saw at the start.

49
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.640
There might be just one big ogre at the very start that is kind of like a mini boss battle.

50
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.010
This is all leading up to a point trust me here.

51
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.070
Mini boss battle.

52
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.890
And then after you complete that perhaps you get into town and you have to find a particular NPC and

53
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.570
talk to an NPC have a conversation they give you some information.

54
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.800
Then after that maybe we reach an encounter where we have encounter I I usually use the word encounter

55
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.020
or refer to battle.

56
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.150
So having a battle there encounter.

57
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.520
This is our town with the NPC.

58
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.500
And then after the encounter we get to the lake and it's something different again maybe it's maybe

59
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.390
it's a whole bunch of.

60
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.790
So over here it was gods.

61
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.010
And over here there's a whole bunch of like monsters or something.

62
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.830
So it's different.

63
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.530
And then there's something else and something else and something else.

64
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.700
So the reason I'm going into detail on this is I think each of these is a moment that's a moment with

65
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.530
mini boss.

66
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.490
Then you have the NPC as you need to find and talk to in town and then you have gods you encounter.

67
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.500
That's a moment.

68
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.650
This is a moment you might have another one to three moments.

69
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.540
So I've got seven moments in my level maybe my intention is to have this level last about say 14 minutes

70
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.480
for example the play is going to go from A to B in 14 minutes then each encounter is going to be around

71
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.560
about two minutes as Sara each moment is coming round about two minutes.

72
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.100
So this moment here with the mini boss needs to be different to the NPC which need to be different to

73
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.910
the guards which need to be different in the monsters to make our game interesting.

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.800
I've seen a lot of early designs and people who are trying to figure things out well they have.

75
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.680
Okay here's two people I have to fight and then he is one person I have to fight.

76
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.090
There's another person I have to fight.

77
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.780
And then another person I to fight.

78
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.690
And then another person lives to fight another idea.

79
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.790
I know actually there's three people I have to fight.

80
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.630
It's just the same thing over and over and over again.

81
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.520
It's really boring and very dull.

82
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.480
So the important thing about moments is that they have to be different and they have to be interesting.

83
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.290
And where we are with our game at the moment we're not yet ready to create each of these moments because

84
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.350
we haven't put in all our features but I think we're ready to create one moment and that one moment

85
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.310
is going to give us a lot of information about what we need to build next in our game.

86
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.660
And it's starting to make a game.

87
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.180
This is how we make an RPG This is how we make a lot of games is you make a moment and then when that's

88
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.880
cool you make another moment when that's going to take another moment.

89
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.640
And that's the process and when you string them all together you've got a game that's often the way

90
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.580
that it works.

91
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.810
Okay.

92
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.590
Back to my slide.

93
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.020
So what tools do we have at our disposal we don't have a lot of features yet but we do have simple combat

94
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.650
you can hit and be hit.

95
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.750
We have simple enemy II they can attack.

96
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.880
They can patrol they can linger.

97
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.320
We have simple environment layout out things we can put obstacles.

98
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.650
We can make the line of sight to obscure enemies.

99
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.110
We can create an environment we can.

100
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.960
When you walk into an area we can give a story based upon how we've laid out our assets.

101
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.340
We can add some audio so we haven't gone through this yet but I'll probably do a little bit of voiceover

102
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.560
In this section as part of this cinematic stuff.

103
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.650
But you probably know how to do that already.

104
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.460
You can add a bit of music and add some sound effects.

105
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.810
You could add some visuals some some particle effects maybe grab some assets still assets maybe change

106
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.430
the lighting so already at this point of our project we have a lot of things that we can do even within

107
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.880
combat.

108
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.360
You could create one enemy that is fast and has no hit not many hit points you can create another enemy

109
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.590
which is big and fat and has tons of hit points so you can already do a whole bunch of variation within

110
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.150
your combat.

111
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.590
So all of this conversation is leading up to me giving you a challenge which is to design your moment

112
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.870
and here's the structure for what I recommend you do at this point is create a one sentence overview

113
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.520
of the moment and then second point is just note whereas the moment taking place is it at the warm visit

114
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.260
at the lake.

115
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.310
Is it at the village and then what is the player trying to do.

116
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.360
And finally what is one meaningful choice you can give to the player.

117
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.590
A CHOICE IS WHERE YOU SAY YOU CAN DO A or B or A or B or C or D and the player isn't just given a situation

118
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.700
where they say the only way to win this is just to walk up to that guy and punch him in the face.

119
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.920
That's all you can do.

120
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.910
So at this point with the tools that we've gone what's a meaningful choice that you can give to the

121
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.480
player.

122
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.280
Now I'm going to show you my answers to this so to give you a little bit of a better idea of how to

123
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.300
do this challenge.

124
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.350
So here are my answers.

125
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.200
The one sentence the player reaches a blockade is stopped by the Queen soldiers and mush must bash his

126
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.140
way through into the village.

127
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.180
Whereas this taking place it's on the outskirts of town.

128
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.050
It's that kind of the town gates.

129
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.110
What are you trying to do as the player.

130
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.300
Defeat the guards and stay alive.

131
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.590
And what's the meaningful choice.

132
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.100
Well I think the choice is to either attack the guards all at once or lure an individual away and have

133
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.220
one on one battles and we're just going to pretend the player already knows how to play the game we're

134
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.970
not going to worry about any tutorials or instructions were just saying someone who already knows how

135
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.570
to play the game.

136
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.780
This is a moment that's happening somewhere in the middle of our game.

137
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.340
It's not the very first thing that the player does at the very start of the game.

138
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.850
So there are my answers.

139
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.620
This is a reminder of the challenge.

140
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.720
Go through those points when you've done that.

141
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.540
Please share your design with our community.

142
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.310
Just write it up and throw it over into the forum so that we can see what you've got at the moment and

143
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.690
in the upcoming videos we're going to implement our moment.

144
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.820
So make sure you put a little bit of thought into this.

145
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.620
And when you have I will see you in the next video.
