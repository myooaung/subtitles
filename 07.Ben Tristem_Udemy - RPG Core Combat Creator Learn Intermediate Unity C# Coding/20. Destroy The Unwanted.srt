1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,070
Hello hello.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,210
We're nearly finished this section we've got a little bit of cleaning up that we need to do and I'm

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,310
going to give us another one of our problem solutions style video so let's have a look at the problems

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,610
we've got at the moment mostly to do with destroying things so one when we're shooting and we're instantiating

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,130
our cool particle effect you can see we've got all of our impact effects just junking up our hierarchy

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,770
we need to tidy that up another thing when we kill our target you can see that this fireball Where is

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,870
it it's going and going and going for ever and that's something that we want to address and make sure

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,430
it doesn't do that.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,630
And finally the last thing is we've got a few different components to our fireball and that's cool for

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,590
us to be out to have.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,260
We're gonna create a little bit of functionality so that we just pause this and get into my scene here

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,310
so that we can have different aspects of our fireball be destroyed at different times so you can see

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,280
as we're going along here the head of the fireball and the trial the moment we impact the whole thing

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,830
blinks out of existence.

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,700
We're kind of covering it out with the impact.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,490
So you don't see it so much but you might not have such a big impact.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,130
You might want to have that a little bit more subtle so that we can for example destroy the head of

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,060
the fireball and then let the particle finish off doing what the particle wants to do.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,830
So then the three things we're going to do I've broken this out as challenges so that you can have a

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,470
look at it.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,290
I will be cleaning out the following destroying out impact effect after it's finished stopping the orphaned

22
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,220
of projectiles flying on forever and destroying different parts of the projectile at different times.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,390
If you wanna take on all of those challenges now here's the time if you want to take them on one at

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,280
a time and see how you go only the first one first and you can give that a shot and then I'll show you

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,080
my solution and then if you feel like it you can give the second one a go and so on.

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,510
So first up let's work on destroying our heat impact.

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,540
After it's finished doing it he hit impacts do first of all I'm going to find where is my hit impact

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,020
it's on my effects here we've got the fireball impact and we've got the generic impact effect.

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm going to create a script which will just be a pretty generic destroy after the effect is done scripts

30
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,040
so we'll go into our scripts folder I think this is more in core than it is in combat right click Create

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:25,380
C sharp script and I will call this destroy after effect effector effects will say effect singular I

32
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,610
think and then open that up in Visual Studio code to get rid of the start method we don't need that.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,880
And as always I really need to be reminded what an update does.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,910
I think we know that by now what I do want to do is to say if we don't have a particle system if the

35
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,490
particle system is not alive and this is a method that we can call upon I know as a challenge I didn't

36
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,660
really give you a clue for this.

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,960
It might have been tricky but you want to know the answer already.

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,650
OK enough waffle let's start.

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,400
If we do not have or there is not a get component what sort of component we're looking for we're looking

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,300
for the particle system dot.

41
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,880
And in here we have a mechanism to see the very first option here is is alive that's returning a ball.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,040
So if basically when we look for the particle system it's not alive meaning that the particle system

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,790
itself is no longer alive no longer producing particles then pretty simply we just destroy this game

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:29,410
object save that and we'll go find the game object we're going to attach that to the look effects let's

45
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,130
see just here jump into my fireball impact click on Add component destroy after effect and that should

46
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,790
be added nicely and then over to my generic impact effect open prefab same thing add component destroy

47
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,370
after effect well it's already been added because this one I believe was the prefab variant of the fireball

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,440
impact okay probably could deserve a little bit of a rename to make that clearer the generic impact

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,230
effect is actually a prefab variant all viable impacts so I'll let you play around with that I'm probably

50
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,670
not going to do too much more with this myself in my particular game so I'll leave that to you however

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,130
you want to structure it make sure it makes sense to you which one is the prefab variant of which other

52
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,550
one.

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's see if that's worked we'll jump on over into the game or fire off some fireballs come on over

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,520
shoot was not so close but he shoots and you see we have an impact that is quickly produced then quickly

55
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,410
destroyed so yep success we have successfully tidy that up.

56
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,470
Okay onto our next thing what's next on our challenge stopping often projectiles flying on forever.

57
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,680
This one is a more simple challenge so if you want to give this your best shot how do we make it that

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,760
we just don't have them go on and on and on we want to have a maximum limit on them so let's go over

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,730
to our projectile script I'm gonna make myself a new variable up the top here serialized here I'm going

60
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,420
to put it in the right spot first all serialized field this will be of type float and we'll just call

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:02,470
this Max life time and what is a good maximum lifetime we want to have as our default probably something's

62
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,150
not going to need to stay on the screen for more than 10 seconds so starting off at 10.

63
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,210
So where shall we destroy how projectile.

64
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,540
I think on a set target that's right at the start of our projectile coming into existence we will simply

65
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,050
decide destroy.

66
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,100
What are we destroying.

67
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,910
Again it's game object.

68
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,090
And after how long Max lifetime.

69
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,540
Okay.

70
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,760
We'll save that jump on overseas that's worked again.

71
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,310
Run run run run run and shoot you shoot 1 2 How many is this take about six or seven after we do that

72
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,690
we'll get this one fly off into the nowhere and okay and it's going to take 10 seconds I might speed

73
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,130
up the video here and it is destroyed itself excellent so so far two.

74
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,500
Two down one to go.

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,850
Let's have a look at the third one destroying the different parts of the projectile at different times.

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,690
Okay cool.

77
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,330
So once again let's get over into projectile.

78
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,610
We need to give ourselves a concept or we need to give ourselves the opportunity to say which things

79
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,430
do we want to destroy on immediate impact.

80
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,570
So I'm going to again serialize fuel create a new variable up here and this will be a game object type

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,350
once again but it will be an array so that we can take in more than one we might want to have five things

82
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,790
that get destroyed and others that do not so well cause destroy on collision destroy on hit we'll call

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,500
it we'll start that off.

84
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:35,170
Now initialize that it now and then within our code all the way down the bottom to do so after we've

85
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,360
bumped into something we are destroying the game object we don't want to destroy everything at that

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,690
point so just before this final destroy let us say destroy the things that are within our.

87
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,730
What do we call it destroy on hit array.

88
00:06:49,750 --> 00:07:01,700
So for each game object and we'll call it to destroy game objects we want to destroy in destroy on hit.

89
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
What are we gonna do.

90
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,630
Well just pretty straight forward we destroy all of the.

91
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,700
To destroy semicolon.

92
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,230
Okay that's cool so we've got all these things that we destroy immediately.

93
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,410
But now this is also happening immediately it's destroying everything immediately so we want to have

94
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:24,520
something in here comma a certain amount of time which we'll call live after destroy life after life

95
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,270
after impact.

96
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,010
I think life after impact.

97
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,330
So how long do we want it to live.

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,410
After impact.

99
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,050
Making my variable a bit backwards here.

100
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,120
Copy this all the way up to the top and ourselves and other serialized field.

101
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,560
This will be of type float and called Life after impact and I'll initialize that and more to.

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,810
OK so make sure it's all cleaned up and tidy up.

103
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,000
If you have any projectile stuff going on that you want to linger around like some smoke or something

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,550
linger around for a while you might want to make it.

105
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,470
You may want to make it more than two.

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,010
So now we need to go over to our fireball projectile.

107
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,700
That's the main one I won't worry about doing it with the arrow at the moment because the fireball is

108
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,710
the one I'm interested in and you see our destroyer on hit a ray.

109
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm gonna make it a size one and that will give us one thing the fireball ahead that I'll drag in is

110
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,630
the game object that will be destroyed immediately everything else will be destroyed after two seconds

111
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,640
that we've got the two seconds resting here.

112
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,420
Okay.

113
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,800
Let's see how this one goes.

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
Click on play.

115
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,630
Very excited.

116
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,450
Boo boo boo and click.

117
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,960
I'll need a pause and getting all nice and close it's all set up for us step ahead step ahead.

118
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,150
Okay so you can see on impact.

119
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,410
The trail is still living the head has been destroyed and then the trail gets time to resolve the remainder

120
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,360
of its kind of flying into the dude and then sticking around for probably a little bit too long.

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,990
So let's adjust that a little bit.

122
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,530
Open up our file fireball prefab point too.

123
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,030
I can also go into the projectile itself into the flamethrower and change this duration so it's lower.

124
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,610
I think that would make sense as well so that we're not having all this time after the fireball has

125
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,550
hit that it's still sitting there generating generating its particles but for now I'll solve it the

126
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,830
other way just by changing up that value we have on here life after impact point too but those are the

127
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,960
two levers that you can pull.

128
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,460
Again these things aren't exact science sometimes you have to fiddle and tune and tweak until you get

129
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,570
the look you're going for.

130
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,510
So we'll throw this fireball okay and that looks pretty good.

131
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,610
We get leery of that trail of the fireball.

132
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,640
Bum bum bum bum.

133
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,870
Yep and it sticks around for a little bit of time.

134
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,860
I think that looks pretty good.

135
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,280
Okay.

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,650
Couple more things to tidy up and before we wrap up I think I've gone and broken our arrows.

137
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,690
Let's have a look at those couple of reasons why.

138
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,670
First of all let's see what's going on.

139
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,320
It hits me and it goes flying straight through.

140
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,640
So first of all what we can do is say well we want to have the arrow head destroyed upon impact.

141
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:57,010
I'm going to go to my root arrow projectile open prefab find the destroy on hit.

142
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,290
Change that to one and drag in the simple arrow that should destroy the arrow.

143
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,610
And for our prefab variance that should work as well.

144
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:14,710
What we need to do in our Projectile class is to scroll down and say that upon impact we want our Arrow

145
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,780
or want our projectile to have a speed of zero so that it doesn't try to keep going.

146
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,960
Let's say it doesn't try to keep going bird bird bird bird straight through our target.

147
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,420
So that will also help us in this instance underneath.

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,020
Take damage before we play our hit effect.

149
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:37,820
Adding here speed equals zero speed I'm referring to here is our instance variable speed run up every

150
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,150
top there so the speed of the projectile.

151
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,670
Save that and see what sort of impact that has with those two changes.

152
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,790
Run run run run run stand in the middle of the bridge.

153
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,170
Don't miss me.

154
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:51,890
Got me got me.

155
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,350
Okay.

156
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,360
We'll slow it down and see what's happening with the trail here just to make sure the trails behaving

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,980
as we'd expect it to behave.

158
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,110
The red ones coming in and hits me bam.

159
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,840
And then the trail slowly disappears.

160
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,080
I think that's awesome.

161
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,860
Pretty good and success.

162
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,130
Okay.

163
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,940
Another thing I'll do with a fix.

164
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,610
I've been thinking about this and getting lots of great feedback from people.

165
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,850
This is really dumbly name so I created my first impact here which was the fireball put a lot of effort

166
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,100
into that and then said Well let's do use a prefab variant but then I encoded generic impact effect

167
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,420
which doesn't make any sense.

168
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,340
I'm using this as an arrow impact effect.

169
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:35,180
So now it's okay for the Arrow impact I think from a naming point of view to be ab prefab variant of

170
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,820
the fireball and if we were to create another layer of effects underneath this we probably would want

171
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,320
to rename the fireball impact.

172
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,830
So it's very clear that this is the the prefab parent if you will of the other variants that come underneath

173
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,090
it.

174
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,830
But for now I'm comfortable that this is differentiated enough.

175
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,880
I think we need to do is go to projectile and put this in a namespace.

176
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,600
I've totally forgotten to do that so I'm going to highlight everything in here.

177
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:08,330
Cut the top name space and it will be namespace RPG dot.

178
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,280
What are we in here in combat and then paste all that inside.

179
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,500
Excellent day.

180
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,310
Save that up.

181
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,040
We also need to do the same thing for what do we create.

182
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,870
Recently that I didn't namespace under the core.

183
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,360
We have destroy after effect story after effects.

184
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,250
Let's highlight everything in here.

185
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:41,600
Boink cut all that name space and the name space is going to be RPG dot core core core.

186
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,770
It's what you say when you're really impressed with something in Australia.

187
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,980
Cool.

188
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,400
Check that out.

189
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,610
Okay so that's all looking pretty good.

190
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,850
So let's just do one last quick run through.

191
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,420
Make sure everything's working as it should before I declare all my bugs and all my tidy ups done.

192
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,640
Grab this thing shoot that guy firewall works kaboom.

193
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,100
Well I've got one last thing that I keep forgetting to do.

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,070
Thank you for Sam pointing this out to me.

195
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,320
Rick what were you thinking.

196
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,980
Can you guys.

197
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,310
But here's a little sleuthing moment for you.

198
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,720
See if you have the powerful brain that Sam patootie has.

199
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,620
What is wrong with this moment.

200
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,800
Just here OK.

201
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,120
What is wrong is we've got this guy thrown left handed left handed throw is a tricky enough as it is

202
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,550
but the fireballs coming out of his right hand.

203
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,850
Well done Rick.

204
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,630
You're using your brain there so fireball click on the fireball scriptural object and turn off is right

205
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,380
handed.

206
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:42,140
This is why we do our quality assurance testing this is why QE test is in the industry super valuable

207
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,520
look.

208
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,370
Now it's actually coming out of the right spot.

209
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,010
Well done.

210
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,660
Who.

211
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,380
That looks okay.

212
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,710
We'll pick up the bow.

213
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,710
We'll let them shoot at me.

214
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,050
Pam's crunch crunch.

215
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,260
I'll shoot at them and due to success OK.

216
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,030
I can't see any issues here now.

217
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm sure there are some.

218
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,560
If you've found anything else please let me know in the comments and Sam or I will come in and do some

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,170
extra bug fixes these things often don't come up until later on but hopefully we've found everything.

220
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,700
Hopefully your game is looking awesome please do share the latest screenshot latest video in our comments.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,330
We'd love to see where you're at with your game and I'll see you in an upcoming lecture.
