00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.290
In this video we're going to implement a simple fix so that when we click on an enemy the player actually

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.280
looks at the enemy looks them in the eye when these smacking them in the face rather than looking off

3
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.840
to wherever he's currently facing at the moment.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.840
I want to start with a quick conversation about how do you know when to move on to the next feature.

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.620
So how do you know when to move on.

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.010
Well in early development I really want to make it clear.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.750
Don't get stuck on one feature.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.130
We've been working on our basic combat for a while now.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.690
I think we're getting very close.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.970
But how do we know when to move on well move on when you can pass this test.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.740
Ask yourself the question Is there anything about this feature which is distracting or broken.

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.660
So when we look at our game here we can run around and say well yeah movement's not perfect but it's

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.620
not too bad it's not distracting it's not broken something I feel is broken when you click you're not

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.880
even looking at the guy that feels like this moment just to you that it's a bit broken to me and very

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.860
distracting to the player so you can have a player play your game be like What is he doing that you

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130
don't want that you want to make sure that you eliminate those things.

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.970
Once we've eliminated those we have to get out of Dodge and move on to the next feature or else we'll

18
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.600
be spent in ten years making our game so what do I see are the last bits of twiddling for our basic

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.340
combat before we move on to say enemy II or the next feature.

20
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.720
Well I think we need to change our player just a little bit so he's slightly more handsome.

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.950
I give him a slightly different color because at the moment when you run around he looks the same as

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100
the enemies and if someone was to play this right now I'd be like What.

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.070
Who would try my I think we need to make the player look at the enemies which is what I was just showing

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.570
him won't be doing that in this video.

25
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.010
And then the next video I'm going to make sure that the dead don't interfere with the thumping because

26
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.410
we've got an issue at the moment.

27
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.230
If I was to grab my enemy who's alive and move this enemy over.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.000
So he's come running up hey you don't kill my buddy who comes running up and then I go to click on him

29
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.050
I can't click on him because he's dead buddy is blocking my recast so I can sort of move around and

30
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.730
sort of sometimes click em but a bit buggy and a bit messy that's going gonna be distracting and it's

31
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.780
also a little bit broken.

32
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
So that's my logic for what we're doing in the next couple of videos then we'll move on to the next

33
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.440
section of the course.

34
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.400
And how we going to resolve this current challenge.

35
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.460
Well I am going to show you transformed not look at you may have used it before.

36
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.120
Pretty straightforward if we read here rotates the transform of the game object so that the forward

37
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.620
vector points at the target's current position.

38
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.880
In other words it will rotate our player.

39
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.930
Beep beep beep beep beep.

40
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.270
So it will be its forward vector is pointing towards the target.

41
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.260
That's exactly what we want.

42
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.730
So I look at is really handy really handy tool to use.

43
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.070
And so this is a bit of a one line fix but I'm going to give that to you again as a challenge to look

44
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.470
me in the eyes and say that you'd transform not look at to turn the play out when clicking on an enemy

45
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.950
and what you need to figure out in this is two main things.

46
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.580
First of all where to add that where to call that method.

47
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.590
And second what to pass into it.

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.120
So we have to pass something into it.

49
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.030
We have to say look at this particular thing.

50
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.410
So there's your challenge.

51
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.090
It's only one line you need to add but a little bit of logic little bit of figuring out.

52
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.050
So take that on give you your best shot and I'll see you back here when you done okay.

53
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.250
Song and jump over into fighter dot c s and as I said it's just one line.

54
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.910
Let's start off by figuring out where should that one line be.

55
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.800
Well if we look at our update where first of all making sure we can attack.

56
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.110
Good.

57
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.390
Getting into range.

58
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.310
We're not in range getting range call.

59
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.210
And then when we are in range stopped moving got it.

60
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.110
And then do the attack behavior what's part of our attack behavior.

61
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.020
Look at the thing.

62
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.120
So within attack behavior I think the very first thing we should do when we're calling attack behavior

63
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.400
is to look at our enemy.

64
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.820
So transform dot look at now what are we going to pass him where we need a passing something's transformed.

65
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.210
Because it transforms its position in the world.

66
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.590
What's this something we're going to pass him was just going to be Target Target dot transform semicolon

67
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.520
that means we should be looking at it and I just want to remind you again this might be something you

68
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.050
do or don't do.

69
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.990
But if he gets stuck and you want a little bit of intel you watching Sam and I know what on earth are

70
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.190
these guys doing.

71
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.620
And you've just typed out exactly what we've typed.

72
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.980
Put your mouse over each aspect and see what it says.

73
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.480
Just to remind yourself what's going on.

74
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.090
So this is the transform attach of the game object.

75
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.700
Oh it's the game object that fighter is attached to go look at.

76
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.320
It's going to rotate the forward vector towards the position.

77
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.830
Right.

78
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.790
This is the target.

79
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.330
It's of type health.

80
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.350
Oh yes of course.

81
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.220
And then this is the transform so just right.

82
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.940
I know you know this.

83
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.000
I know you've been doing this but just a reminder if you get stuck sometimes tons of information when

84
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.450
you just do a little simple mouse over let's say back over in unity make sure this fix works hop in

85
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.240
the middle of a couple of guys here and click point turns doing great.

86
00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.180
And down here turns turns gray a little bit of a little bit of glitchy ness every now and again.

87
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.520
We're gonna get that as I was saying before like that just then there was a little bit glitch before

88
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.630
he started attacking.

89
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.460
That's something that is a tiny bit distracting but I don't think it's broken at the moment so we're

90
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.650
not gonna worry about digging into that just yet.

91
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.850
Those little tiny glitches we want to keep pushing through keep getting features into our game and the

92
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.270
other thing I do in this video is just quickly change the color of my player.

93
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.330
I'm going to find the play a prefab which is under game characters and there is my play a prefab double

94
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.070
click on that that will open up the prefab.

95
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.860
Very cool.

96
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.630
Now if we go into the Sinti pack the Sinti polygon student pack we can see under materials we've got

97
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.910
a bunch of characters textures.

98
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.770
Now I've gone and made a couple of tweaks to these so that we can change up the colors.

99
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.560
You can see we've got a textured blue sari black just drop that over it changes it blue orange which

100
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.690
we've been using and red.

101
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.970
So if one of those takes you fancy then you might want to change it.

102
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.210
I'm going to change my character to blue because it also changes the beard to white.

103
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.050
I want my character to be an old guy so I'm going to click up in the top left because I'm doing that

104
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.970
straight onto the prefab which is how I like to do it.

105
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.880
It's a personal style I can just click out of the prefab and I know the change has been made to the

106
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.010
player game object that I've got in my scene.

107
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.080
Any of my player game objects because they linked to the prefab will have been updated.

108
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.660
Okay save that.

109
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.820
It's looking pretty good don't really need to test that the color works.

110
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.920
But now I think that my player stands out from the enemies and just makes it a little less distracting

111
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.510
for anyone that we might give our game to to say hey what do you think about our game.

112
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.750
Cool.

113
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.310
So in the next video we're going to take on the broken thing that I mentioned before about not being

114
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.660
out a click when there's a dead enemy in the way so I'll see you in that next video very shortly.
