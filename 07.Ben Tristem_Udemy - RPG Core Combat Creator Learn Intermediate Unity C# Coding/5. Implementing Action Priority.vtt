00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.290
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.550
In this video we are going to be having some priority for our actions.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.910
Obviously we can move around if that is the only thing we can do but if we're hovering over I think

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.150
we can attack we shouldn't be acting like we need to move to it.

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.560
We should just be doing our attack procedure.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.820
So if you look in the console I'm clicking It's doing my attack procedure but it's fundamentally not

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.780
also moving to that point in the long run this is going to allow us to also put what I'm calling cursor

8
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.900
a fortnight which is a cursor that is either something that shows that to the player that it can attack

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.860
or that can move or that it can't do anything with this particular object.

10
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.260
And that's very useful in UI because when I'm hovering over something it allows the player to discover

11
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.660
that you're allowed to attack this thing or that you're allowed to talk with that thing.

12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.450
And so that's going to be quite important in the long run.

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.570
We're not doing that in this lecture but we are laying the foundations for it.

14
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.180
So let's dive in and see how that's done.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.880
So you may have noticed some slightly undesirable behavior when we tried to attack this capsule is that

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.780
we're moving right to it.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.270
So clearly we are both doing an attack action and a movement action which is not really the correct

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570
thing to do if you're attacking your attacking if you're moving you're moving.

19
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240
And those are two different things.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.840
So we need to sort out our priorities.

21
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.070
Basically if I've clicked on something that I need to attack then I don't move and if I click on something

22
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.180
that I need to move then I don't attack and vice versa.

23
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.930
Well that is vice versa.

24
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.130
So how do we get something like that to work.

25
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.040
So I think the best way to do this is to have our interact with combat.

26
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.540
Tell us whether or not it succeeded and if it did succeed in interacting with combat then we don't go

27
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.220
on to interact with movement.

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.230
If however we didn't succeed with combat then we do go on movements.

29
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.150
That's the priority right.

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.970
If you click on something to attack then you should attack.

31
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.300
Otherwise you could move there.

32
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.080
Obviously the other way round doesn't make much sense Cause you can move practically anywhere.

33
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.590
And if you just move to the enemy rather than attacked it that's kind of getting your priorities messed

34
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.220
up.

35
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.980
So how are we going to change our code here.

36
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.330
Well firstly I want to return a boolean value from interact with combat.

37
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.630
I'm going to show you how this works in here.

38
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.490
So this is going to return a boolean and we're going to use that in our update.

39
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.770
So we're gonna say if interacts with combat.

40
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.530
So if we have interacted with combat then I'm going to return early.

41
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.270
So this is very much like I continue.

42
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.050
It skips over the rest of this body and exits the update.

43
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.190
And that means it won't interact with movement which is pretty much what we want it to do.

44
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.220
So how is this going to work.

45
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
We need to you can see is complaining here because we're not actually returning a boolean from our interact

46
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.000
with combat.

47
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.930
So I think the clear time that we have successfully interacted with combat is going to be down here

48
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:18.150
either when we are inside this if get mouse button down we might return true here.

49
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.110
So we're saying oh I clicked it yet I interacted correctly with combat.

50
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.820
But actually what I'm going to do is take this outside of the if statement.

51
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.060
Why is that.

52
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.880
Because even if we have our mouse not down this frame but we're hovering just hovering over that combat

53
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.320
target we actually don't want to do any kind of interaction with movement.

54
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.130
Why is that.

55
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.710
Because later on down the line what women want to do is provide some cursor afford ints which is basically

56
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.490
to say if I can interact with movement then I've got to show a combat cursor.

57
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.610
Otherwise I'm going to show a movement cursor.

58
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.380
So that's just kind of laying the foundations for that week have into we are interacting with combat

59
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.770
even if we're just hovering over it even if we haven't clicked.

60
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.950
So that's why I'm returning true outside of the if statement and otherwise basically if we get to the

61
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.070
end of this for loop and we still haven't returned true if we still haven't exited the for loop then

62
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.810
that's the time when we should return false.

63
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.450
So exited the for loop and we just return false because we didn't find any combat targets to interact

64
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.720
with.

65
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.480
So we just return and then we interact with movement.

66
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.920
So if we have a go now see if this is going to give us the behavior that we want I'm going to go ahead

67
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.590
and hit play after it finishes compiling takes a little while sometimes I click on the capsule and you

68
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.550
notice no it's not going to move there.

69
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.380
But if I click anywhere else I can still move.

70
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.660
So that's pretty much the behavior we want when we're clipping clicking on the capsule is not doing

71
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.230
combat.

72
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.250
Now there are situations where you might not be able to move to where you click.

73
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.410
So I would like you to do a similar thing that we just did with interactive combat interacts with combat

74
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.990
and do it for movement as well.

75
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.600
So the way we're going to test this is I'm gonna have a print statement going.

76
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.260
Nothing to do right now.

77
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.260
And that's going to be at the end of our updates and if we get it all right.

78
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.880
Then when you go to the edge of the world which is a place where there won't be anything to interact

79
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.860
with the ray will go through nothing and you won't be able to move there then you should be able to

80
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.340
when hovering over the edge of the world over the terrain not over the terrain rather than it is going

81
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.950
to print nothing to do so that's your challenge to get that print to run.

82
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.040
You going to replicate the procedure that I followed for combat.

83
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.180
And when you get to the edge of the world it should print and not only when you click but also when

84
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.560
you hover over.

85
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.780
If we wanted to have the same behavior as combat that's what it should do so pause the video and have

86
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.810
a go at this okay.

87
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.340
Welcome back.

88
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.090
So let's give this a shot.

89
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.350
So the first thing is to put this statement in here.

90
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.530
So if movement returns true then we're going to return because we are able to we're hovering over something

91
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.100
that is movable.

92
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.680
Obviously I haven't changed this to bullion just yet.

93
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.900
So interact with movement wasn't bullion.

94
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.170
Now bullion.

95
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.700
And you'll notice there's going to be a problem with doing the exact same procedure because I could

96
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.850
choose you know if the mouse button down then true otherwise false.

97
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.670
But that's not going to work when it's just hovering is it.

98
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.530
So we need to kind of flip things around a little bit.

99
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.930
You notice how we've got to get mouse button down here on the outside it's not even doing a ray cast

100
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.900
if we're not clicking.

101
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.650
We need to flip that around especially if we're going to want cursor afford ints.

102
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.640
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this if statement in fact just there.

103
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.590
If condition and copy that.

104
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:55.660
And then what we gonna do is inside at move to cursor we're getting that component the mover component

105
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.190
and moving to it.

106
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:04.210
That's if we've got a hit so I'm going to do my f in here instead.

107
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.070
So it's gonna be if get mouse button down.

108
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.830
So if the mouse button is currently down on the first frame but currently down then we are going to

109
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.240
move to that point.

110
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:24.730
But either way we are going to return True now you notice this move to curse is no longer correctly

111
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.730
named really it's the whole thing is just interact with movements so I'm going to pull that all into

112
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:37.120
one method and so interact with movement now does a rake cast every frame and it will return true if

113
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.950
it could interact with movement that's gonna give us the cursor performance in the long run.

114
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.410
Right now it's not by the way by afford Ince I mean you know giving us giving a hint to the user that

115
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.490
what can be done.

116
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.160
So if there's a walking cursor they know that they can walk there.

117
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.580
If it is an attack curse they need a contact.

118
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.020
That's what we mean in user interface design by a fortnight.

119
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.690
So they interact with movement now attends a boolean but not everywhere.

120
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:07.870
If you hover over it saying not all code path return a value which is a fancy way of saying that basically

121
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.900
if I ran through all of this in this if statement was false I wouldn't have a return value at the end.

122
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.200
It wouldn't know whether it was true or false.

123
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.340
So I'm going to return false at this stage.

124
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.400
So if has hit we are going to get mouse button and return true.

125
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.540
If it finds something we return true if it doesn't find anything return false.

126
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.050
So that should pretty much do the trick.

127
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.050
Let's move our character a little bit towards the edge of the world.

128
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.290
So I'm going to zoom out.

129
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.440
Get to the player.

130
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.370
I'm going to stick him near the edge of the world over here.

131
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.220
In fact this can be quite troublesome if you want to move the play around sometimes easier just to delete

132
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.460
the player as long as you don't have any modifications to the prefab which you shouldn't because you

133
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.820
should try and apply them back as much as possible.

134
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.960
And I'm gonna go to the game characters easy to find because my new layout and we can drag that character

135
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.340
right onto the edge of the world if we go ahead and hit play.

136
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:10.750
It's going to complain because the follow camera is not setup to point out the player hit play now we're

137
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.490
on the edge of the world and if I hover over the edge of the world you can see it's printing log messages

138
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:21.630
about having nothing to do so clear and I'm over the terrain and nothing's happening.

139
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.490
Hover over the edge of the world and at what didn't have it focus I don't actually have to click to

140
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.020
have it coming up but I just didn't have the game viewport focus.

141
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.010
But if I go over the edge of the world it's printing nothing to do so we know that is getting to this

142
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:36.490
stage.

143
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.480
This print statement in the code so I'm happy with that.

144
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.260
Which means that later on when we are adding cursor forces we can put something like a..

145
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.490
No action is possible here kind of thing.

146
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.930
For now I'm going to delete that print statement because we've got the idea.

147
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.500
You've kind of cemented it by doing it yourself with this interact with movement.

148
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.490
So I'm happy.

149
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.990
Let's move on to the next lecture.
