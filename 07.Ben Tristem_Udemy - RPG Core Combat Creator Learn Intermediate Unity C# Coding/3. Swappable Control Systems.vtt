00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.220
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.020
We're going to be having it so that the characters chase us and punch us and attackers and can actually

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.900
do damage to us so I can attack them back.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.870
But if I lose on my health I go ahead and die.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.170
So let's dive in and see how to achieve this.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.980
So it's all very well as being able to detect whether the enemy should give chase or not.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.970
But we do actually want that to happen.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.770
It's a bit boring at the moment.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.860
So the way we are going to do this is as we've already done we've separated out our control for the

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.490
player control a way back in the last section and now we are going to do exactly the second part of

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.570
this which is to set up an Enemy Controller.

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.090
The A.I. controller is an Enemy Controller.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.550
So that's what we want to do at this stage and for it to be able to manipulate the move and combat directly

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.080
and for it to start off it's going to start off with manipulating combat for us to be able to do that.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.670
We're going to have to call the same kind of methods as the play controller.

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.500
What's the advantage of using the same interface as the player controller.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.980
Well for one thing it allows us to reduce the amount of code we have to write because if the fighter

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.040
was controlled differently between the A.I. and the player controller then we would have to write to

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.570
lots of code to deal with that.

20
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.740
So basically what's the player controller doing is saying to the fighter can I attack and start attacking.

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.870
Now that should be enough for us to be able to get the fighter to work.

22
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Basically we might need a few more methods but not much.

23
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.990
But there is a problem.

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.770
They can attack and attack both taking the combat targets the player does not have a combat target because

25
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.850
the combat target is for stuff that can be clicked on and the player cannot be clicked on.

26
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.750
And we want the A.I. controller to not have to not have to have a combat target basically.

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.830
So we're going to have to change this interface to make it more generic and allow it to be used for

28
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.540
the A.I. controller and the player control.

29
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.570
So a little bit of a refactor here instead of taking in the combat target which at the moment we're

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.770
not really using to its full potential anyway because we're just going ahead and getting the health

31
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.760
component off of this.

32
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.310
So what we can do is we could change it over to say a game object.

33
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.880
Notice that in this case I'm not using the renamed tool because we just want to rename it here in the

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.470
fighter.

35
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.530
Nowhere else.

36
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.630
So now it is taking a game object in and it will try to attack it.

37
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.280
For example if I take in a game object that does not have a health component I can't attack it.

38
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.440
So this can attack function is going to fail at the first hurdle.

39
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.670
And so we're not going to go on and do an attack.

40
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.930
So if we go over to the play controller it's now going to be failing.

41
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.630
But that's okay because instead of getting the combat target we do want to get check that there is a

42
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.440
combat target.

43
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.430
Otherwise we should not be trying to attack this thing.

44
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.990
So first of all we're just going to an F target equals no.

45
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.670
We're going to reintroduce that we're going to continue basically saying that if we do not have a combat

46
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.020
target this is not something we can click on to avoid as clicking on ourselves.

47
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.710
Clicking on NPC that might be attacked by A.I. things like that.

48
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.540
And then what we want to do is get the target game object.

49
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.150
So I'm going to do a game object Targ and call it Target game object and we're going to get the game

50
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.370
object from the target so target dot game object like so in fact it probably would have been easier

51
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.110
just to inline this.

52
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.390
So that's what I'm going to target game object target or game object for can attack in both of these

53
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.530
situations.

54
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.890
So now what's happening is can attack.

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.360
We'll check whether the game object is no.

56
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.580
It will also then go on to check whether it has a health component if it hasn't got a health component

57
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.410
we can't attack it.

58
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.320
So it's going to fail.

59
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.620
And then if the mouse button is down we are going to try and attack it directly as a game object.

60
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.850
So it's pretty straightforward.

61
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.670
It's pretty much how it was working before.

62
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.730
So now I want to give you the challenge of making sure that the A.I. can attack.

63
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.610
So the A.I. should attack instead of print.

64
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.690
That seems pretty obvious and we should stop chasing when we've run away now just so that you are aware

65
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.450
the enemy currently is set up to run as fast as we do which means that basically we're not going to

66
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.570
be able to run away are we.

67
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.890
So you might need to change the speed in the nav mesh at which the enemy runs so that we can get away

68
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.400
in time.

69
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.390
So pause the video and see if you can get it to the stage where we are fighting and running and running

70
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.650
away and stopping fighting.

71
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.900
So the enemy I will attack has run towards us when we're in range when we're out of range.

72
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.240
They give up trying to run after us.

73
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.680
So think about how we're going to do that think about how we might have done that and the player controller

74
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.640
so far and how we've done similar things maybe in the move in the fighter how we've done these kind

75
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.950
of decisions in update post video and have a go OK.

76
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.560
Welcome back.

77
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.890
So for example over and fighter you can see we've got our if statements where we're doing if it's in

78
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.740
range move to otherwise cancel the movement and do the attack behavior it's a similar kind of thing

79
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.530
that we want to do in the eye controller.

80
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.360
We want to say that if we're basically in range to chase we want to start fighting.

81
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.160
So we need to get hold of the fighter.

82
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:40.440
So it's going to be a get component fighter and then we are going to call dot and I don't have the name

83
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.690
space includes so dot plus to use the combat namespace I think it's reasonable to for the A.I. controller

84
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.840
to be using the combat namespace.

85
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.110
So the fighter dot and then what do we want to do.

86
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.240
Want to attack but should we always attack.

87
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.660
Hmm.

88
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.300
Let's see.

89
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.770
So we've got our player in here we need to get a reference to the play a game object back an update

90
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.480
like so and I'm not sure I want to be doing this multiple times I'm going to see it in a second.

91
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.580
So we're going to attack it but should we be attacking it if we can't attack it.

92
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.450
For example if the player is dead we shouldn't be attacking it so we should be able to say distance

93
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:28.910
the player less than chase distance and the fighter component nice is getting a bit long.

94
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:37.610
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put the stop method back in here and I'm going to take a cached

95
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.020
reference to our fighter component in start.

96
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.860
So we'll have fighter equals get component.

97
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:54.060
You know the drill fighter very common to do this and then we can just do fighter attack in here and

98
00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.810
we can just do fighter dot can attack player up in the if statement says can we distance play less than

99
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.200
chase distance and fighter can attack plan.

100
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.500
Now I'm not 100 percent happy with this so distance to play.

101
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:17.580
I'm just going to change this into a boolean basically saying in attack range and it's going to take

102
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.140
the game object player as the argument so we don't have to find the object twice in one update.

103
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.320
I think that's starting to get a bit wasteful so we've got that and in fact you know what we can do

104
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.080
because the player doesn't change.

105
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:38.810
We can take a cache reference to the player as well so we don't have to find them every single frame.

106
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.710
So what game object.

107
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.160
The player we take the reference to it at start using exact same method from update.

108
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.410
So I'll take the player equals game object find with tag over into start.

109
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.610
So now our player is available all the time.

110
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.150
Means you don't have to pass this in.

111
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.660
So in attack range probably of player like so.

112
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.730
And now we can do at distance and we just want to check that it's less than the chase distance all in

113
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.870
one go.

114
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.740
So all on that line we are figuring out distance that I can do that as a separate variable.

115
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.800
So I'm gonna introduce a local variable this with the control plus or the light bulb.

116
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:27.450
You can do that control plus then introduce a variable and we're going to call this variable the distance

117
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.960
to player.

118
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.670
So it's easy to read.

119
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.710
Got to calculate the distance to play and if the distance a player is less than chase distance then

120
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.790
we are returning true for an attack range of player.

121
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.290
So instead of distance a player I can use in attack range of player just so everything reads really

122
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:43.620
nicely.

123
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.460
This is why I've done it.

124
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:51.270
Okay cause an update is now saying if an attack range of player and can attack player then fighter attack

125
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.000
player that makes a lot of sense.

126
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.620
Now the problem with this is that our enemies something's not quite working safe.

127
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.570
That's why the problem with this is that our player is going to attack us as soon as we come in range.

128
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.680
Sorry our enemy is going to attack as soon as we come in range.

129
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.080
We can't get out of range because they're running as fast as we are.

130
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.820
So first things first we need to make them slow.

131
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.020
I'm gonna go at a speed of three and then mesh agent.

132
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.660
So now they walk slowly and I am getting away from them but they just keep chasing me.

133
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.640
The reason for this is that we never cancel the attack.

134
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.100
We start attacking play and we never stop.

135
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.870
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna introduce an else into update so that we're saying in attack range

136
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.810
of player and can attack player then attack.

137
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:44.230
Otherwise we're going to have to cancel the attack components so that it doesn't try to attack when

138
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.520
we're out of range.

139
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.420
So let's give that a go.

140
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.580
Hopefully that should do the trick.

141
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.740
Now walking towards me walking towards me I get out of range and they have stopped and I've left them

142
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.070
behind.

143
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.090
They've lost interest but I get back into range.

144
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.140
Even just back into range of one of them and he starts following me again.

145
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.300
So what happens if I let him get to me.

146
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.870
Boom.

147
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:13.280
He starts beating me up and if we have a look at my player components I can see that my health points

148
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.650
are actually going down so the fact that we've made this system so similar between the enemy and the

149
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.110
player means that with so little effort we have been able to create a guy that is able to damage us

150
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.610
in exactly the same way as we're able to damage them.

151
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.750
Cool stuff now.

152
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.370
I'll see you in the next video where we'll be fixing the behavior.

153
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:38.750
I can carry on moving around even when I'm dead and I think the enemies will keep following us even

154
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.190
when they're dead so we're gonna disable that behavior because that's a bit of a weird bug.

155
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.640
See that.
