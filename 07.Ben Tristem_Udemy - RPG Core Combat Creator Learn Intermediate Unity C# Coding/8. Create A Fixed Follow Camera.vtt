00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.530
Hello again my friend in this video we're following our play around by implementing a follow camera.

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.060
So let's jump in to get started.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.350
OK.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.630
As we move around we need our camera to move with us.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.680
What we could do is we could just grab the main camera and child that to the player by dragging it over

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.610
the top of the player.

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.040
Now wherever the play goes the camera will go.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.330
That's going to work right.

9
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.570
Well sort of as you can see when we move around the camera is also taking on the rotation of the player

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.220
as the player rotates.

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.260
And it's kind of cool for about 10 seconds until you start to get really dizzy.

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.550
So that's not what we want.

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.890
So we have a problem how do we look the camera in position without it moving around but still follow

14
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.060
the player as the player moves.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.400
I'm just going to undo my camera drag just there.

16
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.870
And while I'm here I'm going to delete target because we need it.

17
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.820
I get what we need to do is create a follow camera.

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.110
Let me show you a slide fully camera he's a player looking happy.

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.050
There's our camera pointing at the player.

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.730
Now what we need to do is create a follow follow camera game object that we can place at the exact same

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.710
position of the player and then to child the camera to the follow camera and have this relationship

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.360
this child parent relationship with a camera.

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.130
The one we looked through is the child of the follow camera or our game object.

24
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.710
We could call it whatever we wanted here we could call it the thing that follows the player but we're

25
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.990
going to call it a follow camera.

26
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.680
And this fixed distance and angle is something that we can tweak and tune we can rotate the camera a

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.830
bit down or the up move it closer move it further away but always in relation to where our follow camera

28
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.070
game object is.

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:48.570
So let's jump back to unity and right click Create empty and name this follow camera excellent day.

30
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.850
So we've got a follow camera what we need to do here is to create a script.

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.340
So under our scripts folder right click Create to see sharp scripts.

32
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:05.450
I will call this follow camera and then drag the following camera script on top of the follow camera

33
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.140
game objects.

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.190
So now you can see that fellow camera is a component.

35
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.680
Let's open up follow the camera Oh looks good.

36
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.990
Time for a challenge.

37
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.260
And here's our challenge.

38
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.710
Attach these script to our flow camera game object.

39
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.740
Well we just did that so I've given you one for free.

40
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.760
Yay.

41
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.570
And then we want to serialize a variable called target.

42
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.470
And within our update method make our cameras position be the value of the target position.

43
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.960
So it's going to be one line within update which is camera's position equals target's position.

44
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.800
And then of course don't forget to assign the player's game object as the target.

45
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.150
So I haven't given you a lot of clues on the syntax for this.

46
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.710
This is one of those are intermediate challenges that I'm expecting that you kind of note already.

47
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.870
If you don't know it's not a problem at all.

48
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.520
We'll go through it together in a moment.

49
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.820
So take on that challenge do your best and I'll see you back here when you've given it your best shot.

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.000
Okey dokey for now we're not going to use our start method or our commenting on update.

51
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.760
We will create ourselves a nice new shiny variable which will be serialized so serialize field and this

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.000
will be of type trance form and we'll call this target was it of type transform what we need to know

53
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.310
the position we need to know the transform if we click on our flat.

54
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.270
You can see the transform here.

55
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.850
We want to know that transform we want to know the details of that.

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.240
So that is why we've made it of type transform.

57
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.410
And then within update all we need to do is a trance form with a small t dot position.

58
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.640
So that's saying the position of whatever the following camera script is attached to will equal target.

59
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.080
This is our variable we've just made target dot position.

60
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.190
And if he didn't do the challenge he's a good sport for you just to pause and do the last step in the

61
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.550
process to hook all this up together back in unity.

62
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.620
So jump over to you need a little mini challenge for you hook it up so that our camera is following

63
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.820
our player OK so first of all click on follow camera we need to drag our main camera to be a child remember

64
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.320
my slide from before.

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.570
Now the main camera is a child to the follow camera.

66
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.000
And while I'm here I'm going to click on follow a camera and drag that down into assets to make that

67
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.240
a prefab it's really time for us to tidy these up a little bit.

68
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.560
So we've got scene scripts.

69
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.940
I'm gonna make a new folder high level folder here create folder of code is just game.

70
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.940
These are things that just belong to the game player goes into game and flow camera goes into game.

71
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.230
So now we have follow a camera as a prefab so clicking on follow a camera you can see that we have none

72
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.560
as target click on my selector find the player record is drag the player on over player and then I'm

73
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.110
going to apply that back to the prefab.

74
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.000
So up here under prefab open select overrides click on overrides and then apply all.

75
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.490
So now all of that is part of the follow camera prefab.

76
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.720
Excellent let's just see how that looks.

77
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.870
Click on play and moving.

78
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.260
Yes.

79
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.980
So success.

80
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.790
We are moving the camera it's way off in the distance.

81
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.090
Okay.

82
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.370
Let's get in and tune our camera a little bit.

83
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.000
So click out of play mode just move our screens around a little bit.

84
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.570
I was going to put my game window next to my scene window so that I can get my same window looking a

85
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.290
bit fuller.

86
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.030
OK.

87
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.110
Is wiggling around a little bit to get in position roughly where I want the camera about there not looking

88
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.270
too much in the distance but you could do that if you wanted.

89
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.660
And not too far down.

90
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.360
So round about the decent angle we'll tune it again a bit more later on.

91
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.820
Now the first thing I want to do is to have my follow camera exactly on top of the player because we're

92
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.780
making a relationship between the camera and the follow camera.

93
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.650
So the follow camera needs to start on the player.

94
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:55.090
An easy way to do that is to hop on the player go to transform right click copy component back over

95
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.260
onto our follow a camera and on transform right click and paste component values.

96
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.200
That means it's now sitting right on top of our player.

97
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.680
Then click on main camera.

98
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.520
We've done this before we got to game object align with view blink.

99
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.510
So that is now aligned.

100
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.350
You can see

101
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.450
if I click on follow a camera right on top of the player if I click on main camera it's looking at the

102
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.770
follow camera.

103
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.010
Now click on play play our game window pops up and we can run around and that's look pretty good eh

104
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.840
not too bad at all.

105
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.550
I like it.

106
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.650
I like that and I'm not going to get dizzy as the camera spins around.

107
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.300
OK.

108
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.620
So feel free to tune that however your heart desires.

109
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.300
But for now we've got movement of our player we've got our camera moving around let's turn our attention

110
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.590
to having our player look a little bit more interesting in some upcoming videos.

111
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.190
Great work and I'll see you again shortly.
