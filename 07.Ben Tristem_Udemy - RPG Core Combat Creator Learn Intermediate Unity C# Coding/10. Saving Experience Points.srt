Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,600
In this lecture we're gonna be learning how to save experience points so you can see you've got ten

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,430
serious points here.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,310
I go into the next level and find my player again.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,090
Then you can see that the experience points are still 10.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,620
So we've saved our experience points into the save file.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,150
Let's dive in and see how to do it.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,240
So this video should be really brief because what we're going to be doing is just saving the XP of your

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,830
player.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,100
And basically this should be very easy and it's going to be entirely a challenge for you.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,960
So you're going to implement IceSave bill on the experience class.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,150
And what will you store.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,510
And then obviously go ahead and test it out and make sure it's working when you go between scenes you

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,320
keep the same experience points when you save and quit and come back.

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,360
You should have the same experience points.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,730
Those videos have a go OK.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,300
Welcome back.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,830
So let's give this a shot.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:03,690
So first of all we want to go into scripts and it is the resources we're looking for and the experience

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,520
script.

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:12,030
And as we can see in the experienced script what we're looking at is something that just stores experience

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,510
points.

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,710
So that's quite easy.

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,450
We're going to include.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:24,600
So using RPG dot saving and then we're going to implement the Icesave ABL interface which with the control

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,650
dots implement interface we are going to have a capture state and restore state.

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm just gonna order it.

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,780
So that capture state comes after the experience gain experience public method.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,730
And what we're going to return for capture state.

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,330
Well quite straightforwardly we just want to store our experience points.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,330
So let's just return that the experience points on the other hand restoring the state.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,310
We know that what comes back must be a float.

33
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,620
And that's what we're going to use to set our experience points so that experience points can be equal

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:03,360
to these states except that we want to cast that state to a float to make sure that we are getting the

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,030
right type back.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,370
And that should pretty much be it can be a really short lecture if that works.

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,610
So let's go ahead and hit play over in the editor and let's see.

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,550
So currently what's our experience for go to player and find his experience he's got zero experience

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,990
going to whack this enemy a bit and then he's going to die and I gained 10 experience points go to the

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:34,080
next level and find my player again in the hierarchy scroll down and his experience points is still

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,880
10 and I just want to verify that if I go back through here thus saving the game and that enemy is dead

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,630
if I exit the game play the game again then you can see the enemy died but also if I look at my player

43
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,430
sure enough it still got 10 experience points shy and successful and time to move on to the next lecture

44
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,010
where we will see how to display the experience points.
