00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.040
Hello again my friend.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.580
In this video we are sketching out our moment.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.400
You can see all manner of ugly sketching that I've done here it makes sense.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.090
Trust me we'll be going through this together.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.330
But the idea is to make a plan that we can follow so that we can start creating our moment.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.610
Okay.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.990
You can just get in here and start moving things around throwing around your houses getting a train

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.120
tool raising and lowering things I don't need that mountain anymore.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.140
What about if there's a creek through here big mountain over there you can just do that.

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.150
And I think that's cool.

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.880
I'd like to have a little bit of a sketch so I know what I'm working from.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.910
I also find that I spend hours in here just finessing.

13
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130
What would this look like and all what if I.

14
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.770
It's like rearranging the furniture when you don't really know what you're trying to achieve with your

15
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.700
furniture and maybe there are maybe here.

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.940
So what I want to do is show you the process.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.890
I'm gonna go through and just talk you through and make some notes as I go about sketching out my moments.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.820
Remember we're not trying to create an entire level here just yet.

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
We're creating a moment like when you create if you are a movie director we're creating a scene.

20
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.270
So I think I'm going to have my place start down the bottom right now I just need to calibrate myself

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.950
with where my camera is so I know which way my camera is pointing or else.

22
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.360
Okay.

23
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.870
So my camera is pointing kind of this way.

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.120
OK.

25
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.400
So I just need to have that in my mind as I'm scrolling around here so this would be the bottom right.

26
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.550
That would be the end enter and then exit somewhere at the top here.

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.520
And I think a pretty simple process of going through some sort of town as I have here and then out through

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.270
an exit.

29
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.580
And I want to give the player a choice and I think that choice is going to come some way through an

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.140
alternate path that sort of goes around the action.

31
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.360
OK.

32
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.030
So the reason I'm showing you this right this level is I like to think very high level first.

33
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.550
What am I trying to achieve at high level I'm trying to have a path through the village path one choice

34
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.390
on which way to go.

35
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.690
And some enemies in the middle.

36
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.910
And from there once I've got these kind of high level and we talked about this last video as well then

37
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.480
I can put in a lot more detail.

38
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.090
So I think speaking of the detail at the start I won't have the player have a little bit of a reveal

39
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.070
so they're going to come around something.

40
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.840
I remember my camera is pointing this way.

41
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.560
So if I have some sort of going to make this in green when I'm putting in my world.

42
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.710
So if I have some sort of mount any thing in here or a hill or trees that I can't see past that as the

43
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.310
player comes around this bend like that then they get to see at this point what are they going to see.

44
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.640
Well maybe at some point I won't have the player go along a bridge to enter town.

45
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.570
So perhaps there's a river that runs through at the start here just making all this up as I go by the

46
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.680
way.

47
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.760
This is the great part of being a game designers and you just like I think I'll have a river and hey

48
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.130
presto you have a river over the river.

49
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.230
I think I'd like to have a bridge I've kind of had this in my mind.

50
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.440
How do you get into this encounter this moment.

51
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.100
You cross a bridge and that's a little bit symbolic for the players saying you've now exited this part

52
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.470
of the game and you're now entering this part of the game.

53
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.240
So you're a little bit of a moment to think about what's coming up and then we had this moment just

54
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.180
here.

55
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.680
I'll do this in another color orange.

56
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.700
This is where we have our Reveal of what's going on.

57
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.370
What do we reveal what I want to reveal when the player sees through our camera up here we're talking

58
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.040
about what's the player see seeing in Gods soldiers enemies that kind of thing.

59
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.050
So I'm gonna put them in red and we'd probably see them a little bit further why not right on top of

60
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.800
the bridge there.

61
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.670
Back here in town maybe close to the tavern.

62
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.560
So they've got one hand on the their cup of drink and another they're watching this kind of gait that

63
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.180
you're not allowed to get through.

64
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.140
Is it bad or not.

65
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.550
Do we have a gate across here.

66
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.420
Probably not because the peasants need to keep coming and going so maybe there's a little bit of a barricade

67
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.370
to the side of them just to say you can't get through here I won't have this bit blocked maybe I can

68
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.900
have some sound effects or they can speak or something.

69
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.840
I also I think this is a choice for the player.

70
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.340
Do they want to be just like you know tell you who lets let's get in there and have fisticuffs or perhaps

71
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.290
at that moment where they reveal they can go around this little path maybe it's a little bit more subtle

72
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.220
so it's not super obvious the player will feel clever when they go that way.

73
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.620
See if I can draw some of these trees.

74
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.290
There we go.

75
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.720
So some trees just kind of saying this is a little bit of a goat track around the side and now I'm going

76
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.850
to destroy my mountains over here we don't want the play to be to go any way that way.

77
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.420
And up here as well.

78
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.100
And over here as well.

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.480
So blocking all those areas that we don't want to play in again is going to put a little bit of cross

80
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.810
there says cannot go here.

81
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.050
OK.

82
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.090
And then buildings well I'm not going to try to map out exactly where all the buildings are here but

83
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.310
I think we need to have some sort of building there to block the path some sort of building here and

84
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.960
then probably you know town in here.

85
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.700
This is like the main road going through the middle so to make it very clear it's a main road and around

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.410
the sides only trees and shrubs trees I think around the side of the goat path.

87
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.600
Now what I do want to do is put an enemy on the goat path just so there is something going on here there's

88
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.850
an enemy who's doing a patrol wandering.

89
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.800
Maybe it's not as strong as guarding the area just kind of meandering around staggering around if you

90
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.850
will says one guy there and perhaps there's another couple of guys just milling around in town here.

91
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.930
Essentially I've got like a four guards here and one guard there.

92
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.980
That's a little bit the choice.

93
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.380
So we've got the player he's going through our choice I'm going to just make a note in here.

94
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.740
The reason I'm going through this so deliberately is just so you can see the thought process and you

95
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.600
can replicate this yourself in the future we're going to be making bigger levels and more levels that

96
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.410
connect with each other.

97
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.170
So it's good just to know how to create a moment.

98
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.620
Then we're building from there.

99
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.930
And then probably some more buildings up the top here.

100
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.760
See how quick and easy it is just to kind of sketch things out when you do it right in your level it

101
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.860
can take a little bit of time.

102
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.160
You all this mountain is not quite in the right spot and you take ten minutes to finish that then you

103
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.550
decide.

104
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.500
I actually mountains there is not the right thing.

105
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.630
So sketching out first has its merits.

106
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.550
The last thing I was trying to decide is do I have a big kind of tough guy fight at the end so that

107
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.220
no matter which party you go you get this big fight.

108
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.770
This is a question mark and we'll see how that feels.

109
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.080
We don't need to have everything perfectly designed at this stage.

110
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.450
We'll just say maybe there's a tough fight at the end gives us a chance to put in maybe a stronger enemy

111
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.360
have some different stats on that enemy.

112
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.250
Tough fight maybe in the end there really are.

113
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.700
I'm just gonna write this nice and big here fast and loose so I may or may not end up with this moment

114
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.720
in my final game but for now I'd only be constrained with trying to have it perfect which I want to

115
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.220
do it fast and loose.

116
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.190
The other thing I want to say at this point is you can also it's totally cool to have little notes or

117
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.480
place holder elements in your guarantee saying pink Well you might say here there is an NPC that you

118
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.250
can talk to.

119
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.870
Now you can just grab one of the enemy models and just kind of stick it there it won't move.

120
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.430
Don't put an animator on it and then you can just pretend and you can save yourself oh this point the

121
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.730
NPC will say you need to go on important quest so you can do a lot of things where you pretend at this

122
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.520
stage of the game you don't only have to do the things that we've built as mechanics.

123
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.050
Okay.

124
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.770
Save that up so I have it as a reference.

125
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.530
Go back into my level have a look around see if there's anything macro that needs to be changed.

126
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.510
I'll probably be smudging out some of this terrain over to the right here.

127
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.460
Might need to move these buildings a bit.

128
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.750
The outside looks like it's fine.

129
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.410
That's pretty good.

130
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.370
So all in all it's roughly what I need I've got most the assets on this easy existing town and the trees.

131
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.580
The enemies will play around with a little bit as well so yeah I think that's all I need to do.

132
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.870
Okay.

133
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.550
So that brings me to the challenge for you which I'm sure you've guessed what it is to sketch your moment

134
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.470
put some notes on your sketch.

135
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.240
You can do this either on paper or if you prefer that and then maybe take a photo of it or scan it or

136
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.260
just have it sitting by your desk or to do it electronically.

137
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.460
As I've been doing sketch out your moment mark where your enemies will likely be.

138
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.380
And as I said it's okay to add some pretend aspects such as a fake NPC that gives you a quest.

139
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.660
Once you've done that then share an image with the community.

140
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.860
It doesn't have to look pretty you can see mine is pretty ugly.

141
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.870
That is all we need to do at this point.

142
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.660
So jump in take on that challenge.

143
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.110
Share with the community and when you've done I will see you in the next video.
