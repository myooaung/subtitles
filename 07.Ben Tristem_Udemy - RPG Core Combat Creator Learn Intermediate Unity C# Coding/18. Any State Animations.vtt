Hello again my friend.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.240
This is gonna be a quick little video where we change up our animated controller so that we have a way

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.000
for our characters to have a death animation.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.890
So let's get started on that.

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.150
The first thing I want to point out here is that well if we're currently in our locomotion state let

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.090
me click on my play button and click on the player when you click on the character.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.120
One of the characters you can see their current animation state but the little blue line that's going

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.790
through when I click on the enemy.

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.220
It runs up and then changes into this other animation state.

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.970
So you've got a situation here where we've got a couple of states that we're transitioning between if

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.570
I to add a third state maybe to cast magic or a fourth state which might be to talk to NPC then we're

12
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.030
going to have all these different states.

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.040
But what we want from any particular state from attack or from locomotion or from anywhere else is for

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.560
the character to be had a die and transition into that state and is a cool thing that we have in our

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.000
animator already in there which is any state so you can see the state in here any state where it's going

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.870
to grab that move it down to the side here so it's nice and clear on a own.

17
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.860
But this literally means that we can transition from any state into a new state which is our super big

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.100
help.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.840
That means we don't have to make a transition line from one two three four five to seven different states.

20
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520
We can do it straight from any state into the state we want to transition to.

21
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.350
So hopefully with that little quick explanation that's enough for you to do the challenge in this video

22
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.970
which is to trigger the death animation create a death state in our animated controller we've done that

23
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.430
before so you should know how to do it.

24
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.260
Assign an animation you know how to do that and just so you're not wandering around in the animations

25
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.600
armed photo.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.840
We have the death animation in there that I'll be using in case you're wondering where we get it from.

27
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.150
Create a die trigger.

28
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.410
We've done that before.

29
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.670
Transition to death from any state that should be pretty straightforward.

30
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.280
So jump in and do that now and then I'll go through that when you back.

31
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.390
Okay first of all right click Create state empty.

32
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.820
We will click on that state and rename it to death.

33
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.510
That's the state.

34
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.030
The trigger is going to be die because that's what we want to have to have happen want you to die and

35
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.420
then you go into the state of Death Song and click on the plus add a trigger and this trigger I will

36
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.410
call it die small D.

37
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.270
And then from any state I will write click make transition into death.

38
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.980
Death the animation we want to choose up here.

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.050
Let's see motion.

40
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.580
Click on the selector.

41
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.430
Doo doo doo doo doo.

42
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.810
I am looking for armed death one that will click on that and then for the transition we click on the

43
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.030
line going from any state to death.

44
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.920
Now do we need a transition back.

45
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.830
Probably not because you don't really come back to life in our current iteration of the game maybe one

46
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.390
day you can have it come back to life potion but not for now so we don't need to worry about the return

47
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.020
animation sorry the return transition so conditions in here click on the plus and then we will choose

48
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.460
die.

49
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.970
That is the trigger.

50
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.880
Now let's test that by clicking on play.

51
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.530
We have the character should be standing in locomotion so click on die Flip falls over and dies.

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.620
Awesome.

53
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.300
And if I click on my enemy and I click the trigger die drop the enemy dies as well.

54
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.770
So that's all for this video just a really quick one showing how we can use any state to transition

55
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.770
into our death state so that we can have our characters die.

56
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.950
Okay I'll see in the next video.
