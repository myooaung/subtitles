00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,910
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,260
In this lecture we're gonna be looking at how we can fix our health system and the saving system to

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,010
avoid a bug where enemies come back to life at some particular and weird incantations of saving and

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,790
reloading.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,730
So let's dive in and see what the bug is in the first place and then how to fix it.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,080
So we got a bug in health.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,490
Let's see how this is currently manifesting.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,890
The easiest way is gonna be for me to first delete my save file so I can show you all the reproduction

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,670
steps.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,000
Then we're gonna go over into unity and hit play and what we're gonna notice is that if I go and kill

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,470
this god or any god particularly it doesn't really matter anything with a health component really is

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,420
going to do the trick.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,250
He gets killed.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,640
Fine.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,590
That's okay.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,270
Now what happens is I can save this and then leave the game and then reload.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,730
And obviously the God is dead.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,910
Seems normal right.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,520
But what happens now.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,300
If I hit save again and then reload the game one more time what's going to happen.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,100
Well the god is actually alive again.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,870
Why was that the case.

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,460
Well let me run through this one more time so if I delete save and then go and hit play obviously I

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,460
start off my default location lock and pick up the sword.

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,160
That's the quickest way of killing this God.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,780
And then I whack the God a few times.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,680
And sure enough I think if we go and find this god go to the scene and go to enemies in which enemy

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,050
are we talking about is this enemy.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,720
Yes it is and have a look at his health component.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,030
You can see his health points zero as we would expect.

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:45,680
So sure enough in the game we go ahead and save and we quit and then come back and we should be back

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,390
to the god being dead.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,490
But actually if we go and have a look at our health component you will notice.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,310
Whereas the health component for our enemy that select the enemy's health components here it is.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,740
You can see that its health points are faulty.

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,770
So what's going on there.

37
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,560
Why are its health points 40.

38
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,000
That explains why if we save and quit again.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,240
He's alive because he's not got zero health points.

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,760
So what's actually going on is if we go and have a look at our health component going to close all the

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,820
others just to make it super clear in the health component we've got two places the or few places that

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,530
update our health points.

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,410
So where could these health points be set to forty one places and start in fact this is quite a likely

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:27,890
candidate.

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,230
That's the first option take damage.

46
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,730
Could we have taken negative damage.

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,120
Seems unlikely is no point where we're doing that.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,660
We aren't modifying it and get percentage not doing at modifying and capture state but we are modifying

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,690
and restore state.

50
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,340
So the two places that could modify the health points are restore state and start and what we've actually

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,100
got here is a race condition happening between the two.

52
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:57,470
So what's happening when we load from our save file in the first instance is that we are getting restore

53
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,700
state called First it is setting zero health points because the enemy is dead but then start gets called

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,130
afterwards and it sets the maximum health points.

55
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,000
Mind you because restore state actually set the health points first and checked whether they were lessons

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,800
zero and then died if appropriate.

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,830
We saw the dying animation we saw that the God was dead even though it had 40 health points thereafter

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,320
because the start reset it to 40.

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,870
So that's a really weird bug and that should definitely not be happening like this.

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,920
So have a think if you can think of a way If start is always called after the restore state just no

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,790
challenge like this.

62
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,070
See if you can think of a way of making sure we don't set the health points.

63
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,980
If we have already restored the health points pause a video and have a go OK.

64
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,750
So one way you could've done this is with a boolean you could have said hey we've got a restore state

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,920
it's happened so we're not going to set the health points we could have a boolean specially for that.

66
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,290
What I'm gonna do is actually turn our health points not into a serialized field because actually we

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,990
don't need them there we can visualize the health points through our UI.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,770
I'm going to set the default health points to B minus one f so a negative health value which you should

69
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,810
never be able to obtain unless it's just this on initialized value.

70
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,270
So what I'm going to do is say well if we've restored health points then they are going to be greater

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,590
than minus one.

72
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,910
So that's fine.

73
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,520
But if we haven't then they are going to be less than less than 0 0 minus 1.

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,910
So I'm going to say if health points are less than zero we know that we haven't been restoring them

75
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,430
yet they haven't been restored and that we need to set up some default health points in which case we

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,640
can get those default health points from base stat.

77
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,880
So let's give this a go.

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm gonna go back over into unity and again I'm just going to clear out my save file to make it super

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,970
clear in fact because we're deleting the save file so often I'm going to make a key binding for it in

80
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,730
our game.

81
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,790
So if I go to our saving wrapper I want to be able to call into the saving system to delete.

82
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:13,930
So I'm going to create a public void delete method in the saving wrapper and we are going to do a get

83
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:22,180
components saving system a saving system that would go and we're gonna call dot delete which does not

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,850
exist at present and we're going to call delete on that default save file and we're going to set up

85
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,620
a key binding in update.

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:39,080
So it's gonna be if the input gets key down is gonna be the key code I'm gonna use delete the delete

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,520
key because you don't really use it for anything else in the game we're going to cool that delete method

88
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,560
and then if you want to try and fill out the delete method if you know the saving system or you've done

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
the saving system section then go ahead.

90
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,170
If you haven't and don't want to then just follow along and type what I type so I'm going to go over

91
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,450
to our savings system.

92
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,230
Saving.

93
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,570
Saving system here it is.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,780
And I'm gonna create a new public and load.

95
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,640
So it's gonna be public void.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,140
Delete string save file and it's not even going to do anything particularly clever.

97
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,360
We're just gonna use the file dot delete method that is provided by C shop and we're going to build

98
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,520
the path from let's have a look where do we get our path.

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,680
If we do load file what has load file getting the path.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,180
Here we go.

101
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,190
Get path from save file so we tell it to save file name.

102
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,660
And it finds the whole file system path.

103
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,520
By that and actually pretty much do delete.

104
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,940
So now hopefully if I just reload I'd expect to hit delete and see it disappear from the file system

105
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,510
which it has.

106
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,050
Fantastic.

107
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,820
So now I can delete the save file without having to go to this folder which is nice.

108
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,940
So if you restart the game at this point we should be from scratch.

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,500
Fantastic.

110
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,980
So I'm gonna get the sword go and kill the enemy and check that our bug has disappeared so remember

111
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,520
it was reproduced by killing the enemy.

112
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,040
Saving reloading the game which point the enemy should look dead.

113
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,250
Yep looks dead.

114
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,060
And just to check what we were seeing is that if we have the enemy selected in the hierarchy and look

115
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,430
at their health components they actually had 40 health points in this case we can't see the health points

116
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,530
because well we've removed them from being a sterilized field so we're just gonna go ahead and hit save

117
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,590
and then recycle one more time and this time the enemy should still be dead Hopefully indeed the enemy

118
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,060
is still dead.

119
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,980
So we haven't successfully fixed that race condition in the health system and along the way we also

120
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,110
added a function to delete and clear our save file for debugging purposes in the next video we're gonna

121
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,010
look at how we can use Unity or C sharp events actually in order to save us from having to recalculate

122
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,260
the level every single frame.

123
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,750
I'll see you there.
