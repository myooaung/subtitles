00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.680
Hello again in this video we're in the run up to the enemy smack him in the face a couple of times while

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.340
sort of the face and have him die and fall down in a crumpled heap.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
Sara let's jump in and implement our death animation OK.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.790
This is another video we're going to give you the challenge pretty early on and get you to solve it

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.730
yourself.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.570
While we're looking at is the health script that we need to do some functions within here to trigger

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.160
our death animation we've done all this stuff before using the attack.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.100
So let's have a look at what we need to do for our challenge.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.220
What should a trigger death when health is zero within health dots.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.280
Yes trigger the death animation when the character's health reaches zero.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.670
There we go.

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.120
I've said it five times now it should be clear and four bonus points use a bool to stop triggering the

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.800
death animation once the poor fellow is already dead.

14
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.430
So there's lazy challenge if you need a hint.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.800
I'll give you a hint just now.

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.950
Otherwise jump in and take on the challenge.

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.460
So the hint is.

18
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.400
Previously we set up the attack in our fighter script where we said to do.

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.510
Where are we in here.

20
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.190
We used the set trigger to trigger the attack.

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.120
So if you're a bit unsure about what to do there's a little hint for you.

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.320
But there we go there's all the clues.

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.480
Jump in and take on that challenge now.

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.010
Okay.

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.480
First thing I knew I think health is a nice broad kind of generic terminology but what we're really

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.680
doing here is increasing or decreasing our health points.

27
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.770
I'm just going to rename this f to health points just so it's really clear what we're doing.

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.110
Right.

29
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.680
Health points.

30
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.220
Okay.

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.010
So where we have our health points equals health points minus damage instead of just printing this out.

32
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.730
What do we want to do here.

33
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.180
Well say if health points is equal to zero.

34
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.750
And remember because we've got our previous line saying that it won't go any lower than zero.

35
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.250
That's why we can say equal to zero.

36
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.370
We don't have to say less than or equal to zero in this instance.

37
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.960
Then what do we want to do.

38
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.290
Well curly braces we will say get component and it is the animator we're looking for and it may tore

39
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:17.240
parentheses dot set trigger and we are going to put in will jump over to unity find I double click on

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.410
that ones click on it again.

41
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.580
Copy just to make sure we get it exactly perfect paste in there.

42
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.290
Excellent semicolon.

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.070
Save that I'll jump back over in unity see what's going on here.

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.690
I'm going to click on play.

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.510
I've noticed something about the capsule Claudia.

46
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.700
We'll get back to in a moment but click on play come over punchy and once twice punched him in the groin

47
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.680
a couple of times and you can see we're continuing to bash in which is hilariously funny.

48
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.890
But we'll do something to prevent that from happening.

49
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.540
But first of all just having a look at our capsule colliding here on our enemy so click on the enemy

50
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.770
and find the center on the y axis and just move that up so that it's probably one.

51
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.220
There we go.

52
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.020
That's gonna make it easier to actually click on the character anywhere and not accidentally click past

53
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.530
him.

54
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.890
Okay.

55
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.730
Very good saves that up.

56
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.800
Now let's go prevent this you know continuing to have him flop around on the ground after we've punched

57
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.570
him a couple of times so how are we gonna do that.

58
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.430
Well we need to create ourselves a ball to stop at the top here.

59
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.410
Line nine for me ball and we'll call this is dead and we'll initialize that at false because you start

60
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.580
off being not is dead and now where we're getting our animator and setting the trigger.

61
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.970
Let's extract this is a method tidied up a little bit will double click if to call this die nice and

62
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.060
dramatic now then die first of all we want to be checking if is dead because if it's dead then we don't

63
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.010
want to be doing anything that follows so we will return because he's already dead you don't need to

64
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.890
rub insult into injury and now if we're continuing we will set is dead equals true because we do need

65
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.010
to kill him and then to trigger our die so save that.

66
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.660
Jump back over into unity click on play run over to my enemy punch him a couple of times in the nether

67
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.330
regions there we go boom boom falls on the ground doesn't trigger.

68
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.800
Over and over and he's still punching he's still in the attack state which is not what we want but we'll

69
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.050
fix that up in upcoming videos.

70
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.530
One last thing I want to do while I'm here we made a couple of changes to the enemy so if you have to

71
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.810
the click on the enemy prefab up to the overrides you can see we've got the enemy script and the capsule

72
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.020
quite a click apply.

73
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.800
All will leave the health super low for now.

74
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.280
I changed the health down to.

75
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.370
I think what was it nine or eight eight points there they just changed the capsule quarter.

76
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.910
Okay great.

77
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.880
So now we can trigger our death animation.

78
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.060
Great work and I'll see you in an upcoming video.
