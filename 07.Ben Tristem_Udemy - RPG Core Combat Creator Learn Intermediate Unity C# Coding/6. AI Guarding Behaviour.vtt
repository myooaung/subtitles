Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.510
In this lecture we aren't going to be enabling a guarding behavior where if the guard tries to come

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.680
after us and I escape him he goes back to his original guarding position like the good God that he is.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.280
So let's dive in and how we can see how we can achieve this okay.

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.410
So what do we want to achieve with this A.I..

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.940
The current thing that it does that I think is a little bit weird is they come up to attack you.

7
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.520
But when they lose sight of you they just stand wherever you lead them to.

8
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.220
They're not very good guards in that sense right.

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.530
They should be guarding whatever they were left to God.

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.690
So these guys were guarding the path I can take them away and just take them on a wild goose chase and

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.080
then leave the path completely clear for me to run down.

12
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.940
That's not what we want to do.

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.390
We want them to go back to the original position they started off at.

14
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.440
Now if you think about it.

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.350
An A.I. controller is a little bit like the AIS mind.

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.530
So any state that we put in here excluding things like cache variables here things that we've got hold

17
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.290
of once just to save us time.

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
But there is also states which we currently do not have.

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.830
But if there were any state it's basically like that A.I. is memory.

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.540
I'd like to think of that.

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.580
And that's what we're gonna do.

22
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.060
We're going to be using memory basically like this.

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.100
And the idea here is we won that God to remember what location it's supposed to be guarding.

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.700
So I'm going to have a vector 3 called God location

25
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.100
which initially isn't going to be set to anything but we are going to update that with the transform

26
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.010
that we start with basically where we are put it the beginning is where we're going to God.

27
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.370
We could have it for example as a serialized field but not in this case.

28
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:07.880
So we're going to have a god location equal to the transform dot position like so.

29
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.330
So the god location in fact this is a little bit confusing that's location that's position.

30
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.150
I'm just gonna use consistent terminology and rename use the F 2 to rename God position.

31
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.360
So this guard position is where we want to return to.

32
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.930
So challenge for you.

33
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.790
When should I decide to return to its post and what do you need to call in order to make the ally do

34
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.210
that.

35
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.300
Remember that we are calling the same things as our player is able to call so pause video and have a

36
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.530
go.

37
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.830
If you feel ready otherwise I've got a hint coming for you in just a second.

38
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.580
You can always come back and just watch the hint.

39
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.580
If you're struggling OK so the hint is that what you're going to need to call is move it.

40
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.210
Don't stop.

41
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.540
Move.

42
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.930
Action.

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.490
I'm not telling you what goes in the brackets that you can work out for yourself.

44
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.110
So give this a go OK now I'm going to give it a shot.

45
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.390
So where do we need to cool this at the moment when we are attacking when we can attack.

46
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.720
We attack and otherwise we cancel and just stop where we are.

47
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.960
But what if instead of cancelling we got hold of a reference to our mover.

48
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.980
So I'm going to add a reference for the movie script.

49
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.140
I think this is going to need the movement name space including which is okay.

50
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.780
The controller does need to control the movement namespace and then I'm going to do the get components

51
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.500
like so and then the mover we can use instead of cancelling the fighter directly.

52
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.910
We can use the move to start a move action because we know that starting a move action automatically

53
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.180
cancels the fighting action and then where do we want to go to.

54
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.970
Well that is quite clear that we want to go to the guard position that we left off.

55
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.130
So quite simple.

56
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.760
All in all but it brings out some of the ideas around how we want to deal with state and how we want

57
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.100
to think about state in A.I..

58
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.890
So this guy comes and attacks me comes off his post then I leave and he goes back to his post automatic.

59
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.400
Now that looks a little bit odd because surely God wouldn't instantly forget about me the second I go

60
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.500
out of his radius of interest and just go back to his post.

61
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.340
So we're going to be working with suspicion in the next lecture and I'll see that.
