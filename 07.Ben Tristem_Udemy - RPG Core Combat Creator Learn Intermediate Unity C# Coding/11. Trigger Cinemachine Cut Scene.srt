1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:04,690
Hello again.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,860
In this video we're going to set it up so our player runs through a trigger volume that triggers our

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,440
cinematic moment.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:16,570
We play through our cinematic moment and then after it's done it returns control back to the player

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,520
and we can set it up so that when we run through the trigger volume again it doesn't trigger the cinematic

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,060
sequence.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,100
So let's jump in and get started.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,870
Let's start by finding our game object where our playable directories for me it's my intro sequence

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,110
going to add to that a component first of all I'll add a box collider that will be somewhere in the

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,970
scene over in the middle in there.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,250
So what I will do you know it's something very interesting see how it might transform on my intro sequence

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,040
is bloomed out.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,710
That means that if I try to move it like there you can see it's been moved.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,440
If I click away and then click back it's back where it was before.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,950
That's because whenever you see the blue here that means that this game object thinks that there's some

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,400
animation taking place and the animation is pushing it back to wherever it thinks it should be in the

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
first frame.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,300
If I click away and click back to it and that is because when we set up our timeline sequence it automatically

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,500
added this intro sequence animation track on here that is causing that particular I think I'm being

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,000
animated issue so I'm gonna go ahead and delete that we're not using it for our synth machine or our

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,830
Dolly animation.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,760
So now that it's deleted when I click on intro sequence you can see that the fields here aren't blue.

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,030
Now I can move my intro sequence down to their has to click away and click back again.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,750
You can see that it has retained its memory of where I put it.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,030
OK.

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:44,530
So we're particularly looking at the box cloud Ask.com make it a bit bigger ten on the x axis of six

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,280
on the Y and two on the Z or Z.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,930
And I've got to place it on the bridge on big fan of placing the trigger volume so you can't accidentally

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,330
not walk through it click on my intro sequence I'm going to rotate that so it fits nicely across my

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,630
bridge and you know I'll start it up a little bit just so it's not too wide and doesn't need to be actually

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,110
that high at all because the play is nowhere near that high.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,540
Okay.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,670
Drop it down now Trig volumes what else do we need to do here for trigger volumes.

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,420
Well first of all we need to click is trigger for our box collider.

35
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,960
We need to add a rigid body rigid body and my rigid body I'm just going to put that kinetic and turn

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,460
off gravity.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,950
What else do we need to do when we have this trigger moment.

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,380
Well we need when we run through the trigger volume we need to have a collider on our players.

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,330
Let's find our player as of yet we haven't got a collider on it.

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,070
So add component this one I will do as a capsule collider capsule collider.

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,880
Okey dokey will alter that a little bit.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,500
Just make the radius a little bit thinner for me.

43
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,510
Probably what's at Point Three ish will increase the height up in the air a bit and I will.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,650
Sorry that was increase on the y axis and now I'm going to increase the height to about one point seven

45
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,290
six doesn't need to be perfect just needs to be.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,420
So it looks pretty good.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,970
Okay.

48
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,470
There we go.

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,940
And you know it just to be super thorough.

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,610
I'm going to delete the C or delete.

51
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm going to paint over the texture that I've got from my little note saying here's where the cinematic

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,410
takes place.

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,870
What next.

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,890
Well we need a script.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,100
So let's go and create ourselves a script folder right click Create folder that I will call cinematics

56
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,010
a Matt Dick's over there now.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,130
Right click Create C sharp script this C sharp script.

58
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,960
I will call cinematic trigger cinematic trigger.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,280
Okay.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,500
Step one I'm gonna get rid of start and update.

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,600
We won't need those.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,410
We'll wrap this in a namespace what should we call this namespace name space.

63
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:54,670
We'll call it RPG cinematics seems like a pretty good thing to call it and then curly braces at the

64
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,080
top curly braces down the bottom and then highlight an indent.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,930
Now we need to use a particular namespace.

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:08,440
We need to use so using Unity engine dot playable as playable as is where we'll find all the good things

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,570
related to our playable Director.

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,670
Where is it playable director just in here.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,520
Okay.

70
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,620
So in our class here we're going to on trigger into and then we need to get our playable directed component

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,300
and play it.

72
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:33,650
So get component Yep angle braces playable director parentheses dot and it's as simple as just saying

73
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,090
play that will play whatever playable director is associated with this game object.

74
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,120
Let's save that and see if it works.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,570
Just quickly before I look at that I'm just going to get rid of my trees over here they keep getting

76
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,690
in the way of my camera and frustrating me no end.

77
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,230
Okay cool.

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,310
Got rid of those.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,930
Now I know that there's a couple of issues of why this isn't going to happen first of all.

80
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,820
I remember if you click on intro sequence play on a wake is currently on so as as soon as we hit play

81
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,800
that would get that triggering our sequence which we don't want to do so turn off play on awake.

82
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,320
The next thing when we click on play you notice is an issue with our ray casting where we've got our

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,060
trigger volume.

84
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,380
If I click to try to run through it if I click there the player runs up and stops which doesn't quite

85
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,460
make sense does it.

86
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,840
So I'll try clicking again and he's saying I'm not sort of going through there at all.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,190
The problem is that our ray cast is not making it through this trigger volume there's an easy solution

88
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,070
to that which in our intro sequence up in the top right under layer.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,870
Currently it's on default to change that to ignore Ray cast which pretty self-explanatory means that

90
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,510
this game object will be ignoring the ray cast of the ray cast will be ignoring it.

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,010
We might want something a little bit more sophisticated later on but for now this will serve our purpose

92
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,300
of making sure we can trigger our cinematics properly so click on play.

93
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,930
Now I try to run through it but I run through it.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,830
Okay but it didn't trigger.

95
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,610
Why is that.

96
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,850
Well that's because as I sometimes do I've forgotten attach this script to my game object so cinematic

97
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,710
trigger needs to be over.

98
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,980
It's gonna roll up rigid body and animators and then I'll tell you us one surefire roll up box collider

99
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,820
then I can't see my box collider so I'm going to leave it expanded so I can see it.

100
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,840
Click on play.

101
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,700
We should be at a run through the trigger volume.

102
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,380
Yep that starts out sequence.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,080
Excellent.

104
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,460
Go through the cameras and then it should return back to the player.

105
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,310
Okay awesome.

106
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,400
We have a problem though.

107
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,740
If I run back again this way it triggers it all over again.

108
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,310
So that is something that I want asked to solve in a challenge.

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,410
Also it's probably not going to happen in this instance but if one of the gods came wandering through

110
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,540
there that would also trigger our cinematic moments so we don't want that to happen so I've got two

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,300
points of our challenge here for you is to improve our trigger.

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,690
First one is to make sure it's only triggered once and the second is to make sure that only the player

113
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,400
can trigger it.

114
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,830
And if you want some hints I'm going to give you some hints.

115
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,830
You don't need hints jumping to take that on now.

116
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,780
You want some hints.

117
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,710
Here they are hit number one.

118
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,530
Use a ball for the first part and hit number two.

119
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,240
Use a tag for the next part.

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,340
So they hint saving and figure out the logic to improve our trigger when you're done.

121
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,210
I'll see you back here.

122
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,160
Okay let's do this together.

123
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,290
Back over into our cinematic trigger.

124
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:27,130
I'm going to add a ball right at the top of our class ball and of course all ready triggered and we'll

125
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,890
initialize that at false now instead of just straight up playing We're gonna get ourselves an if statement

126
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,840
if what are we gonna do here.

127
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,200
Well if we haven't already played so if exclamation already triggered already triggered I should say

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,330
not already played and this is the part where we'll say make sure it's only the play and the way we

129
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,940
do that is by accessing the players tag.

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,730
Now just double check that when you click on your player the player is tagged as player.

131
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,900
If it's not this won't work.

132
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:06,230
So make sure is play tagged as player and then we can type in here are the DOT game object dot tag.

133
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,820
Equals equals what well equals player in our quotations.

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:19,450
So we haven't already triggered and it's the player then that's where we want to play our playable director.

135
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,060
And at the same time we are triggering this to play.

136
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,910
We also want to flick our ball so it goes from false to true.

137
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:35,240
So already triggered equals true save that up.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,960
Jump back over.

139
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,100
Now I'm not going to check that.

140
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,050
It's only the player that can trigger this.

141
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,150
I'm pretty sure we've got our code.

142
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,580
Good for them but I will check that we can only trigger at once.

143
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,530
We'll go through we do our cinematic sequence which for me is about eight seconds

144
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,180
and then we run through it a second time and nothing happens.

145
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,900
Awesome.

146
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,650
Great stuff.

147
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,430
And just a reminder.

148
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,020
Don't be like me where I keep forgetting to apply my changes back to my prefab on the player I've got

149
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,910
a few things that I have changed.

150
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,160
Apply all of those.

151
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,710
Or better still be working directly in your prefab so that you know those changes are applied immediately.

152
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,110
Now there's one other thing that I want to highlight.

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,420
We're not going to fix in this video but we're going to fix in.

154
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,390
Most likely the next video is that when we run through our trigger volume and we're in our cinematic

155
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,150
moment the player can still click in the world.

156
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,130
If you look over my scene view the character goes running off to go wherever you've just clicked.

157
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,100
In this scene.

158
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,970
So what we need to do is take away control during that cinematic moment and that's gonna be the topic

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,930
of the next video.
