00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,310
In this lecture we aren't going to be adding two things.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,800
One is automatic checkpoint thing when we go through a gate.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,720
So as I go through this gate and out the other side I have automatically saved in this location in the

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,130
new level.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,050
And this becomes obvious when I stop playing and start playing.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,760
You will see the other thing that we're gonna add which is loading up the last level that we were in.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,080
So it's automatic.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,150
Even though as in sandbox one it's automatically loaded up sandbox to because that is the last level

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,490
that was saved.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,540
That's what we're going to figure out how to do in this lecture.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,660
Let's dive in and see how so in order to be able to load the last scene we need to know a little bit

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,380
more of a piece of the API to the saving system namely this function here the load last seen function

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,220
which seems to be exactly what we need.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,090
Now it takes again the save file and its job is to load the last saved scene and then load the state

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,540
in that scene.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,300
So it does both loading the scene and loading the state into that scene and it returns an iron numerator

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,970
in exactly the same way as loading an async scene takes time.

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,320
Well loading the last scene.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,570
Does does that as part of its job.

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,850
So it takes time as well so we have to run it as a numerator.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,950
So the way we're going to do this is we're gonna call this in start and we're going to call this in

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,500
start from the saving ramp up.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,170
So let's have a go in our saving wrapper.

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,880
We are going to introduce a start method.

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,200
Now one thing you may not have known about Start methods is that actually they can be or they can return

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,020
I in numerator.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,590
And if you do this essentially start becomes its own code routine which is automatically started in

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,050
start kind of makes sense doesn't it.

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:58,880
So the iron numerator is what we need and what we can then do is with AG Get component saving system

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,600
we can call to the new API that we know about which is the load last seen.

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,760
So dot load last seen and we want to load from the defaults save file so figure out what was the last

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,810
scene that was saved into that save file and then we want to go ahead and yield return the result remember

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,760
that in an iron numerator you can yield return another iron numerator and that basically waits for that

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,540
co routine.

36
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,960
So what we're going to end up doing here is on start it's immediately going to try and load up the last

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,080
scene and basically wait until that's done and obviously will end up in a new scene.

38
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,860
So let's go over into unity and give this a shot.

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,060
So I'm going to hit play and let's see where it loads up.

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,980
I actually loaded us up in two scene two but then you saw that the last place that we were in scene

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,990
2 was actually at the exit portal because we saved just as we were exiting.

42
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,340
And that meant that we then got portal through into scene 1 which is all a bit confusing and a bit wrong.

43
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,390
That's not really how it should work now.

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,730
The way I would like it to work is that I go over into scene two and at this point I've loaded into

45
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,120
a new world use this as a checkpoint.

46
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:21,050
It saves here so that if I exit the game and come back to the game again it's going to reload me here

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,390
rather than going through reloading me into scene one then back in Scene 2 through the fact that I'm

48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,120
going through a portal change et cetera.

49
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,340
No.

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,510
It should just come straight to this point.

51
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:38,120
So for that we're going to have to make a modification to our portal class and just have a think about

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,400
it it's a mini challenge really for you to pause video and have a go and think where abouts are you

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,260
going to call an extra save in the seat this sequence of events in order for us to load directly into

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,440
that level and have checkpoints after we've gone through the portal pause video and have a go okay.

55
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,840
So hopefully you saw the behavior that we wanted from the beginning of the video and have been able

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
to replicate it.

57
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,360
If not then let's talk it through.

58
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,650
Basically what we want to have happened is we have loaded up the data so perhaps the health from our

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,140
player and then we are getting the other portal and updating the position of the player as well.

60
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,180
At that point is where we can then do a save before we fade in but we've got the position of the player

61
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,500
that we want to keep track of.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,140
And we've got all the other data from the load so we can go ahead and save again right after we have

63
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
loaded up the player.

64
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,470
It sounds a little bit wasteful and counter-intuitive but it's all right.

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,500
It's a good way of doing this I think is to checkpoint at this point.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,560
Once we have loaded up and gone through the portal.

67
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,100
So if we do that let's see how that actually goes and looks.

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,240
So first things first I'm gonna go and play it's going to be a bit weird and funky this time around

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,430
but we've gone through here gone through the portal it should have done a checkpoint thing save at this

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,040
point.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,970
So if I quit and open up this time I should go straight into sandbox 2 as we do.

72
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,150
Fantastic and it loads me up and in the right place basically where I left it.

73
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,610
Now we did see in that instance that it was a bit jarring it all happened very quickly and suddenly.

74
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:25,470
So what I would like to add to this is that in our saving wrapper after we have done our start and we

75
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,790
have done our load last scene I would like to add in a fade in basically so that we always start with

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,630
a fading.

77
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,370
And it hides any of that jarring jumping about from the initial scene load.

78
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,330
Now the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to go to the fader and create a new method in The Fader

79
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,490
that allows us to instantly switch the fader to faded out.

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,130
So then we can fade in.

81
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:00,730
So I'm gonna create a new public void because it does need to return a thing called fade out immediate

82
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,470
and it doesn't need to take any parameters.

83
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,050
OK.

84
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,840
Now in the body of Fader immediate all we have to do is set our canvas group Alpha equal to 1.

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,780
So it's not going to be transparent.

86
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,850
It's not gonna be visible through that alpha then using fade out immediate.

87
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,980
We can go over to our saving wrapper the first thing I'm gonna do in start is get a reference to the

88
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,240
theta so that we've got something to work with.

89
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,890
So we'll get the fader doing a find object of type as we've done in the porthole.

90
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,420
Again this isn't happening very often it's only happening the first time we start the game and then

91
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,470
using the fader we're going to instantly fade out so the fade out immediate so that it's all opaque

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,170
and then we're going to load up the last scene.

93
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,440
It's gonna be that twang that we saw as the camera adjusted and we're fighting in so we're gonna do

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:04,920
a yield return Fader top fading and we need a time for that so I'm going to make that a civilized field

95
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,320
configuration variable.

96
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:16,110
It's gonna be a float called the fade in time and I'm gonna set that to a very small point to a second

97
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,920
and that's going to be what goes into our fade in.

98
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,870
So let's see that in action.

99
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,270
So if we exit the game we should be loading back into our sandbox to when I hit play yes indeed we did

100
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,100
and it faded in as well.

101
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,230
So you gonna adjust the fade in time to your liking to try and cover up the camera trying.

102
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,190
I think it's better now.

103
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,140
I don't want to put too much fading in either cause is going to annoy me as I prototype but now you

104
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,780
can see that if I go back in sandbox one and hit play it's going to have remembered that the last scene

105
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,710
I was in was sandbox one and it remembered my position and everything.

106
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,360
And hopefully if I killed guards they'll remember that too they go we got that God who's still dead.

107
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,890
So it's remembering all the state automatically for me.

108
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,430
So I don't need to remember to hit save and hit load.

109
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,990
I can use that for debugging purposes now but automatically when I go between levels it has check point

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,920
in my progress and put it in the save file so when I come back I'm gonna go back to the last level I

111
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,970
was in great stuff.

112
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,050
So in this lecture we have seen how we can automatically load and save on check points and also load

113
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,050
up the last scene we were in and that basically wraps it up for the saving system.

114
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,180
So hopefully now you are confident with using that saving asset pack you can try bringing into any other

115
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,600
games that you have that you want to implement saving and it should be generic enough to use in anything.
