1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,570
So again in this video we're going to create ourselves a second weapon.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,220
Technically it's not a weapon it's the unarmed weapon as a scripted object and we need to rearrange

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,210
our scripts a little bit so that we have all of our relevant tweaking and tuning variables on our scriptural

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,950
object so that we can be easily updating our data for our various weapons if we want to change the damage

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,420
on sword we can do it there if we want to change the damage for an unarmed hit we can do it on unarmed

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,490
range et cetera.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,090
So let's jump in to get started.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,410
Let's continue with our scripted object by bringing the other things from house fire a script over you

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,610
can see that we don't have the damage and the range.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,860
I think it is let's look in our fighter script and say yeah we've got weapon range and weapon damage.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,700
Want to have all of these within my weapon scripts so we've got all the weapon things in one place.

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,870
And I also need a way for my fighter script to still be calling and getting that information.

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,390
So still be accessing range and damage so let's start off with a challenge voice should be reasonably

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,900
straightforward where I want you to move range and damage to the weapon class from the fighter class

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,970
and also to create to public getter methods.

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:16,100
Just very simple methods that return the value of damage and return the value of range and then to update

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,380
update fighter don't see us to call those public methods in the right place.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,980
So to make sure that we can still access range and damage from fighters so those who challenge champion

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,580
take that on I'll see you back here when you've given it your best shot OK.

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,360
First of all in fighter let's go and grab our weapon damage variable cut that out and then cut that

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,690
out too and then over to our weapon paste that in.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,300
Cut that out.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,890
You two seems to be what I say to my kids a lot of the time.

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,460
Cut that out.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,650
Stop fighting back ever in a fighter.

26
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,900
We find range cut that out then over two weapon and paste that in as well.

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,870
Now we need to make a couple of public get to methods pretty straightforward we have public and then

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,510
we're looking for a return type of what is weapon damage.

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:07,980
It's a float and we'll call this get damage parentheses curly braces and we will return in here.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,430
Weapon damage easy peasy.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,810
Now let's copy get damage because we're gonna make a very similar method for get range rename this from

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,420
get damaged to get range and from get a story from weapon damage to weapon range.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,650
Okay.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Clean my spaces up a little bit save.

35
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,960
And then over into fighter we need to find where we were using those we should have some red squiggly

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,620
lines somewhere.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,070
Okay.

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,750
Weapon damage.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,510
And within range these are no longer variables from within this class.

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,210
So we need to be accessing weapon Dot.

41
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,430
Get what's his damage.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,750
And then over and Burns's parentheses at the end and then weapon range you might get is in range method.

43
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,020
I will change this to weapon don't get range.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
Mark I say that I'm pretty straight forward.

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,400
Hopefully that has been straightforward for you.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,680
Back over into unity let's see what's going on.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,600
When I click on play K you can see the sword has been updated.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,130
We now have damage and range.

49
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,610
Let's run run run over.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,730
There'll be a problem but that's cool.

51
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,030
Problems are things we can fix the problem is that our enemies aren't really really doing much anymore.

52
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,130
That's because we've broken them.

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,870
They have an unarmed but we're not really set up for an in a very clever way.

54
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,170
Hey while I'm here I'm just gonna change damage on sword.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,750
All right tend to a bit more than it was and give ourselves a mechanism for creating an unarmed weapon

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,730
while an unarmed weapon is not really a weapon is it.

57
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,490
But we'll create a script rebel object so that we can change things like the damage and the if we do

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,150
wish to override the current default animations and the range and so on.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,320
So new folder within our weapons folder create folder.

60
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,160
We'll call this an armed and unarmed right click Create weapons.

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,690
We've got our contextual make new weapon script table object.

62
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,240
This will be an armed an armed weapon damage.

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,740
We'll make this.

64
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
3 just to make sure it's a little bit different.

65
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,170
One is fine.

66
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,930
Weapon prefab.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,120
We don't have a weapon prefab an animator overall.

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,350
We don't wanna override the animator but what we do want to do is to jump over into our weapon class

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:23,370
and just to make sure that when we instantiate and when we're doing our override that we're not getting

70
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,210
into trouble if we have any no situations.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,240
So what I mean by that null situation is that the terminology right in if weapon prefab does not equal

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,990
now.

73
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,820
Then we want to instantiate I'm going gonna come back to weapon prefab in a moment not happy with that

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,340
naming it loops then we want to instantiate the weapon.

75
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,960
If we have a weapon is what we're saying.

76
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,700
If there is no weapon then don't go ahead and try to create a weapon.

77
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,500
Pretty easy just protecting against that.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,740
No scenario.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,500
Nelson area.

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,420
I think that might be better.

81
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,040
Okay if animator override does not equal now.

82
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,470
Same deal put out rack.

83
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,490
Now statement in our curly braces hey presto.

84
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,780
Okay.

85
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,600
With prefab I mentioned I'm not happy about that.

86
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,270
So let's rename this from weapon prefab to we'll just call this equipped prefab which is really what

87
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,180
we're saying here.

88
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,810
If you don't have a prefab equipped then don't try to instantiate that equipped prefab and it may be

89
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,700
a weapon or it might be something else.

90
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,710
Just trying to map out terminology so it's really clear we're talking about what you have equipped here.

91
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,280
K we'll save that and then a couple of things we'll need to tidy up.

92
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,680
We would need to find our player make sure that our player still has what the player needs to have on

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,210
the player does the player have a sword.

94
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,700
Yes the play does cool and then our enemies are going to give the enemies an unarmed weapon as we've

95
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,360
created here.

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
So let's go and find our enemy's enemy enemy.

97
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,900
I won't go into the enemy prefab and then over where we have weapon I will click on the selector This

98
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,630
is in the fighter scripts weapon we will provide that unharmed which is excellent and what we he will

99
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,500
also give it a hand transform because technically it's not a weapon but you still are punching with

100
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,920
your hand.

101
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,990
So if we want to have any hit effects we want to do that when we're punching so scroll down find right

102
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,530
hand and under right hand click on that backup to the enemy level.

103
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,210
And now I can drag the right hand into the hand transform.

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,980
There we go.

105
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,040
Exit back out of enemy just click that check that all that enemies do have that behavior.

106
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,750
Yes unarmed and right hand click on play now what we want to see when we run over there is the player

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,470
has the big old sword which the player doesn't.

108
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,550
We've broken something there.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
Let's have a look and see what we've broken with the player's weapon.

110
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:47,320
I think it might be because of my rename over here of equipped prefab so we'll click on our swords scripted

111
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,750
all object fun sword in here yet you can see a quick prefab has disappeared so click my selector and

112
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,590
search for equip sword so equip sword goes into a quick prefab Yeah but a naming there I think.

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Click on play make sure the player's got his sword.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,630
Oh soon I'm going to have to implement the player's secret weapon.

115
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,910
I'll tell you about that when we get to it a little bit of suspense.

116
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,000
What's the secret weapon.

117
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,360
And they're punching as they should do and he's got his sword as he should do and it's just check that

118
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,060
the players damage health is going down whereas his health before he dies healthy is going down.

119
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,460
Yep it's going down as they punch him.

120
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,850
Excellent.

121
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay so now we've got an unarmed weapon we could equip that the player as well if we wanted it contained

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,280
within our scripted object and we have gotten rid of our errors that we've had there before.

123
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,680
So thanks for your patience with patients with those errors.

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,490
I know it's taken a while.

125
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,230
Great stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
