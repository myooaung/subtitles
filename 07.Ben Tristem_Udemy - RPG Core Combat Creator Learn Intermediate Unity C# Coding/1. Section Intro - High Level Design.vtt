00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello and welcome to the next section of the course in this section we're focusing on game design.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.190
We're going to look at your game design document.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.700
We're going to look at what makes your game stand apart from other games.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
So you might already have a really good vision of this in your mind and you've been thinking for a long

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.080
time.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.730
This is the game that I really want to make.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.840
That's great.

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.160
You might be coming from the position of oh I don't know I haven't really thought about it.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.720
That's cool as well.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.250
This section is all about putting into it as much time and effort as you want take out of it as much

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.940
as you want.

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.320
And if you really just sort of you know checking it out a little bit and seeing what's going on not

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.440
a problem go through it at your own pace but it is a really great opportunity to get some early thinking

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.400
not to have your game design completely.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.230
We can't do the whole thing in one go but just to have that early thinking about what is your game about.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.460
There'll be other sections throughout the course where we talk about game design some more more into

17
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.810
the details of the game design.

18
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.350
But this is a good high level game design conversation.

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.350
We're also going to be talking a little bit about art design and art direction.

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
So generally what's your game about is what this section is about so let's jump in and get started.
