00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.140
Hello and welcome back my friend in this video we are going to be adding damage so that when we shoot

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.650
our enemies it does more than just kind of jiggle around and sit there.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.070
We'll be destroying the arrow we'll be doing damage will be hurting our enemies.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.600
Just a reminder we haven't implemented a bunch of stuff yet like we haven't implemented the weapons

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.670
within the saving system so if you try to go to a different scene with a weapon it's not going to continue.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.590
So still lots for us to do but we're making fantastic progress.

7
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.260
And the way we're going to structure this is here's my dude shooting his arrow.

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.510
We're going to have the damage amount being provided by the weapon in this case the bow and then it's

9
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.190
calculated when it's launch.

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.320
So when the projectile is launched and instantiated and pushed off towards the enemy we're going to

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.440
say at that point the amount of damage you will do is for example 10 and then the damage is actually

12
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.720
dealt when the arrow collides with the enemy or with the target.

13
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.040
And we've done it this way so that we can have all of our weapons are responsible for the damage that

14
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.500
a sword is responsible for damage and we can have ask repeatable objects cited sources say 10 damage

15
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.860
and the bow is a 10 damage.

16
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.310
If you don't have a bow plus five it might be 15 damage rather than having to mess around with putting

17
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.440
the damage onto the arrow and to say well this bow needs to shoot that particular arrow and it's a better

18
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.530
bow so let's shoot a better arrow.

19
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.440
Let's put all of the damage calculation onto the bow but side note if you wanted to yourself and you're

20
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.950
going make a flaming arrow then a flaming arrow could add more damage to whatever the bow is passing

21
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.100
on.

22
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.230
So there is the structure there if you want to do that within your game.

23
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.120
But we're having the weapon be the ultimate authority for the damage.

24
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.570
So let's fire up our Projectile class.

25
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.820
We need to give ourselves a notion of damage that's going to remove that line before health and create

26
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.850
a new float variable which I will call damage and this will be zero because it's not providing any damage

27
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.600
at this point for our game.

28
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.850
We want to be passing the damage in from our weapon when we call.

29
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.820
What are we going to call in here when we call set target.

30
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.040
So let us find data to set target health target in addition to that.

31
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.810
So come out.

32
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.190
We also want an argument of float or type float which we will call damage.

33
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.550
So in other words when you calls it target you need to tell us the damage as well as we did before.

34
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.270
Let us set the damage that will be on the projectile once it's instantiated this dot damage equals the

35
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.530
damage that we've just passed in from calling set target.

36
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.470
OK.

37
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.270
We'll save that.

38
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.630
Now over two weapon find our set target for me.

39
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.300
It's on line 45.

40
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.900
So it's within.

41
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.190
Launch projectile.

42
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.330
We're passing in target comma.

43
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880
Now if memory serves I scroll up weapon damage is what we've called it here it's not just damage could

44
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440
probably be just damage but it's called weapon damage at this point.

45
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.600
So we will pass in.

46
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.400
Weapon damage.

47
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.950
Now back over to projectile what we need to do within here.

48
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.040
Just gonna put it down the bottom is we need a mechanism for saying what happens when me the projectile

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.440
the arrow in our case collides with something.

50
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
So what happens when I crash into an enemy that's gonna be the challenge for you.

51
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.340
So apply damage from projectile.

52
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.270
First of all add on trigger enter to the projectile just in the place that I started writing down here

53
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.300
and check it that we collided with our target.

54
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.270
So do a check to see is this the target we collided with.

55
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.220
If not we want to return.

56
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.120
And just a hint remember that the target is of type health.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.060
So we can use that when we're doing our comparison and then we coul take damage passing in the relevant

58
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.270
things hint hint.

59
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.900
And after that we destroy the projectile.

60
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.740
So that is not sitting around in the scene.

61
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.860
And just a reminder if you look at this you know I'm not sure what to do.

62
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.280
And you want to follow along with me.

63
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.120
That's totally cool.

64
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.670
But any moment you think oh I know that particular part of this pose a video and do that particular

65
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.670
part of the challenge so that you're practicing and you're flexing those muscles even if you can't do

66
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.320
the whole challenge doing part of the challenge is totally okay.

67
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.640
So do your best take on the challenge and then we'll go through it together in a moment radio so on

68
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.270
trigger enter to start what we're doing here and you can see it's added collider other as information

69
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.310
that we're gonna be accessing so we will start with if we want to be looking at our other objective

70
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.660
here.

71
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.510
So if other dot get health so I get component I was going to ask you what component should we give it.

72
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.190
I'm kind of giving you the answer I haven't I get component health is not equal to what he is a chance

73
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.730
to.

74
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.730
Little mini challenge if he didn't do the challenge yourself.

75
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.810
If it's not equal to target then we return.

76
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.180
We get the heck out of here.

77
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.120
Why does this work.

78
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.850
Well Target is of type health.

79
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.110
So when we are looking at our other.

80
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.510
The thing that we've collided with getting the health component and comparing it to target which is

81
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.650
of type health we can do a direct comparison between the two and say Are they the same.

82
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.110
If they're not then return next line.

83
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.180
We want our target to be taking damage so target don't take damage.

84
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.360
And how much damage should we be doing well damage that is going to be our instance damage the very

85
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.040
top damage that starts off at zero.

86
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.550
But then we pass in the amount of damage when we create this projectile and send it on its way.

87
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.650
And then finally destroy.

88
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.150
And if you didn't do any of the challenge here's the easy one that you can do.

89
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.420
What do we destroy we destroy game object some others destroy me the arrow that has been shot.

90
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.130
OK we'll save that.

91
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.300
Back over into unity one more step that I didn't mention.

92
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.050
But let's do this together is to find our projectiles jump into the arrow projectile.

93
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.140
And what do we need to add to the Arrow projectile.

94
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.700
We need to add a collider.

95
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.540
Okay.

96
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.610
Oh you know what Sam was mentioning I had a wonky Arrow said Brooke you've got a bent arrow and I thought

97
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.130
he was just being a little bit crude just between you and me.

98
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.960
But know I see what you meant Sam.

99
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.330
Okay.

100
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.510
I do have a wonky arrow in here and it's probably because I've got this weird rotation sorry should

101
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.150
be negative 270.

102
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.700
No idea why it is not.

103
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.790
My apologies if you've been yelling at Rick's wonky Ahu on the screen now I'm gonna go back up to the

104
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:26.200
parent level on Arrow projectile add component box collider and it comes in pretty massive so we'll

105
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:36.250
make it a bit more tightly fitting on to the arrow so just changing the size and change the positioning

106
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.570
a little bit.

107
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.540
I'd like to have a little bit of the arrow poking out at the end so that the arrow pierces the heart

108
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.790
of our foes a little bit before we trigger all of the all of the damage and having it destroy all that

109
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.660
looks pretty good.

110
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.800
So reasonably fat kind of collider but that's good make sure we might miss give ourselves a bit of an

111
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.610
advantage although the enemies are shooting the same arrow so I guess they get an advantage as well.

112
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.660
Now let's see the plan needs to be holding the bow.

113
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.980
Yes default weapon I have the bow equipped the bow.

114
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.500
Let's have a look at that make sure we've got that covered bow scripted all object.

115
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.250
Weapon damage 10 so that's what we'll be doing each time we shoot yes and then the weapon range can

116
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.890
I'll leave that as is or I'm close enough to see and you know it just to be a little bit crazy I'm gonna

117
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.840
give one of my enemies and bow as well.

118
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.150
Crazy Rick.

119
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.570
Okay.

120
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.860
Which enemy do we want to look for enemy.

121
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.880
Boop boop boop.

122
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.090
Enemy this guy at the front.

123
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.110
What number you enemy seven for me and default weapon.

124
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.420
We will give you a bow okay.

125
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.570
He's not gonna behave as we expect just yet because we haven't implemented all of his logic we haven't

126
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.830
given him a different kind of chase radius and all that kind of stuff for the bow but for now it's not

127
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.500
too bad.

128
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.150
Wherever he will shoot this dude this dude is enemy fire.

129
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.480
For me we'll look at his health at the moment it's 40.

130
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.220
I just remembered something that I did wrong again.

131
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.340
We'll fix that in a moment first I'll show you the problem is happening here fizzles too slow.

132
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.360
We need to speed that up but health's not going down the arrow is not going away.

133
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.880
What has Rick done.

134
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:05.830
I did this deliberately so that you could learn the lesson of this stupid mistake that I make over and

135
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.580
over.

136
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.990
Actually that's a lie I just forgot.

137
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:15.640
Yet again I forgot to do what I forgot to click on my projectile on my box collider is trigger on a

138
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.580
little note I need a tattoo on my inside of my eyelids always quick is trigger Rick.

139
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.770
Once you have drama.

140
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:22.860
Okay.

141
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:28.100
And while we're on our own projectile change of speed to 10 cells not quite so slow motion back over

142
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.410
into our game.

143
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:29.920
Well done.

144
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.950
If you saw that when I was doing it.

145
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.980
You like Rick you've missed his trigger and you clicked on his trigger because you know these things.

146
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.360
A wise one and bounce and then yes.

147
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.160
Looks like it's being disappearing the arrow.

148
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.080
His health is going down he's gone.

149
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.340
This guy can he should hit me.

150
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.450
Yes he can.

151
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.750
But problem with him is when I woke up in here he's like Nope not chasing you anymore.

152
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.260
So we would need to play around with his chase radius.

153
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.170
It's really just some tuning we can do for him to make him more more clever.

154
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.450
But you can see we've got a general issue with our enemies.

155
00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.850
They need to chase you when you're shooting them.

156
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.480
They can't just stand there and be like yeah nothing to see but we've got our arrows and we're shooting

157
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.000
and we're doing damage and the arrows are disappearing so this is huge progress progress super excited.

158
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.810
This is making our game feel you know what feel pretty cool I reckon so.

159
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.090
Great work in this video and I'll see you again real soon.
