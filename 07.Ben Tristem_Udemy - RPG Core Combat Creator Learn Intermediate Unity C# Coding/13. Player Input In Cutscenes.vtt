Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.700
In this lecture we are going to be disabling the action that the player was doing when they will enter

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.200
the cinematics trigger volume and also removing controls no matter how much I'm clicking around the

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.300
world here.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.630
We are not able to move the player an inch but when the cinematic is finished we are back in control

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.760
and we can go and try and attack these guards and beat them up and play the game play our moment.

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.560
Let's dive in and see how it's done so we're able to get the right log messages.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.530
But this isn't disabling control we do actually want to do that.

9
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.740
But before we dive into disabling control I want to show you a little problem that even if I wasn't

10
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.740
controlling so let me just not select the follow camera if I just click on this guard I'm now not clicking

11
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.450
anything.

12
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.150
Okay.

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.640
And watch what happens.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.290
I'm not giving it any control inputs so it wouldn't matter if we disabled control but I went up to the

15
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.880
guard and killed them because that was the last last action I had given.

16
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.210
So what we actually want to do is we've got our action scheduled.

17
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.370
It's got a cancel current action we want to call cancel current action when we enter this trigger volume

18
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.610
whatever we were trying to do before whether we're trying to attack a guard and kill it.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.580
That should now stop because we've entered this trigger volume.

20
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.890
So how do we do that.

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.710
Well first of all we want to get hold of our play can play itself the player game object so to do that

22
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.780
we're going to use game object dots find with Tag and we're looking for the player tag.

23
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:50.560
OK I'm going to store that into a game object called player and then on the new line we can get hold

24
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.020
of the players get components of type action scheduler for that I'm going to have to include using RPG

25
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.830
core and look for the action scheduler and do a cancel current action.

26
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.360
Now what would happen if we go and play now.

27
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.080
In fact let's give it a go.

28
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.180
So you believe me if I click play and I click on the guard we are still going to run up to the guard

29
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
but notice we're not trying to attack him we're just running to that location so to some extent the

30
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.110
council worked it worked in some sense that it cancelled the fact that we're trying to attack the guard.

31
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.560
But what it didn't do is cancel the movement that we had started.

32
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.450
So if you have a look at the fighter the way we do this is that if we're not in range we tell the mover

33
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.080
to move to this target position but at no point do we stop that while we stop that once we get in range.

34
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.530
But if we don't get in range.

35
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.340
When do we stop it.

36
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.420
We don't.

37
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.030
If we cancel the attack half way we never stop it.

38
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270
We just remove the target.

39
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.880
So the way to do this would be to when we cancel a fighter we also cancel anything that was going on

40
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.660
in the move up so that that can't that kind of thing can't happen.

41
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.520
This is basically a bug that we didn't have we didn't have exhibited because anything that could cancel

42
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.140
the fighter was the mover and the mover would then subsequently go on to tell it to moved somewhere

43
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.360
else but here where we've got nothing else for it to do it we need to be able to cancel they go.

44
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.790
You saw it happen he actually stopped in this place it in his place when he entered the trigger volume.

45
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.440
He stopped moving instantly.

46
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.610
So that's what we want.

47
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.900
And let's just check it one more time with if we were just moving to another location so if I'm just

48
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.460
moving to this pace past the trees I stop I go in to the transition of the cinematic.

49
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.000
So that's working except that now I do still have the problem that if I walk into there it stops but

50
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.210
if I click somewhere I'm still in control.

51
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.120
So we want to be able to disable control and I think with the structure we've got in place here you

52
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.060
should be able to find that pretty easily done.

53
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.730
So oh no you don't we don't want them to go off and stop playing while we're doing a cinematic stop

54
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.460
the player from being able to control.

55
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.650
I think the best way to do this is to disable the component the player controller component.

56
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.820
Now see if you can find maybe a little bit of googling is required to do this but see if you can find

57
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.650
how you can disable a component is a generic thing not something that you have to do specifically or

58
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.420
change anything in the player controller code.

59
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.710
That's the nice thing about this to stop the player from controlling and then re enable control at the

60
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.730
end of the cinematic poser video and have a go.

61
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.010
OK.

62
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.550
Welcome back.

63
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.680
So let's see if you figure this one out.

64
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.330
So first things first we're going to have to use the player game object to get component and we're getting

65
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.950
the component of type player controller.

66
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.190
Now this one's not here.

67
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.640
So we're gonna have to include a name space for control and then we are going to call dot enable which

68
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.650
is a property on any components and we can just set that to false.

69
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.520
Hopefully you found that in your googling your research or you just remembered okay.

70
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.900
And then we want to re enable in and enable control method so set enable control to true in here.

71
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.750
Now the player isn't accessible.

72
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.590
I'm actually going to move this up to the class level so I'm gonna cut and paste the find the game object

73
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.060
find into start and I'm going to make game object player.

74
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.440
Can I make that there.

75
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.900
There are handy helpful hints.

76
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.330
Allows me to bring this up to the level.

77
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.470
No there isn't.

78
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.290
So I had to copy this.

79
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.430
I'm going to make it a private variable of the cinematic control remover.

80
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.580
Just collect cash.

81
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.170
The player and I'm going to update that and start to be the player and then we can use it in both of

82
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.960
these methods so hopefully that should do the trick.

83
00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.650
Let's see.

84
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.730
So I'm going to walk over the bridge that stops and then I'm going to click somewhere in the world and

85
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.230
hopefully that's having no effect.

86
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.670
Yes indeed.

87
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.020
I go to the scene I can see my player is no longer being moved by that.

88
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.540
So however I can then get control again when the cinematic has finished.

89
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.770
So that's all wonk working hunky dory exactly how we would like it to work.

90
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.380
We've enabled or enabled disabling of player control.

91
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.330
Now that was the last piece of the puzzle to getting our cinematic moment set up and I think you'll

92
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.370
agree that it now feels quite nice and you can obviously go ahead and make it feel even more polished

93
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.180
than this.

94
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.240
Spend more time on it and your own bits and pieces in fact I would very much like to see what your cinematic

95
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.200
moment ends up looking like and how the moment as a whole plays all of this bit where you are then having

96
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.370
to go through the level and beat up the guards do record a video of this and post it against the forum

97
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.450
topic for this lecture.

98
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.430
I look forward to seeing them.
