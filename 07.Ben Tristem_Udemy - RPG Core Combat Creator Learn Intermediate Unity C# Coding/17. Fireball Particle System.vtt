00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.470
In this video we're gonna make our fireball look more like a viable.

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.000
There it is.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.160
So let's jump in and make some fireballs.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.630
The first thing I wanna do is go to the asset store and grab some particles and once again I'm using

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.790
the assets from our good friends at Sinti.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.440
They've made a simple F X cartoon particles.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.140
You can search for simple F X click on that that will take you to a very cool very blocky voxel looking

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.390
particle system which is the style I'm going for in my game you might want something different but this

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.010
is one I'll be using import that you have to download at first if you haven't already I've already downloaded

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.670
it import that into your project should be pretty quick and like I say if you want to go for different

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.990
style absolutely we don't need a lot of particles for this exercise just something that can look fire

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.250
bullish.

13
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.400
Now that has landed inside our assets I'm going to drag that just underneath asset pack so it's in the

14
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.700
same spot that our other assets are.

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.300
Now we need to find out projectile double click on the fireball projectile at the moment it looks like

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.340
an arrow which is not what we want.

17
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.650
We want to grab the arrow and delete it and the trail and delete that as well.

18
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.400
I'm gonna be doing two parts to this projectile one would be the fireball head and the other part will

19
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.000
be the fireball trail and each of these offer us some ways of learning different things about the particle

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.450
system.

21
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.270
I'm going to assume that you've seen Unity's particle system before.

22
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.790
If you haven't you might want to check out one of our introductory courses the unity to D or Unity 3D

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.280
course but if you haven't seen anything at all it's cool you can follow along with what I'm doing here

24
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.520
it should mostly make sense gonna my fireball projectile right click and let's see effects.

25
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.540
Particle system.

26
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.310
I'll rename this particle system to fireball head.

27
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.540
Okay now we're going to do a couple of things you can see it starts off with our just standard default

28
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.730
white blobs just blobs is that they are white ball things firing into the wherever.

29
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.070
I'm going to change a couple of things first of all what I wanna do is just have one single particle

30
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.930
that spins around this will with a new concept rather than just having this emitter with a whole bunch

31
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.580
of particles making this kind of wave of things going on you're going to have one particle so click

32
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.690
on emission right.

33
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.660
Over time we'll make that zero and under bursts click the plus we have a count of 1 so a burst when

34
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.560
there's one thing that comes out and this There Goes The one thing because we've got a duration of five

35
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.690
seconds on our particle system and a lifetime of five seconds every five seconds.

36
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.960
We're going to get a new particle that lasts for five seconds.

37
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.700
We don't want it to be flying through the air so I'm going to find the start speed or is it his start

38
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.150
speed and put that to zero.

39
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.050
Now just sitting right there it's not sitting exactly on our origin point because we have a shape.

40
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.010
I'm just going to turn off the shape so it's going to be right smack bang in the middle.

41
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.680
Now we want it to look a little bit different.

42
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.990
So going down to renderer click on renderer and instead of render mode being billboard I want to change

43
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.430
this to being mesh.

44
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.730
That means we can put in some sort of structure some sort of game mesh in there and the mesh I'm going

45
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.100
to choose will be click on my little selected here I'm going to search for gun and find the S A if X

46
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.530
gun flash that will click on that.

47
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.480
And that brings in that object that's going to kind of be a chunky fireball head I think.

48
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.180
Looks okay.

49
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
You can use whatever you want here you could use it a sphere that it could be as simple just putting

50
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.850
in a little orb in there and it would do the job just fine.

51
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.910
If you don't have this asset pack in particular.

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.600
Now I need to change the render alignment because at the moment when I turn around I'm not actually

53
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.520
seeing the back of it.

54
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.500
So change your render alignment to local.

55
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.950
Now I can see it from side on I can see that my Z axis forward is that way and I want that my head to

56
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.640
be moving that way.

57
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.010
I'm going to go all the way up to the top and change the rotation to 180 basically to turn it around

58
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.860
the other way.

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.260
That's exactly what I wanted.

60
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.740
Back down to renderer again.

61
00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.250
Let's give it a slightly nicer look and to do that click on material just the selector again such for

62
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.420
gun flash.

63
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.360
Double click on that.

64
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.920
And now we see we've got this orange kind of thing that suddenly looks like a fireball.

65
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.750
Now we want this to be doing something wanted to be kind of spinning around so I'm going to find rotation

66
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.000
over a lifetime and click on that to select it and then click to open it up and it changes to 500.

67
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.140
So it's kind of spinning around you know doing fireball kind of stuff as it flows to the room like that.

68
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.730
I think that looks pretty cool.

69
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.430
And then what else do we want to do in here.

70
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.510
Let's see simulation space local yet stock color.

71
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.830
This all looks pretty good for now.

72
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.100
Okay.

73
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.620
So we've got a head for our object.

74
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.500
Now we need to put in a trail.

75
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.790
Let's go into our simple effects.

76
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.810
Particles in here find the prefabs look for.

77
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.320
There's going to be what did a flamethrower grab the flamethrower drag it.

78
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.790
So it's a child to the Fireball projectile in his scrawl out a little bit to see what's going on here.

79
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.700
That looks pretty cool right.

80
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.240
That looks kind of like burn fireball ish.

81
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.540
We need to make a couple of tweaks and changes.

82
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.670
So while clicking it on click Play Now we don't want this to be kind of flame throwing out fire.

83
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.190
We want it to be as we move along.

84
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.560
But remember that's when the particles are emitted so I'm gonna change a couple of things here.

85
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.290
This all will change the size and stuff to start lifetime.

86
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.370
I'll make point three some smaller and the start speed.

87
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.180
I'm gonna change down a point one and now instead of having right over time.

88
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.250
But but but but but because then if it goes really fast we get this weird kind of blobby effect if it

89
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.420
goes really slow it looks quite tight and instead of right.

90
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.820
Over time I'm gonna go and find down here.

91
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.060
Let's see emission put right over time to zero and right over distance I'm going to make say 20.

92
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.870
So then it's emitting based upon how far we've travelled.

93
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.490
So if we travel a short distance not much coming out have a long way then lots comes out.

94
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.240
So that will allow us to change the speed of the fireball and still have a nice consistent emission

95
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.220
going on there.

96
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.950
What else do we need.

97
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.880
Shape.

98
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.200
We can leave that as a sphere.

99
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.340
That's fine.

100
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.400
So currently velocity of a lifetime and limit velocity of a lifetime.

101
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.480
I don't believe we need velocity of a lifetime controls velocity of each particle during its lifetime

102
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.760
and to turn that off.

103
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.410
But I'm going to leave the limit velocity over lifetime which controls the velocity limit and damping

104
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.290
of each particle during its lifetime.

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.910
So puts a little bit of dampening on it which is another way of saying things aren't going to move faster

106
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.800
than we want them to move.

107
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.400
If these things flying through the air we're not gonna get any we'd kind of behavior with things being

108
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.130
trying to be pushed around too quickly.

109
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.570
So we just leave the limit velocity of a lifetime on color over lifetime leave that on size over a lifetime.

110
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.810
Yet all these things look pretty good rotation rotation speed Great.

111
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.410
Okay now let's have a look at the size of things you've got the fireball ahead.

112
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.700
Yep we've got the flame thrower that looks like it's way too big.

113
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.680
So let's jump on up to the size font size.

114
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.700
Where are you.

115
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.650
It's not size instead of to make it point five.

116
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.930
See how it feels good to click on play read that's that size compared to the Fireball head.

117
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.000
It looks okay and move the fire flamethrower back a little bit so it's kind of starting a little bit

118
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.100
behind the fireball head.

119
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.470
Yeah.

120
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.380
Looking good.

121
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.210
I think and then whereas our volume make sure our volume is aligned properly it needs to be aligned.

122
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.540
I think just a little bit behind the front of the fireball head so just flatten it out a little bit

123
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.110
switch it up a little bit make it a bit wider so we've got a nice good hit volume.

124
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.040
Yeah that looks okay.

125
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.960
And then push it back.

126
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.560
There we go.

127
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.170
Okay now let's jump into the game and see how this actually works see if it works.

128
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.240
The player should have that all ready to go.

129
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:45.100
Should have been equipped already or run over pick up our flower thing shoot this guy.

130
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.720
Look at that fly through the air.

131
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.270
Okay.

132
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.020
That's pretty cool.

133
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.830
Little bit of tweaking we need to do.

134
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.140
But as I'm going to do my tweaking I'm going to give you a challenge which is to customize your fireball

135
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.110
you don't have to make it exactly the way I have.

136
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.170
Make a fireball make it look cool and then please share it.

137
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.250
A screenshot or a video.

138
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.960
I'm going to do a little bit more tweaking of mine so you can see what I do but please customize yours

139
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.060
make it yourself make an ice bowl it doesn't have to be a fireball make it a lot more red make the trail

140
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.640
longer add some smoke to it there's smoke in the Sinti pack so put your own flair to it and make it

141
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.040
look really rad so jump in take on that challenge I'm gonna finish my off and I will show you my final

142
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.640
values just very briefly when I'm done I've got the fireball here I made a tiny bit smaller two point

143
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:37.760
seven I sped up its rotation put it to 700 the flame thrower itself I didn't do a lot of start lifetime

144
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.090
point for start speed point two and start size point four okay and then all the other values should

145
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.560
be as they were before.

146
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.500
So there it is there's our flamethrower free projectile fireball thing that's the word I'm off the fireball

147
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.510
there's still a little bit of polish to make this moment really sing but pretty happy with this so great

148
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.070
work and I'll see you in the next video.
