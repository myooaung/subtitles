Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.790
In this lecture we are going to be revising setting UI values so that we can go and attack the God and

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.350
the value that appears above his head is actually the value that we set in the binding of that unity

4
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.860
event.

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.410
Let's dive in and see how to do it.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.350
So at the moment our damaged text is just displaying a default value that we set in the text component

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.100
itself.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.620
Obviously that's not really what we want.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.550
That's not what it's about.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.030
It's about displaying the actual damage amount which we have already passed in through the argument

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.360
to spawn.

12
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.530
Now unfortunately that's not working on two levels first of all the amount that's being passed into

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.320
spawn is not actually the right damage amount.

14
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.530
It's a fixed amount that we set up in our inspector in the House script we've fixed it to 13.

15
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.690
That's what we're going to deal with in the next lecture.

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.640
But in this lecture what I want to deal with is making sure that our text actually displays that amount

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.330
that we put in in this case the amount that we put in is 13.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.210
So the text should display 13.

19
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
Now you can take this whole lecture as a mini challenge now if you like because I think you are able

20
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.850
to do this.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.710
Basically you need to expose some way on this damaged text component of setting that text value.

22
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710
Now go ahead and do that if you feel confident.

23
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.130
Otherwise just wash through.

24
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.030
And that's what I'm gonna be doing this lecture.

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.660
So the first thing is going over to damage text and exposing some sort of function.

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.400
So we're going to do this by creating a public method.

27
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:50.820
It's going to be void and it's going to be called set value and it's going to take a float amount and

28
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.920
that's going to be what we're going to set it to now.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.660
How do we get hold of our tax component that we want to set things too.

30
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.820
Well I think the easiest way is just to use a serialized oil field for that.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.180
You can obviously do it in other ways too.

32
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.990
So we've got a serialized oil field that we're going to get a text object which is going to be our damage

33
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.720
text I'm going to call it and we're going to set the default value to nulls just so the C sharp compiler

34
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.460
does not complain.

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.550
So you can catch up with this bit by pause the video and just write this into the damaged text file

36
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.690
and then we're going to go over and make sure that's what first of all we need to make sure that we're

37
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.290
using the unity engine UI and then we can go and bind these things by going over to our prefab which

38
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.340
is in game damage text and now we want to go and bind that component so it's giving me an error at the

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.960
moment.

40
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.290
Have I saved the file now if not saved the file that I'll be white.

41
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.570
So if we go to our damaged text game objects and look for the damage text script now we can bind to

42
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.040
a component so we can just drag in this text object into our damage script so that it knows what it's

43
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
referring to and we've found that in the inspector which now means that when we get this set value coming

44
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:14.040
in we can do a damage text dot text and set that text value of the UI text to the float amount.

45
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.360
Now obviously the float Mount is a float.

46
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.450
So we need to convert that to a string and we might want to do stuff with decimal points as well.

47
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.710
So let's have a look at how we're doing things for example with the level display we've got string dot

48
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.760
format.

49
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.870
I'm just gonna use the string dot format.

50
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.280
Copy that over into our damaged text.

51
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.480
So we're gonna string dot format.

52
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.810
The amount that is passed in here to the damage text we want to display and semicolon at the end of

53
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.960
the line and we might need to include something for string yet we need to include the system using system.

54
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.540
Okay.

55
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.520
So that should allow us to set the value.

56
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.510
So the final thing is we need to call that function that we've just created.

57
00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.660
So just a second for you to catch up if you are still doing that here is the stuff on screen for you

58
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.080
to catch up with that value.

59
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.120
And then we're going over into damage tech spawner where we are going to do the instance dots and we're

60
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.440
going to set the value from the damage amount that is passed in here.

61
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.970
Okay.

62
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.780
So now the damage amount flows from this spawning function in to the instance that we've just spawned.

63
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.890
And that instance has a serialized field reference which it uses to set that text.

64
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.610
So let's give it a shot.

65
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.360
If I go ahead and hit play well I'm expecting to see now is that if I go and attack this God where he

66
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.280
attacks me then we see the text 13 which is indeed what we had set up in our binding for that damaged

67
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.060
text.

68
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.540
Great stuff.

69
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.620
So what we've done is we have exposed the setting of that text so we can set the correct value.

70
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.850
Now in the next lecture we are going to be looking at how we can bind unity events that actually have

71
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.070
some value in them so that the unity event can send a value to another function.

72
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.320
I'll see you in that lecture.
