00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.180
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.570
In this lecture we're gonna be doing a display for experience point so if I go ahead and bash this god

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.510
then when he dies our experience points go up.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.140
Fantastic.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.270
Let's dive in see how it's done.

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.140
So again this should be a pretty short lecture because we're doing something that we've done before

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.730
which is creating a display.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.380
It's very much the same as the health display we've done in the past.

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.780
So you're going to do this as a challenge.

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.630
So first of all you want to add to the HUD.

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.440
Basically some text for you to do the display.

12
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.970
Then you want to draw from the health display we've done before basically copying and pasting it and

13
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.730
using it adapting it for displaying experience points instead and test it out.

14
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.790
So pose video and have a go at this challenge okay.

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.640
Welcome back.

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.770
So we're gonna dive right on in and first of all we're gonna start with having a look at our health

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.930
display and reminding ourselves how it works.

18
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.370
So you can see on a wake.

19
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.430
It finds the health component by tag from the player.

20
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.050
We're going to want to change that over to the experience component instead and then update we update

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.220
the text as you can see here we're adding a percentage point we don't want to add a percentage point

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.910
to experience so that's going to change but otherwise quite simpler.

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.890
And we're going to call a different method here.

24
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.920
We're gonna have to introduce one for experience.

25
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.120
So we're gonna have to edit the experience class as well.

26
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.180
So but first of all I said we're going to make a change to the HUD so I'm going to go to the HUD prefab

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.320
and I'm going to duplicate health like basically our energy value label whatever it is let's just go

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.970
ahead and duplicate these two elements and then we're gonna go ahead and rename.

29
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.480
So first of all I'm going to rename the label to being the experience label and I'm going to relay pool

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.170
the value to the experience value so experience like so.

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.630
So that is good.

32
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.670
Needs to be moved down a notch.

33
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.330
Let's try.

34
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.550
I'm going to try and keep it in line using the shift key and just bring it down to be roughly right.

35
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.310
It doesn't have to be perfect.

36
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.940
I'm gonna change the text so the label instead saying enemy is just going to see say XP and you can

37
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.880
see why I'm using different labels now because it keeps these values aligned on the right.

38
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.170
And then the value.

39
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.010
Example value.

40
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.770
Let's just say something like 300 just to show that it's not going to be in percent.

41
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.400
So we know what that looks like.

42
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.070
But it is just an example value it's going to get changed by our component so I'm talking the components.

43
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.100
Let's go ahead and duplicate our health display in fact I'm gonna do that in the editor sometimes doing

44
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.200
file manipulation in the editor is better.

45
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.570
So control D will duplicate file even if you didn't know that it was going to be able to do that.

46
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.990
It's created a health display one I can go and edit health display one and I'm going to change it to

47
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.250
the experience display instead.

48
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.110
And let's also rename the class that we've got.

49
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.190
So pretty much gonna be the same now except that instead of the health component again you want the

50
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.480
experience components and we're going to call that variable the experience instead and then experience

51
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.790
is going to be set from getting the play with tagging and getting components of type experience.

52
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.510
So just substituting out the bits that aren't right and then we will go into wants to string formatting

53
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.760
here but instead of putting the percent less just remove the percent we still probably want to keep

54
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.670
no decimal places for the experience points and just in case.

55
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.220
And then we gonna want to do a method on experience so let's maybe let's just talk about what that method

56
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.960
should look like from the outside first.

57
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.870
So experience dots get points that's what I'm going to call it.

58
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.410
Whoops.

59
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.550
It's also completing for me.

60
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.350
Now it doesn't have get points I'll get points they go plural and it doesn't have it yet.

61
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.860
So let's see we can generate the methods and I am going to go over and have a look where it generated

62
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.910
it and generated it as internal rather than public and near the bottom so I'm going to move it up and

63
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.480
make it public but otherwise it got the type wrong as well.

64
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.610
It said it is gonna be a string.

65
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.540
So we want it to return float forget points.

66
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.660
And then that's basically what we're going to do we're just gonna return the number of experience points

67
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.090
very straightforward getter like so.

68
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.460
And is there anything else that needs to be done.

69
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.740
Just save experience display.

70
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:29.090
Go back over into the Ed. And I'm going to look at the experience value and expense value has got the

71
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.530
enemy health display on it.

72
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.520
We want to remove that and instead add on experience display like.

73
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.660
So now if we go ahead and hit play we did have 10 experience points at the end of last lecture and that

74
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.100
is indeed what's showing up my experience display so I can go on through and remember that the archer

75
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.380
this guy's alive for some reason don't know why he came back to life.

76
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.610
Maybe something had changed in his scripts anyway.

77
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.850
So I've got more experience you can see the experience went up I'm gonna go and kill this Archer over

78
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.370
here and he should give me 30 experience points or 20 experience points and you can see I'm levelling

79
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.870
up basically by killing these guys and I'm well I'm getting more experience points not quite leveling

80
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.900
up yet that he's going to be later on so we're going to do that in the coming lecture is how do we detect

81
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.370
or say I've got something experience points I should be a level three I should be a level five that's

82
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.970
gonna be the subject of the next lecture and I will see you there.
