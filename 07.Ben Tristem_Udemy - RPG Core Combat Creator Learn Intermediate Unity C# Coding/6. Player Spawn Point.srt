00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,340
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,300
In this lecture we're going to be positioning our character so that when he walks through a gate he

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,580
will be at the corresponding portal rather than the default spawn location.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,190
So let's dive in and see how that's done.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,060
So at the end of the last lecture we were able to print out scene loaded which meant that we know when

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,940
it is time to update our player's location but at present we are not able to do so.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:38,650
So if I load up the transition scene and go through the portal we end up not in the correct location

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,320
in fact where is it that we want to end up.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,410
We haven't really specified this.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,090
If I have my character here.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,220
That's obviously not the right choice.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,470
We want him to have it somewhere near the portal but not actually inside the portal otherwise he'll

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,940
teleport straight back.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:02,770
So we need to specify that location so I'm going to open up our portal prefab and I am going to create

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,810
a game object underneath this great big empty game object.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm going to call this the spawn point and the idea of the spawn point is that it's going to be separate

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,230
from the portal and not inside it so that we're not going to end up teleporting straight back so this

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,250
is our portal.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,740
This is the portal spawn point.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,970
Now it's hard to visualize at the moment the spawn point so I'm going to change the representation of

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,080
the game object you might not know you can do this but on the dropdown in the inspector next to this

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,200
little cube icon you can select a different type of icon you can select the capsule which tells you

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
that this is the spawn point.

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,060
I'm going to have this little diamond because it's just smaller and easier to see.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,930
And then when I've got the portal selected you can see that I could move this diamond wherever I like.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,480
Outside of that portal.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,800
So that's going to create as a spawn points.

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,700
And I'm gonna go and find the portal in the level and we can see that it's spawn point is not correctly

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,880
located outside of where we want to be.

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,190
So I'm gonna move that spawn point forward a little bit and they'll go if we walk into this capsule

31
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,220
into this collider we will be transported but when we come back we'll be just outside of the collider.

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,110
So that we could walk back in if we wanted to or go on with the rest of the level.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,120
So that's the idea and we're gonna have these spawn points I'm gonna have to update that spawn point

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,630
also in the other level.

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:35,910
So in seeing in just the sandbox scene and I go and find my portal zoom over to the portal.

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:44,860
We go and I've got to find the portals spawn point which is here get to move it out just in front of

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,740
the gates like so.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,750
Okay so that's that's the idea.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,440
Now we need to have a link to this in the script.

40
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,960
So we've call our portal script open here.

41
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,420
Just gonna close my sidebar down and what I'm gonna do is I'm adding another serialized field here which

42
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,720
is going to be of type transform and I'm just gonna call this the spawn point.

43
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,930
Like so obviously we're gonna have to set that over in our prefab.

44
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,010
So let's open up the portal prefab and I'm doing it directly on the prefab so don't forget to apply

45
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,210
any of this stuff and spawn point game object I can just drag into that transform.

46
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,270
So it's getting the transform component of that.

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,230
Game Object.

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,160
So when we move it in each scene it's going to be a different location.

49
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,440
So what we're going to want to do is instead of print scene loaded we are going to want to do two things.

50
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:44,380
Firstly we want to get hold of the other portal because when we enter the level we are a portal in that

51
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,430
level but there's also another portal in the level that's where we want to end up spawning too.

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,140
So for now I'm just going to create a empty function to do that and that's gonna be part of your challenge

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,760
to get that other portal.

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,620
And then we want to do is we want to update the player and we're going to be doing that with the result

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,190
of the other portal so we gonna use the other portal to update the player.

56
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,920
And again I'm going to generate an empty method for that.

57
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,090
So we'll update it from the other portal.

58
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,450
But you need to do some stuff to find the player and update it in the first place.

59
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,800
So that's the general crux of how this is going to work and I'm going to leave out to you in a chat

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,780
to move the player.

61
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,590
So you're going to find the portal that's the first method you going to fill out.

62
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,690
Remember that performance isn't too important.

63
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,000
We're doing this once when the scene loads not every frame.

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,630
So you might be able to use that to choose your methods for convenience rather than performance.

65
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,140
And don't forget that the current portal still exists.

66
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,280
So you don't want to return the current portal otherwise that's not going to work as it know going to

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,790
spawn in the right location and then you want to update the player.

68
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,900
So have a think about that.

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,610
How are you going to set the position and rotation from our portal.

70
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,890
Pause the video and have a go okay.

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,850
Welcome back.

72
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,090
So we're gonna give this a shot first of all getting the other portal.

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:08,180
Well I'm just going to do a find game objects or find objects of type in fact and we're going to want

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,280
to find them of type portal.

75
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,830
I'm doing this in the wrong method aren't I doing this in the update player I want to do this instead

76
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,520
in get other portal.

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,550
So this is going to return as a list of portals of which we can do a for each loop over.

78
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:30,850
So for each portal portal in portals and then how we're going to check where we are.

79
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:37,150
We don't want it to be this portal so I'm just gonna do a quick if portal equals this.

80
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,070
Then we're just going to continue.

81
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,280
Remember that just means we going to skip over the rest of the for loop and otherwise we are going to

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,120
return the current portal that is being examined because that is the other portal fairly straightforward.

83
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,520
And notice it's still giving me an error here because not all code pass return value as because if we

84
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,010
go through the hole for each loop and find no portals because there are no portals in the scene what

85
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,910
are we going to return.

86
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,030
Well I'm just going to return null because we couldn't find a portal now updating the player's location.

87
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,190
How are we going to achieve that.

88
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,540
Well first of all we need to get hold of the player and we've done this many times before.

89
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,870
We're going to call game object up find with Tag player and that's going to return as the game object

90
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,410
player.

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,620
Now we want to update this player's transform.

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,030
So I am going to do.

93
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:36,030
Player dot transform dot position is equal to the other portals dot spawn point dot position.

94
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,630
And similarly for rotation.

95
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,880
So just copy it over.

96
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,510
It's going to be the rotation.

97
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,670
So for both of these.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,180
Okay let's give that a shot.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Head over into the editor hit play and see if we can spawn into the right location.

100
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,300
So I'm going to go through the portal and seen the sandbox scene that takes me here.

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,550
That could have been just right by accident.

102
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,320
Let's go back through.

103
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,910
Nope.

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,220
That wasn't right by accident.

105
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,060
Here I am at the right spawn point when I go through so I'm noticing that the rotation of the spawn

106
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,610
point isn't quite correct.

107
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,630
I'm facing in the wrong direction not facing towards the world so let's quickly correct that this spawn

108
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,040
point.

109
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:22,250
I think the Z is the forward axis so we want to turn it round so it looks a little bit more like that

110
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,340
and Z is now pointing forward if I hit play.

111
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,380
Let's try one more time.

112
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,760
Yep sure enough I come back through I'm facing down the path ready for action.

113
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,640
So Sam from the future here to give you a little bit of an update if your player is not updating correctly

114
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,670
for whatever reason.

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,620
Sometimes this can be because you have multiple terrains in a scene.

116
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,680
Then the reason for this is actually because we are updating our player transform directly but there

117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,160
is also a nav mesh agent that is simultaneously trying to update the position and these two can sometimes

118
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,670
conflict and your character can end up in completely the wrong place.

119
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,350
So if this is happening to you there are two ways around it.

120
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:10,700
In both cases we're going to have to do a using Unity engine dot A.I. and then we are going to have

121
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:21,650
to use our players nav mesh agents so we can do play dot get component nav mesh agent and one way we

122
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,310
could do it.

123
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,830
Which is fairly simple is enabled equals false and then re enable the nav mesh agent just after you

124
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,050
have set the position and rotation.

125
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:39,080
That's one way another way which is a little bit nicer than doing this is just to tell the nav mesh

126
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,570
agent where you would like it to teleport to where you'd like it to warp to.

127
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,480
And there is a function called warp which does just this.

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,970
You give it the new position you want it to go to and it will automatically not conflict with the nav

129
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,890
mesh agent because you're telling it what to do.

130
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,030
So what we're going to do is warp to that position not set the position transform the rotation does

131
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,440
not conflict with the nav mesh agent so we can just go ahead and do something like that.

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,580
That's probably the simplest solution.

133
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,880
It's not going to be reflected in the future videos but if you go ahead and do this now then it's not

134
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,780
going to be a problem.

135
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,920
We do work around with the other solution later on though however.

136
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,760
So be aware of that.

137
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,150
Now of course this is all going to break down as soon as we have multiple portals in the level we're

138
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,810
heading to and that is going to be the case because in sandbox 2 less safe sandbox 1 and go over to

139
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:40,160
our portal and I'm going to create another portal over here between these two sets of gates and that's

140
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:51,710
in core just drag our portal and I'm going to re scale it and I'm going to move this spawn point and

141
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,560
finally just set the scene to load to be the scene index 0.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,680
So what's gonna happen now is that when we come into this scene which is going to be the portal that

143
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,750
we actually get moved to so I'm going to go over into the original sandbox then back and you see that

144
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,260
it's kind of not even sure where it took me.

145
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,520
Now the reason for that is actually pretty odd and it's something to do with the nav mesh agent.

146
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,440
And basically if you try and reposition right at the beginning of the scene with the nav mesh agents

147
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,500
enabled sometimes it doesn't work.

148
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,210
So I'm going to have our player have his nav mesh agent disabled by default.

149
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,840
Now remember that the nav mesh agent is enabled in health when you are alive.

150
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,690
So in the first update our character is going to have his nav mesh agent enabled anyway.

151
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,120
So I'm gonna go ahead and hit play and now hopefully what we should be able to see is if I go through

152
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,580
to the main scene and then back to the corridor then I get positioned at this gate but not at the other

153
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,750
gate.

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,340
What if I wanted to be positioned at the other gate.

155
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,080
Well then we are going to have to have some way to identify these two gates and that's going to be the

156
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,340
subject of the next lecture.
