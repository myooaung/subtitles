00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.570
OK in this video I'm going to share with you some tips and tricks and to get ourselves ready to start

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.540
manipulating our environment and placing everything in our scene so that we can create our moment.

3
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.870
So let's jump in and talk about some ways to be more effective in creating a moment before I start crafting

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.500
my moment.

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.960
I've got four things that I want to show you some tips and some just general techniques that I use when

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.650
I'm creating a new area like this the first one is purely cosmetic.

7
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.330
I get really annoyed looking at this default skybox so one of the first things I do in a project that

8
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.790
I've resisted doing all the way up until now but I can't resist any longer is going to the asset store

9
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.640
and finding a skybox.

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.230
I'm going to type in free as good box.

11
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.360
Totally up to you whether you want to do this or not.

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.970
But for me I'm just gonna grab this first one here looks fine looks fine because it's free thank you

13
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.530
to box phobic letting us use the skybox I'm going to find in here to input might need to download first

14
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.850
I've already downloaded this in the past I'm just going to import there's a few things in here I'm pretty

15
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.190
sure I don't need but I'm just gonna put it all any way because the assets look pretty similar to the

16
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.320
style I'm using and if I find I'm not using them then I'll just delete them from my project to tidy

17
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.570
up but I recommend you go find a skybox and then once you've grabbed on this is box phobic him is going

18
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.310
to put that into my assets pack's assets pack asset packs there we go Fox phobic open that up skybox

19
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.570
cube map and then under.

20
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.710
Let's see materials I believe scroll the way down the bottom you can see these skybox cube map just

21
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.770
grab that and drag it onto his guide box and now I've got some clouds and some blue sky OK just looks

22
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.570
a little bit different.

23
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.560
That's a quick one for us to do there do that if you like and if you want you can clean up all the things

24
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.820
in here that you don't need but like I said they are kind of similar to the type of game that we've

25
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.360
got so might keep them around.

26
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.700
Okay.

27
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
The next thing is a tip if you've got two monitors which I do at the moment I can have my my sketch

28
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.250
that I did over on my other monitor.

29
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.530
If you don't it's real pain flipping between the sketch and in back you've seen sketch and seen so what

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.740
you can do is put that sketch within your scene as a reference.

31
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.220
So what I'm going to do up here is right click Create three object quad and make this quad where is

32
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.400
it.

33
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.010
Inspector I'll make it just for now are 50 50 50 so it's not in huge.

34
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.290
I think we need it rectangular.

35
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.810
And where is it you might is.

36
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.290
There it is.

37
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.150
Batting court is just one face of a cube that I can see from one direction rotated around so I can see

38
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.930
it fine where I have saved my sketch.

39
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.620
If you created your sketch electronically or if you've taken a copy of it then you can grab it drag

40
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.210
it into your scene I'm just going to drag this straight into assets.

41
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.550
This high level here and in a moment I'll figure out where to put it came moment sketch.

42
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.710
Let's see where we're gonna put these things.

43
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.220
I think this is going to be with our scenes and in our sandbox.

44
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.610
Yeah that seems pretty good for now just in sandbox.

45
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.420
I'll probably delete this after I've got my scene looking pretty good so it's all just in here for a

46
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.710
short amount of time.

47
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.290
Now I'm going to do next is create a material so right click Create material this will give me a few

48
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.810
extra levers to pull so that I can more easily see my sketch moment.

49
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.420
I can't spell correctly sketch sketch as a material and in material here the under Alberto I'm going

50
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.690
to click and select my moment sketch double click on that has now applied this material.

51
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.910
Now I can drag this material onto my quad it looks pretty awful but I've got a few things I can change

52
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.010
here on my material instead of being a standard shader I'm going to changes to unlit texture book and

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.150
now it looks a little bit better still not amazing because it's all skewed so let's click on our quad

54
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.390
and change the scale actions can use my scale tool here and just drag it sideways as looking a little

55
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.130
bit better and then drag it up nice and big like that then we have it is bigger as little as you want

56
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.600
that's just one way that while I'm working in my scene here and saying I need a guy here need to go

57
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.450
there I guess quickly refer to my image that is sitting looming nice and large in my scene behind me

58
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.530
there that allows me to quickly on the fly see what I need to do I'll get just a little tip for you.

59
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.960
Their next tip as you're going along and changing things in your terrain I use terrain a lot so I find

60
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.510
it really fast I can get in there and just lets see raise a lower I can say not I want this to be here

61
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.280
yet I want some stuff to be there let's just put an obstacle in the way there let's make a little river

62
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.810
etc. So I like to use terrain there's a bunch of other ways that you can add assets or we can use Pro

63
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.690
builder as well that we might do later on in this course but I use it because it's fast but sometimes

64
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.150
it's a pain to map things out on the ground.

65
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.970
So what I do is I add some simple textures so I've given this to you as a downloadable against this

66
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.460
lecture you can see these simple textures there's a folder there I've unzipped that already you'll need

67
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.850
to unzip it and drag that on into your fold into your project I'm just gonna dump it in assets again

68
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.950
for now simple textures where does this leave.

69
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.290
I think this leaves in my terrain textures I can grab simple textures put it in terrain textures a folder

70
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.420
in there simple textures This is just blue red and yellow couple of different blues because I like to

71
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.570
kind of penciling where water might be before I've actually committed to doing nice fancy water and

72
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.150
just so I can draw things on the ground.

73
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.420
Sorry let me show you how this works if I click on my train and then I go to my paint texture added

74
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.880
to rain layers create layer and then I'll just fine say the yellow double click on that boat as a yellow

75
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.450
edit for rain create layer and then what do we want the blue double click it's in there do one more

76
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.310
time so you know I'm pulling into this two more times where's the other ones that I want there's the

77
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.610
dark blue and then the last one I'll do is the red red texture Okay so now that I've got these I can

78
00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.610
click on say red changed my brush size down to pretty small come back into the scene and then I can

79
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.420
paint in here if I change the opacity way up to maximum I can just paint things on my scene that allows

80
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.000
me to add notes and stuff kind of spray painting it in this I might put a little picture over here which

81
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.530
might indicate that's where a boss battle is going to be or I might use the yellow and say you know

82
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.080
what I've got the alternate go track going along here and then I can just use a regular brown I've got

83
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.260
a ready to say the player runs along here so I find it useful just for adding notes and adding little

84
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.860
tips to myself about what's going on or just being silly and spray painting the whole world yellow.

85
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.590
So it's going to undo all those fiddly doodles I've pretty much seen they're just an extra little tip

86
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.940
for you in terms of how you can make your moment creation process a little bit easier and the other

87
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.190
thing we haven't talked about yet is trees.

88
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:55.120
I'm a big fan of trees so if you click on terrain and find the symbol the second one in here which is

89
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.290
paint trees click on that.

90
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.100
We haven't added any trees yet but if click edit trees add a tree and then we'll have a tree prefab

91
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.130
we've already got trees from our Sinti asset pack.

92
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.850
So when I click on that selector type in tree it's a couple of trees here which got another couple of

93
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.880
trees from that Skybox pack very important if you want to play around that later on.

94
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:20.980
So going to choose this tree and then click on Add now gives us a whole bunch of flexibility so you

95
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.270
look at the previous trees we'd hand place those ones before but now what we can do is why I choose

96
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.770
my brush size small my tree density kind of medium.

97
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.750
I can paint trees blink onto my scene as I move around and click I can't see them there because the

98
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.690
draw distance is such that it's saying don't draw the trees way off in the distance scrolling in and

99
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.810
out here as you can see.

100
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.690
So you might find that it's pretty good not to have trees that you can see way off in the distance because

101
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.540
it's better not to have to render it because the play is never going to see them.

102
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.220
Interestingly though it also chops it off when you're in the same view like this.

103
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:59.530
OK so I can go in and place my trees I can change the height of them if I click off random I can move

104
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.710
up and down I click on random then I can say the range of the height and I can also do that with the

105
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.560
with the weight.

106
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.860
So with the width and I can have some variation in the color.

107
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:16.450
Okay so there's trees obviously I can go and add a second tree and I can add a third I can add a ton

108
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.900
of trees so I'm just going to undo what I did there again because it's a little bit messy.

109
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:28.220
That gives us the ability to add trees and the final thing I'm going to do here is just tidy up my hierarchy.

110
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.660
This.

111
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.240
Trust me.

112
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.310
This is beginning to become a real big mess.

113
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.950
Once we start adding assets in there.

114
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.310
So we want to be organized.

115
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.020
Let's first of all create ourselves an empty game object which we will call enemies and grab enemies

116
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:48.080
0 1 and 2 drop that into the enemy's game objects there and then also patrol path.

117
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.970
You're not going to create another empty game object which I will call a patrol path I will grab the

118
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:55.590
patrol path.

119
00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.230
We have already dropped those into patrol path and then I think I'm going to throw a patrol path inside

120
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.270
the enemy's game object just because they seem to go hand in hand.

121
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.830
And I can roll them all up and not have it cluttering up my hierarchy.

122
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.180
I'm also going to write clicking create empty.

123
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.460
I'll create something I just call core which is where I will put my directional light.

124
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:24.520
My player and my fellow camera on my camera that follows the player as it is What's missed.

125
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.570
I'll try that again.

126
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.310
Drag that into core.

127
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.110
There we go.

128
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.920
Now I can roll up core drag core up to the very top I tend not to look at that one too much and enemies.

129
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.810
Looking pretty good and we've got this random quad laying around I might add another final which is

130
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:46.240
something I'll call prototyping which is something that I is a little mental note to me and to Sam who

131
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.680
hopefully is watching this and saying Why have you created that Rick is that this is something that

132
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.660
we can delete add to it's kind of like a temporary folder but it's things that I know when I'm prototyping

133
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.020
I can just throw things in there to keep it tidy.

134
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.410
Okay.

135
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.620
Now there's only four things in here I feel better for further points we could go ahead and organize

136
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.360
our environment which we will need to do at some point but for now it's okay to roll that up.

137
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.880
I'm also going to go and delete my trees because we've got our new way of placing trees so I don't need

138
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.610
all these old trees and just delete all these trees in here.

139
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.030
Great.

140
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.970
Now I can go and place my trees are fresh and I knew I was gonna go ahead and create my moment now in

141
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.780
my world but I think we've taken long enough in this video we'll do that in the next video.

142
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:34.690
My challenge for you in this video is to tidy up your hierarchy and to get all of your tools ready.

143
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.460
So in the next video we can lay out our moment great stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
