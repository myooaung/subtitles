00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Hello folks, welcome back.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:06.840
In this lecture I'm going to create your new job that is for secondary demo project,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.035
but the code is not yet available in our GitHub repository.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:13.230
So we need to push our code into the, our GitHub repository.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870
Then only we can build it from the Jenkins because

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.420
Jenkins can able to pull the code from the source code management.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.760
So for that purpose, I'm going to create a new repository called the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.915
secondary demo project so that we can update our code over here.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:31.835
So new, I'm going to create a second demo project.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:33.605
Okay, this is the name I'm doing.

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:36.319
Let it be public and create a repository.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.500
And even I'm going to Marvin server here we have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.875
created our second demo project going say to that.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.915
So converted this one into your Git repository for that git init dot,

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.484
which means that we are converting these into your local repository.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:56.165
Now I'm going to associate my remote repository with the local repository.

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.840
For that, we just need to execute this command. Go back.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.145
So we have associated our local repo with the remote repo.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:05.675
And one more thing, good,

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:08.390
I think I heard remote or the target directory over here.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.490
Anyway, we don't want to push targeted directly onto the GitHub because we will

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.130
take the source code on building variable we want and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.859
the source code should contents enough information.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.900
What is required to build the application?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.510
That is where our palm dot xml is helping us.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.065
Anyway, git add git status.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.289
So we are adding all these files to our remote repository,

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.785
git commit minus GM initial commit.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:37.085
So we how committed our changes into our local repository.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.440
Next thing is we need to push our code into

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.580
remote repository further git push origin, master.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.000
Okay, I'm just pushing our code onto remote repository.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now it's asking for the remote repository credentials.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.835
So everybody, Okay.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.175
So I come into my changes.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:56.870
Now if I go and refresh,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.420
I could able to see our code over here.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.055
Once our code is here,

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.725
it is very easy to build from our Jenkins server

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.069
just to take the URL of our remote repository,

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.240
go back and create a new item under this term,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.270
secondary demo project, I'm naming it.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.285
And the Maven project go here.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:21.530
And a restricted this to run on specific system,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.320
that is Marvin build server.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.435
Next thing, get usually we name it as a student or client.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.170
Okay.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.930
So you were released this one and we don't record

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.095
any credentials and it is Marshall branch, I hope yes.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:40.310
And go back and clean install.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.150
Okay. Same thing I'm doing and the apply Save.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Now let's build it and we'll see what happens.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.770
So I'm opening the build output.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.075
This, it could able to successfully execute our goals and packages.

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.760
It couldn't able to find in our local repository.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.225
So it is pulling from the central repository. It may take your win.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:09.470
Alright, we have successfully completed our build process from Jenkins.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.825
Again, this build happened on Marvin.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:17.150
And if I go to my Marvin slash home Jenkins directory here,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.075
under workspace, you can see the one more project,

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.755
that is second the project.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.375
And three, if I do,

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.400
you can see the VAR file.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.175
So this where file, we can deploy it wherever we want.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:29.645
This is your web application.

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:31.640
Again, we have your Tomcat server, right?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.025
We can deploy it onto the Tomcat server,

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:36.050
but that can be done through the Jenkins.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.805
We don't do it with other Marin.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:40.190
Maybe I have already covered that in mind.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.460
Devops, Project 2 can check it out. How does it work?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.875
But this is how we can use mapping to do all the build activities.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.085
But we don't execute commands directly on the marvin.

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.975
Once it is set up and working fine,

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.050
we will be managing Marvin with the Jenkins.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.410
I hope it has given me a clear idea how to work

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.650
with Marvin as a developer and Azure DevOps,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.375
in, in, in next video,

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.430
I will be talking about a learning path.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.600
Once you have learned man,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.570
when what things you can learn to shape up

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.705
you were carried that we are going to discuss in the next lecture.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:17.460
Thanks for watching and see you there.
