00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
So far we have created our first two Maven project

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.545
and we understood the how the directory structure has been created.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.140
Now it's time to build our application.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.760
Before building this application,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.515
let's understand that what are the steps are involved in the build process.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:22.890
And if you see our application is app.js and app test.py is the test case name.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.675
Usually in the real term project,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.405
there will be more dark Java extinction files,

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.380
as well as the test cases.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.325
Now to build any application,

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:34.115
the fastest step we need to compile the source code,

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.830
compiling source code, nothing but in our case,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.850
app.js file is there that we need to convert into the app dot class.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.265
Similar way we how AP test dot Java,

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.340
that is also we should convert into the AP test dot class.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.730
So this is how we need to compile the source code.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.380
Once compilation is done,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.600
we need to run the test cases because we have created your test cases over here.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.555
In our case AP test dot class is the test case which we created.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.430
We need to run those test cases,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.320
an application that is Atlas.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.015
Once we run the test cases,

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.175
we need to create the package out of it.

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.840
That could be a JAR file,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.460
JAR file or a file.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.645
It could be anything.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.430
Once we have created a package,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.900
even by using Marvin,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.125
we can able to deploy this application on the target system,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.750
even though it is not your primary responsibility,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.800
we can still do that.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.740
And once again, the process involved is we are

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.235
going to compel our source code like your application,

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:29.915
as well as the test cases.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.620
Once this is done, we need to run our test cases on our code.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.060
If it is fine, then we are going to create a jar, JAR files.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
These are the steps involved to build our application.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.385
Now let's go back to our Eclipse.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.634
Now, I want to build this application.

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:48.005
So to build this application is quite simple.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:49.775
That is selective or project.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.010
Go to right-click and run.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.070
Okay, while running, it is going to ask you that,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.780
What do you want me to do?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.130
It is a Maven project,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.795
so we need to choose the Marvin,

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:03.515
Marvin buildings in case if you have already run the marvin built,

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:04.955
you can go with this one.

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.560
But if you want to change your goals,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.745
you can choose this option.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.010
Either way is fine for us because we haven't

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.565
run any commands are we haven't to build these applications, so forth.

00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:15.620
So let's select the map and build.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.910
And here it is,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.365
asking for the goals.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:21.320
Now let's see what is goals in our next lecture.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.150
Thanks for watching and see you there.
