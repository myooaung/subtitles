00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Until previous section, we were working with the mapping with integration of Eclipse.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.695
We haven't TA dedicatedly installed mapping,

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:09.300
but whenever we install Eclipse,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.145
Marvin comes along with that one.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:15.795
And also we covered most of the concepts as a dollar per pint of you.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:21.780
Now it's time to understand how does it work as a DevOps engineer prospect to that is

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.480
where I'm going to take a Linux system and we'll

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.005
create a build system by installing Marvin on that one.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:33.000
And we are going to execute most of the activities what we have done on our Eclipse.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.220
Along with that, we will see some of

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.320
the additional concepts which year DevOps engineers should know.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.590
For that. Of course,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.910
we need your Linux system.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.275
So in this case,

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:48.125
I'm going to use my AWS as Cloud provider where I'm going to create a Linux system.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.840
In our case, you can use any Cloud provider.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.685
Of course we just need your Linux system,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.365
even it could be where VM.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:57.020
But I don't want to make it as this is Tom dependency.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.450
That is the reason I'm taking your Cloud systems so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.225
that everybody can able to follow it easily.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.375
If you are new to the AWS, then don't worry,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.455
I'm going to add a separate lecture how to create an AWS account.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:13.805
After that, you can directly come over here and start creating any instance.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.250
Any way I'm going to show you how to create your new year to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.995
place our code so that you can follow along with me.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.705
I have already few systems.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.300
That is Jenkins Tomcat on some Kubernetes system.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.165
But for time being just to note these systems,

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.215
I'm going to launch a new instance where we are going to install Maven.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.765
Let's go and launch a new instance from here.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.120
Maybe I will go back to console.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.910
This is how it looks like once you have created the world,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.770
AWS are continually, then you can go to EC2 service which is under compute,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.000
either here or here.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.140
Let me go here.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.110
And running instances, there is 0 running instances,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.590
but in stances total three.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.780
Hey, how about this moment?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.984
Anyway, go to running instances.

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:55.325
I held three instances which are in stop disturbed.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.740
That's the reason it is not showing under running.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.080
Let me launch a new instance.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.140
Here. I'm going with that, Amazon to Linux.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.005
You can go with any amazon Linux, there is no problem.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.530
Even you can go with the Red Hat SUSE Linux, Ubuntu.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.035
But whenever we deal with this operating system,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.265
the command may not work.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.290
So if you are new to the Linux,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.740
maybe you can strict with the Amazon Linux adults you constrict

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.580
to follow what operating systems are used throughout these lectures.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.440
Let's go and select this one.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.685
And this is the instance type which we are going to use, free tier eligible.

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:31.445
Maybe you can find out the additional information

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:34.820
about the free tier eligibility in AWS page.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.620
Here we are not changing anything.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.025
Let it be with other default settings here as well.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:43.700
And the tags we are going to add it name of the server.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.850
I'm going to give it as a Marvin build server.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.075
Okay, this is the instance tag we are giving.

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:57.380
Security group. We are going to create a new security group for that.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.535
I'm changing it as Marvin. Yes, G.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.535
Same thing in the description as well.

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:07.385
Next and lunch.

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:09.770
While launching, we need to download your key pair

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.905
because that is useful to connect to our system.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.170
So I'm going to create a new key pair.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.220
So this is the option.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.475
It will get propagated if you are launching it first time.

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:23.390
And I'm going to name it as a man when key,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.085
under download the key pair,

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:28.685
we have downloaded it and Launch instance.

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.970
That's it. We have created a new EC2 instance,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.470
I meant to say Linux EC2 instance where we are going to install MATLAB him.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.880
That sum for this lecture.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.975
In next lecture, I'm going to show you how can you able to install Maren.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.550
Thanks for watching. See you there.
