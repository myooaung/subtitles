00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.144
So far we have seen how to install Java and Eclipse.

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:08.625
Now it's time to create our foster Maven project.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:12.450
Before that, let's understand how these console looks.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.935
So there are various options over here and the disease Package Explorer,

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:19.890
nothing but once we help create our projects,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.840
we can see the list of the projects over here.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.795
We can explore the content of the huge pack is at each project.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.450
And here, whenever we work on any file,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.275
that file get opens over here and here,

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.670
is there any bugs in the code,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.410
the output of the code,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.125
whenever we execute that program, we can see that.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.255
Now you should see the Package Explorer.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.275
There are few options where we can create different kind of projects.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:47.150
But in our case, we need to create

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.905
a Maven project rate for the two we should go into the File New.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.080
And here we need to choose the project,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.200
but there are various options we couldn't able to find

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.130
the Maren option so far that we can go to others.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.350
Here, we can search for Marvin.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.320
That is, they are mere VN, sorry.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.345
So Marvin project, if I select the Manhattan Project and click Next,

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:13.715
okay, In this result,

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:17.494
we can able to choose the workspace location.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.555
If you remember, we have 2s and a workspace

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:25.385
as under users where luck See, then projects, right?

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.755
So that is the default workspace location.

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.150
If you wish to change that one,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.285
we can choose by choosing the browser and we can change.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:35.345
But at this moment, let it be in the same location.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.370
So I'm just canceling it.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.005
And the next one is here.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.820
Create a simple project.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.850
In case if you are good at developing your Java application,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.560
maybe you can choose this option.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.480
Whenever you choose this option,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.954
just to create a directory structure.

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:52.265
And you need to write your own programs.

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:55.460
But I'm not your developer and I don't have that much skilled,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.410
so I'm skipping this level,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.235
which means that I'm going to use the archetypes selection.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:02.765
So if you choose this option,

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.285
it is going to skip the archetype selection.

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:08.810
If you don't select, it is going to display the archetypes.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.910
Now, click on Next.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.340
Here we can see we stop the archetypes.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.295
Whatever is available or not is propagating.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:16.865
Yeah.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.729
Here you can see list off the architects.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.410
But what is archetype?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.735
If you search in the Google same thing.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:28.100
So I'll just search it for what is archetype and Marvin.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.950
And if you click architect in shot,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.460
archetype is a Maven project or Template Toolkit,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.670
which means that it is like a template which comes with

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.585
the default directory structure as well as some default application.

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.360
With that application, we can do our changes.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.495
It is like here's some example projects kind of thing.

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:49.730
So in our case in eBay, we need that.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.010
That is the reason we are going with the archetype.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.450
If you need more information,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.895
please go through this document and here,

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:58.010
there is a way out of the reject command

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.635
how we can create architect through the command line.

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:05.795
I'm just going to pass this one until we are working with Marvin on Linux systems.

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:09.680
There we are going to execute it, but go back.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.965
And here we are going to select a map in, Okay,

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.550
Madeline, archetype and Quickstart.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.650
Here I'm selecting the map and archetype

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.810
Quickstart artifact ID and group IDs are two dot, apache dot Marvin,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.980
archetypes and Watson is one dot-dot-dot or the time of recording this video,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.730
the Watson off the archetype is one dot for click Next.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.865
In this result, we need to provide Marvin coordinates.

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:39.035
So here we should provide group or the artifact ID and version.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.240
Before providing this information,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.460
we need to see how others are using that we are going to discuss in our next lecture.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.230
Thanks for watching and see you there.
