00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Now it's time to execute the supply goal,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.580
but we don't have any central repository.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
So even though we try to execute that goal, it doesn't work.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.865
So if you go and see the what is deploying,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:17.010
deploying is nothing but a to copy our final packages and to the remote repository.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.200
So we don't have any remote repository,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.630
but at this moment we are getting all packages

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.390
from the marvin central repository that we can

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
check it out by using Maven repository URL.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.735
If you go, you can see here Maven repository repos Central.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.295
And if you go here,

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.160
there is a URL that is republic dot.org.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.405
If we click on this,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.070
it will distort the ALA repositories.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.450
I mean to say all the packages are libraries which we can get it from the mapping.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.330
So even we were doing the JUnit, right?

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.010
So if I search for J unit,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.870
you can see J unit is there.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.225
And again, if I go to J unit,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:58.925
there are questions we are using for dot hl7.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.725
Even apart from four dot hl7,

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:02.885
we can use the some other versions as well.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.105
I can still use three dotted.

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:08.900
Let me try to use the A3 dot-dot-dot and we'll see what happens.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.430
So it is not responding.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.025
Let me close it and reopen it quickly.

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.230
We are just trying to reopen it.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.295
It is taking the default workspace location and the lunch it.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:24.635
Okay, now, what we are doing is we are going to update our configuration.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.825
That is bom dot xml.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.340
In palm dot XML,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.345
we are going to use JUnit instead of four dot 11.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:34.415
I'm going to use the dot-dot-dot.

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.590
So even though the dependencies also get

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.170
changed to the three dot-dot-dot instead of four dot 11.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.865
Let me save this file.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.500
And if I refresh,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.825
you can see here J Unit 3.

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:48.439
But this time there is no dependency with the other packages.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.825
So if we go to dependency hierarchy,

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.655
J unit alone can get downloaded and stored in that Marvin repository.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.485
That is how we can pull it.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:02.090
So in case if we try to access the package which is not there in the remote repository,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.040
Let's take an example that I'm, again,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.930
I'm willing to the palm dot xml,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.000
assume that the eight dot, sorry,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.820
three dot A2, which doesn't exist at all.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.790
So let me save this file.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.880
And you can see here you are misses, Okay,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.610
problems I think yours,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.825
if you see the errors,

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:24.050
it will tell you that missing artifact, that JUnit.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.170
Why? Because if you go and check anywhere central repository,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.955
there is no such kind of package.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:30.620
We have three dot-dot-dot two,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.285
but not three dot a2.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:32.870
Okay?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.420
If the package is there in the central repository,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.100
then only we can able to use it.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.510
So the packages must be available in the central depository in case if you have you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.055
ever worn remote repository and if there is such kind of worship,

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:47.735
maybe then you will get it.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.505
But most of the cases,

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:51.260
these kinds of libraries are files.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.904
We are going to pull it from the mountains and told repository.

00:02:54.904 --> 00:03:00.725
So you should make sure that the existing repositories or library should be there, okay?

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:07.115
Now again, I hope change it to a 100 and I think you should get updated, updated,

00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:12.425
and any VM keeping it back to our original one file.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.525
Save, That's it.

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:19.070
Okay, So this is how we can work with to the repository is on our local system.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.525
That's all for this lecture.

00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:22.890
See you in the next lecture.
