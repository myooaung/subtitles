00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.575
Hello folks, welcome back.

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.945
Now our modern system is up and running.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:05.685
Let's connect to this system.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:08.820
To connect to the system we knew the tool called mobile

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.140
external party and cutting to you or convenient you can use anything.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.015
In my case, I'm going to use them or by x term for that we should take the public API.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:19.560
So this is the public IP.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.420
You can just need to copy it, sorry,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.370
by mistakenly held corporate private.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.640
But this is the public IP.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.650
So I have taken public API,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.120
Go to your mobile extra.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.340
So you need to download and install them away.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.725
External Arles put you also you can use.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.480
So go to sessions.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.280
I'm giving the IP address and go to advanced settings here you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.530
should use private-key and you need to go to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.215
the path where you are mapping keys downloaded.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.625
Let me open this one.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.620
Okay, so here we have the key.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.110
This is the path where we kept our key,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.600
go to this location and load the key path location like quick access downloads,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.550
when and you work,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.660
keep it, that's it.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.179
And the default username is ec2.

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:06.230
User.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.005
Alright, we are connecting to our mapping system.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.480
Let me see the security group.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.940
Maybe security group could be the issue.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.845
So go to Security Group.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.690
Okay. It looks good for me.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.080
Yeah.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.730
We have connected to the system.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.120
Okay.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.830
Nothing to change just a little bit of time and become the root user.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.120
To become the root user,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.365
use the pseudo you assume minus this is the command and clear the screen.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.840
Now it's time to set up Marvin for that one,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.115
we need to go to the Apache official website and download the packages.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:40.040
Let's do that. So I'm just opening the new tab.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.855
If you search for download a M7,

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:46.985
then you can see Maeve and download Apache Maven from where we can download Apache Maven.

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.530
And if you open the link,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.570
you can see system requirements.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.865
What is the minimum requirement of your system?

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:56.150
So we should have the JDK installed.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.130
That is one thing we need to make sure,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.395
and there is no memory requirement and the disk space is approximately ten MB is fine,

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:06.560
and even operating system there is no minimum requirement.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.345
Next thing, these are the links,

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:10.025
how you can download the work.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:10.730
Marvin.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.255
So we are going to use the tar.gz at RKO.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:15.860
This is the one we are going to use.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.630
So you just need to right-click and copy link address to download it.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.430
Before doing that one, anyway,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.335
we how connected to our system, right?

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:27.215
Let's install Java first for that one.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:28.715
Just to go here.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.940
And the Java seems it got disconnected.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.605
Let me open the new tab.

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.020
Okay, again, same thing we need to do

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.520
sudo SU minus and increase the font size is not this much.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.680
And I'm closing the previous session.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.885
And here, clear the screen.

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:48.110
I'm going to check whether Java is there or not.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.710
Java minus three, there is no Java installed.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.405
So let's install Java.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:57.485
Yum, install Java minus one dot dot star.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.170
Okay, this is to install the latest version,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.780
which means that the packages which starts with

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.215
the Java minus 1 dot it installed those back edges?

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:08.765
Yes, to install, it may take your well,

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.955
let's wait until it gets completed.

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:13.355
Great, Java installation is completed.

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.085
Just check for Java minus version.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.935
Okay, here we can see Jiao on dot-dot-dot.

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.095
Now we need to set up Java HomePod.

00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:25.250
For that, we need to update our dot profile and we should add the Java HomePod.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.125
How can I check the Java home path?

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.280
It is quite simple.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.275
Here we are going to execute this command.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.795
I'm going to add this command in the documentation.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:33.485
Anyway.

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:37.310
This means that the file which starts with the Java minus 1 dot dot,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.290
dot, after that, it could be anything.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.780
So in this directory, wherever it finds,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.350
display those, and we are displaying only top three.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.190
That's it.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.405
So among this, this is the one we need to set up the Java Home button.

00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:56.560
For that one, just we need to add it to VA tilde slash bash underscored profile.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.960
So we are going to update the bash profile of the root user.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.150
And the next thing we need to add Java under skirt home is the cold path of the JDK.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.990
That's it.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.475
Once you have done this,

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:14.890
you need to add this one to you or a path.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.500
Dollar Java are under skirt home.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.815
Okay, So what we are doing is we have installed a Java.

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:24.085
Once that is done, we need to set up Java home birth.

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:27.520
So we are given, this is where the JDK is in standard.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.710
That is what we are telling to our path.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.565
I'll write.

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:32.545
Now, save this file.

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:34.704
And if I do echo,

00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:38.780
dollar path Can not able to see the updated path yet.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.885
But you can do sorts of our bash underscored profile,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.390
which means that read the file.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.180
And now if I do the a copepod,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.540
we could able to see the latest part of it.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.290
So which means that our Java installation is successful.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.980
In next video, I'm going to show you how to set up Madeline.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.780
Thanks for watching and see you there.
