00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
So far we have created our cost to demote project.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.145
If I go and explore what is the content is there inserted this project,

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:14.145
you can see one SRC main Java SRC tests to Java JRE System Library.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:17.535
Maven dependencies is such that target bomb dot xml.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.880
Among this, we need to more concentrate on these two.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.160
That is, a certainly main Java SRC,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560
DST Java, next Palm that XML,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.020
these three and the target usually should not

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.795
get created are the time of creating our project,

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.880
but we are using Eclipse by default,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.650
even this folder got created,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.455
okay, just ignored this one for time being.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:40.165
If we talk about a subsea main Java,

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.280
this is the actual application code we need to write it.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.130
Anyway, we use with the default template.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.295
That is the reason we get year defend project, okay,

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:52.160
there is a package called com dot demo company,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.810
first two demo project and the application called app.js.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.820
This has been by default it kin.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.575
And if I double-click on this one,

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:02.480
the file get opened over here.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.890
This is the content of this file and it is just like you're printing Hello world.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.565
Okay?

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:12.035
So that is about the application what we have created at this moment.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.300
Similar way, you associate test to Java,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.580
it contains the test cases.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.920
So whatever application we are writing u,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.325
if we would like to test that application is working fine art,

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.935
then we should create the test cases as well, right?

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.260
So even this is a default application,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.720
so we got to some default to test cases,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.360
that is AP test dot Java.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.525
Okay? This is the test case which we have got it.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:38.135
Alright, next one is palm dot xml.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:40.265
Nothing but Project Object Model,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:44.780
which tells about that what are the dependencies to run this project and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.895
also what is the outcome of the project and what is the name of the project?

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:52.850
And washing all this information is stored over here.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.070
We have given our Maven Coordinates,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.810
Red Lake, group ID,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.475
artifact ID, and version.

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:01.520
That information gets stored under palm dot XML.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.680
You can see here this is the group ID of

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.865
this project and the artifact ID as well as the washing IT.

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:09.425
Okay, apart from this,

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:13.805
it has some other information which we are going to discuss in the letter plant up-time.

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:16.280
But this is how the directory structure get

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.940
created whenever we use the default archetype template,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.620
but usually dollar purse, right?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.085
All this application by creating the empty directory structure,

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:26.585
we are not developers.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:30.440
We are just understanding how dollar per start working with the application.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.885
That is the reason I've just gone through with

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.960
the archetype which will create your sample project.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.250
That's all for this lecture.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.760
In next lecture we are going to see how to build this project.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.500
Thanks for watching and see you there.
