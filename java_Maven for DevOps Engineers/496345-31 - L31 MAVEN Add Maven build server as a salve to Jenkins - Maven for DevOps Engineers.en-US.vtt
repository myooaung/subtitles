00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
In previous lecture, we have seen how to install Jenkins

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:07.380
before adding our Marvin build server as a slave to Jenkins server,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.390
we need to do some configurations,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.725
okay, for that 1,

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:12.540
first to go to managing chins,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.345
and we need to check out whether all the plugins are

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.680
available to add our mechanism slow system for this one.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.255
For that one, Let's go to available tab and search for magazine.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:25.050
I don't think so.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.225
Maven plugin has been installed during our default setup.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.345
So we need to install Maven in worker plug-in,

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:37.085
even Marvin integration plugin all time selecting it and installed without restart.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.485
Alright, we have installed a mapping in worker plugin.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:42.215
Go back to dashboard again, managing Pickens.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.890
Let's go and check what null installed plugins are there.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.050
Basically we knew the Git Hub.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.540
Okay, we need GitHub login, I think.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.715
Good luck and it's already installed.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:56.665
Okay, now we are going to add our map and build server as it's slow

00:00:56.665 --> 00:01:00.845
to this Jenkins server further to just to go to managing chins.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:04.670
And here we have managed notes on the clothes.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.550
So here we are going to add a new node.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.020
So our node name,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.885
I'm going to go Marvin build server.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:12.365
Okay.

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:14.810
Because it is a Marvin's her work just naming,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.550
it doesn't matter and build several hurdles.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.115
We can use slave whatever name is convenient for you,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.810
and it is a permanent agent.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.515
Next, and here the name is Marvin build server.

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.930
Let it be the description and executors.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.555
Nothing but how many jobs can it run parallelly?

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.730
I'm going to do five by default.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.215
If you see on your master node,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.870
you can execute to two jobs are two of them here,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.760
and I just given five.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.605
And the remote root directory,

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:41.975
we should have a remote router directly.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.595
So to provide this one,

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:47.000
we need to create a separate user for unmanned system.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.545
That is a best practice.

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.275
So here, this is Marvin server, right?

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.735
If I go to cats class, ETC,

00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.285
password which tells that how many users are there,

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.525
we just have only one user that is easy to minus user.

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.745
I'm going to add one more user.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:03.439
That name is Jenkins.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.405
So user add Jenkins.

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:08.210
Okay, we are adding your user called the Jenkins.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.535
And let's set up the password for Jenkins, Jenkins to 123.

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:15.500
And the same I'm giving.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.080
Alright, So I helped given the password.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.895
And one more thing is we need to add this user to the pseudoscalar.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:24.815
Okay, this is the pseudowords file.

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:29.975
Here we need to add our Jenkins server to the suitors going further to go to F to G,

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.850
nothing but capital G,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.175
which means that it will go to the end of the file.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.190
And we are going to add under root,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.985
Okay, Jenkins, and we are going to add this one, okay?

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:44.105
Which means that whenever we execute any admin commands,

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:45.545
don't ask the password.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.030
That is the meaning of this one.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.235
So we have now created your user called the Jenkins and added him as an admin.

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:56.300
Now, another thing is we need to enable the password based authentication.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.700
Okay, so for password based authentication,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.230
we just need to edit.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.660
Class UTC is, as it says here,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.270
to d under skirt concrete, by default,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.614
EC2 instance doesn't comes with the password based authentication.

00:03:08.614 --> 00:03:13.760
So just to edit to this one and such for PSS w, are they okay?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.219
Which goes to the password authentication.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.645
We should enable this one.

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:20.075
So by default it will be commented it out.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.640
So we'll just remove the comment.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.410
And there is one more entry with

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.190
the same password authentication which specifies the node.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.765
We need to comment this one.

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:34.640
So I just to remove the comment in this lane and added over here, That's it.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.800
Once this is done, we just need to repress

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.535
the associated service necessary to do a reload.

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:42.560
Okay, sorry, sorry.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.725
Today we load, which means that we have

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.025
enabled password based authentication on the map and server.

00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:52.550
Now we can use Jenkins server to connect with them, Morgan.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.110
Now, let's go on to add this.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.885
Mavens are about as a slave to our Jenkins server.

00:03:56.885 --> 00:04:00.455
So go back and remote 2 root 2 directory,

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:03.425
I'm going to go slash home slash Jenkins.

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:06.290
That is the default Jenkins home directory.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.420
You can go and check it out over here.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.590
Pwd.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.260
So let me switch Jenkins user,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.970
okay, PWD, if I do,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.910
I'm under slash home Jenkins directory, okay,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.530
this is the path we have given,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.785
which means that it will be useful as a workspace directory.

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:24.290
Next two levels, no need to provide labels,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.365
which means that in case anything with that name,

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:30.710
IT is going to take by this isn't something like that.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.155
Next to uses all this stuff is not needed.

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:35.900
Next thing is launched agent by connecting to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.570
the master lunch agent where execution of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.960
the command on the master ourselves launch agent way ISS yet.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.750
So usually we will choose this option,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.810
okay, which will generate a few files, JPL file.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.805
So we need to execute on the client side.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:51.350
But as a quick process,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.625
I'm going to use the lunch agent way I associate Here host name,

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.625
nothing but the server name of the remote host,

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.785
which means that our Marvin system,

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:03.965
let me get the IP address of our Marvin system.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:08.285
Here I'm going to use the private IP because both are in the same VPC.

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:09.545
If you don't know VPC,

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:12.155
which means that it is like same datacenter.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.870
So it will connect with the private IP address.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.685
We don't need to provide the public IP,

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:20.540
so I'm just giving the IP address next to credentials.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.085
We just created Jenkins user read those credentials we should add over here,

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:29.915
add Jenkins, and here username and password we are providing.

00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:36.650
What is the username that is Jenkins password also Jenkins, our 2123.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.065
And I'm giving ID also Jenkins under description. No need.

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:42.560
Okay.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.654
Hopefully help you in the right password and select the Jenkins.

00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:49.745
Okay, So we have given the Jenkins credentials and

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:53.030
one last thing we need to do that is known we repay host.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.150
It should be non-recurring verifications strategy.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.635
Okay, save this one.

00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:00.440
And we could able to connect to our slow system.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.830
So let's work on this one and see the logs. Okay.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.290
It is trying to connect to our remote system.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.810
Yes, you can see isn't successfully connected,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.105
which means that it has been registered.

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:15.845
I'm going to say our Marvin server has been registered as it is into this system.

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:17.135
And once this is done,

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:21.800
you cannot see any red cross mark over here which could able to connect

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.990
and it should be able to gather up the information about our map and build server.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.210
Alright, so that's all for this lecture.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.955
In next lecture I'm going to show you how can we execute your build on the remote system.

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.865
I'm into some haven't built system by using the Jenkins.

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.390
This is how in the real-world we are going to use the build servers.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.925
That's all for this lecture and see you in the next lecture.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.840
Thanks for watching.
