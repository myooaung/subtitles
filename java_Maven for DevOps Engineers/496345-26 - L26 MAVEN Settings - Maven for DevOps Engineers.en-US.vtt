00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.185
Hello folks.

00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:04.635
In this lecture we are going to talk about settings dot XML.

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's try to understand why do we use settings.js XML.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.685
I just searched and forth settings.py XML in mapping.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:13.425
If I open the first link,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.185
if you see the definition of settings dot xml,

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.200
the settings.py XML file contains elements,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.375
use it to defend values which configure maverick executes in various ways,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.025
like the palm dot XML,

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.260
but it should not be bundled into

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.785
a nice specific project are distributed to any audience.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:37.665
Which means that usually palm dot xml is associated with your specific project to it.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.150
And that palm dot XML,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.830
if you use for some other project,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.220
it may or may not work.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.425
Settings.js, Emily's kind of your global configuration.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.520
Assume that there are some common values you need to provide across your environment.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.364
Then you can update in the settings.py

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:55.415
XML and this file we can able to configure in two locations,

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:56.735
that is Mab install.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.465
So where we have installed maven within that,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:01.130
there is a file called convict.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.055
Under that we can specify the settings dot xml.

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.290
Let me show you this location.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.780
Alright, so this is our mountains,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.150
or would I just renamed the host name as a man when?

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.960
So it is easy for us to identify because we are going to use Tomcat in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.205
next lecture that 30s and I have used a Marvin host name over here.

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:22.730
And if I go to slash OPT Apache Maven.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.785
So here we have econ and we have the settings.py XML file.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:29.405
Okay, this is one location.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:30.845
And if I open this one,

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:35.285
I think most of the default values are displayed over here.

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.775
So a lot of content is commented over here.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:42.425
This is one location and another one is we have dot m2 directly, right?

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.060
So in this case under root,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.640
root user, we have here dot m two directly.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.955
So under dot m2 directory here also we can create,

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.165
by default you cannot see the settings dot xml file over year,

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:54.695
but we can create it.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:02:00.020
But recommended way is better to create your settings.py XML file under dot m2.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.500
So this is how you can defend the settings dot xml.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550
And if you would like to change something apart from the default values,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.935
maybe you can update the sittings dot XML.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.900
So in our case to test to this one,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.540
what we are going to do is I'm going to use

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.025
a Tomcat and we'll try to deploy your application from Mab into Tomcat.

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.905
In that case, we are going to use the settings.py XML.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:24.410
I will show you how we are going to do that one.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.700
That's all for this lecture.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.370
In next lecture, we are going to see how to deploy

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.355
your application on Tomcat server. Thanks for watching.

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:32.970
See you there.
