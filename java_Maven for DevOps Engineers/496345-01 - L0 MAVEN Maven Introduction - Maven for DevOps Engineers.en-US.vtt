00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.385
Magnesium or not the word you used to build automation tool for Java projects.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.340
That's the reason there are many courses which

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.745
talks about Marvin as a developer, paint off for you.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.705
Apart from developer, DevOps in the unit also use Marvin,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.830
but there is no clear information about what kind of activity C,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.825
a DevOps engineer can take it off.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:26.370
Well, using Marin that motivates me to create this madman course.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.050
Welcome to my new course,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.354
Marvin for DevOps engineers.

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:35.285
In this course I'm going to talk about Marvin as a DevOps engineer point of view.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.055
By enrolling to this course,

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:39.470
you are going to learn how we are

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.685
dollar per use mapping activities of your DevOps engineer,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.585
our Marin, nothing but what kind of activities he can take it,

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.195
building Java projects using Marin.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:55.180
And also you are going to learn how to set up Marin and integrating mapping method

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.055
Jenkins hope these concepts help you to use Marvin efficiently in your DevOps workflow.

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:06.080
In next lecture, we are going to see concepts which do we cover as part of this trend.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.190
And thanks for watching,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.470
and I'm excited to see you in the course.
