00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
Hello folks, welcome back.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.565
In this lecture we are going to see how to install Java.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:10.710
As we discussed, we need to Eclipse and Mammon to proceed with our course.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.160
But without Java, it is not possible to execute.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.665
Our Marvin commands are even Eclipse.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.370
So we are going to install Java on our Windows system.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.320
To install Java, first,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.360
we need to download Java packages.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.125
For that.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.215
Just such a Java JDK download,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.470
which will take us to the article.com website.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.265
And here we can download our Java SE Packages.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:36.955
Click on the first link.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:41.915
Here we can see the latest version of Java or the time of recording this video.

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:44.255
We have Java SE 15.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.805
Now we should download it for Windows read,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:51.380
we need to go to Oracle JDK download page to download it for Windows.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.785
So click over here and if we scroll down here,

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:58.640
we have Java packages for different operating systems.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.310
We are going to choose Windows 64-bit because

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.900
my operating system is Windows 10 at this moment. Let's download it.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.990
While downloading, we should accept the license agreement.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.090
So click on this checkbox to download the JDK packages.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.969
It to take say well to get it downloaded,

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.800
we'll wait until it gets download.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.385
Alright, download has been successfully completed.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.825
Let's open this one in the folder and start installing the Java.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:31.750
So this is the packages which we just downloaded.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.210
Let's double-click on this one to install it,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.960
you should have admin privileges to install this Java packages.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.970
I'm already admin on these accounts,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.410
So there is no issue,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.615
I meant to say on this system.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.240
Alright, so this is the welcome,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.165
deserted to setup our Java.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:50.260
Let's go.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.970
Nothing to change over here.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.330
In this space, we can change the Java installation path.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.305
By default it is picking up C drive Program Files, Java.

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:00.910
Let it be in the same location.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.460
If you wish to chain, you can choose the option.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.389
I'll read our setup of java has been completed successfully.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.620
Let's close it.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.660
Once the installation is completed,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.200
you can see the Java packages under C drive, Program Files.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.995
Java. This is where Java installation has been done.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:25.555
And if you click on this one,

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.200
you can see the bin calm and a few other directories.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.530
Now we need to set up our Java environment variables to make it work across the system.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.090
For that, we should go to this PC properties directly.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.290
We can right-click on this PC and go to properties

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.060
and advanced system settings and environment variables to come

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.100
over here we have another method that is

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:01.850
just such a control panel and System and Security, didn't systems.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.060
This is also brings us into the same place.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.940
Either way we can come over here and go to at once

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.195
the system settings, environment variables.

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:13.880
This is where we need to setup system variables.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.160
Whenever we set up system variables,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.890
this particular application will be accessible across

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.445
the system with respect to or whatever he was a reward.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:28.475
So we are going to setup over here to setup first we need to update the path of our Java.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:31.390
I meant to say where it has been installed.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.345
So edit the path and we need to copy the location where we have installed a Java.

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:39.985
If you remember, this is where we have installed,

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:41.485
but to set up path,

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:43.360
we need to do that as well.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.995
So I'm going in Serbian till here, I'm copying.

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:54.175
So add new pop and pecan. Okay.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:58.540
We need to set up one more environment variable that is Java and Oscar home.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.045
For that, we need to create a new system variable.

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.805
So click on New Java,

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:08.950
underscore home under the path of Java where it has been installed.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.190
This term we need not to do the bin because it is still JDK level.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.975
Okay? I don't know. Okay.

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:18.005
That's it. I can say we have configured

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:22.055
our system variables to validate it whether it is working prime are not.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.440
Just go to command prompt,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.470
execute java was shunned command.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.435
You can see here the Java version script.js No.2 has been installed.

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:36.620
It is working well and one more command we can execute is Java C.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.069
Java see nothing but compilation of the Java application.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.020
We haven't provided any application.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.860
So it is giving that you need to include few more parameters.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.465
In a way, it is saying that our Java installation has been successful and working fine.

00:04:50.465 --> 00:04:54.200
In next video, we are going to see how to install Eclipse.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.840
Thanks for watching and see you in the next video.
