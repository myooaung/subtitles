1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.510
Or write so we are done with a table design or development and we are selling some data from our table

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.070
inside a database.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.950
Now what I think we should do next is actually make this a little bit more dynamic.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
I want to show you a technique that I use all the time and something that is going to give you some

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.080
information some practice on switch statements.

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.570
That way we can apply one or one of the things that we learned from the course here on this CMOS project.

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.860
All right.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.230
So what I really want to do is make another page and include it so we want to use it for the same page

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.530
right here.

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:46.920
Postop BHB and we want included for example the lead that inserting the crud basically is included by

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.310
using GET requests instead of just going to another page which will probably include the page using

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.730
GET requests I'll show you right now if you don't know what I'm talking about so don't worry about I'm

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
going to show you right now exactly how we're going to do this.

14
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.320
So the first thing that I want to do is remove this table outta here and include it here depending on

15
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.090
certain condition.

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.040
But for that we need to make another file.

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.410
Go to admin and then let's go to includes reichlich includes And let's create another page called view

18
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.860
on the score or pose that be.

19
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.840
All right.

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
And let's go to pose and make sure we get that table in there.

21
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.620
Let's get it out of there.

22
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.320
The whole table and I command at it you will be control at seeing if you are in the Windows or Mac coming

23
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.920
at us.

24
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.880
We know that and let's go back to view or Paul's view on the score or on the score post up DHP that's

25
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.310
pasted in there just for itself.

26
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.160
Let this thing a little bit here.

27
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.360
That's fine.

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.990
The key is here which is bothering me a little bit.

29
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.650
That's fine.

30
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.330
And let's go back here here.

31
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.830
Well we want to do a switch statement.

32
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.450
So first we need to check for a condition.

33
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.790
So let's raise a tag first before we write any Ph.

34
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.630
Right.

35
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.360
So we're going to be using to get requests to do this here organizes a little bit so you can see what

36
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.480
I'm doing.

37
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.420
Make this a little bigger for you.

38
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.670
Perfect.

39
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.220
So if it's said we're going to use this.

40
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.700
Remember the function get a check for a get requests get superglue all source.

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.410
We're going to call this key the source if it's said I want you to set this very well because we do

42
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.500
this is that for the statement to work we need a condition.

43
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.080
Right.

44
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.790
And it takes only one parameter it takes only one so we're going to use one variable.

45
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.280
And depending on the very what we're going to show the front pages in includes functions so we're going

46
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:21.730
to check if this get source is available if it is then we say we make a variable for it called Source.

47
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.500
All right.

48
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.660
So that's one condition.

49
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.500
Let me show you the switch statement if you don't remember which right here is this switch statement.

50
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.860
All right.

51
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.350
And then the switch statement we have something called cases for example this would be 34.

52
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.780
All right.

53
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.080
And they call that would be right here.

54
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.570
Nice and just giving you a little placeholder there so that way you can tell exactly what I'm doing.

55
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.400
How this is written and we're going to copy this a couple of times going down.

56
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.430
All right.

57
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.860
So this is going to be a different case and it's going to be a different case.

58
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.800
Nice.

59
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.060
Thirty four nights injured and nice to.

60
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.220
You get the idea right.

61
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.960
And here we'll have the fold here the fold.

62
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.320
All

63
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.950
right.

64
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.990
And we'll have a break here.

65
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.360
But we need to put the code right here right code here.

66
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.500
So this is a switch statement.

67
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.480
So we need a condition right here to compare it to this case.

68
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.130
So if this source right here is equal to this case we we're going to display this.

69
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.060
If you go to this game we're going to play this and so on and so on.

70
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.540
All right so now we do it like this.

71
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.270
But what we need to do is include the default page that I wanted to include would be that view or post

72
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.720
I want people to view all the polls and then depending on what they click in there to include all their

73
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.610
files.

74
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.930
So we're going to say View all polls that.

75
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.800
Right.

76
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.770
So we are including remember this file right here that we may with our table saw the painting on that

77
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.820
condition we're going to display this table.

78
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.100
Now they say it is going to be displayed all the time.

79
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.020
That's that's the idea.

80
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.540
But so that's why I'm putting this as the fault because I wanted to just in case we don't find any other

81
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.260
get requests right and then we display that all the time.

82
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.850
So this is going to give us a narrow now but I want you to see it.

83
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.890
You say you see we are display's giving us a notice actually is still displaying it for us.

84
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.190
What he's telling us that is he has an undefined variable and this is explain this because all the conditions

85
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.130
in the switch statements fail.

86
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.300
So it knows that it needs to display something it needs to do something.

87
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.110
So we are just plain and well we're just getting undefined variable.

88
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.080
For that we just patch it up a little bit and we just use an else and because it's undefined let's just

89
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.400
set it to something whatever it doesn't have to be anything it could be empty.

90
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:32.560
We just needed to get it out of the way refresh as you can see here we are included in the form there.

91
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.070
Now that's not the fault.

92
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.910
Perfect.

93
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:45.780
So for example if you have a condition of 34 If you have a source of 34 I show you right now what that

94
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:52.350
is I'm going to go to that you are on top here and an outside source study for this study for we go

95
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.950
after and you can see this nice 34 right here.

96
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.880
All right.

97
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.930
So that's what we're going to be doing depending on this condition here.

98
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.540
We're going to be explained different things here.

99
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.080
All right so we are done with this lecture here on the next one we're going to be making the rest of

100
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.850
the pages and I'm including them depending on the condition.

101
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.670
All right.

102
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.620
So thank you so much and I'll see you in the next video.
