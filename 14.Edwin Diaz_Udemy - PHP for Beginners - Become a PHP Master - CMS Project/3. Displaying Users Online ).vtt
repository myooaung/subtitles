00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.180
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.950
So hopefully you understand this code here that we started courting a couple years ago right or last

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.790
lecture.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.450
So if we see a new user right we see the new session id we're going to insert the time of the session

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750
with our first came into our site.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.930
So if for some reason that user and this is how we're going to find out how the user is not new right.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.920
If this count is actually something other than no that means they use just been there before right that

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.870
count is more then we're going to just update.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.330
And what are we getting We're going to be updating.

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.950
All right.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.330
Remember we're going to keep track of the user with time so we're going to day users on line and we're

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:54.970
going to set the time to what equals to time write in how we are going to identify the user how are

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:06.350
going to know which feel to update remember where sesshin equals what session.

14
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.030
If you got it correct you're a genius.

15
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.190
You're awesome.

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.160
So that's all we're going to find out right.

17
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.150
So what else do we need to do here.

18
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.950
What is it.

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.520
How are we going to be this.

20
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.030
How are we going to be explain the user based on what.

21
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.750
All right.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.030
Well we're going to display the user account the users on line based on how many minutes or seconds

23
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.770
they've been on our side how many how much time.

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.710
So that's how we're going to actually get that information.

25
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.960
So we're going to make another query here and we're going to find out that information we're just going

26
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
to say.

27
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.820
Users online users on that's just going to be a variable and Querrey variable is going to hold.

28
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.910
The users are going to show you right now exactly what we're going to be acquiring for.

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:08.240
So we're going to select fall from users online where the time field right is less than what.

30
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.240
What do you think.

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.570
We made some calculations up here right.

32
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.450
What do you think our field.

33
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.770
What is the condition of your well time out right here right.

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.490
That's going to be our target time out.

35
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.480
Now we've got to send that in to make that work Ray.

36
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
So up upon Actually we are already sending that in.

37
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.900
So all we got to do is just do the count here.

38
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.310
So we're going to say count to user and we've got to send this in with this function.

39
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.580
My Ask your lie.

40
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.200
No Rose that's how we're going to count it.

41
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.130
All right.

42
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.170
And we're going to put that timing operator there just to make sure.

43
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.720
Whoops there we go.

44
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.670
All right.

45
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.140
So I think we're done here.

46
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.690
All right.

47
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.100
So now let's test this out.

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.200
Let's put a x ray already got it right here.

49
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.380
But if you don't have it right.

50
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.200
Put an NH one down here like this.

51
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.020
All right.

52
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.060
And this is just temporarily.

53
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.520
All right.

54
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.350
And we're going to come here to my publication that you're going to see though I already have one in

55
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.160
here.

56
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.950
All right so if you want to see that number change go to another browser.

57
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.410
All right.

58
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:46.790
And I've been your co-host of course co-host logged into your application and this song says zero.

59
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:57.900
Here I think my Firefox is not counting the cookies I don't have the browser enable them to use come

60
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.570
back here and check it out.

61
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.720
After that was just weird.

62
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.250
I'm probably getting some type of error here.

63
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.580
Let's go back and see what in the world just happened.

64
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:20.790
That is so let go from users where time.

65
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.460
That's just weird there.

66
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.790
Let's go to our BHB ad minutes.

67
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.570
Check out what happened.

68
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.320
All right.

69
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.410
So the HP men

70
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.270
and users on line.

71
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.670
All right we've got two sessions here.

72
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.080
All right.

73
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.200
I'm just going to delete them and check it out.

74
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.220
Maybe some type of bug or something and come back here or refresh.

75
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.370
And we are getting this Sessions they're getting in but we are not

76
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.800
getting the right information.

77
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.820
That's because we have some type of bug or something here and I'm surprised that we're not getting a

78
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.420
notice.

79
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.300
I think we're not sending this guy here.

80
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.520
I mean he might ask you a live connection

81
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.820
and we can the user.

82
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.230
Maybe my logic is flawed.

83
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.910
We go in that we fix it.

84
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.650
Sorry about that guys.

85
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.950
Firefox.

86
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.210
There we go.

87
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.370
My logic was messed up guys.

88
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.210
This is what happens when you spend too much time in the computer.

89
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:53.420
Local CMOS and they go to admin and now you can see that we have to be users.

90
00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:04.650
All right let's go to safari and let's log in and log into a fiery in the middle in front of you so

91
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860
you can see admin.

92
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.150
I'm already logged in so that's why he's doing that.

93
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.920
So you can see now that I've got three users right here.

94
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.820
All right.

95
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:22.620
So now we refresh and we have some being a many yet remember and we can actually make this less of the

96
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:33.140
way if we make this 30 seconds here we are just going to show those specific users and save my keyboard

97
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.900
battery miles batteries are running out.

98
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.670
So all right let's go to this guy right here and refresh.

99
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.900
Now you can see that I look down to people because they've been there more than 30 seconds.

100
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.650
All right.

101
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.160
So my logic was not very good.

102
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.800
All right so now time has to be actually bigger than timeout.

103
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.730
Hey that's the right logic there guys.

104
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.050
All right.

105
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:05.120
So now another thing is that you can actually put this somewhere in your navigation on top here.

106
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.530
I'll show you in an election next lecture how to do that.

107
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.680
But of course you should know how to do that by now.

108
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.250
If you don't one even watch the next lecture don't watch it.

109
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.910
But I'm going to show you how I do it.

110
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.910
Very simple.

111
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.030
Thank you so much.

112
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.210
I'll see you in the next lecture
