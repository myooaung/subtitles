00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.370
All right so we are in section 2 right now.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.950
Here are the practical ab exercise and what we need to do here.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.190
Very simple step one make two variables called number one and number two in said one to value 10 and

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.310
the other to value 20 set number to add two variables and just play the song with Echo.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.870
OK that sounds pretty simple enough.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.530
And then here make two arrays with the same values one regular and the other associate of a rate.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.810
If you want a positive reading go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.210
You can as a matter of fact I want you to do that.

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.260
I want you to try since we already went through this in the lectures.

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.040
It should be very simple.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.770
So pause a video go back and if you need to watch a lecture or watch it and come and do that.

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.920
After that I'm going to help you out and do it with you.

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.250
All right.

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.050
Suppose if we didn't do that.

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.350
All right so hopefully you were able to post a video and did that.

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.980
Now if you if you weren't able to do it don't worry.

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.430
We're going to be able to do it right now so let's go ahead and start doing that.

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.730
So it's telling us to declare two variables right.

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.520
So let's start with the variables number one and we're going to set it to 10 then.

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.660
Very well number two.

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.000
Right.

22
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.990
And we said this one to 20 pretty simple enough that we are going to be echoing this and we're going

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.980
to be a number one plus number two.

24
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.840
All right.

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.620
Let's put this in concatenate your tag.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.320
So that way when we write the next steps nothing is wrong with it right.

27
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.360
We get we've got a space below that.

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.690
So we got 30 right here as you can see let me make a little bigger.

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.380
Dirty.

30
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.520
Perfect.

31
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.670
Next we got to make Torie's right.

32
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.230
So let's go ahead and make two arrays are going to call the first one is going to be a list array is

33
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.750
going to be just a regular array and then I use the array function right here to make this variable

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.280
an array.

35
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.870
Right.

36
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.200
So I'm going to put different values here and I'm going to divide the value by Colma right.

37
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.910
There we go.

38
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.020
Perfect.

39
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.610
So that's one array.

40
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.980
Then I'm going to make the other array.

41
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.530
And this is going to be a race has 0 for associative and also when I use the same for my right here.

42
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.210
But this all going to make a little difference so I'm just going to say number here.

43
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.470
That's going to be the key of the array.

44
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.190
And I'm going to point the value of it.

45
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.790
That's it.

46
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.170
That's an associate of array right here.

47
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.840
Right.

48
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.570
With a key of number and a value of 10.

49
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.520
Simple enough.

50
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.560
And we can Eckel equil the first array here this one.

51
00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.360
The second array I'm sorry and let's make sure it's the same name we could just copy and paste a year

52
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.410
into that.

53
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.750
So here we put brackets and we refer to the key of the array so that way we can print it out if we wanted

54
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.880
to.

55
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.550
Right.

56
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.630
So let's check that out real quick.

57
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.620
And you see we can see the value of 10 if you want to print out the other.

58
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.870
Let's make sure we concatenate this with a B or tag should right here.

59
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.650
Let's just go ahead and copy that one.

60
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.540
Put it above this one and let's just call the first one here right.

61
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.860
And first of all remember this is a regular array.

62
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.890
So we got to Acqua with the index of 0 and if we go back you see the in 0 was 23 the first one and then

63
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.200
this song is number right.

64
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.120
Simple enough.

65
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.920
To look at the instructions.

66
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.520
We don't have anything else perfect.

67
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.580
So we were able to complete this section successfully and hopefully you did the same.

68
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100
So I'll see you in the next section.

69
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.610
And good luck.

70
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.040
Thanks and see you in the next lectures
