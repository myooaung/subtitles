1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,940
All right so now we have a database.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,170
We have a table.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,810
We need to connect to it.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,360
So let's go to our editor.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,570
Let's open it up and let's create a folder.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,570
Inside I see a mess.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,950
All right so anyway here right click on it and let's create a folder here called includes.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,550
And the reason why actually I was creating a file sorry about that.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,650
Right click on the new folder includes the reason why we want to put up includes for this because we

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,230
don't want these files that we're going to be creating here into the public area.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,990
You see all these folders going to be in the public domain where we put our CMS system so we one day

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,040
conclude to have a really secure data that in there.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,500
All right.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,180
So in saying it this include less right click on it and create a new file.

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,880
And I'm going to call these the b b this is the father we are going to be using to create our connection.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,860
All right so let's open up the HP tagging here.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,520
We don't have to close it but I always like to close it anyway.

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,480
BHB knows that every day if you're not writing the amount this file you don't have to close it.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:21,160
But I like to if you don't write if you're not writing anything that needs like this file here and then

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,520
be that BHP this is going to be the connection.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm pretty sure we're not going to be using NEHTA mail.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:35,250
But again I'm just the way I am anyways for this is for us to connect to a database we need a function

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,640
call my Eskew our connect and we need to process some parameters.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,010
All right so we can this is really easy right now with past local holes this is always going to be the

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,580
name mostly for all servers even online or in real life.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:03,150
They're going to be a local holes and then we are going to be passing it user name and then we are going

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,720
to be passing it the password in this case is empty.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:16,640
And then the next one is a database name and thus it seems this is the easy way of connecting to it.

29
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,750
All right is not the correct way and surely the correct way of doing it.

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,270
And that's just a sign this is a variable.

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,330
It's not 100 percent correct way.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,250
Not that bad either but I'd like to.

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,240
Another way that I think is actually better.

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,610
So we're going to use that if they here just to make sure that our connection.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
It's good.

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,000
You know remember the steam is going to return true or false to us and we are assigning a variable to

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,410
it so that way we can manage it a lot easier.

38
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,690
All right so let's see if that connection is true.

39
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,030
We're going to see we are connected.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,470
All right.

41
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,450
If it's not we're not going to see anything.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,890
So let's make sure that we close that let's open this.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,250
Click on it.

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,270
Let's first see this file right here and then just click on it.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,550
So reason doesn't want to click on it lets you go manually here.

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,500
I don't know what is going on with my editor.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,140
The edge is maybe a crash or something I don't know.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,590
Let's just go ahead and google locally is this.

49
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,490
All right let's go ahead and include the view right here.

50
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,090
We are connected.

51
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,870
All right.

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,260
So we know we are connected there.

53
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,560
There we go.

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,790
Now it works.

55
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,920
All right so that's the easiest way to connect to a database.

56
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,740
Let me show you the way that I like to do it.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:59,870
Let me show you two more ways of doing actually the B and probably seen this before in mine.

58
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,080
So we're going to say the user We're going to say localhost to this.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,370
So we just type we just save everything in variables.

60
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,850
That's the way we do it.

61
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,430
Some of us do it and we put these values in here instead of this.

62
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,320
All right.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,350
Now I always like to be very secure with my data.

64
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm going to show you the most secure way of doing this.

65
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,620
And a more secure way of actually connected to a database and have all these information here is by

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,310
converting these values into constants.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,870
Right now we can go ahead and convert this into variables and put these values in here just.

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,860
That just makes it easier for us to use this function right here.

69
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,380
Right.

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,660
Makes it more organized.

71
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:56,520
But I want to put all these value what my idea is to make this as constants but it would take me a long

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,100
time to write each constant down or I don't know I have a really cool little trick that I do and that

73
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,450
I put all these values into an array.

74
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:23,030
So for example I may do that Kito the array the host and I just put locavores in here.

75
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,570
Just copy this year.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,590
Right.

77
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,550
And then you copy and paste or all of it written down.

78
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,900
And then of course there's the user TV pass.

79
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,890
And if you don't remember how to make grades go back to the lecture.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,540
And that way you can get some more.

81
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,000
I know.

82
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,340
You know we've got lives and we get pretty busy and we forget.

83
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,240
So I'm just assigning the values here to the array.

84
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,730
So we've got to accumulate all these data all these data right here into the array called the B.

85
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,770
That's all I'm doing right now.

86
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,680
So don't get confused on that is really easy.

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,820
All right so we have the key in this array call the host is going to have this data and that the user

88
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,390
is going to have this data and so on and so on.

89
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,140
All right.

90
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,120
What I really want to do is convert this into constants so I'm going to use a function that is going

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,640
to loop through this array is going to uppercase this and is going to grab this value and convert it

92
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,670
into what is going to grab this whole thing and convert it into a constant.

93
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,160
I'll show you right now.

94
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,890
Remember the loop that loops through on the rate for each member remember that.

95
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,340
So that for each loop is the one that does that.

96
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:56,900
And we're going to loop through the array called D-B as what as a key we can do it like this.

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,510
And the key is going to be value right.

98
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,840
So we're going to have a couple of things we're going to have the key which is right here we're going

99
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,430
to use that.

100
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,950
The reason why we were using this one here right now.

101
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,600
I forgot the little arrow here because we're going to be uppercase in this.

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,030
Right so that's why I'm using this one this extra right here.

103
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
You probably saw this one before.

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,560
You're right and we're going to be using the keys so you can also use it for each like this.

105
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,010
Right.

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,470
So the function to make constants is like this if you don't remember and just writing it down real quick

107
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,370
and we can.

108
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,810
It's going to be something like this right.

109
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,200
If we make it a constant we make the first feel the constant.

110
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:51,390
It would be something like this local's So this would be a concept right here but I'm going to use this

111
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,310
function this loop here to make it for me.

112
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,140
All right.

113
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:04,140
So and then I use the function the fine say the function can use another function as D or 2 upper and

114
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,520
this is just going to uppercase the key in the key right now is this one.

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,780
Remember we need to uppercase that for a constant right to make a.

116
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,130
Constance.

117
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,160
Constance right.

118
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:22,630
Well so anyways it's actually really good practice to do the operation.

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:33,780
So let's convert the key that's actually uppercase and say here we just put a coma and we include the

120
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,350
value there also.

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,330
All right so I think we're good here.

122
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,260
If everything came out the right way.

123
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,650
Well actually before we do that we need to convert this into constants because right now this function

124
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,900
is doing it for us.

125
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,020
So right now we go like this and check it out.

126
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,510
Well it's actually working right now too.

127
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,480
It is still working.

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,820
All right.

129
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,050
Scott is converting it for us right now.

130
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:12,000
Actually this this is the one actually this is not this is the one connected right now so that's why

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,500
we're getting this data right here because we got this on here connecting.

132
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:23,760
So now it's not working so right now what we need to do is we need to use constants that we already

133
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,700
have because our loop is making it for us the host with uppercase everything because everything is uppercase

134
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,270
already for us the we pass and the name

135
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,770
you mean right.

136
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,090
So we go back to.

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,120
We still connect if I make any mistake here you see that we get all of this.

138
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,930
So right now we get this going right here and if we save it we are connected.

139
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,490
So this is just a little trick I learned along the way to do.

140
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,180
And hopefully you can use it to in your applications.

141
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,470
All right so now that we are connected to the database we need to go to the next lecture.

142
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,360
Anyway thank you so much and I see you then
