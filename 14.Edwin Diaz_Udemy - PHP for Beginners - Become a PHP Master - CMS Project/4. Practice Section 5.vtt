1

00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:01.910
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.920  -->  00:00:06.240
I really really am really proud of you for made it to Section 5.

3

00:00:06.480  -->  00:00:08.310
This is only believable right.

4

00:00:08.370  -->  00:00:14.370
I got a lot of lectures even if you made it to Section 5 you have learned a lot and if you haven't contact

5

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:17.070
me as soon as possible we need to talk or write.

6

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:20.500
But anyway let's go ahead and let's do Section 5.

7

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:26.520
We're going to go here to break the gap and find out BHB is the page.

8

00:00:26.520  -->  00:00:31.130
So what he's asking for us to do all right we got to use a previous math function.

9

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:34.120
Do anything here here.

10

00:00:34.190  -->  00:00:34.750
Equity.

11

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:37.380
We're going to actually look at that.

12

00:00:37.400  -->  00:00:40.620
Is going to echo and we use a shrink function.

13

00:00:40.620  -->  00:00:41.340
Here we go.

14

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:43.970
And we use a previous array function equipt.

15

00:00:44.010  -->  00:00:45.510
Pretty cool right.

16

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:47.550
You learn about pre-build functions.

17

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:49.040
Go ahead and use that.

18

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:53.440
And if you need to go back to the lecture go ahead and do that before you come here write positivity

19

00:00:53.480  -->  00:00:55.380
and go ahead and do it.

20

00:00:56.550  -->  00:00:56.830
All right.

21

00:00:56.850  -->  00:01:03.520
So if you post a video if you have not don't cheat or write but if you have positive vitriol then you're

22

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:09.750
able to do this or not but I'm going to help you out just in case you have not but this is going to

23

00:01:09.750  -->  00:01:11.000
be really simple.

24

00:01:11.010  -->  00:01:13.730
The first one is going to be a math function.

25

00:01:14.100  -->  00:01:15.330
Let's just do a neck on the.

26

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:16.030
How about that.

27

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:22.910
Let's just use a rand function to say you know what I want you to give me a random number from 1 to

28

00:01:22.910  -->  00:01:23.580
1000.

29

00:01:23.580  -->  00:01:25.980
How about do you remember that function right.

30

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:27.080
All right.

31

00:01:27.240  -->  00:01:35.130
So we're going to come here to the practice five and we've got some if we keep refreshing we keep getting

32

00:01:35.130  -->  00:01:36.050
different numbers.

33

00:01:36.060  -->  00:01:37.310
Oh we got one look at that.

34

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:39.530
That's odd press here.

35

00:01:39.540  -->  00:01:41.910
Look at the different numbers every time I refresh.

36

00:01:41.980  -->  00:01:44.070
Right so we got the math part done.

37

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:45.820
That was easier right.

38

00:01:46.090  -->  00:01:48.540
Let's use a string function.

39

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:49.640
All right so the string.

40

00:01:49.680  -->  00:01:51.270
What can we do with strings.

41

00:01:51.270  -->  00:01:55.950
All right so let's create a variable with a string because I could do that.

42

00:01:56.070  -->  00:02:00.450
I could do this in the Echo if I wanted to but I want you to see it like this.

43

00:02:01.110  -->  00:02:06.380
And let's just create some random strings see I'm going to type so fast you never seen this before.

44

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:09.570
Look there wasn't that fast.

45

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:12.060
That's how I usually type I'm just typing slow for you guys.

46

00:02:12.060  -->  00:02:12.720
Seriously.

47

00:02:12.840  -->  00:02:18.130
Well ladies every time I say guys I mean ladies are right so and guys of course.

48

00:02:18.320  -->  00:02:22.190
Let's do a new variable here called value length.

49

00:02:22.200  -->  00:02:24.970
This is just going to be the length here.

50

00:02:25.920  -->  00:02:27.980
Hopefully I'm typing this right.

51

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:29.670
But anyway doesn't really matter.

52

00:02:29.670  -->  00:02:35.310
Just a variable is going to hold the function as you are Len L..

53

00:02:35.490  -->  00:02:37.480
Well as to your L E.

54

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:42.580
And remember it's a function so we have the parentheses and then semi-colon.

55

00:02:42.780  -->  00:02:48.330
And what do we need to put here what do we need to find out the lento why this string right.

56

00:02:48.630  -->  00:02:52.080
So that's why we use a variable is a lot easier than typing this whole thing and putting this whole

57

00:02:52.080  -->  00:02:53.330
thing in there right.

58

00:02:53.850  -->  00:02:55.540
And it's cleaner too.

59

00:02:56.070  -->  00:03:02.760
So we're going to do that and then we're holding this in a variable here because that way we can do

60

00:03:02.760  -->  00:03:04.250
all the things with it right.

61

00:03:04.410  -->  00:03:06.780
Super simple to do that.

62

00:03:07.150  -->  00:03:07.440
Right.

63

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:10.370
And I'm just going to echo this.

64

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:13.640
I like to separate it here so you can see what I'm doing.

65

00:03:13.890  -->  00:03:15.930
And then just put a B or attack here.

66

00:03:15.930  -->  00:03:20.010
Actually I should put a B tag here.

67

00:03:20.480  -->  00:03:21.540
But that's fine.

68

00:03:21.550  -->  00:03:27.150
You will be able to see it there let's just put something here.

69

00:03:27.240  -->  00:03:31.350
I wish BHP would do this automatically for me but I guess it doesn't do it.

70

00:03:31.910  -->  00:03:33.780
You know like a B or Taggert.

71

00:03:33.990  -->  00:03:34.990
But anyway.

72

00:03:35.430  -->  00:03:38.770
And I will put a the artwork for the next one here just in case.

73

00:03:38.810  -->  00:03:40.130
Let's equity's value.

74

00:03:40.440  -->  00:03:45.300
And as you can see here we have value 26 characters in here.

75

00:03:45.300  -->  00:03:50.940
So if I start counting I'm going to get to 26 or if I put one more saving and come back here refresh

76

00:03:51.250  -->  00:03:53.820
We've got 27 and this is changing automatically.

77

00:03:53.820  -->  00:03:55.100
That's awesome right.

78

00:03:55.110  -->  00:03:58.540
So then that's one pre-build array function.

79

00:03:58.560  -->  00:04:01.410
Ooh this is going to be a hard one right.

80

00:04:01.740  -->  00:04:03.830
On every function.

81

00:04:04.170  -->  00:04:06.960
How in the world am I going to do that.

82

00:04:07.440  -->  00:04:08.220
All right.

83

00:04:08.220  -->  00:04:09.630
Come on guys.

84

00:04:09.630  -->  00:04:11.200
Talking to the expert here.

85

00:04:11.340  -->  00:04:13.980
So let's go ahead and do a raise.

86

00:04:13.980  -->  00:04:21.450
So what I want to do is how I'm going to use an RE function called in array we're going to find something

87

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:22.580
inside an array.

88

00:04:22.590  -->  00:04:27.960
I don't know if I did that on the lecture I probably did but we're going to set here a variable that

89

00:04:27.960  -->  00:04:30.000
I want to find as a matter of fact you know why

90

00:04:33.330  -->  00:04:35.370
I'm feeling creative.

91

00:04:35.520  -->  00:04:42.790
You know what we are going to insert this string of full of characters inside and out our array.

92

00:04:42.960  -->  00:04:44.730
I said it correctly there.

93

00:04:44.820  -->  00:04:50.310
All right so all we have to do now is just create an array called I Don't Know What do you want to create

94

00:04:50.530  -->  00:04:54.160
called these are the numbers or values.

95

00:04:54.180  -->  00:04:56.120
This is named values.

96

00:04:56.170  -->  00:04:58.270
Now be creative to the right.

97

00:04:58.590  -->  00:04:58.890
All right.

98

00:04:58.890  -->  00:05:04.090
And this just create this create a new array while creating old ones.

99

00:05:04.240  -->  00:05:05.510
Skree this one.

100

00:05:05.910  -->  00:05:08.670
And we're going to put some values in here.

101

00:05:08.730  -->  00:05:20.730
I'm going to pull some strings and some numbers and some more strains and some more numbers and here

102

00:05:20.750  -->  00:05:23.600
I am going to put this string variable here.

103

00:05:23.610  -->  00:05:29.060
I just want to show you that an array takes anything anything.

104

00:05:29.070  -->  00:05:36.240
All right so now that we made a r r r r we now we need to use the function to find out if we found something

105

00:05:36.240  -->  00:05:36.840
right.

106

00:05:37.050  -->  00:05:38.040
So how do we do this.

107

00:05:38.040  -->  00:05:41.420
All right so we first use the in array function.

108

00:05:41.610  -->  00:05:45.440
You see my code is already highlighting this pretty cool right.

109

00:05:46.170  -->  00:05:48.840
And then what do we want to find.

110

00:05:48.840  -->  00:05:53.620
Well the first thing that we need to do is actually tell it what we are finding right.

111

00:05:53.670  -->  00:05:57.070
So what is it that we're finding we're finding a string right here.

112

00:05:57.240  -->  00:05:59.430
That's why we need to find string.

113

00:05:59.490  -->  00:06:01.520
Or we could have done it from here.

114

00:06:01.590  -->  00:06:02.500
Really the matter.

115

00:06:02.670  -->  00:06:05.830
And then next thing is where we are going to be finding this.

116

00:06:05.950  -->  00:06:10.050
We're going to be finding the values are very perfect.

117

00:06:10.050  -->  00:06:14.300
So now this function has that it found this somewhere right.

118

00:06:14.310  -->  00:06:15.260
We found it.

119

00:06:15.570  -->  00:06:19.410
So how are we going to be using this to display it.

120

00:06:19.460  -->  00:06:19.820
All right.

121

00:06:19.830  -->  00:06:24.330
So first of all we are going to be you know what.

122

00:06:24.420  -->  00:06:28.510
I'm just going to make a variable your code name.

123

00:06:28.540  -->  00:06:28.860
Right.

124

00:06:28.860  -->  00:06:33.520
And look what I'm going to use because I want you to be creative like this.

125

00:06:33.720  -->  00:06:44.010
And I if found remember that this the if statement would bring me true or false this will bring me true

126

00:06:44.040  -->  00:06:45.560
or false.

127

00:06:45.690  -->  00:06:51.560
So if true then I'm going to echo something Aure.

128

00:06:51.660  -->  00:07:00.410
So if we find it then we're going to say wow wow wow we did it together.

129

00:07:00.750  -->  00:07:01.830
That sounded cheesy there.

130

00:07:01.830  -->  00:07:04.260
Sorry guys we did it together.

131

00:07:05.710  -->  00:07:07.380
Said it too fast.

132

00:07:07.380  -->  00:07:13.500
All right else.

133

00:07:13.660  -->  00:07:14.880
All right.

134

00:07:14.880  -->  00:07:18.340
We say something like we messed up.

135

00:07:19.200  -->  00:07:21.490
We missed it.

136

00:07:21.510  -->  00:07:23.980
Could not find it.

137

00:07:24.010  -->  00:07:25.090
I get into character guy.

138

00:07:25.090  -->  00:07:26.090
Sorry.

139

00:07:26.190  -->  00:07:28.950
Can now find.

140

00:07:29.010  -->  00:07:31.050
There we go.

141

00:07:31.050  -->  00:07:31.280
All right.

142

00:07:31.280  -->  00:07:37.590
I think we're good here we don't get any BHB errors here and we're going to be tagged there so let's

143

00:07:37.590  -->  00:07:39.000
see that refresh.

144

00:07:39.330  -->  00:07:41.060
Oh wow.

145

00:07:41.220  -->  00:07:42.320
We found it.

146

00:07:42.330  -->  00:07:48.660
Let's see if for some reason we don't find this so what do we do.

147

00:07:48.660  -->  00:07:49.030
Right.

148

00:07:49.030  -->  00:07:52.620
If we if it doesn't find its value let's take it out.

149

00:07:53.190  -->  00:07:56.370
Let's take out these value and see what happens.

150

00:07:57.070  -->  00:07:59.090
Whoops.

151

00:07:59.100  -->  00:07:59.920
Stick it out.

152

00:07:59.940  -->  00:08:01.050
Refresh.

153

00:08:01.050  -->  00:08:01.830
We messed up.

154

00:08:01.830  -->  00:08:09.020
We could not find mystery cannot find it.

155

00:08:09.060  -->  00:08:11.060
We go refresh.

156

00:08:11.270  -->  00:08:12.870
We metho we cannot find it.

157

00:08:12.870  -->  00:08:18.140
So hopefully this lecture here will gave you some really good idea on what you can do.

158

00:08:18.240  -->  00:08:18.740
All right.

159

00:08:18.900  -->  00:08:23.520
Now you can you know be a little creative and use some of the things that I showed you already.

160

00:08:23.520  -->  00:08:25.620
And you know improvise.

161

00:08:25.710  -->  00:08:29.310
But anyway thank you so much for watching this and I'll see you in the next section.

162

00:08:29.310  -->  00:08:30.150
Take care.
