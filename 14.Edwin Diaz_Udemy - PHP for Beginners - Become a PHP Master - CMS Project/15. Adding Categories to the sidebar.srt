1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,170
All right so our searching engines is working.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,030
We have dynamic data here from category's we have a polls right now.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,500
Now that we finish this section here with a custom search engine Let's go and jump into the blog category

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,940
and we want to display some data there and hopefully we have time to this place and data here on this

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,440
lecture.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,600
All right so let's go ahead and do this.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,960
So we need to go back to sidebar while we are there.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,530
I'm there.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,500
So if you're not.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,980
Make sure you are in sidebar and we need to go to where Actually this is search.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,940
Let's go to a sidebar right here.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,490
So we are this is a search area and below that is their categories Blug category as well and that's

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,810
find the end of that and this one has a long place there.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,270
So right so what can we do here.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,570
Let's first thing we will be doing is getting some ph being here.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,820
We need to get a query going.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,660
That way we can display some data from our database.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,750
Now we do have a query if you remember and that is the category query.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,830
We can go get that in the navigation size and go to navigation and we can see here that we have a little

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,090
bit here of this data so we're going to copy this.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,470
We're going to take it back to the sidebar.

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:39,240
And I think I'm debating where to put these data and say Here let's just put it this is put some PH

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,860
BE TAXED for us.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,230
Use the control Z or command Z to undo whatever mistake I make.

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,690
All right.

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:56,160
And as I do it while selecting it and pressing command right bracket or left bracket I can organize

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,970
data also like this.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
All right.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,760
On we will organize some of this stuff.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,240
All right so we are selecting everything from categories and here we just going to make changes a little

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,830
bit.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,260
Select select categories

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,690
sidebar.

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,780
I like to change the name of my query that way they are descriptive for what they are doing and that's

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,570
changed right here.

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,360
Also we're going to be displaying the category title there.

37
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,100
Actually yes that's what we're going to be displayed on.

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,420
We're going to put some posters in there also.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,180
Well right now we're just going to display the category.

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,670
All right so the category will be.

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,790
And let's see.

42
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,510
We get some of these data here.

43
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,690
All right.

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,260
So we're going to have to turn off BHB again and get all this data inside there so that we can display

45
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,230
a categories right.

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,730
But we don't want to get the while loop around all of this because it's going to be duplicating the

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,470
whole Bhatt's want to be duplicating the Allied tax only.

48
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,730
So we're going to be put into a WHILE loop in there.

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:21,370
So let's go ahead and take that out.

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,010
Let's pull the WOW.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,170
Right here.

52
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:38,780
Actually below the you well whoops this is right here.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:50,970
Of course we're lose BHP tags again.

54
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,230
All right.

55
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,510
So

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,410
shall we fix that

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,450
title I think it's good already.

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,850
I mean we have everything we need right here right.

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,930
Oh we got to do is just delete this

60
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:24,600
and take this up with it a bit and we should be good to go right to have these data like this because

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,220
I want you to see it on the screen.

62
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,680
I have a really neat and nice for me.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,250
But you won't be able to see as clear as you see it right now.

64
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,780
All right some of you I'm over the vices are why everybody to be able to see this.

65
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,270
So let's go ahead and check that out and see where we are if we see anything and if everything came

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,300
out good.

67
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,900
All right.

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,740
So let's go ahead and check it out.

69
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,620
Go to the front page.

70
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,480
So we have some categories right here as you can see bootstrap javascript BHB and Jawa.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,970
They will display beautiful make this a little smaller.

72
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,110
And the reason I'm doing that so that way you can see that one is on the right side and the other ones

73
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,500
on the left side.

74
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,200
Right.

75
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,950
So we've got some categories in this plan already.

76
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,360
We're going to get some more.

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,400
All right so we might be displaying just some picture here on the right side later on.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,030
But anyway I want to get this done here real quick.

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm going to take.

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,670
Let's just see that this well right here.

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,250
So what I want to do as well is I want to be be this to be I want this to be like a widget that we can

82
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,830
clear whenever we want.

83
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,220
Right.

84
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,350
We can put some data or something.

85
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,340
So it's a matter of fact.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,110
This is

87
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,800
this just take out the whole thing out of here and let's include it somewhere else.

88
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,560
BHP

89
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:18,330
this function include what do we want included we are in the clothes for this so let's just leave it

90
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,300
right here and let's call it widget widget up.

91
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,100
Be close.

92
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,400
That's it.

93
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:38,190
And I just want to make a fire and I'm going to call this widgets widget that ph be where you go and

94
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,690
just paste that in there.

95
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:47,600
That way we have this Widger here that we can do things with you know.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,080
Right.

97
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,500
Right.

98
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,950
So I think we're done let's check it out to see if everything's working fine.

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,930
We don't have any errors.

100
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,720
So everything is looking good.

101
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,440
All right.

102
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,870
So anyways I think we're dealing with a category C or another trick I wanted to show you is that we

103
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,060
could limit this categories here by let's say let's limit it to three so that way you can see right

104
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:20,970
now showing 4 we can limit the categories by using another Kohary and where I we have to make an arc

105
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,080
where we just have to modify what we got.

106
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:31,610
So we were in sidebar and let's just see we were here right here and we were making inquiry right here

107
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,860
so select everything from categories.

108
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:44,420
Limit this limit this to three and see how that goes.

109
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,120
And as you can see we are limited into three results.

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,660
All right.

111
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
Just know that you can't limit them.

112
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,830
I'm not going to do that right now we probably do that later on when we have a lot of categories but

113
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,250
let's not set a limit for that right now.

114
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,630
We are displaying some data.

115
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,750
What I will erase is this right here.

116
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,190
Since we have no space for that right now let's just take that off and we might display the images here

117
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,540
later on or maybe some more categories.

118
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,340
All right but it's a matter of fact and you see just take this.

119
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,970
Well it's right here.

120
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,780
This one here and there.

121
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,460
So this divide this one's here

122
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:42,740
and let's just take it off take it off completely and we make this 12.

123
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:51,220
Let's make this stand all the way down to 12 sets means half and 12 means this is a column.

124
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,780
Great system we bootstrap and I have a course in that if you're interested.

125
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,960
So right now it's expanding all the way across this right here.

126
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,460
So our categories could be long as this.

127
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,850
All right.

128
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,540
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

129
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,650
Take care.
