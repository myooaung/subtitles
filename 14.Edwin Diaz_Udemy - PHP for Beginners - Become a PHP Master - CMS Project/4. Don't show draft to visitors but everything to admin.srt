1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,210
Who welcome back my students on this lecture we are going to take this a little bit further.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:06,810
Right.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,190
A little bit more advanced because I want you to learn something new.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:17,170
So now we have added two functionalities right we have the functionality for the home page for the categories

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,400
so we're not shown pools.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,400
If it's a category but what if we are an administrator of the site and you know we of course we want

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,020
to be able to see that categories of course we want to be able to see our pools in the home page.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,580
Right.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,080
Because we might be making some changes and we want to see that reflect want to see those changes reflect

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,290
on the content right.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,050
So what can we do when that is the choice right.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,370
So basically we want to see the pause if even if they are own draft.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,870
But if we are logged in if we're not logged then that means we or somebody else and we don't want to

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,190
see it.

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,780
We want to see this no pools available right.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,470
So if we are administrator we see a we're not administrator we don't see it.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,750
So how can we do that.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,250
Well let's actually do it.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,290
Let me show you right now if we go to View polls you can still view the individual post because we having

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,930
added that functionality to hide it right when he's on draft.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,900
And this is where I'm going to show you the sample how to do this when you are logged in.

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,620
How to see and when you logged in in Tennessee and when you log out.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,900
So let's go to the cold real quick.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,370
Re-imposed that BHP were going to be creating this.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,700
All right.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,760
So right now if we click on here the next tag is right here.

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,430
I think we should move this all the way to the bottom.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,470
All right.

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:58,000
So let's move this all the way to the bottom right here and then we're going to make sure that it works.

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,390
Let's just organizes a little bit here

31
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,160
and save it.

32
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,600
Let's just make sure that it works.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,250
All right.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,280
I didn't break anything.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
He works fine.

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,980
All right one thing that I went and fetched this head here is bothering me.

37
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,150
Let's just take care of that real quick and not take too much time with it.

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,150
Where is it right here.

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,050
I'm just going to call this place and take this out of there.

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,020
Come back here and refresh as you can see.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,800
There we go.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,550
All right.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:44,460
So this is the way I'm going to do it here we we're doing this dating or view views for the post-up

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,960
functionality that we added.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,260
That's fine.

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,450
We'll probably change that in the future.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,560
But right now we will leave it that way it is.

48
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,680
So this is the way I'm going to do this.

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,070
I'm going to check first if we are logged in.

50
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,830
Right so if we set the session

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,330
Well that's a lot of

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,880
if we have a user session.

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,660
All right.

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,710
If we set and admin

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,710
then we are logged in right as an admin.

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,840
Perfect.

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:44,810
So what I'm going to do is well for admin I want to make a query with everything.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,280
Yes I want to be able to see everything.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,130
If not admin I'm going to put it else they mean right here.

60
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:00,450
I'm going to grab this Querrey from here and cut it and we're going to put another conditional here

61
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,450
so select all from polls were foresight equals false ID and rightful status

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,750
equals publish.

63
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,880
So for regular people which is which is show the published ones.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,960
All right.

65
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,080
Beautiful right.

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,420
All right.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,830
But we still have the problem when we are we don't have a.

68
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,040
No polls available right.

69
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,380
So if we refresh here we still see this because we love then.

70
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,140
All right.

71
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,180
But let's look now and let's see how this looks.

72
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,980
First I'm going to copy this top here so that we can come back to it.

73
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,030
So let's see what this is going to do the way it is right now he's not 100 percent right.

74
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,400
It's going to go to admin.

75
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,280
And I love how I'm going to pay that link that I just copy from there and we can see or see that we

76
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,650
we still have to work on it.

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,040
But we did not we're not showing the polls.

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,160
Let's look again again.

79
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,420
All right.

80
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,240
So let's go to the individual post.

81
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,050
All right.

82
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,740
So you need to work on it.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,930
All right so work.

84
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:25,800
Well we can do here is we can do the same thing we did here in category or in that BHP we created this

85
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,040
ICU known roles we can do the rules so we can do something like that.

86
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,450
There

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:45,300
you know actually this has the same name so else this horror.

88
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:55,470
So these else we can put this else all the way to the bottom and we can't even put it with this guy

89
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,650
right here else.

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,380
Let's check it out real quick and see other looks at him break anything that looks like it worked right.

91
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,200
Let's look out right here in this page that oops I don't have that individual polls.

92
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,740
That sucks.

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,840
I'm going to have to log in again and graph

94
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,750
these polls right here.

95
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:31,470
Copy this logo based that in there.

96
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,800
And now we don't see the polls.

97
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,080
If we are logged now.

98
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,140
But if we are low again we can see it.

99
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,320
So let's look again again.

100
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,610
Rico and I are going to tell you my password.

101
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,050
Let's just paste that link in there.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,080
And we are able to see everything there.

103
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,870
So this is how you can actually do this functionality.

104
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,210
All right.

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,850
Beautiful.

106
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,370
Let me see what else can we do here.

107
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,350
I think this is it.

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
This is what we get.

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,730
This is the best we can do for now.

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
All right.

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:13,860
If you want you can clean up this cold a little bit and you can take all this out a year like this functionality

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,820
from there and you can put it anywhere you want.

113
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,670
All right.

114
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,010
You can put even a function right here instead of all these code refactor this.

115
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,430
Take this back to functions that BHB and make this a create common function and you called it right

116
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,360
here.

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,800
All right so it's up to you to clean it up if you are one already showing how to refactoring the early

118
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,950
years earlier lectures.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
All right.

120
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,630
So beautiful.

121
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,560
Now you can implement this to your whole CMAC.

122
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,660
You can implement it to your home page.

123
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,870
Implement this to your job to your category pages and I will be implementing it.

124
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,690
So don't ask me later on you know how to do this because I'm already showing you.

125
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:08,460
So if you see it on my CIMS on the next lectures you know that I did it I changed it myself so I'm going

126
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:16,140
to change the home page and going to change the category to make it look like the post like the individual

127
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,030
polls one.

128
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,210
All right.

129
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,020
To make it like this only available if we are logged in even if they are on draft.

130
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,680
All right.

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,020
So now let me show you let me just make this real quick.

132
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,520
Draft's right.

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,360
Actually they are draft ballots just to publish real quick just to make sure that they're are still

134
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,660
available for everybody else.

135
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,000
So they are all home page categories intact.

136
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,760
And if we go to their individual polls it is showing for everybody else.

137
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,530
Beautiful.

138
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,420
It is working.

139
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,310
It's perfect.

140
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,550
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next two lectures.
