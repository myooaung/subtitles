00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,220
Hi welcome back.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,400
This is really getting really exciting right.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,280
Well on the last video we saw how we created a class and we added a method inside the class.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,410
Now we need to find a way to actually start using those functionalities right.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,710
So let's go ahead and open our coeditor what we are.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:28,350
While we will be doing this lecture here is instantiating instantiating a we're going to create an instance

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,420
of this class.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:29,880
Right.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,270
We're going to make this work basically we are going to be calling the functionality inside the class.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Right.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,620
So we know that we have this class here called car right.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,580
And you can call this an object already because we have the functions right.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,150
We have we will have the properties there.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,880
Well we don't have it yet but the way we create an object is we need to instantiating this class here.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,290
All right.

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,940
Now we'll show you in a minute how we do that this first before I Confucianist first do Aceves here

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,520
and it's to on underscored three.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,970
All right.

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,890
And right now I have a whole bunch of different turns turns for the things that we do in programming

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,810
and you need to learn a couple of them.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,520
All right.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,390
So that way you can be in sync to what's going on right.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,050
So we have the class here and we are checking methods.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,870
But right now we don't need to do that.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,970
Let's just take this off.

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,560
All right.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,540
So we created a class right here.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,730
We create a functionality.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,630
How do we start using this functionality.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,590
That is the question right does the million dollar question.

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,210
Well very simple.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:51,140
We use the name of this here but we first use a keyword called new and then we use that name with parentheses.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,620
Boom.

34
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,580
Done that.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,840
That way we can start using this.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,840
Now we need another way of actually holding this value here.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:08,370
This is very simple to when we create raise or create functions to that we save into variables and do

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,410
things with it very similar to that.

39
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:18,990
So what I want to do is create a variable and then I use over well to hold this this class here with

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,960
all the functionality inside.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,610
Then I use terms that are very normal right.

42
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,260
Basically what we are what we will be doing is creating a new instance of this because we can create

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,820
many of them.

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,550
So I'm going to actually call this let's just call this.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,730
All right let's just.

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
All right let's call the BMW.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,300
All right.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,780
You know I'm so descriptive with my names.

49
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,690
And so now I create a new object.

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,220
This is an object now.

51
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,110
All right.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,600
So we created a new instance of this class here but you can actually call this an object right because

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,930
an object is you know a group of data related that you know by a common theme.

54
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,720
Right.

55
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,000
So this is an object now that we have this W of we can go ahead and you know what we can create another

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,530
one we can call this I don't know Mercedes and thus for me say these bands I like nice cars.

57
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,160
What can I say.

58
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,090
Mercedes Benz right there right.

59
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,230
So we create another instance of the object of this class I'm sorry and you can call these objects if

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,920
you want.

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,450
And how do we start using this.

62
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,570
How do we start using the most the functionality.

63
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:42,060
How do we start moving the wheels drive of the BMW for example.

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,160
So right now what I want to do is I'm want to move the wheels of that BMW right.

65
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,060
And this is just a figure of speech.

66
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,580
We know that we can move the wheels would echo.

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,860
But imagine that we had this whole bunch of functionality inside this method here.

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,530
How do we activate it.

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,680
Very simple.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,140
We grabbed the BMW right.

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,740
We use a minus and the arrow a greater than symbol and we say you know why.

72
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,000
We moved house wheels.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,010
Now BMW boom and the wheels are moving right here.

74
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,590
OK.

75
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,980
This is how you start using it so you grab that object.

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,390
The name of it the instance and you say move wheels.

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:24,870
All right.

78
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,360
So we have that what about these other Mercedes what are we going to do with this car.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,300
We've got to raise.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
Yes why not.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,300
This race.

82
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,940
So I'm going to grab this one too and I'm going to say you know what I need you to race.

83
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,150
You need to go with this guy too.

84
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,270
So let's go ahead and ask for it.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,060
Let's use the same thing here.

86
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,320
Mercedes and then move wheels.

87
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,640
Boom cities right in front of it when they're being built is going to win this race is behind right

88
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:56,980
now.

89
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,860
Who's going to win.

90
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,370
So let's go ahead and do that.

91
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,280
Let's win.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,640
All right.

93
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:04,840
Whoops.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,590
We saved it.

95
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,760
We're supposed to save it on the on the fall here.

96
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,540
I don't know why I keep saving that there.

97
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,540
There we go.

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,380
So be in though.

99
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,540
When in front of a gang and so on that's all.

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,730
So you get my point or we can call this many times and we can create as many instances as we want to.

101
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,590
This is how we can start using the functionality inside that class.

102
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,550
Right.

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,730
So anyways Hopefully you were able to learn a lot on this one here.

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,240
And if you have any questions I'm here 24/7 we're not 24/7 but I'm here for you.

105
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,130
So these students I know this was really exciting for you because it was really exciting for me.

106
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,080
Now you might not see a lot of functionality but keep this in mind we are actually creating objects

107
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,510
now.

108
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:54,460
We are actually creating functionality that is that you can use to create games.

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,510
Right.

110
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,960
There are a lot of programming languages out there that you could use like Java Sea or any other language

111
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,980
to create really really really high definition games.

112
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,730
But anyway ph are a really great language to learn and this will help you knowing all P is going to

113
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,710
help you create really advanced web sites.

114
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,450
All right.

115
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,400
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you.

116
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:19,890
And that's one
