00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:06,750
Welcome back many students do you have an idea or request for this project that we're building now is

2

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:09,770
your chance to post it right here in this lecture.

3

00:00:09,810  -->  00:00:15,110
Some of you I think most of you should have a right hand side bar on this specific lecture that you're

4

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:18,590
watching on the sidebar if you're going top.

5

00:00:18,600  -->  00:00:23,970
There should be some tabs that you can click on to make a discussion on this lecture.

6

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:28,350
I want you to post your idea your requests right here and this lecture.

7

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:31,730
That way I can come and look at all the requests in this lecture.

8

00:00:31,740  -->  00:00:35,610
I don't have to go and search for it all the way through the course.

9

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:37,910
So if you have a couple of seconds maybe a minute or two.

10

00:00:37,920  -->  00:00:41,120
Or if you have an idea which is the main thing right.

11

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:44,070
If you don't have an idea then you can do anything right.

12

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:48,390
But if you have an idea please take a couple of seconds a couple of minutes to post it right here.

13

00:00:48,390  -->  00:00:53,490
We appreciate it very much is going to help you is going to help your classmates and overall is going

14

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:56,580
to help me make everything better for everybody else.

15

00:00:56,820  -->  00:01:00,650
So I want to thank you for being in this lecture for being in my course.

16

00:01:00,780  -->  00:01:05,970
And I'm looking forward to see your idea your requests for this CIMS project.

17

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:06,390
Take care
