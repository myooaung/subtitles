1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,880
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here we're going to be updating every user page.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,620
All right.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,500
Since we already modified our password encryption we have to also modify that page.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,480
So we're going to log in and I'll show you what I mean a minute if I can.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,760
Again that would be nice.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,790
One two and three.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,740
There we go.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,100
So let's go to users of your users and we have these user right here.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,090
All right.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,220
We also have the files right here I'm going to show you what I mean if you remember when we are logging

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,710
in.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,050
Let me show you the log in

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,030
here.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,400
We have this new hashing going on here.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,760
I mean we have the PP-ASEL verify when we're when we are logging in but we are also hashing the passwords

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,320
in the registration.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,570
So if I go to registration I mean if I can find it right here we remember that we use a password hash.

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,240
All right.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,890
So we also need to edit that on the Edit user page.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,680
So right here what we're going to be doing is we're going to be leading a lot of stuff here because

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,050
we don't need it anymore.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,770
All right.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,530
So we don't need this here.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,900
No need this right.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,080
And

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,820
it's fine we need is that's OK.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,430
And we don't need this either.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,620
All right.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,300
All right so and

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,950
don't need this.

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,640
All right.

32
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,280
So if it's not empty.

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,200
All right so if the past is now empty that's fine.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,460
Let's go ahead and do this here.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,520
Let's query for

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,510
a password right here.

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:14,910
So this Querrey the NSA select we're going to select

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,230
all from

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:39,750
from users where and I believe his User ID equals the user ID that we got up here here.

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,020
All right.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,720
All right.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,830
Perfect.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,130
And then we're going to said we're going to say get user right.

44
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,040
So we get the user and we send it in with my ask you lie of course.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,930
Fetch.

46
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,630
Actually you mice here like Querrey which still function.

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,610
We use a connection and we use equerry.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,430
All right.

49
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,520
Perfect.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
And we confirm it

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,540
from a user

52
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,800
that's confirmed this real quick and make sure everything is OK.

53
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,100
All right good user equerries fine.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,800
All right.

55
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,920
So what do we want to bring from the user.

56
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,130
What we want to bring in the user password so we could say row.

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,290
And as a matter of fact we could we just have to check our database.

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,640
And I'm going to do that right now.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:08,990
Let's go to Peachi my admin and check that column there and see if I'm just right here show you.

60
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,480
Let's go to the database

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,870
and the user and the column is the user password.

62
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,420
All right.

63
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,770
So we can instead of actually selecting all of every day let's select just a password.

64
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,590
All right celestially Let's do this select user password and that's it.

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,220
Right.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,520
And that's just going to select one from there.

67
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:45,680
So that way we get one result and we just say miss you like fetch array.

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,050
All right.

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,960
We just used this.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,460
Perfect.

71
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,380
All right.

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,850
So we get one roll back and now we got to do is say this the user password.

73
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,830
All right.

74
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,050
Rowe

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,120
user password.

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,950
Perfect.

77
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,050
Right.

78
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,990
So this is the first part on the second lecture this one here we're going to complete this.

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,010
But I hope you see where this is going.

80
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,770
Right.

81
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:34,150
So basically what we're doing if is if if it's not empty right this field the user password then we

82
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,920
get to do this Querrey we're going to select user password from users where a user ID has user ID right

83
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,160
here actually.

84
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,660
Hold on.

85
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,540
Let me make sure it's the same idea because right now there's a lot of the same right.

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,210
I would go.

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:57,060
And then we send the querying with my ask you like query we confirm it and then we get the roll here

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,750
we don't need to do a loop get that the user password.

89
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,620
So that way we can compare it with other passwords.

90
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,490
All right.

91
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,790
So the next lecture we're going to do that.

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,620
Thank you so much.

93
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,360
And I see you then.

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,980
Take care.
