WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.530
All right so we are displaying some data we can list on data and we already made the edit post page

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.990
right.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.820
So we type a condition here.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.820
Source equals it posed.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.880
We go to that specific page right now what we need to do is actually put a link here.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.110
So when we click and we go to that specific post speech and edit that specific post.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.790
Right.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.400
So first of all let's go to that page right now and there should be View polls.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.870
We're going to be adding a link right here at the end of the delete.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.180
I don't know where I got to semi-colons there but just took it off and go ahead and check this out.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.460
So the lead we want to edit to be actually before delete the list should be the last I think.

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.220
All right.

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:03.390
So what we want to pass here is the same because we this get request should be going to that same page

14
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.480
posts because we have the switch statement here.

15
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.350
All right.

16
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.040
And then we're going to pass it a parameter to go to that page and the.

17
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.850
The parameters are going to be added.

18
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.670
Post right.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.450
That's a parameter we passed to go to that page and then here I show you a new technique that you don't

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.370
know yet.

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.290
Well I actually show this in my course but that's in the beginning where I talk about GET requests and

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.900
this is just to the Vaj the parameters see we can set multiple parameters but we need to divide the

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.240
values by using an ampersand right.

24
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.420
That's how we divide the value.

25
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.470
And I'm going to call this new parameter p we haven't made it yet but P ID we're making it right now.

26
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.700
And that's going to be equal to the post ID.

27
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.120
Right.

28
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.620
So I think we're done here and this is going to say it.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.560
So let's go and check that out right now.

30
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:12.090
Should work if I refresh here and I click Edit it takes me to actually take me to the edit page.

31
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.310
Sorry about that.

32
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.640
All right.

33
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.600
That's I forgot something here.

34
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.740
And of course I did forget to add the source.

35
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.030
We need to add this source source key and that shoe fits it.

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.410
All right.

37
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.770
Let's go back into it again.

38
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.640
I did see that and passing two parameters up here.

39
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.100
This source and it's posed to take me to this page.

40
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:50.040
And then the P underscore ID for post ID to this specific post and this is how most of the see M-S is

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.250
in the world the big ones do it bason different parameters as a matter of fact Google does that.

42
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.880
They pass like 10 Parama to see you are.

43
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.780
So this is how you get information across.

44
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.370
All right so now that we have that information we need to actually catch it somewhere.

45
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.310
So lets just make this smaller.

46
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.930
I don't know why my editor keeps making.

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.000
I don't know if it's me or the editor making this bigger here.

48
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.600
All right.

49
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.940
So let's go to another page here where we can get a query that we already have.

50
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.260
I think we are on that page right now as a matter of fact.

51
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.950
Yeah we are on the page.

52
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.270
All right.

53
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.450
So let's take this query out of here because we're going to use it.

54
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.820
All right.

55
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.520
So before I do that let me explain what I want to do.

56
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.800
So if I'm here and I click add it I want to take that parameter array in catch it somewhere else to

57
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.320
display all the information for that specific post.

58
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.590
So I want to display the title from the database for this specific post.

59
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.390
In this case it's going to be id 28 and the older the stat is I want to play all this information for

60
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.400
that I need to pull that information from the database.

61
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.990
Right.

62
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:13.800
So let's go to the edit post and let's make a let's open a stack here first and just get a copy of that

63
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.340
query here might do it again when we have it right here.

64
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.630
Right.

65
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.160
Makes no sense.

66
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.960
So I'm just going to change the name select post by ID here.

67
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.520
All right.

68
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.230
And change here change this here.

69
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.580
Another thing that we want to catch here is get the request right.

70
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.890
So we're going to say if set and I closed this no I did not so make sure you close your loop here.

71
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.520
You don't one mistake.

72
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.130
All right.

73
00:04:49.440 --> 00:05:01.820
So if it's set and what are we checking if his set says say they get and it's called the P ID or I the

74
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.020
store check that now.

75
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.600
But let's just say it.

76
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.060
You see right here on top of the browser the ID does the Get that we're sending.

77
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.970
So the ID if I said I want you to do something.

78
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.090
So what are we going to do is I want to actually convert this here into a variable.

79
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.750
Let's just take the side here.

80
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.260
Write not to be or show you what I want to do is go and see if our lives are getting so much information.

81
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.060
So let's let's try that.

82
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.840
There's got to view polls let's edit it.

83
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.970
And I can see that 20 right here.

84
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.750
So we are getting some information.

85
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.180
Perfect.

86
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.740
All right.

87
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.710
So let's convert that and call it something else call it post let's call it the post ideas and not confuse

88
00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.990
a with a database ID or the get Id get post ID or something whatever you want to call it that's fine.

89
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.480
We'd only actually even need this right now but we might later or so.

90
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.130
All right so that we now that we are getting information how we can display some of the information

91
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.260
right here.

92
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.290
So for example I want to play the other.

93
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.200
Let's go ahead and put it right here on the altar Valley you actually put let's put de-value right here

94
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.160
and the beginning there so that where you can see it just in case this goes to the next line value and

95
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:39.320
say let's open a B tag and let's say Echo and what is the name of this.

96
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.930
Here is a matter of fact we didn't check if that was actually bringing in information from the database.

97
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.260
But we're going to check it right now I guess.

98
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.480
So call this value or.

99
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.190
Plus other semi-colon and let's check it out.

100
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.440
Let's see what happens.

101
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.500
Let's go back that's it.

102
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:10.890
And we are bringing in some bad stuff because we forgot to do something that should be tagged right

103
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.770
here.

104
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.390
All right.

105
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.500
You see that the name of the author right here and that's exactly the information we have in the database

106
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.040
right.

107
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.960
So we're going to be doing that right now.

108
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.100
We're going to echo everything out.

109
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.000
Let's just go ahead and copy all this.

110
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.890
Actually the whole value thing so that what it would have to do it over and over again.

111
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.570
So

112
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.590
OK

113
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:44.220
let's do it right here and put the first one the second one and then later on we're going to change

114
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.280
this.

115
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.530
But right now it's just pasted there.

116
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.830
Hopefully we don't forget.

117
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.000
Right.

118
00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:00.150
And this the image we're going to leave for last and then do something else with that and the value

119
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.960
for the area here.

120
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.600
I think we need to put the value of the tets area inside the tetes area here.

121
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.310
We don't need to put Or do we just do it like this.

122
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.470
Let's see if we get some data out of there for now.

123
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.830
All right.

124
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.290
And the image we need to do something else for it and we probably do it in the next lecture so save

125
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.290
it first.

126
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.950
Actually we need to change our values.

127
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.950
He almost forgot.

128
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.710
So this is going to be the title title

129
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.270
this one.

130
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.620
This is make sure that's what it is.

131
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.460
Everything system that post category ID category ID

132
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.790
or two we got this one right.

133
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.310
Pollstar is right.

134
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.100
Image like I said we're going to do something else.

135
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.470
Ampoules tags and post content

136
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.400
are really sticking out.

137
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.480
Just refresh.

138
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:12.820
All right.

139
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.950
We're getting some undefined post-Clinton content here stuff.

140
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.670
So we're going to check on that.

141
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:23.200
But right now we're getting post-Idol the idea that everything we're getting all that information out

142
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.060
of here even the pool stacks Let's check out what happened to the post content and

143
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:40.430
post content is not even here and that is super weird right.

144
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.140
Post content

145
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:53.100
right.

146
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.690
All right.

147
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.500
Let's check it out.

148
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.730
I would go.

149
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.970
All right.

150
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:05.730
Remember we're going to get an editor later on so we're going to fix all this space things here.

151
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.770
But we're getting some data out of the database.

152
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.220
Perfect.

153
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:16.410
So the last lecture we're going to continue this and fix it up a little bit and get a better.

154
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.980
OK.

155
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:17.990
Get the image also.

156
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.940
So thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

157
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.880
Take care.
