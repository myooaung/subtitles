00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.320
Perfit Hopefully you are able to keep up with me.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.330
Not just we wind up video a hundred times if you have to.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.820
You need this right.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
That's why you hear and that's why you came so far.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.250
So this is not a time to give.

6
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.930
This is a time to keep going.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.300
So if you feel like giving up you need to drink a little coffee and straighten up because this is you

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.720
almost done with this all right.

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.620
And you come really far.

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.640
So for those of you that are thinking about giving up for those of you that I decided let's keep going.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.960
For those of you that are down.

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.260
Let's keep going.

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.510
You can do this all right.

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.110
So.

15
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.040
All right.

16
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.530
So now that we're pulling some information out of here and we can echo the user id in the other page

17
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.200
when we go here and we just say if we type anything of course is just going to give us a blank page.

18
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.560
But if we put the RICO user name like we did on the last one submit we can see that we are finding the

19
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.750
user there.

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.260
All right.

21
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.270
Echoing the ID Now let's pull some more information out of that.

22
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.610
And if you go back to the users table we can pool all this information for that specific user right.

23
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.670
So let's go ahead and check on this rolls here.

24
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.090
Right.

25
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.760
On each of them on these columns and let's go and pull some more information so let's take the echo

26
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.860
out of there first.

27
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's make a little bit bigger so that where you can see a more let's just copy and paste this a little

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.570
bit a couple of times.

29
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.180
Going to change some of these things and let's just pull the you first name out of there and in a minute

30
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.310
I'm going to tell you why we're going to need that.

31
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.500
All right.

32
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.320
We're going to do some validations and we're going to be sending some sessions somewhere else and we

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.280
need this information.

34
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.640
So

35
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.740
now we're going to change this of course to first name and we're forgetting something here.

36
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.550
But that would be the last name right.

37
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.480
I mean the user name the user role or think or role let's just call a role or whatever let's just call

38
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.280
it the be the be user role that's too long there but that's fine.

39
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:31.200
The user name in user would be I just want it to be descriptive so that way you don't get lost from

40
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.510
this DV user ID.

41
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.800
All right.

42
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.650
Perfect.

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.670
So we got all this information that we're pulling from there.

44
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.090
We can echo and try it out but I think I think we got it.

45
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610
I think he's working all right.

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.210
Let's pull out the user name the user name.

47
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.310
All right.

48
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.400
And this one has a column there name user name right.

49
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.700
So out of that row of this specific user what we're going to be doing.

50
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.500
So once we have this information Let's just double check and see if we don't get any errors there.

51
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.330
Let's go back here refresh that submit this.

52
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.620
We don't got no arrows here.

53
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.970
Perfect.

54
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.630
All right.

55
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.580
So now that we have all this information let's just do some validation.

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.550
So let's do an if statement here.

57
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.030
And I'm just going to say if the user name and this is not this user name that's why I named it differently

58
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.650
here.

59
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.960
This is this user name right here.

60
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.010
So if this user name is not and you can do this if it is if it is up to you whatever logic you want

61
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.460
to use.

62
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.510
Right now I just want to start with if if is not the same as this is it's not equal to that.

63
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.990
And remember that password which is password variable on top here.

64
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.570
Remember that.

65
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.340
Well here because it's like a cascading style sheet if you know CSSA goes down from top to bottom.

66
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.710
Remember that is not equal to what to.

67
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.860
Actually we haven't even got it out yet.

68
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.020
So let's get it out.

69
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.600
So let's make sure that we get that out right.

70
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.030
Let's get a password.

71
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.830
So

72
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.630
user password array.

73
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.960
All right here.

74
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.720
And his name right here.

75
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.770
Let's just double check to see if that's the name that we got

76
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.730
in there.

77
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.940
Let me just in the Peachtree my admin is our password.

78
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.440
Yes that's the one.

79
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.260
Perfect.

80
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.760
So if that's not the same as does the user password

81
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.900
then I want you to redirect the user somewhere else right.

82
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.880
Wanted to send the user where back to the index.

83
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.410
So we get to use the head of functions here when they pass it in parameters here location.

84
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.640
Make sure that you always capitalize is L here.

85
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.010
Double quotes.

86
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.800
And then we're going to send it to in that stuff BHB.

87
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.540
Remember we need to go back.

88
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.320
We need to get out of this because we are includes All right we need to get out.

89
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.960
It includes And we need to go back so we can go to.

90
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.820
It's all right so let's go ahead and enter there and let's click on anything there and submit.

91
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.280
You see that you didn't you probably did not see it because it's fast but before when we did this it

92
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.380
would take us to the log in page and would be blank.

93
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.630
Right now we do anything.

94
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.260
It just refreshes and takes us back to index that BHP goes back he goes to log and up he actually but

95
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.480
he does it so fast.

96
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.170
That takes us back here.

97
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.230
Well you don't see it.

98
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.200
So I would type recall click submit.

99
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.410
They takes us to the log and up here.

100
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.660
Be right.

101
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.740
The head of functionally it is working issues doing it so fast you can see it.

102
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:21.330
All right so now what I want to do if else let's do an elf and let's do Elf is let's do that one because

103
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.670
I think I haven't used it in a while.

104
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.990
And I think that's probably right here.

105
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.460
Elf is l l l.

106
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.670
If I remember that.

107
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:38.420
And this just do this just tickle this out here and we're just going to change the logic on this one.

108
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.770
We're just going to say equals.

109
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.540
All right.

110
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.620
So this is the opposite right here.

111
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.310
Then we can just redirect to admin.

112
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.420
Right.

113
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.450
So let's do that real quick.

114
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.230
The location admin.

115
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.940
Let's go back because we've got to get out of here we've got to need to go to the folder called admen

116
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.020
And let's check it out to see if it works.

117
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.060
You excited.

118
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.110
You have to be because you're doing something really good and you're going to be a web developer very

119
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.510
soon.

120
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.900
Right.

121
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.840
A professional one soon sooner than you think.

122
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:21.620
So let's go ahead and say Rico and type in MIT and it's not taking us anywhere.

123
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.980
All right.

124
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.190
So our logic here is flawed.

125
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.040
All right.

126
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:34.240
So Or this is now working one or the other or location and so else if.

127
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.700
OK.

128
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.620
And let's do an else statement right here.

129
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.030
We need to remember that the past one has to be the same for us to go to admin.

130
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:52.680
So that's why eating even take is there but let's do a statement here and let's do a location.

131
00:07:53.130 --> 00:08:00.110
And if anything else happens besides these two things here we need to take the user back to that to

132
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.220
today.

133
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.060
That's right.

134
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.050
Could you just copy this one here but sometimes just write more.

135
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.900
So let's make sure that we know that possible for recall.

136
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.890
That way we can log in.

137
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.520
Right.

138
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.290
So possible for Rekos one to three.

139
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.350
So let's go ahead and try that actually I think we are good to go here.

140
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.900
I'm going to recap a little bit but then you get it.

141
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:31.200
But just in case you don't recall and down 1 to 3 enter it takes us to admin rights where able to log

142
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.160
in if I type anything.

143
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.630
Rico and then type anything else it takes us back to here and that's the statement right.

144
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.720
Anything here statement.

145
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.440
We're working again right.

146
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:54.150
If so let's recap a little bit what we did and I'm going to do it really but we're going to be doing

147
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.940
a little more here.

148
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.830
We're going to be dealing with sessions there as a matter of fact.

149
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.910
Let's go ahead and finish the session there.

150
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.420
When I finished the session they are going to recap at the end and show you exactly what we did right

151
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.520
just in case you are still confused.

152
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.110
I'm doing a little faster sense you're ready.

153
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.330
We've already done similar things in the past.

154
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.120
All right.

155
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.850
So anyway I'll see you on the next lecture and hopefully if you do have any questions I'm here 24/7

156
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.180
for you.

157
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.580
So all right take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
