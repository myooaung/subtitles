00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.480
Welcome back the students in this new section we're going to be creating the forgot password feature

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.310
for our CMS is going to be a great learning experience.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.640
We're going to be learning a lot of really cool features.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.250
Let me show you how it works.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.550
So we're going to have a forgot password link here right.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.650
Real close to our log in.

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.670
OK.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.880
When we click here we're going to be redirected or the user is going to be redirected to a page is going

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.030
to ask for the user's e-mail.

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.920
OK.

11
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.730
So we are going to be using this e-mail to send the link behind the scenes we are going to verify that

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.900
this link is in the database.

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:47.710
Of course when we click reset we are going to be using a top third party software or wetware like I

14
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.110
call it sometimes that is going to allow us to use fake We are going to allow us to send fake e-mails

15
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.620
for development purposes.

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.390
OK.

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.240
Now just because we are sending fake email doesn't mean that we are using a fake application to send

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.800
it we're going to be using a real third party library to send the e-mail to the users.

19
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.760
But we just happen to have this problem happens to have it's a.p settings so we can plug into this and

20
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.570
test this before we you know we implemented to reel to reel features out there.

21
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.940
So but anyway so we're going to get a link in the e-mail or the user when they click here is going to

22
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.960
take it to another page.

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.900
He's going to ask for the new password.

24
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.490
Right.

25
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.490
So let's see.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm just going to type in any parts we're here.

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.130
As a matter of fact I'm just going to type in a very small box 1 2 3 1 2 and 3 reset

28
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.870
OK is going to redirect this to a logon page.

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.490
Now I'm going to type in the user name and password logon.

30
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.870
And as you can see it logs it logs the user end.

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.740
Let's logout let's look at another thing that we are going to be using again.

32
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.080
This is going to be a really cool amazing experience for you.

33
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.780
OK.

34
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.270
I can guarantee you that.

35
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.410
Let me show you right here the database you see this feels empty.

36
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.700
Let's do this again.

37
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.940
And let me show you what happens behind the scenes a little bit.

38
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.300
According to Jim

39
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.760
reset they use is going to get another e-mail this refresh here has another link.

40
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.160
But before I click on that link Let me show you what happens here.

41
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.060
We get this talking and this talking is random.

42
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.450
Every time somebody gets into that page.

43
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.740
So we click on it of course we change the password.

44
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.050
It's going to ask for us to little game but I want you to notice something.

45
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.320
You see this link here says Logan and he says Logan as well.

46
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.250
Well when I log in

47
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.470
he's going to redirect this of course to the dashboard but if I go to the home site we would see different

48
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.210
links here.

49
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.320
We got outman and log out now.

50
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.960
And we of course see a different link here.

51
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.940
We are using helper functions and we are going to be creating some really cool helper functions to refactor

52
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.670
code that we already have just to make our application a lot better.

53
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.960
So let me just revise some of the things that we are going to be learning.

54
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.200
We are going to be learning how to use BHP mailer to send emails.

55
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.110
We are going to be using Mail trap and want to show you how to use that if you never used it.

56
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.190
We are also going to be using prepared statements so we make sure that whoever puts information into

57
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.240
any of our application forms is going to be everything is going to be secure.

58
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.100
Now that person or that user is not going to be able to try to hack into our application do some damage.

59
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.510
So we're going to be preparing our statements.

60
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.070
We're going to be using that.

61
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.050
We're going to be using composer to pull independent these BHB packages.

62
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.920
If we never use.

63
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.440
I have a free course on that.

64
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:20.640
But on this on this section here I'm going to show you how to use a real quick to pull in packages BHB

65
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.250
third party libraries and there are dependencies.

66
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.340
Real fast is going to be a really cool amazing experience so I hope you are happy and I'll see you in

67
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.380
the next lectures.
