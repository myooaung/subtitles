00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.530
That's having a lot of fun and learning a lot.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.450
OK I thought so.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:04.760
Good.

4
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.600
Good stuff guys.

5
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.500
Good stuff.

6
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.740
So let's go to the post up BHB here and let's go to let's go to those links.

7
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.720
We're going to fix this later.

8
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.820
Guys don't worry too much about this.

9
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.760
I got some really cool lectures coming up to show you guys how to do a lot of really cool stuff so I'm

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.420
going to have to change my background here for my ideas so I can know where this thing is anyway so

11
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.350
we want to make this a little dynamic What do you guys think.

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.580
So there is another function that we need to create and that is responsible for the texting that this

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.390
post was like.

14
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.510
So let's go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.420
So right below downloading user ID function we're going to create the user

16
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.840
like this

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.100
all user like poles or something.

18
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.350
I don't know.

19
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.640
It's just a name guys.

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.740
OK.

21
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:15.280
And this is going to take the post ID would like pause Id put maybe a placeholder.

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.130
And here we are going to be making equerries So that's why that function is super useful right there.

23
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.470
And all we have to do here is just select.

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.560
So we're going to you know basically select what they likes whether user ID matches a user ID that's

25
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.120
logged in and of course we want to make sure that it pulls ID is the correct one as well.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.850
Right.

27
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.990
So that way we know that a user actually like this.

28
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.630
So we are going to select all from polls.

29
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.450
I mean likes where they use their ID.

30
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.210
OK.

31
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.360
As a matter of fact we have a user ID on the polls and we see that.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.130
Well we don't.

33
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.960
This has nothing to do with that yet.

34
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.180
But I think it is very good for us too.

35
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.900
And that's why I don't want you guys to miss any of my lectures because I always show you something

36
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.220
different.

37
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.270
Depending on you know how I feel there has nothing to do with the lecture.

38
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.490
I think it's very useful for us to do like a user id type of field here just to the the user ID instead

39
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.380
of having to pose user tests here name.

40
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.290
So yeah we do that later.

41
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.880
So here

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.590
weekend write function so let's concatenate do have a function right here.

43
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.150
So let's get the logging user id OK because remember that the user has to be logged in and we're going

44
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.840
to do that in a minute to like it.

45
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.660
So that's how we get to know.

46
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.690
We also want this to be and false ID and you can do and like this as well.

47
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.820
Cause Id

48
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.370
be doing just like that not to make it too complicated.

49
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.860
I don't want it to be too complete I was going to concatenate these two but let's just do it like that.

50
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.820
OK.

51
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.610
This is this curly brackets.

52
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.590
So for me tool or for the next developer to differentiate that this is a variable.

53
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.350
It's easier to understand like that but there you can see my ds actually doing that but if for some

54
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.720
reason this was in a text editor right.

55
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.800
You can't tell unless he has it curly brackets and so.

56
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.560
So now that we have this squaring let's assigned this as a result because when I get data from there

57
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.400
and we are going to return

58
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.680
my SU rules my focus should have done this here.

59
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:24.030
But anyway what I want to do is I'm going to do I tell her every feature here I've done this before

60
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.000
where I use do everything in one line.

61
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.750
So if it's greater or equal than one I want to return TRUE else return false.

62
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.530
OK.

63
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:44.420
So we could have done this here and we can return to either you know they use their ID or the

64
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.810
let's just do it right.

65
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.230
Or they of course.

66
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.250
OK.

67
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.290
So we could just say we turn the user id off.

68
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:07.970
Now here here are false and we can go ahead and delete everything else that that makes a lot more sense

69
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.070
like that.

70
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.790
OK.

71
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.690
Make sure your still works OK.

72
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.130
So you can go back to this logged in user

73
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.550
right here and just refresh.

74
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.660
And you know if you don't see any errors in there you know well let's go ahead and log in.

75
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.540
Just make sure that it is working.

76
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.800
And I'm going to go to that test page and refreshing still works.

77
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.990
OK.

78
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.170
So

79
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.590
so why don't we test is.

80
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.690
OK.

81
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.450
So I wanted to go to that test page right here.

82
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.890
And it's returning you for.

83
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.070
So what I need to do is I'm going to say if

84
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.610
they use it like dispose call user Leichter or something like that

85
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.820
like ELSE

86
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.720
THE not like something like this.

87
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.700
So let's go back here and this put some type of post ID right.

88
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.860
So we need a push ID will it will pose and we see that 1:39.

89
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.510
So 1:39 is not liked.

90
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.620
Right now we should not see what you see the now like it.

91
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.540
So let's pass is 1:39 now here.

92
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.480
Sorry.

93
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.340

94
1:39 right here.

95
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.650
And let's go to that test page and refresh and you can see they said did not like it and you just say

96
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.920
user.

97
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.490
Let's like it and let's see what that page says.

98
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.840
So let's go back to that posts.

99
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:18.150
His other 1:39 Yes this just like it looks like let's go back to that test page and let's refresh and

100
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.350
you can see that it says user like that.

101
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:29.410
So we successfully create He created that really cool function guys really organize and really methodically

102
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.700
prepared.

103
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.430
OK.

104
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.340
So we could we could of course make this a lot more than namak allow better.

105
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.430
But I'll leave that to you I think this is this is really cool right now.

106
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.400
Right.

107
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:48.160
So let's go ahead and in the next lecture Let's play a little bit with this two functions in our polls

108
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.000
page.

109
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.120
See you in the next one.
