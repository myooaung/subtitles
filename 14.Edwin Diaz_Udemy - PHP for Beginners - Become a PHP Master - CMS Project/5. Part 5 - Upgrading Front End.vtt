00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.570
Hi welcome back my dear student in this lecture here we need to set a default user right here.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.790
So when we say let's say for example we see this specific post we display that for the user right here.

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.330
All right.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.090
So we could do these many different ways.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.840
Very easy way of doing this would be to go to the EDID on the score of course and grab the echo right

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.640
and just put it right here put up the HP tag and Echo they're safe come back here.

7
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.930
Actually what am I doing.

8
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.600
All right.

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.070
Now explain that we need to echo it.

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700
We need to find the user from somewhere else.

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.450
The user name will be will display and everything from categories

12
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.910
user name if post update.

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930
Now we got to selected from this guy right here.

14
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.630
Paul's user right.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.560
So it is available in the while loop right there.

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.940
We're going to come here

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.590
and call it out right here.

18
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.260
User

19
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.570
safe

20
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.100
center.

21
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.250
Now we see that it is selected there.

22
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.040
So now let's say for example we changed this to Pete.

23
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.550
This is the easy way of doing that.

24
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.210
Now we could actually make in many different ways.

25
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.140
You see right now it says Pete and we go here he says Pete also.

26
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.870
All right.

27
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.720
So that's the easy way of doing that.

28
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.540
All if you're interested in some other ways let me know and I will make a lecture Right.

29
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.000
So now what's next.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.550
Well you got to go to your home site.

31
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.100
Your front page here and you can notice that we are actually displaying here the user name while the

32
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.100
other name in this case or this ads on old posts.

33
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.540
So if I go to my last page right here you can see that I'm displaying nothing right here and nothing

34
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.100
right here nothing right here and that's only one that I got.

35
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.160
The reason why not display anything because it's not detecting the user it's not pulling the user's

36
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.510
pulling out all the order only.

37
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.980
All right.

38
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.080
So we need to update that so that way these plays they use is very simple actually.

39
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.080
If you go to your end it's and right here

40
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.830
right you can see that we're pulling out the poles altar instead of putting other pozole that are you

41
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.470
pull out the polls user safe and you can leave this like this if you like.

42
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.170
So that way you don't have to go crazy on updating everything here on this page.

43
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.690
All right.

44
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.710
So make sure that everywhere you need you're pulling out information from the database.

45
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.550
You update this post a user.

46
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.890
I'm going to leave the same variable so that way I don't go crazy changing all this.

47
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.030
So if I come here and I see a refresh.

48
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.990
Now everything here right is going to be empty.

49
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.480
Cept the user click on the array.

50
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.560
The user is not going to see anything here.

51
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.460
The reason is because he doesn't find it right.

52
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.700
So we need to go to all the polls show you right now instead of same post although we say polls are

53
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:47.660
user safe and here pose a user safe.

54
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.280
Come back here refresh.

55
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.390
And now you got that by that user.

56
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.480
You go everything by the user.

57
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.900
Beautiful right.

58
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.790
That's just doing minimal work.

59
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.510
You can go ahead.

60
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.420
And if you one yourself you can change all the variables in everything.

61
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.430
Does this post alter for Polsce user if it makes more sense to you.

62
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.420
I'm showing you a different way of you know with minimal effort to do it.

63
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.570
All right.

64
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.760
So I'm going to be leading a lot of my polls here since they are made by older folks authors right.

65
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.830
And we have users now making that all right.

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.890
So we don't have to worry about that.

67
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.110
All right we've got comments here.

68
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm going to be making some new lectures.

69
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.470
Also grading our CMOS and making him more events.

70
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.750
So keep tuned for that.

71
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.510
Thank you so much for allowing me to teach this course.

72
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.580
If you have not given me a review and you'd think this course is awesome Please take one minute really

73
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.740
helps me a lot and it keeps me motivated to make more lectures for you guys.

74
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.700
All right.

75
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.740
This is what I see in the morning when I wake up.

76
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.320
If I see a good review it gets me motivated.

77
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.560
If I see a good message you know a thumbs up or maybe something on Facebook make sure that you are subscribed

78
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.100
to the Facebook group for this course which is really awesome because I answer a lot faster than what

79
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.490
I'm answering right now.

80
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.030
If you post something on day udy me or anywhere you are a platform.

81
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.210
All right since platform sometimes LAXON sending me notifications so that's where I could take hours.

82
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.230
But if you post posted on Facebook or send me an email I can't answer you really fast.

83
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.590
Thank you again and I'll see you in the next lectures
