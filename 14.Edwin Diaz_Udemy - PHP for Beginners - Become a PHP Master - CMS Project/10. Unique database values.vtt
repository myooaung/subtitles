00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.760
Well come back my students for those of you that are sleeping wake up for those of you that are active

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.650
and ready to learn.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.880
Let's do it.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860
Even if you're not ready just listen to me.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.570
OK.

6
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.580
So let's get going.

7
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.990
So what do we need here.

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.560
We have a form that we need to check to see if some values the password field and the confirmed password

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.240
field are the same.

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.750
Remember this is what we got here.

11
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870
We need to make sure that this are the same before we go anywhere else.

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.660
We can include some Jake way of mean or javascript ideation here.

13
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.530
A female 5 in Asia maybe.

14
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.580
But we're going to do this in the service side.

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.900
Now one word of advice if you want to make your logon username unique besides a validation that we guy

16
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.500
remember that we have a registration year with some functions that can check to see if that e-mail address

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.190
or the or the username.

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.360
We have those validations.

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.700
But if we want to do this in the backend with your database you can oh you have to do is go to that

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.890
the field that you want to make let's say unique you want to make this username unique and all you have

21
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:25.030
to do is come here and add a key and immediacy it was very easy to do this as going to be in situ.

22
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.560
And let me see if it's here

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.730
let's go back to structure here.

24
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.680
And he was super easy to.

25
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.550
OK more.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.380
There we go.

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.530
So all you have to do is click unique.

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.620
I think my screen is so small that OK.

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.760
See that's what it is is here.

30
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.310
But when this is responsive it goes to the more functionality right here.

31
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.910
So you have to do is make this unique and you're going to have some validation in your database and

32
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.300
you might skew old databases.

33
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.120
OK.

34
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.810
So you feel that you want unique you make him unique right here.

35
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.560
OK.

36
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.940
So that way you never have the same username again.

37
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.590
So let me just make that unique.

38
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.570
Let me just do it right now to show you.

39
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.890
So right now this is the code that as you well called alter table users add a unique user name.

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.150
I guess me.

41
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.530
You're going to see this Kyra you see that.

42
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.040
So anyway let's go back here.

43
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:44.880
And let's check for form submission for to see if this passwords are the same this input fields

44
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.230
so

45
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.580
there is a little feature on the video that you're watching on some of the platforms that you can make

46
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.050
it so.

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.460
That is fast faster than what you're watching right now.

48
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.620
I think is one at 1.5 or two Xs that you can make me basically go faster.

49
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.310
Just in case I'm typing too slow for you or you one this to finish faster.

50
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.540
OK you can put that setting in your video some video platforms.

51
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.380
So anyway let's just do this one here we want to make sure that they are both there.

52
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:42.140
And they're both being set and that this is confirm I believe is confirm password if I'm not mistaken.

53
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.960
So let's go ahead and check this out first because I didn't get that in here.

54
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.400
So let's come here.

55
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.910
And we go and now we are going to echo these out.

56
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.730
They are both the same.

57
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.190
If it passes well not the same.

58
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.210
They're both being set.

59
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.050
That's what I mean.

60
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.690
You can check to see if they are the same as well and we're going to do that but let's just do this

61
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.290
real quick answer in the passage of the nation.

62
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:32.030
So let's go ahead and create one on the next lecture on how to act the matter of fact I want to I'm

63
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.290
going to give you that as a little challenge.

64
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.280
Just make sure that you compare this to create a ball now statement and compare this to.

65
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.280
And then we are going to be writing some more code.

66
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.590
I'll see you in the next lecture.
