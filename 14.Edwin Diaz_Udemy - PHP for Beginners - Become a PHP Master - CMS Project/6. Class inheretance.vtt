00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.620
Hi welcome back on the last video we learn how to add properties to our classes and how to use those

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.480
properties.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.230
Were there instances and using methods.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.690
Now we also learn how to reference the car class or any class by using the word or the key word called

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.580
does.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.270
We had a lot of fun on the last video.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.930
I hope you did because I did.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.680
Now on this video we're going to be learning how to what do you know the title we are going to be learning

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.980
about inheritance.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.740
Right now you got to pay a lot of attention to this.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.460
This video here because inheritance is something super important in opii object oriented programming.

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.140
Right.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.650
So when we deal with classes we can we know that we can use the properties inside of the class with

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.110
other methods and we can use other functionalities of this class with the methods right within the methods.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.940
Now you know that we can also create different classes.

16
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.590
So anyway before we do that let's go ahead and do a Save As before I get into any more deeper than what

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.060
I'm getting right now because I want to show you visually what I'm trying to do.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.260
So class let's call this.

19
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.800
This will save us on this and call it class inheritance and Harrod inheritance.

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
I think I'm trying to is very tense.

21
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.080
There we go.

22
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.420
I think I'm I think I got it right.

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.170
This is the key word there that I don't use much or I don't use the word inheritance.

24
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870
But anyways.

25
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.680
So so now we have a card class right here.

26
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.050
I tell you what let's create another class.

27
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.770
How about that.

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.750
Let's delete all this.

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.230
Let's delete all of it.

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.650
And let's go down here and create another class.

31
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.190
So I'm going to create another class called class and what I want to create another class called plain.

32
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.800
Let's create a plane why not right.

33
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.710
All right.

34
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.590
Perfect.

35
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.090
Now we can also let's just do something here.

36
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.290
All right.

37
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.370
Well let's first let's check if this class exists right.

38
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.790
How many classes we have.

39
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.400
If class let's just use this method Clausewitz's.

40
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.350
And let's just find our ray plane.

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.600
Actually we need to capitalize this or I remember that.

42
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:48.450
And then we need to main food club class naming here and we're just going to echo what he does

43
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.900
just to make sure that is everything is working as expected.

44
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.640
It does.

45
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.820
All right so we know that it does exist.

46
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.170
All right.

47
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.950
Perfect.

48
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.490
All right.

49
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.120
So we have a new class here going.

50
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.110
Let me just actually comment this out that way you can use if you want.

51
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.700
So now what is class inheritance topic is is that we could use another class inherit everything that

52
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.020
this class has its properties its methods and everything else that we have inside right.

53
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.200
Right now we just have properties and methods.

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.580
So lets go ahead and use a word that is going to extend.

55
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.970
Its going to inherit everything.

56
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.660
So the key word is class plane plane extends.

57
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.150
This is the key word extends.

58
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.530
There we go car.

59
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.520
Thats it.

60
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.080
Now we have all this functionality inside this new class.

61
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.170
Don't believe me.

62
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.100
It is very simple to prove it.

63
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.870
Let's let's go ahead a stance.

64
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.140
This new class.

65
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.460
Right.

66
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.600
How about that.

67
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:12.840
So what I'm going to do is actually I'm going to say jet right jet new plane because this is the new

68
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.740
got instantiate this class.

69
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.940
Right.

70
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:27.930
So now I could say this plane of course is silly class but these new plane has how many wheels.

71
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.120
Well let's equil that for us re eco wheels.

72
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.530
So let's see that all look that.

73
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.350
We have four wheels and these new and then let me just comment this.

74
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.030
So you know that that's the one that we are using.

75
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.730
As you can see here.

76
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.590
So he inherited wheels here for.

77
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.280
Right.

78
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.090
And look at this.

79
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.200
Let's use a method.

80
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.400
Why not let's use this method here and see what what it does.

81
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:08.370
So let's go ahead and use that to just call the method change the wheels to turn the color.

82
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.710
We can even use the method of the class.

83
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.780
Right.

84
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.700
Perfect.

85
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.780
So you see that I didn't put anything here.

86
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.640
This class is empty right now.

87
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.570
The best thing about it is that I can come here inside this class and I say you know what I want this

88
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.680
wheels now to be a different value.

89
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.000
How about that.

90
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.990
So is this do that this change.

91
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.060
The answer is we use 220 now.

92
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.430
And of course let's just take that out.

93
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.510
And as you can see here right.

94
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.630
We change it to 20.

95
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.060
So what we can do is we can override its parent.

96
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.620
Right.

97
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.140
Because this is the parent right.

98
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.550
It's parents value we can well whatever we think we can come back.

99
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.540
Come down to the children class right and change the value of it we can override it.

100
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.800
We can even override this one we can override methods we can override whatever we want we can create

101
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.960
another matter that will override this one.

102
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.410
I mean that there is no limit on the things that we can do here.

103
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.890
All right.

104
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.190
So know that we can do that now.

105
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.460
So anyways I hope I'm going to make this video sure and I'm going to make it too long so I hope you

106
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:28.530
were able to to grasp this concept of classing heritance because it is very important and we will be

107
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.170
using there a lot since it's really useful to do that.

108
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.960
Think about it.

109
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.560
You don't you have all these classes of these properties and methods inside a class and you can just

110
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.530
create another class and have all this functionality working right there in that class in that new class.

111
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.280
Right.

112
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.750
Perfect.

113
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.350
Anyways I see you in the next video and hopefully you'll learn something good from this one and you

114
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.860
can Graf's grasp the concept.

115
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.810
All right take care.
