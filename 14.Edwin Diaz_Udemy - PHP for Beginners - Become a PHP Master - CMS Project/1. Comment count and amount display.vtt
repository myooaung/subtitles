00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:03.570
Hi welcome back my students in this lecture here.

2

00:00:03.600  -->  00:00:10.200
I want to show you how to improve our CMA system by creating a new comment system is going to be very

3

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:13.880
simple is actually going to be a lot better than what we have before.

4

00:00:13.900  -->  00:00:19.810
Let me just show you exactly what we have before or what some of you already have.

5

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:24.010
It's that what we're doing here is incrementing.

6

00:00:24.030  -->  00:00:24.610
All right.

7

00:00:24.680  -->  00:00:28.310
Feel the pulse coming count in our post table by 1.

8

00:00:28.320  -->  00:00:30.930
Every time a user makes a comment.

9

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:35.010
All right we're going to do things a little bit different and actually they're going to be a lot more

10

00:00:35.010  -->  00:00:36.320
fun to do.

11

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:36.770
All right.

12

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:38.490
So we're not even going to deal with this.

13

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:42.230
I want you to go to your post up DHP and I want you to delete this line.

14

00:00:42.240  -->  00:00:42.830
Just delete it.

15

00:00:42.840  -->  00:00:47.220
Or if you want just to have as of reference just come in that line out.

16

00:00:47.220  -->  00:00:49.010
We're not going to even use it anymore.

17

00:00:49.010  -->  00:00:49.760
All right.

18

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:54.330
So my idea is this every time we create a comment.

19

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:55.370
All right.

20

00:00:55.820  -->  00:00:58.430
All we have to do if we want to show the number.

21

00:00:58.420  -->  00:00:58.830
All.

22

00:00:58.940  -->  00:01:05.430
Being the the amount of comment that we have in our admin right here is that all we have to do is just

23

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:13.970
count the rows in that specific post and that's it right once we count the rows for this specific idea

24

00:01:13.980  -->  00:01:19.050
for this specific post we can say okay has three comments as for comments we don't even have to increment

25

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:25.350
that field by one anymore and we don't have to do a common count so we can even delete that out in our

26

00:01:25.350  -->  00:01:28.440
database if we wanted to are out of our table.

27

00:01:28.560  -->  00:01:30.610
So let me just show you how this works.

28

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:31.120
All right.

29

00:01:31.140  -->  00:01:38.660
So go to your view of polls and we're going to do this right here where we are echoing pools common

30

00:01:38.660  -->  00:01:39.920
count.

31

00:01:39.960  -->  00:01:41.600
All right.

32

00:01:41.600  -->  00:01:44.990
So first and I got this line right here.

33

00:01:45.000  -->  00:01:46.610
I'm going to show you.

34

00:01:46.740  -->  00:01:48.860
And just going to copy and paste.

35

00:01:49.080  -->  00:01:54.510
Basically we make a Querrey right and we select everything from comments were common post ID equals

36

00:01:54.500  -->  00:01:56.310
a post ID.

37

00:01:56.310  -->  00:01:56.910
All right.

38

00:01:56.970  -->  00:01:57.550
We remember that.

39

00:01:57.560  -->  00:02:03.450
That's the common bull's eye is the one that we are inserting right right here.

40

00:02:03.690  -->  00:02:06.320
That's a common count right.

41

00:02:07.560  -->  00:02:08.700
Right here.

42

00:02:08.760  -->  00:02:11.040
So we are inserting come in post ID

43

00:02:13.710  -->  00:02:17.710
which is actually right here.

44

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:18.120
Sorry.

45

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:20.830
The post ID into the common post ID.

46

00:02:20.850  -->  00:02:21.580
All right.

47

00:02:21.660  -->  00:02:24.930
So if these two are similar.

48

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:29.790
Right well actually the same then we make the Querrey right.

49

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:39.000
So we'll come here and we'll say you know what and where we count or send come inquiry.

50

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:43.750
All right just to make a little bit more semantic or something.

51

00:02:44.040  -->  00:02:49.500
So and then we'll create another variable here and we say count comments

52

00:02:52.680  -->  00:02:54.620
if I can spell it right that would be nice.

53

00:02:54.620  -->  00:02:55.360
There we go.

54

00:02:55.490  -->  00:02:59.640
And then all we got to do is use a function to your call.

55

00:02:59.690  -->  00:03:01.530
I ask you your line on Rose.

56

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:03.020
All right.

57

00:03:03.300  -->  00:03:09.030
And we'll use the results right here put it right here and that's it.

58

00:03:09.070  -->  00:03:09.380
All right.

59

00:03:09.390  -->  00:03:16.380
Now we have to do is just echo count comments like this.

60

00:03:16.500  -->  00:03:17.050
All right.

61

00:03:17.190  -->  00:03:19.680
For this specific user.

62

00:03:19.980  -->  00:03:24.390
So now we save it and we go back to our admin and enter.

63

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:26.340
And now you can see that everything is zero.

64

00:03:26.470  -->  00:03:30.990
All right and now we got one right here because we have a comment for this specific user.

65

00:03:30.990  -->  00:03:36.080
So for example if I go to this polls right here and I create a column and then I say OK my name is that

66

00:03:36.180  -->  00:03:50.350
India's support at India's come or actually doing school of code.

67

00:03:50.400  -->  00:03:52.860
School of course does come and go.

68

00:03:52.920  -->  00:04:00.440
It's a really cool Web site they're developing and just saying something like mind comment.

69

00:04:00.510  -->  00:04:01.230
All right.

70

00:04:01.230  -->  00:04:03.420
Samit All right.

71

00:04:03.420  -->  00:04:09.390
Now we go to admen we go to polls and now you can see that we have a comment there.

72

00:04:09.450  -->  00:04:10.120
All right.

73

00:04:10.250  -->  00:04:11.820
And we got two views of course.

74

00:04:11.820  -->  00:04:14.220
It's pretty cool stuff right now.

75

00:04:14.220  -->  00:04:16.170
It would be nice if we have a link here.

76

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:21.670
We had a link where we click on this and we can see all the comments for this specific post.

77

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:24.580
We're going to do the next lecture I think you're going to like it anyway.

78

00:04:24.600  -->  00:04:27.180
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next one
