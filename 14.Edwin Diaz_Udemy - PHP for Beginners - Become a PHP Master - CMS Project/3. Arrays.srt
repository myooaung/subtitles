00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,200
High on this video we are going to be learning about arrays in arrays are something wonderful in programming

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,680
because we can store multiple types of data inside one container.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,550
If you remember we talked about variables and we said you know variables we can we can store data in

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,370
variables but we were only able to store one single data one single value inside a variable.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,310
Right.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,300
Arrays are variables with super power.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,370
That's what arrays are arrays you can store any type of data and only any type of data.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,830
But many many times over and over again.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,880
Let me show you exactly what an array is and it may show you how to use them.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,030
So let's go ahead and open our coeditor now I'm going to grab that blank that BHB and then I go Aceves

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,370
here.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,510
And like I said don't mind Mike the files that I got on the left side there just know that you have

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,550
that in your course that's the size files.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,940
You might not have some of these files here but we believe me we will go over everything I'm going over

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,160
right now and the lecture is why you should have in your exercise files right.

16
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,180
Whatever you see here.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,780
Sometimes it might not be accurate because I will delete some of these files and we'll do it again depending

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,660
if I make a mistake on a lecture or something like that.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:34,040
So anyways I raised that Ph.D. that's going to be the file name and let me show you first.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,310
Let's just open up a BHB tag and let me show you the syntax of how we write it down.

21
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,790
Just like the variable right.

22
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,560
We say that an array is just like a variable with superpower's right.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,200
So we're going to be using the dollar sign because you know it's a variable.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,980
Basically.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,860
We're going to we're going to give us superpowers so we are going to be saying number list.

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm going to name it number list right.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:16,610
And the way we assigned this variable superpower to make it an array is by assigning it an array function

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:16,930
right.

29
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,100
Look at that right here.

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,390
So that looks very much like a function right.

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,490
Well it is a function you know in a way right because it has parentheses here and that's what a function

32
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:31,760
is.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,520
By the way in ph B you're going to see a name like this and then you going to see a parentheses in a

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,790
semicolon.

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,950
Hi sorry for the interruption This is evident from the future I just want to make you aware that there

36
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:52,080
is another type of frame that is a newer way of defining arrays and is this square brackets right here.

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,600
This is the other way of doing things even though it's all there.

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,900
It is still used.

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,780
OK so you're still going to see this and I shouldn't say old you're still going to see this in some

40
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,080
applications because there are some uses to this.

41
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,740
OK.

42
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,480
Now you're going to see this a lot more.

43
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,110
So this is the same thing as this.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,760
OK.

45
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,870
But with this new syntax we don't have the word array and we don't have this parenthesis.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,060
We just have this square brackets.

47
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,800
OK.

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,480
So you can still do something like this.

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,060
Here is something.

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,090
OK.

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,200
Or you can still have values here is this same thing as data array on top there.

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,000
OK.

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,380
So when you see the syntax with square brackets keep in mind is the same thing as having this guy right

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,000
here.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,860
This is just a little shorter and it's more than this.

56
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,830
OK.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,880
But you can still use both.

58
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,360
Thank you so much and I'll see you in there in a couple of seconds.

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,150
Take care guys write functions in PH BE have it do many different things.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,860
In this case this is going to make this variable is going to give this variable superpowers and now

61
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,830
we're going to call this variable array.

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,650
Now and I tell you that we can store many different values inside here and that's what I'm about to

63
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:23,100
do right now look at this all right we can do this with our raised by the way with variables and look

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,610
at this

65
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,100
and angle into this.

66
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,520
I love arrays by the way because we can do so many different things with it.

67
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,950
All right.

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,340
So

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,340
let me just make this a little bigger.

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,890
Here is where we can see what we are doing.

71
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,440
All right.

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,190
So let's just make this so that we can go to the second line there.

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,770
All right.

74
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,070
So let's make sure that we have a separator there and actually right here.

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,590
We go

76
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:28,490
all right I think they were good all right so we have this array here with many different type of values

77
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,020
in there we even have an one saying hello there.

78
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,930
So we have.

79
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,990
Now one thing I got to tell you Monterey's that we do these values here.

80
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:45,650
Each of these values are called indices in the index in an array starts with zero.

81
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,250
So this first spot right here of this number is in that 0.

82
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:57,110
I'm going to show you in a minute the structure right behind the array inside this page right here when

83
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,910
we publish it on the browser.

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:06,960
So let me first show you that if we go ahead and see this here we don't have anything.

85
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,640
All right that's a good thing because we don't have all arrows but how do we show an array.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,820
How do we display the information.

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,330
Let's use an echo echo function and let's say let's just keep this play array.

88
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,810
This this number list on the screen we get an error rate to string conversion not possible right.

89
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,330
So we have an error here.

90
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:37,650
So how we display these data here well I already told you that arrays have indices right.

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:45,400
We have a name that's of zero here and it's a one two three four and five values.

92
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,720
So we start at zero and we have five values in here.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,270
But we start with zero.

94
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,520
And the way we do that if we want to display the value on the browser we need to refer to it by the

95
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,260
index number and the index is zero.

96
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,550
And we all we use brackets around to refer to that and I'll show you in a minute why we use that.

97
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,730
And as you can see here on this plane to 67.

98
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,880
So on this plane in that zero we use the name of the array following by brackets aim side brackets with

99
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,300
type in the end it's this is in the series like I said.

100
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,800
Now let me show you what I mean in that zero.

101
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,810
And that's what it is.

102
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,410
So I'm just going to comment that out.

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,340
And I did this.

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,650
This is the same way we do it in the mail basically wearing the mail we do ladies would come and things

105
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,280
like this.

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,890
Right.

107
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,680
Well we would just use forward slash twice and that's a single line.

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,500
And I'm just repeating this my.

109
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,260
I might have told you already how to do this but just in case.

110
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:59,890
And for Slash and little star here with do everything until we close it like this.

111
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,200
All right.

112
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,510
And I think you do it like that on CSSA.

113
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,330
I believe if I not mistaken.

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,600
So anyways.

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,830
So we got this.

116
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,440
They were referring to let me just come in this hour like I was going to do.

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,600
And let me show you the structure of an array.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,180
So I'm going to use a function this is a built in function in ph b cold drink.

119
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:30,650
Our right there you see the percentages there and when to put the name of this array inside here.

120
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,770
And when I come out here I'm going to show you the structure of it.

121
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,020
All right.

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,330
Didn't take this halo out of there because that's getting.

123
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,440
I should i got to leave it there.

124
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,680
That's.

125
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,580
Hello we have a think on the first part the last one.

126
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,490
So we said that we need to refer to the first item to 67 by the end that number right here.

127
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,550
All right you see that in this right here.

128
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,090
Zero.

129
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,760
So and it has brackets that's how the race constructor inside has brackets in there around zero.

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,630
So we were referred to it by the name of the array.

131
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,800
And by the brackets in the end it's zero.

132
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,870
If we wanted the second value here we refer to it by brackets the number one as you can see here we

133
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,720
can do that.

134
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,870
Say to print are there as is come and out by pressing command.

135
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,680
And the four slash or control the four slash on Windows and then do the same thing to take it off and

136
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,430
on to refer to it by the number one to see what we get.

137
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,900
We get a second value.

138
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,520
All right 87 65.

139
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,690
We do four we get 345 five which is almost the last value we really wanted to get.

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,870
Number five and we get five which is this one.

141
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,840
Hello.

142
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:51,740
Right.

143
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,610
So this is how we take information out of the array and use it very useful.

144
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,610
All right we can pull whatever we want into an array in arrays are actually the number one containers

145
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,530
we use in programming even though variables are something that we use all the time.

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,100
But arrays are going to find yourself using it a lot more.

147
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,910
The variable since we can hold more multiple data inside an array.

148
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,260
Right.

149
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,080
And there are different types of types of array and we're going to be talking about that later.

150
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,670
Correct right so anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture here and hopefully you were able

151
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,300
to learn some valuable information.

152
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,760
And I see your next one.

153
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,240
Take care.
