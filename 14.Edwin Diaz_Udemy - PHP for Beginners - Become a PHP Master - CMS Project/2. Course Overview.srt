1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,220
I welcome other students so I wanted to give you an overview here.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,120
And I was going to make some fancy slides here but I just wanted to show you exactly you know d what

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,850
we what we're going to be covering here in discours even if you forgot or maybe you didn't you'd even

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,030
if you did look at it at the beginning of the introduction.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,490
OK.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,410
So we're going to you know start learning about the fundamentals of PH being the first steps.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:35,220
S. some data types constructs control structures we're asked to do with decision making custom functions

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,210
that we can create our own.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,430
We are going to be also learning about built in functions that HP has that we can use right out of the

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,610
box how to use form data or how to submit information using a form.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,300
I don't know if you've ever seen that on the Web sites where you can put your name your address and

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,580
things like that.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,590
So we're going to learn how to do that then we're going to learn how to do that.

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,900
We've been with databases.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,590
OK.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,130
So databases you know we're going to be able to learn to insert that information into databases.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,640
Then we're going to talk a little bit about BHB security then BHB and the Web.

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,870
We're going to talk a little bit and we're going to learn a lot.

19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,530
Actually 10 lectures here so far about BHB object oriented programming.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,210
Ok how to make objects with BHB.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,450
Right now what we are learning is procedural.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,610
OK this is just writing a program from up to down and you know but when we are writing a program in

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,170
object we into programming we deal with objects and you guys need to know that.

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,180
So I include that section about that then we can also work with files just like any other language just

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,770
like Job I will see that controls files in your computer like making directories and things like reading

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,630
files BHB can do as well.

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,360
So we can learn how to do that.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,400
Then after we learn all the fundamentals we can jump into the CMS project and in the CMS project this

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
is where the fun begins.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,020
This is where you're going to be learning a lot of things.

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,460
OK.

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,920
Even things that really show you the fundamentals you're going to be learning it here because we're

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,540
going to build a really cool project that you can use yourself and at the end we're going to launch

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,680
until 9 OK.

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,170
So it's going to be pretty awesome because here you're going to learn so much like real life stuff that

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,860
is very hard to get in a course so I try to put as much features as possible in this project.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,450
The CMs project like I showed you in the demo is an application where we can do anything we want.

38
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,880
Basically very similar to WordPress.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,210
We're going to build categories.

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,490
We're going to post comments on users so they can log in.

41
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,480
They're going to have their own profile their own dashboard with some really cool features in there.

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,510
We're going to be improving it if we're going to be adding some extra features in this section.

43
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,020
Here is a whole bunch of features that we're going to be adding to it.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,280
Then we are going to have another user registration here we'll show you how to do it first.

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,940
We're going to have a user registration years extra stuff pagination.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,720
We're going to we're going to build a little feature here with users on line.

47
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,640
We are going to learn a new way of creating a password encryption system.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,890
We're going to be improving our common system that we created first.

49
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,940
OK.

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,820
We're going to have a lot of cool things here.

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
We're going to even be able to send e-mails.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,680
We're going to be using third party packages like we do in real life applications.

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,950
We're going to take it to the Internet.

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,870
We're going to launch this show you how to do that.

55
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,990
OK.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,680
There's some extra features here that I include.

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,410
And then we also have a section where we feel fits a lot of box or you know problems our kerning our

58
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,580
applications.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,860
And we're going to be doing some refactoring meaning that we're going to be taking some of that complicated

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,300
code we're going to make it simple and better new registration system.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,250
We're going to create pretty you or else a new forgot password system OK.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,320
And this is just extra features that I keep adding in the end.

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,620
Well it could be.

64
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,940
Maybe we have any extra sections after watching this video but we're going to have some real time notifications

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,270
here with a third party package called pusher.

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,740
So that's going to be pretty awesome.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,220
OK.

68
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,400
So we're going to keep adding things as tango goes.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,160
So you know you guys have more value in this course than any other course out there.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,750
So hopefully this overview here helps you you know know where you at where you want to go.

71
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,650
And I'll see you in the next lecture guys.

72
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,360
Take care.
