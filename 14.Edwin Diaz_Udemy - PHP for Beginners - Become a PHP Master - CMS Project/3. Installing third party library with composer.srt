00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,140
Welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,340
So it's tough for us to start figuring out how we are going to be sending e-mails.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,910
Right.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,830
So we need a third party library because we know the mail function does not work properly.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,940
OK.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,790
So this is the page for the library that we are going to be using and this there are a couple of them.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,650
This is one of the best ones BHB mailer.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,350
There's a whole bunch of functionality here.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,100
OK.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,990
And this is in the home page and you can get to it by just going to Google or something.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,870
Typing BHB mailer clicking on the link and it will give us some more information.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,580
So here's how this works.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:52,810
We are going to be using a another software Webware program to download to install BHB mayor.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,080
And the reason why we're doing that is because it's going to be easier if you don't know of a composer.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,450
Do not worry.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:08,690
I'm going to show you how to use a composer is a package manager for BHB So this very simple here you

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,880
download it and they tell you how to download it.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,070
And then this or this or the configuration you can basically paste copy and paste into your project

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,260
and he would work great.

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,540
Make sure you change the host to your whatever.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,530
As a.p is OK.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,940
Your user name your password.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,810
So let me show you let me first explain to you about composing real quick and I got it.

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,540
I believe I have a course on that.

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,210
And some of these BHB core tools just in case you want to find out some more about it.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:56,200
If you go here and when you see I have of course you see

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,820
and if I go to Edwin dÃ­az real quick let's go to my profile and should be there somewhere.

28
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,130
Is a free course and it's called

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
See what it is.

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:33,970
They I created that course specifically for for you guys so you guys can actually learn this.

31
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,020
And I think I passed it.

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,630
It's it's the tools has to be in the second page.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
And now really looking guys

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't see it there.

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:03:04,220
Let me actually go to this other web site my on my Web site actually find it free courses and BHB advanced

36
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,210
tools.

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,930
OK.

38
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,350
Here you will find how to use composer how to use vagrants.

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,970
OK.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,970
Very important tools for development.

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:27,280
So anyway let's go back to the course and let's go and type in composer here

42
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,720
get composer that Gorog is a Web site.

43
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,810
Unless they change it.

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,260
If you're using Windows when you click download is going to offer you to use Windows.

45
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,030
OK.

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,790
Downlow the there is a lot.

47
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:51,000
It's a lie easier when you download it with Windows because he's going to give you a whole package a

48
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:59,060
whole thing to download everything with a Mac like I'm running right now from the terminal I can do

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,000
this.

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,910
OK I copy the first line and I place it in my terminal OK like this.

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Well you've got a copy and paste all of it.

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,630
One by one.

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,430
And then at the end you just delete that file.

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,010
OK.

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,780
Then you have composer and store pretty cool.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,060
OK.

57
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,170
But anyway so.

58
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,850
And there's a whole bunch of if you don't know like I said go to coding faculty that come install it.

59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,180
And there's a whole bunch of tutorials about it.

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,990
But anyway that's how we're going to be using.

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,420
And if you don't have it go ahead and download it now.

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,380
And that's it.

63
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,320
OK let's go back here.

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,380
And once you start using right away I'm going to open my terminal and this is the same thing right here

65
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,560
in this ID as my term you know in the Mac or get Bash.

66
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:58,180
Oh and by the way if you don't have a terminal a command window and if you want something very similar

67
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:07,360
to Linux or Mac the one like the one I'm using downhole get bash go to get right here to this Web site

68
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,210
and download this little guy right here.

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,440
OK and just follow the prompts and he's going to install something in your desktop is going to stall

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,490
bash a command tool that you can use and then double click it and open it and he's going to open a window

71
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,010
like this.

72
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,540
I think it's going to be black and use that in just to send commands that I'm writing.

73
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,650
OK.

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,420
I have composer installed globally so make sure that you do us well.

75
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:42,280
So if I type in composer here you can see that it's going to show a retro like that.

76
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,430
Decide you know the date is installed.

77
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,170
OK.

78
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,430
So let's go ahead and install require.

79
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,080
So I'm going to use composer require a this does not work for you because composer is nine still global.

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,080
So make sure they on their page and start to compose or globally.

81
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,670
So this is the

82
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,250
command right here.

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,090
OK very simple I just wanted to show you composer require to paste it.

84
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:26,480
But before we do that let's actually actually you know what I can create if I wanted to the JSM file

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,540
with you and composer in it.

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,960
That's going to do that.

87
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,950
A creative composer Jason foud that we can and I'm sure actually let me show you how to do that real

88
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,670
quick.

89
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,160
It's going to when I press enter is going to ask me hey what is the name of the vendor.

90
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:48,710
I'm just going to click enter for everything under a name on just going to type in India's court of

91
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,410
faculty

92
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,490
that come closer with a greater than symbol.

93
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,050
Enter Antar Antar and would you like to find your dependencies.

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,060
If I click yes he's going to ask me questions I don't want to do that now.

95
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,130
It's going to ask me if I want to search for a package I can do this be achieved BHB Mailer and it's

96
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,880
going to look for it and you can see that it finds it right here.

97
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,970
If I press 0 here he's going to download it for me but I don't want to do it.

98
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:31,180
I want to get out of here to show you the composite that Jason File let me see if it's images come out

99
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,120
of there.

100
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,930
Enter

101
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,150
find out if you created the file real quick

102
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,770
OK you've got to actually go back.

103
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,250
Composer Jason and

104
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,800
D.S.

105
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,780
Let's go back here.

106
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,270
I don't use as much.

107
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,310
I think I used to maybe twice because I create most of my projects already in a different way.

108
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,760
It's required actually.

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:03,750
So yes BHB mailer so BHB made it should be the first one zero.

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,180
And actually I think it's number three too.

111
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,610
So zero enter no version control constraint.

112
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,360
Click Enter.

113
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,100
And now it's actually doing that for me.

114
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,430
And now the composite additions that Chaisson should be there for me

115
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,960
yes that's fine.

116
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,970
That's fine.

117
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,020
All has to be here.

118
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,720
There we go right here.

119
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,650
So now we can see the composer that Jason fow created for us.

120
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,130
This is the information that I put in.

121
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:59,600
As you can see now if I want to download some type of file I can say well you see that he has a dependency

122
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,320
here.

123
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,980
It's going to require ph be made right.

124
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,530
So let's clear this and I'm going to Taiping composer install

125
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,180
excuse me and it's installing now for me.

126
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:26,120
And now I have a new phone directory here with composer of course and BHP mailer OK.

127
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,920
And that's it.

128
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,700
Now I know this could be a little hard to actually do.

129
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,780
So make sure that you download composer.

130
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,460
The only problem that you would have is a few typing composer in your terminal and you don't get you

131
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,010
get a bass note in that command error or something like that.

132
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,480
That means that your composer is nine still globally go to the documentation make sure that you in Windows

133
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,230
I believe you have to put your own path.

134
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,880
You have to have a Ph besides the cuticle file in Windows.

135
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,770
So make sure that when you are installing and going to ask you where is the BHB that executable.

136
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,790
If you have a zap you can find it.

137
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,340
You go to the Zahm application.

138
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,120
And I believe he's in or something like that but it's there.

139
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,680
OK.

140
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,170
You can find it and with a Mac you shouldn't have a problem.

141
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,850
OK.

142
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,180
Very easy.

143
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
Thank you so much for watching.

144
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,970
And the next lecture we're going to start setting everything on with BHB mail to send e-mails.

145
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,350
Thank you.
