00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:06.840
Welcome back my students in the last lecture we already downloaded this page right here that I built

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:12.040
for you this markup this form and now we are ready to start coding some PH BE into it.

3

00:00:12.040  -->  00:00:12.930
Right.

4

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:18.460
What I really want to do is that I want to clean the data before we go to the database.

5

00:00:18.480  -->  00:00:24.230
And I also want to encrypt the password so that way we can make this hacker proof.

6

00:00:24.240  -->  00:00:29.130
So these are going to be a really awesome series of videos on how to build this restriction page is

7

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:29.780
going to be awesome.

8

00:00:29.780  -->  00:00:30.440
You know I like it.

9

00:00:30.450  -->  00:00:31.120
All right.

10

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:38.910
So let's go ahead and jump into our registration that BHP which is in sire's see a folder from the last

11

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.040
video right.

12

00:00:40.440  -->  00:00:46.270
And then let's go ahead up here and start recording some BHB right.

13

00:00:46.280  -->  00:00:55.230
All right let's open up BHB attack that we've done like a million times and let's check for the forum

14

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:57.020
to see if the form is actually working.

15

00:00:57.020  -->  00:00:58.480
This is what we want to do on this one.

16

00:00:58.480  -->  00:01:02.470
On this lecture here and you should be able to do this.

17

00:01:02.490  -->  00:01:03.670
Few know how to do this.

18

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:06.910
Just post a video and do it because that's what we are going to be doing.

19

00:01:07.130  -->  00:01:13.590
And if you know how to scaped values of the form also do that because that's what we are going to be

20

00:01:13.590  -->  00:01:15.450
doing also so.

21

00:01:16.030  -->  00:01:18.080
All right.

22

00:01:19.890  -->  00:01:22.450
So let's go ahead and do this.

23

00:01:22.590  -->  00:01:26.490
This use a set function.

24

00:01:26.500  -->  00:01:27.660
Hope you're having a great day.

25

00:01:27.660  -->  00:01:30.520
I'm having an awesome day today.

26

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:32.340
I start a little down.

27

00:01:32.520  -->  00:01:33.890
Like how you want to do anything.

28

00:01:33.890  -->  00:01:39.300
And once I started making a video or two to help you guys out and get you some more information I started

29

00:01:39.300  -->  00:01:40.150
feeling really good.

30

00:01:40.230  -->  00:01:43.060
So that's an advice there.

31

00:01:43.060  -->  00:01:46.920
If you're feeling down started doing something you like then all of a sudden you're going to feel a

32

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:47.580
lot better.

33

00:01:47.580  -->  00:01:48.330
All right.

34

00:01:48.660  -->  00:01:52.910
So we've got a couple of fields see your dad.

35

00:01:53.430  -->  00:01:54.720
We need to get right.

36

00:01:54.990  -->  00:01:58.490
But first let's find out if this is working so we're going to use this myth here.

37

00:01:58.500  -->  00:01:59.550
Value.

38

00:01:59.850  -->  00:02:03.360
Value from these out of you to check if it's working.

39

00:02:03.480  -->  00:02:12.210
So if they submit Ryfe if this M-ID value is available to us when I say it's working I'm trying to I'm

40

00:02:12.210  -->  00:02:17.820
going to try to make this a lecture C or shorter if you guys don't mind if you don't let me know and

41

00:02:17.810  -->  00:02:19.460
message me I will make them longer.

42

00:02:19.650  -->  00:02:24.300
Well the shorter they are the better it is for you especially if you don't have much time.

43

00:02:24.480  -->  00:02:28.110
So let's go ahead and check this out to see how it looks in the browser.

44

00:02:28.640  -->  00:02:31.950
If it works enter raised.

45

00:02:32.010  -->  00:02:34.500
Now it's working right.

46

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:40.250
So we know that our form is working and we need to do is extract the values and clean them out and we're

47

00:02:40.250  -->  00:02:41.370
going to do the next lecture.

48

00:02:41.370  -->  00:02:44.980
So I feel like this shorter lecture versions let me know.

49

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:48.160
Message me if you don't then also let me know.

50

00:02:48.210  -->  00:02:50.210
But anyway thank you so much for watching.

51

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:51.750
And I see you in the next lecture.

52

00:02:51.750  -->  00:02:52.180
Take care
