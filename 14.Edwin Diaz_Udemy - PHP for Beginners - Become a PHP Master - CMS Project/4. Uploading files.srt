1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,350
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,810
I'm a student so hopefully you are at the root of your directory and whatever hosting company you are

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,350
if you are here on Go Daddy.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,000
Perfect.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,310
If not don't worry about it we can still do it.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,100
All right.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,290
So we are in the public on the score.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,290
This is going to be my web directory.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,990
So here is where we're going to need to be or see him as follows.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,340
But we also need to create a database right.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,170
So let's go to our local host

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,310
them BHB my admin right in here.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,300
We're going to do an export on our CMOS.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,470
All right so we choose or see a mass make sure that you use click on the CMOS.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,780
Now any any other tables you're going to see a mess.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,340
All right then we're going to go to export and then we're going to click go and we're going to download

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,950
the database file which is going to end with a Escudo extension because that is for the sequel.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,260
All right.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,580
I mean sequel as well.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,410
All right so now we got that.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:12,740
So the next thing is we've got to go to our local host and we've got to compress our CMOS into a zip.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,590
All right.

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,580
So I and my Mac I just right click and compress mass in some of you if you using Windows where you need

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:30,800
to do is right click and use 7 zip or think when Zip is programmed to use to compress into a zip folder.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,140
All right.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,210
Basically we're compressing this so that way we can all bloated to go daddy easily.

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,200
So let's go here.

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,440
Go Daddy or whatever hosting you're using and click upload.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,560
We're going to upload it to the root directory and then along the way it is 6 4 4.

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:48,840
All right.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,620
That might cause a permission problem later on but we'll fix that.

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,890
We'll see if we can fix it.

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,830
But anyway this is the permission for the full folders.

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,740
Anyone going to choose a file that I need to upload.

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm going to go to my HD Doug's and see him as I already compress this before so that's why I have it

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,640
right here see him as that zip.

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,230
All right so make sure that you compress the whole folder from the lectures.

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,050
All right open.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,420
I see him has already had this in the directory.

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
I already have it.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,440
So that's why he's telling me that but I'm just going to say yes for you just because you don't have

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,080
it you're not going to get that pop up.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,870
So I already completed this.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm going to refresh.

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,520
I think that he has something that I can refresh useful refresh if not just going to refresh it.

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:49,580
And we have the folder right here that zip right click and I'm going to extract and extract right there.

47
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,910
All right.

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,070
Now that I have extract that should see the folder now right here.

49
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,230
If I click on it you're going to see that I have all the files in there so I'm going to go back right

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,980
and there's a couple of things that we are going to change.

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,040
They're in the database.

52
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,560
But before that.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,130
All right we need to create a database so I'm going to make this lecture very sure and let you you know

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,580
blow this to your server and I'll see you in the next lecture.

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,400
Thank you so much
