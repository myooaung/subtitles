00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.350
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.080
We're going to do a little refactoring first a little turning this equerries into functions because

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.690
still now right.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.320
We did this live right here the first time and it turned out great.

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.330
Right so we put it in the back and it functions file here.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.840
So let's do that with this one here.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.880
Also we need to start getting into the habit of putting everything into functions.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.340
So let's go ahead and go to take this out of here.

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.830
Actually I'm going to use a feature here that you probably have not seen yet and that's just click here

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.300
and we're going to split it in half.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.560
You want to put a file here and it's going to be here on the right side.

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.230
Well this is for the people that are using this coeditor.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.670
By the way.

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.120
So if you're now using this code don't worry about it.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860
And I'm going to use this working Fauzi a lot better than using the right.

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.560
The one at the bottom there for some reason because I'm not so used to using this editor that's why

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.290
you probably see me looking right here.

18
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
But anyway everything is up here and everything is close here.

19
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.120
So you can see there there's got to a logging of day here.

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.180
And let's take this out of here.

21
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.390
All right let's take it out.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.490
This is actually take it out with that ph B tag that we need.

23
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.440
There we go.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.470
All right.

25
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.080
Let's make this a little bigger.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.910
Remember this is functions actually right here.

27
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.370
They just bring it down to the right hand panel right here which is I just dragged it down and we're

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.750
going to call this function.

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.960
This function is actually responsible for updating.

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
All right so this is the old they function function.

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.080
So let's just do it right.

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
Just making sure that tax I correctly that's why I click on it that way I can see these on the line

33
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.890
little line there and you're going to pull some space here and we don't actually need that tag by the

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.660
way.

35
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.480
So we didn't we didn't have it here but we do.

36
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.130
All right.

37
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.130
And we don't need this if it is.

38
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.560
So maybe we don't need that.

39
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.520
So let's go back to this and let's just leave it here.

40
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.050
All right.

41
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.470
Just leave it here.

42
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.770
And while we're going to be putting here let's just leave everything here.

43
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.890
We don't need it.

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.060
Well we're going to be putting Here is the function.

45
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.850
All right.

46
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.630
So we got it set here and we're going to have to call the function when the when the form is submitted.

47
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.480
So let's call Let's first make this function here because we have a make Let's wrap this whole thing

48
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.990
into a function.

49
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.300
So we're going to call this function update update

50
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.700
table array of the table.

51
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.220
Wrap it up.

52
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.200
So now every time we want to add as all this content here we're just going to call this this function.

53
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.320
Let's go back to the right panel to the left panel and they just pull all the information there here

54
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.150
and let's see if the function works.

55
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.340
It's a matter of fact we have to bring the global connection.

56
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.930
This one here we have to also take it to this function right here.

57
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.410
So make sure that's there.

58
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.430
All right.

59
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.300
OK.

60
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.780
Perfect.

61
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.010
So let's go to this file here.

62
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:56.090
Logging on the score of day and let's try it seven and let's call it the IP man and let's just say some

63
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.530
bogus password here.

64
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.720
Update It looks like it worked.

65
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.260
Let's check it out.

66
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.290
Seven and a worked.

67
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.640
All right so we were able to refactor I'm not going to make this video too long.

68
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.310
All right.

69
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.510
So let's go ahead on the next one and then finally I think we'll have to do anything else here.

70
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.910
Let's finally go ahead and start

71
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.410
deleting stuff from our database.

72
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.920
Right.

73
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.730
So anyway see you in the next video.

74
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.120
Take your
