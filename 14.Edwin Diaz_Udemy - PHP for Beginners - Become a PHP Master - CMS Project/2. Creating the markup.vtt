00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome back my the student.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.800
So on this new lectures I'm going to show you how to create awesome delete Moldau.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.470
We bootstrap now.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.150
Right now we have a little pop up when we click when we click it we get this little javascript pop up

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.630
right.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.130
This doesn't look very sexy doesn't look very nice.

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm going to show you how to create one that looks like this.

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.400
Let me show you.

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.430
If I go and say Bush strap down.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.910
Whoops I misspelled it but my best friend helping me if I go here and I click here you can see this

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.890
little box here.

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.650
This is this is going to look very nice.

13
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.390
Or C a mess and we can have a really read delete button here and a castle here.

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.790
I mean you're going to see that it's going to look great if you want to see a preview of a preview.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.050
I'm pretty sure this section is going to have a couple of more lectures go to the last one and I'll

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.420
show you a preview there at the end of that lecture.

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.060
All right.

18
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.820
So anyway but it's going to be really nice.

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090
Let me show you how we can implement this in our system.

20
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.710
First of all let's go and back to you through school.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.970
See I believe they have that cold but you can get the cold from Bootstrap.

22
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.750
I'm going to take this Moldau code from here and I'm going to go to admin includes And right here I'm

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.980
going to create a new file called Delete Modahl that BHB.

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.060
All right.

25
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
Save it.

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.650
There we go.

27
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.200
Paste that code in there and I'm going to go to your post because that's where I wanted to include it

28
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.320
right.

29
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.200
And if I go and say include or more now

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:57.170
the DUP ph B and then go back here and then refresh us what did I call that file.

31
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.790
I never included a file here the day is called The Lead Moldau.

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.410
All right.

33
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.430
I did include it but I put the order in the wrong place.

34
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.910
All right.

35
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.980
So now we have this Moldau we click on it and we get these bots included automatically beautiful right

36
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.610
now we need two more you know study a little bit so I'm going to go back here to the Moldau.

37
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.490
I'm going to create an anchor tag right here with a class of between.

38
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.750
In another class of VTM.

39
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:43.290
Danger right that that's going to make a read and I'm going to call this cancel actually delete this

40
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870
one is going to be called cancel.

41
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.520
I'm going to put an extra class because we are going to be targeting this I'm going to call this down

42
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.850
the link there.

43
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.140
All right.

44
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.650
Just remember the name just in case we forget.

45
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.410
All right.

46
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.380
All right so now that we have this let's just look at it real quick.

47
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.180
All right perfect.

48
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.170
So now we got it working right.

49
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:19.590
And here we just want a nice touch to say something like Are you sure you want to delete

50
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.550
this post or whatever it is that you are

51
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.120
deleting all right so now you don't even have to go to the last lecture to actually see this being implemented.

52
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.160
Now you can see right here look at this.

53
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.680
Are you sure you want to delete delete or cancel.

54
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Now one that takes a little bigger right.

55
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.050
So let's make this H1 an H1.

56
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.710
Whoops.

57
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.290
I don't need to show you that right.

58
00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.910
So anyway so what we're going to be doing and how we are going to be doing it is that they see if we

59
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.210
can minimize this a little bit so that we know

60
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.940
we can make it to actually too big.

61
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.120
All right

62
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.110
that's fine.

63
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.370
All right so the way we are going to be doing this is when we click here.

64
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.950
All right we need to pull the ID out of the post whatever ID we have here.

65
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.200
And that way we can send our requests to the delete function right.

66
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.040
So let's do that.

67
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.940
And we're going to be doing that Jake where we so we're going to be using a little bit of that here.

68
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.030
All right.

69
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.960
Now one thing that I have to let you know is that in order for us to target this specific button here

70
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.320
we need to write the code the javascript code in the same file on the View or post page.

71
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.110
Why.

72
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.520
Because that data is being produced dynamically and we cannot access that data from anywhere else unless

73
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.330
we are in the same dynamic data unless we include that javascript there in that same dynamic data.

74
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.190
And that way we're going to be doing that by putting javascript somewhere here.

75
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.130
So if we go the way to the bottom here of this file view view Opal's we can write our javascript right

76
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.770
here right.

77
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.710
And we can create a document right here.

78
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.760
But instead of creating all that document that right we can go to scripts and get it from there right

79
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.980
here.

80
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.050
All right.

81
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.070
We're going to close it with.

82
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.010
There we go.

83
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.730
Now alert just to make sure that it is working.

84
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.580
And let's go to

85
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.930
this bar right here let's create a copy of it and then commented it out.

86
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.580
And all this we're going to take off this on click right there.

87
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:22.280
And this shows make sure he has an ref and also lets make sure he has a class right.

88
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.950
Right.

89
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:31.040
And we're going to call this the lead or the lead link just delete link.

90
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.330
Come back here.

91
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.100
Copy that out.

92
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.630
Well actually we have our call right here.

93
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:48.930
Let's go to the bottom here and let's create an event here for that and we get an essay on we're going

94
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.660
to use this function on from Jake Querrey when we click on it.

95
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.320
We want this callback function to be activated and this callback function is going to have this alert.

96
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.810
I was going to say works or something like that.

97
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.300
All right.

98
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.050
We save and make sure that you save everything.

99
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:18.080
And if we refresh we click on this and he says he doesn't work.

100
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.740
All right.

101
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.200
See that.

102
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.290
And the reason why he doesn't work is because on this view or post page Jake he's not included remember

103
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.820
that Jake worries include all the way in the bottom of the page on the footer brei all the way in the

104
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.270
bottom of the foot and we are not including this all the way in the bottom of the footer.

105
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:45.220
So what we need to do is we need to go to our includes Go to our footer and take Jake worry out there.

106
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:54.190
This script the link and go to the header and include this right after our editor pasted.

107
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.620
And if we refresh and click on that file again.

108
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.800
Now it works.

109
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.430
All right.

110
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.720
Beautiful Let's see if we can do something else on this very real quick.

111
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.250
All right.

112
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.480
So the next step for them for us to do is to pull the idea out of it.

113
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.700
That's the first step.

114
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.160
So how are we going to do that.

115
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.890
Well let's go back to your polls here and if we look at the link we have a class here and this link

116
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.510
already called the lead.

117
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.880
All right but we don't have the pulse ID anywhere here.

118
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.730
Well we have it right here.

119
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:40.270
So let's copy this false ID copy in and let's put it in this create another issue here called Roe.

120
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.870
And let's just post the ID right there.

121
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:50.490
So now we can pull it from this specific link so we save it.

122
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.090
Let's go back to the bottom code right here.

123
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.750
Let's target that and we're going to say this.

124
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:05.760
Let's put a variable for us and this caller ID that's used Jake way with this meaning this specific

125
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.460
link whatever link is clicking.

126
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.730
We are clicking on the moment and we're going to be pulling out the ID from the rail from the acha view

127
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.550
and the actual name is rail.

128
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.180
And now the idea should be there let's just alert it just to make sure that it is there.

129
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:31.680
And if you don't know Jack very much you can take my Jake workhorse and you can learn a whole bunch

130
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.020
is pretty useful basically javascript but in an easier way to do it.

131
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.220
So we refresh make sure that and when we click and we get the ID right here it's working beautiful.

132
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.110
And now we click on another one we get the idea for that specific link.

133
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.980
That's why we use this right here.

134
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.970
All right.

135
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:57.300
Remember this function this callback function is targeting this specific link the specific class wherever

136
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.010
that class is targeting.

137
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.370
And this means just that specific item that element right.

138
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.260
In this case is an eye an anchor tag with a class of delete link.

139
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.420
But anyway hopefully you got this far right if not just rewind the video and look at it's pretty easy

140
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.120
to do.

141
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:22.700
And if this confuses you again I have a really good Jake where recourse available and that is there's

142
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:29.700
always discounts available on the specific platform or if you ask me and if you can afford it I can

143
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.160
always help you out.

144
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.210
Anyway thank you so much.

145
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.340
Now see you on the net.

146
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.930
The lecture
