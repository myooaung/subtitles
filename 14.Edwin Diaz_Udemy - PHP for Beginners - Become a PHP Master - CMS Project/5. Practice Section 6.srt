00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:01,410
Hi welcome back.

2

00:00:01,410  -->  00:00:05,030
I'm really happy that you made it to Section 6.

3

00:00:05,070  -->  00:00:09,180
You've got to be learning some really good stuff here when you reinforce what you already learned.

4

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:09,810
Right.

5

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:11,860
So this is going to be awesome.

6

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:12,520
All right.

7

00:00:12,580  -->  00:00:14,410
Lecturer So let's go ahead and do this.

8

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:21,360
So we are in less in Section sits here and you should be on the practical app and on the sets that BHB

9

00:00:21,390  -->  00:00:26,460
right double checking that because I know some of you would take some time off.

10

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:31,770
All right so he asking us to make a form that's limited to one that one had to pull supernova.

11

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:34,840
Then we just want to echo that value and see it right.

12

00:00:34,860  -->  00:00:42,850
So go ahead and post a video create a little form and catch it with a super super global and let's equate

13

00:00:42,980  -->  00:00:45,770
that see it on the browser right.

14

00:00:45,900  -->  00:00:47,920
That see it right here on the middle here.

15

00:00:47,920  -->  00:00:51,070
All right so make sure you do everything right here.

16

00:00:51,820  -->  00:00:54,420
All right so post a video and you should be able to do that.

17

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:57,630
It should be very simple for you since we already did it.

18

00:00:57,630  -->  00:01:04,320
If not go back to the video rewind it and just keep looking at that video over and over until you learn

19

00:01:04,320  -->  00:01:05,250
it.

20

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:08,010
All right so positivity don't cheat.

21

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:12,900
All right so I'm assuming that you did it and you did it successfully because I'm a good teacher.

22

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:17,440
I believe that in my heart but hopefully you believe that too.

23

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:21,430
But anyways so let's go ahead stop Edlund stop talking so much.

24

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:22,960
Go ahead and start doing this.

25

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:30,490
All right so let's create a form here and let's make sure he has a method.

26

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:34,960
Remember that those data method right there right.

27

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:41,050
And let's make sure he submits the same page sets that ph B.

28

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:42,330
Now let's create.

29

00:01:42,510  -->  00:01:43,940
We just need one value right.

30

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:51,870
So I'm just going to create this input is going to be Samit types of MIT name is going to have this

31

00:01:51,870  -->  00:01:54,350
is the name that we're sending into the postal pro-global.

32

00:01:54,690  -->  00:02:00,870
And this is the value it's the value of the book and of course just going to make it different than

33

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:02,640
the other the rest.

34

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:05,340
So let's go back and see what we got here.

35

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,640
All right we have a button here that doesn't do anything.

36

00:02:08,640  -->  00:02:11,390
Perfect.

37

00:02:11,520  -->  00:02:17,080
Now what we need to do is make our BHB.

38

00:02:17,080  -->  00:02:21,570
All right so Paul Superguy over here to catch that value and display it.

39

00:02:21,570  -->  00:02:23,390
So how are we going to do that.

40

00:02:23,410  -->  00:02:29,380
Us we open a BHB tag and make sure that we have that.

41

00:02:29,490  -->  00:02:30,330
And

42

00:02:32,970  -->  00:02:38,670
so now let's use an if statement just to make sure that this has been submitted is really good practice

43

00:02:38,670  -->  00:02:39,810
to do that.

44

00:02:40,650  -->  00:02:42,860
And when we check on that.

45

00:02:42,900  -->  00:02:45,510
But when we sum it up once and it'll happen.

46

00:02:45,540  -->  00:02:50,040
So let's use a function is set to check on that super global right here

47

00:02:52,920  -->  00:02:54,370
for the value submit.

48

00:02:54,380  -->  00:02:58,690
And this is the value that we got on the name right here.

49

00:02:58,740  -->  00:02:59,190
That you.

50

00:02:59,200  -->  00:03:00,110
All right.

51

00:03:00,570  -->  00:03:08,010
So if that exist were going to be echoing on the screen that said That's all we going to be doing and

52

00:03:09,130  -->  00:03:11,810
we're going to copy and paste that here and that's it.

53

00:03:11,820  -->  00:03:12,970
That's all you got to do actually.

54

00:03:13,110  -->  00:03:14,600
Very simple right.

55

00:03:15,030  -->  00:03:17,690
We don't need anything else here unless we have a mistake.

56

00:03:17,700  -->  00:03:18,880
And I think we're good.

57

00:03:19,140  -->  00:03:23,420
So let's go back here let's refresh submit.

58

00:03:23,550  -->  00:03:26,390
As you can see the value right here we are echoing the value.

59

00:03:26,430  -->  00:03:32,310
If I go ahead and refresh again and submit we get value again.

60

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:35,490
So that's all I ask for you to do in this second year.

61

00:03:35,510  -->  00:03:37,680
All right so hopefully you did this successfully.

62

00:03:37,680  -->  00:03:40,650
Super easy to do and what we've done here.

63

00:03:40,650  -->  00:03:45,600
So hopefully you have as much fun as I did and I see you in the next section you're almost there.

64

00:03:45,600  -->  00:03:47,900
Take care.
