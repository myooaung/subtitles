00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.630
All right so we left off on this links here and the other links right here.

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.300
All right.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.800
So we are going to be for your users.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.300
We're going to be doing something here.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.680
Well I want to do this lectures actually be able to delete a record.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.020
So let's go ahead and do a delete query and if we go all the way down we have the link where right here

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.040
or we have to change things around a little bit.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:36.800
The user id the lead from users you should be able to know how to do this already with a user ID.

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:46.450
It caused a user ID right for it and the user Querrey to that.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.600
That looks great right.

11
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.860
And users right here.

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.270
Right.

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.510
And the link here we just got past passed the I.D. on it.

14
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.060
So

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.980
the lead right here.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.720
OK I think we're good to go.

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.070
Let's test this thing out.

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.660
Oh.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.350
Make sure that it says users.

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.740
All right let's try it out.

21
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.360
Let's refresh click and that's not passing the

22
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.580
user id make sure that we are on the same page.

23
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.230
Let's make sure that we are getting this here.

24
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.630
We're now getting a user ID which is refresh again.

25
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.110
Delete.

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.900
You see right here when we click on it we're now getting our user ID.

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.680
So let's make sure that we are on the same page users that BHP delete user id

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.740
let's just save it again.

29
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.140
Maybe I didn't save it.

30
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.050
That's probably the problem.

31
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.500
Delete.

32
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.850
And we're not actually getting the user id right here.

33
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.970
You see the lead for but we're not deleting anything.

34
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.520
So let's make sure it is working actually right here.

35
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.470
Misspell something.

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.670
Sorry about that guys.

37
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.490
User ID now should work.

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.820
All right.

39
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.310
Delete.

40
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.010
Perfect.

41
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.060
Now it is working right.

42
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720
Make sure you don't misspell something sometimes when you're trying to do it too fast.

43
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.140
Any misspelling can make something not work.

44
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.660
All right.

45
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.950
So on the last lecture we're going to tackle the rules and we're going to see how we can change this.

46
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.560
All right.

47
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.920
So anyway thank you so much.

48
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.040
And I see your next one.

49
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.460
Take care
