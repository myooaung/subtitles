00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Welcome back my dear student in this lecture here we're going to try to finish this as much as we can.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,420
Now we have a couple of things that we've got to work on.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,720
First of all this form right now if you try to submit it that way it is would not submit if you put

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,420
something in.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,830
Yes it will submit it.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,160
Well it's not going to submit but it's going to redirect us.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,950
So let's go to functions real quick and let's check out the code responsible for that

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,420
as you can see that's the only code responsible for that.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:40,080
And what we need to do is come to registration that BHB and just common to out here because we are not

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,960
working 100 percent and we don't want it.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,940
We don't want to do anything with them now.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,050
So if I type something in nothing happens and that's what I want.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,470
So now the next step for us to do here is first of all I want to include a couple of features here.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,490
One of the features is we want to give the user some type of notification that something is wrong with

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,240
their form so they could fix it.

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,730
Right.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,670
Because right now they try to submit something in and they get the speech they don't know what in the

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,820
world is going on right.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,770
That's one thing.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,300
Another thing that we want to help the user complete this form.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,910
So if he has a name that starts with a we want his foreign to you know if he types his name would a.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,750
Or let's say his name is Alfonso.

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,660
He registers something was wrong he's password we don't want him to type in the name again.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,440
Right let's help him out a little bit.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,670
Elisha's autocomplete it for him.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,570
And that's what we're going to be doing with the form.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,330
All right.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,980
So we're going to autocomplete this for him.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,880
And we also want to echo out the same user name that he typed in before that.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,890
All right.

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,530
Before the registration fail of course so we can help him mowing a couple of ways.

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,090
All right.

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,520
So let's go to this forum right here and right here on user name we are going to type in these new attribute

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,660
called autocomplete.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,620
And we can turn it on.

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,350
We can turn it off but it's already off.

37
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,700
Let's turn it on.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,410
There we go.

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,810
And now the next one here.

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,350
So now if you go back here and let's say my name is Edwin which actually it is.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,250
Right.

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,930
And I just want to use a name like this and I type in my email address whatever.

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,560
The e-mail address is right and register.

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,880
Now if I try to type in Edwyn again guess what not then what if I type in.

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,880
Actually it's making me look really bad guys really bad.

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,420
Let's go back here.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,380
Autocomplete is on.

48
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,160
So should he be making love.

49
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,320
All right let's let's type in there doing some crazy e-mail.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Hopefully we'll take the e-mail.

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,310
There we go.

52
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,130
Yeah yeah yeah I know.

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,240
And we are now typing Edwins there.

54
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,040
All right because I needed to refresh the browser guys so you can see that we were already helping the

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,720
user out I to do this press tab or enter and they get their name filled in.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,290
All right.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,820
So now the next step for us to do is to actually display back the user name for them.

58
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,140
All right we helping these guys out with our application we just want to make our application and user

59
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,510
friendly guys.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,630
All right.

61
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:33,550
So let's open up we BHB tag here and let's do a shorthand so that way you can get used to it shorthand

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,540
if statement.

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,430
It works like this.

64
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,220
We're going to echo out something if we set I know this might be a little confusing you get used to

65
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,830
it.

66
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,940
All right.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,610
So what do we have.

68
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,450
Well if the user name is set this is what this question mark is we want to display it.

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,940
The calling is if it's not set else statement.

70
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,700
Basically we want it to be empty.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,240
So let's try that.

72
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,890
Enter as you can see the Edwyn is put in again.

73
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,830
Paolo refresh.

74
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,860
Watch this.

75
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,160
The power is going to stay right there.

76
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,590
You see that we help the user already with that beautiful.

77
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,910
So let's do that for the rest of them well enough for the rest of them.

78
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,610
Let's do that for e-mail and that's it.

79
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,570
We can do that for fast.

80
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,660
Well we wouldn't want to put the same password again make it easier for him right here.

81
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,890
For a complete Zaun this just make sure that we change this to email

82
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,870
and we go guys if you notice are not really holding you by the hand are the end of this.

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:56,640
You know because you already have taken 200 something lectures maybe 300 on lectures already and you

84
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,930
don't need me to hold you by your hand or this.

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,940
You already know most of this stuff.

86
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
So.

87
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,240
All right.

88
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:13,270
So Edwin and then Edwin according faculty are calm cool.

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,050
He would go

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,440
let's see if my brother was going to help me out.

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,950
You see how easier that is now for him now even though even if this did not have anything we could just

92
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:36,490
say Edwin and then type in you see that a lot easier for them just in case they are lazy.

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,270
All right.

94
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:43,180
So I think we're done with his lectures on this lecture with this with this lecture sorry.

95
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,970
Or the next lecture we're going to continue with this and just keep improving it and making it better

96
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,070
for you guys whole.

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Hopefully you'll like in his lectures and I'll see you in the next ones ticker
