00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,590
Hi welcome back my students in this lecture here we are going to be refactoring your code that it'll

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:05,920
be.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,690
We're going to be condensing a code making it into modular pieces.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,250
All right.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,410
Just like we did with custom functions that basically that's what we're doing right here.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,300
We're grabbing a whole bunch of code and putting it into functions right.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,580
We have our categories here working already.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,220
All right.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,860
So that's working.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,400
And let's go back to our categories.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,400
PH be right here.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,860
So we got all this cold right here right.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,090
You know we have a lot HD mail here too.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,500
So refactoring is going to come very handy.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,980
All right.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,230
So we are going to be doing here we're going to be creating this this file call function that BHB which

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,320
is very popular and see a Messis.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,890
So I just going I right click on admen I'm going to make this phone call functions that BHB enter to

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,980
open up ph BTX here.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,300
And you should know this by now because you took those foundations when we started the course.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,730
Right.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,230
So I'm going to go back to categories.

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,940
I'm going to take all these cold data here like this.

24
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,810
Right.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,880
And then it goes back to functions are going to create a function here called insert categories.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,990
There we go.

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:29,220
And I'm just going to paste all that code in there and then I'm just going to grab this function here

28
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,270
name.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,560
Go back to categories and place it right here.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,350
Put a semicolon right here and the end of that BHB tag.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,860
Condense my code a little bit more this way.

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,310
And now we have a beautiful piece of code here which is the name of the function calling our functions

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,110
right.

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,770
With all the functionality behind the scenes.

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,660
So now he says called on the Find function insert categories or let's make sure that we save our functions

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,850
of BHP far right here.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,330
All right.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
And come back again.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,180
Insert categories like 40 something is going on there let's just check it out.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,780
All right.

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,520
Make sure that this code is clean.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Here let's go back to categories of BHB and we have this should be all.

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,070
OK.

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,620
One thing that you should not forget which I forgot right now is that we need to include this file right.

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,690
We need to make sure that is available functions are BHB.

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,090
Right.

47
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,930
So go to your admin header inside your admin folders and make sure that we include this file right just

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,740
like this.

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,900
So we want this to be

50
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,220
functions that BHB.

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,830
All right.

52
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:59,100
And that's what it should be their functions and we are actually we are an admin and this is in psi

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,900
actually is inside.

54
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,970
And we go that's what it should be right there.

55
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,400
All right.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,630
For those of you that don't have these Olby start function make sure that you put it right now.

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,810
All right this is something that we are going to be needing through our CMF this is going to star output

58
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,370
output buffering right.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,030
You can look it up on the net.

60
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,850
So basically we're going to send some information in the headers and that's for more advanced users.

61
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,260
But just put this Olby start function right here just in case you don't have it.

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,520
So let's go back here and let's check it out.

63
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,220
Now it looks like he's working right.

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,180
Look at the ad category.

65
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,510
Then we can test three A to find connection.

66
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,010
All right.

67
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,040
All right one thing that we need to do.

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,720
All right.

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,700
Another thing that's good that I tested that out is that we need to bring our connection has to be global.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,500
So we need to ride the global attribute Well the global right here.

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,950
And this is just going to make our connection very well global.

72
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,830
All right.

73
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,360
So make sure that you do that.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,510
Now should work.

75
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,460
There we go.

76
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,380
Yes.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,220
Three category and now we have another category they're working all right.

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,190
So make sure that you have your global here every time you're using a function and you need a variable

79
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,600
to be available.

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,890
Make sure you bring it in with the global keyword right.

81
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,860
Make sure that you include your BHB your function that ph be found here.

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,680
All right.

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,590
So make sure you have the Olby star function.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Also we are going to be needing that later on.

85
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,290
All right.

86
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,230
So we are going to continue.

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,850
All right.

88
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,780
Refactoring the rest of this.

89
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,480
And I'm just going to show you a couple of them and then you should be good.

90
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,840
And you should be able to do it yourself on your see a mess.

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,550
All right.

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,430
So thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you in the next one.

93
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,020
Keep it up keep motivated this is going to take you super far in life if you apply the knowledge.

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,770
And I'm always here to support you.

95
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,470
Right.

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,280
Have a blessed day.

97
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,020
Bye bye.
