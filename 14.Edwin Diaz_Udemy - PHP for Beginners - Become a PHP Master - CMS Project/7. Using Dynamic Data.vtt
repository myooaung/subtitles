00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.960
I will come back and this video here I'm going to show you how to display the nametags how to use dynamic

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.570
data with BHP and how to change a couple of sentences on our coeditor.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.820
For those of you that know the brackets.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.810
So first of all let's go ahead and open brackets and we have this wide background that I want to change.

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.200
You can leave it wide if you want.

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.530
I'm going to be using a dark background since I'm used to programming in the dark background so I'm

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.210
going to go ahead and go to file extension manager.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.260
Go to the theme Stabb here and get inside Marnell Kai.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.450
And this is just a theme based on sublime tetch which is a cool weather tool that I use that I paid

10
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.860
for and he has something very similar to that so I want to install that for this coeditor as you can

11
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.400
see it change in background to black right.

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.630
You can go back here and change themes on view and you can change to whatever you want.

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.010
All right.

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.520
You can come and use that.

15
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.900
If you like I'm going to use this one I'm used to it.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560
Even though this one looks good.

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.260
Right if you agree.

18
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.800
All right so if you see me with a different color background later on you know would want to come back

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.630
here and change if you want.

20
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.730
So I was going to use monel card for now.

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.470
All right.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.990
And other than that I want to do is I want to grab this embed that BHP.

23
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.730
I want to do a Save As and when and when my key word by the way where you can come here and you can

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.810
see the key we're shortcut right there on file.

25
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.530
So I'm going to call this blank that BHB.

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.330
All right.

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660
And you should have this file.

28
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.680
You will have this following you of course exercise files.

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.770
So for example if I if you see that I have all the Farseer when I'm giving you a lecture and you don't

30
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.490
see it in your course that's satisfied don't worry about me as long as you have.

31
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.140
What I'm showing you in the in the moment if I'm showing you a file like this one blank that BHB find

32
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.140
showing you a lesson in that and you have it that's what you need to worry about.

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.840
Don't look to the left side here.

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.280
And in fact if you look to the left side and you see all the Fauzia don't get confused.

35
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.400
Just pay attention to the one that I'm giving you the lecture on.

36
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.930
Right.

37
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.920
So we we have this blank that you're going to build a little structure by putting the exclamation there

38
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.690
and clicking tab pressing tab on my keyboard and here I'm not going to do anything that's going to save

39
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.140
it here.

40
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.710
And then on to another save as I'm going to call this dynamic because I wanted to have that blank BHB

41
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.740
there so that way we can use it to save as other documents that we're going to be making.

42
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.340
So I got to call this dynamic dynamic tetes that's what we're going to be creating here.

43
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.750
This is going to be a little outside the scope of this section here because we're in that section though

44
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.860
this complex is in the beginning because we're going to be talking about something and we're not going

45
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.030
to be talking about what I'm going to show you variables which I'm going to be showing you later lecture

46
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.690
but I want to show you an example how we can display that namak têtes.

47
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.480
So I'm just going to write in H-1 tag and BHB in the amount and this is going to say hello.

48
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.120
Student right.

49
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.280
I'm going to click here to display in my co-host.

50
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.270
Now if you don't for some reason you don't have this set up make sure that you go to your file and it's

51
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.890
going to be in your previous settings.

52
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.100
Make sure that you have this file path right here.

53
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.520
HTP call and forward slash forward slash Lokos forward slash demo.

54
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.150
This is the four that we are working on.

55
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.720
Make sure you have that set up.

56
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230
If you don't go ahead to the locals and make that demo on there and keep them.

57
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.560
Start following me right.

58
00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.240
Make that them a folder and that blank that BHP and start following me for some reason you don't have

59
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.880
that but you haven't and you exercise files right.

60
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.120
So you have to do is go to us as I follow and copy it.

61
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.730
We have an H1 tag here and we just you can see it all right.

62
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.460
That is displaying their tetes.

63
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.120
Now what happens if for some reason I want to display the Centex this is a title for example

64
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.400
the title Edwin D is

65
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.120
the official site.

66
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.230
For example Fishell site they say this is a title for a for my website.

67
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.630
What am I for I want to display this in 20 pages that I got in my wife's I would have to physically

68
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:53.510
go there and copy this from this page here and pasting those all the pages right.

69
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.900
I would have to do that.

70
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.160
And that would be a static text that would be something that will stay there all the time.

71
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.930
What I want to do is produce something dynamically something that I can insert in one page and it would

72
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.400
be available in those 10 pages.

73
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.660
How can I make that happen.

74
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.300
How can that be possible.

75
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.340
We BHB BHP can actually help you create dynamic data that you can use over and over in different pages

76
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.310
without needing to add it manually.

77
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.960
So let me show you how that works.

78
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.760
Let's say for example I want to change this Tessier on all 10 pages.

79
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.380
Right.

80
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:38.020
So we create a file we included we create a function and we put a function on those pages and then with

81
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.460
that function we call another file that has a bunch of data that we can use in that specific page whenever

82
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.910
we want.

83
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.440
Now I don't want to confuse you here by going to get this example right now.

84
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.530
So I have the stats right here what I do is in that scene and I imagine this I mean another page in

85
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.450
a house on BHB and in that page I have I create something called a variable and very was a container

86
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.370
and I have this

87
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.710
data assigned to that variable.

88
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.700
We are saving these data here because I want to I'm actually going to call these data this variable

89
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.700
title that title and I have this H-1 in 10 different pages.

90
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.260
What I'm going to do is inside this H-1 I'm going to embed some page.

91
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.730
And going to echo out the title.

92
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.320
Right now if I just echo this I get a problem there I don't have anything in there.

93
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.320
I me just take that call.

94
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.650
As you can see I have not been there.

95
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:54.840
If I use echo and I use that title the name you can see that I'm displaying the title right here in

96
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.370
this plane that têtes inside of you.

97
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.760
So you can see here by me including this little ph be here.

98
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.810
This BHB function on the pages I create this value here.

99
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.760
Now you might be wondering so what is the purpose of this.

100
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.770
As you say you have to go physically and copy and paste this code here and load 10 pages.

101
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.400
Yes and No.

102
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.000
You see now that I have this variable here on 10 pages right.

103
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.490
This is the one page.

104
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.110
This was in one page.

105
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.940
Now every time I want to change the value here I want to change these steps.

106
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.250
I don't have to go to those 10 pages.

107
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:49.680
I can go to that specific page which in most cases call functions that BHP in changed this and I could

108
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.020
say Edwins site.

109
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:03.540
Now when I change this value on one page is going to changing all 10 pages in that is dynamic data dynamic

110
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.220
tetch rain.

111
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.590
In this case it could be dynamic numbers which can be any data you want.

112
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.230
It can be pictures.

113
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.030
All right.

114
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:18.210
So just by having this in one page write with have value there and then having this little function

115
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.900
or 10 pages right I create dynamic data because I can I just change it in one place and it would change

116
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.000
getting all different pages I could have a thousand different pages which endure for me romantically.

117
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.870
So beautiful right.

118
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.190
BHB helps us do that.

119
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.220
All right so hopefully you're able to learn something valuable in this lecture here.

120
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.430
And I got a lot more in store for you so keep tuned.

121
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.470
And let's go to the next lecture if you have some time.
