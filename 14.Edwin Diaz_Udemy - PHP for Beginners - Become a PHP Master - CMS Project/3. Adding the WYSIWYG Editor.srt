1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,540
Hey welcome back my students so I am from the future I came back because I had to lead the lecture that

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:12,480
was here before because we were installing a the editor and we said we get it's are was free and then

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
he became a paid plug in.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,370
And we don't one that we want something to be free so we can install these we see week editor that's

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,280
going to make our application look a lot better when we are adding pools.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,210
OK right now we have this empty data type of container here right.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,550
It will be nice to have an editor that we can tell a size or create headings or link create links and

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,090
things like that.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:48,910
So if you go to S.K. editor to open source editor that I use pretty cool are going to click here and

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,100
they get different versions.

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,620
I'm going to be using version 5 they have version 4 other time I'm recording this and they have pretty

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,560
easy stuff here but it's pretty easy to installed.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:06,240
So all we have to do is actually get the link either download it or get a CDN link to install it.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,830
So this is how it's going to look.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,040
We're going to be able to do things like this OK and even create links if we want it to.

16
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:22,260
So I'm going to click download and we can use NPM know package manager or zip file folder or see the

17
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,380
end which is the one that I'm going to use.

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,370
And let's go back here to admin underscore footer right below.

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,350
Actually now footer header right below Jake where we are going to place that code.

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,590
OK.

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,040
So one thing that I want you want to make you aware of.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,070
Do not worry about the extra code you see in your screen right now.

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,490
Any extra code in the sky or in here.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,610
Just worry about what I'm showing you how to do right now we are grabbing the link the Syrian link and

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,320
we are attaching it in the heading in admin on the score header.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,900
That's all you have to worry about.

27
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,420
OK.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,700
And now make sure that you save the file.

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,800
OK.

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,790
Now the next thing is to get the code to initialize our editor.

31
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,800
So let's go to the documentation.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,450
Let's go to QuickStart.

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,470
And here you can find so quick example.

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,810
So I'm going to grab this code right here.

35
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm going to copy it to my clipboard and I'm going to go to Scripps.

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,650
OK.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,430
And I'm going to just face that in here like this.

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,230
And save it.

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,320
OK.

40
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,050
Now the next step for us to do is to go to that ad puls page or whatever other page we are using right.

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:49,590
And go to that tetes area where your post content is located and in the ID actually view here right

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,710
body so our ID for that search area is called Body save it.

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,820
Go back to the scripts and edit edit this field right here to select the body.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,170
So he's going to find any tets area that has a body I.D. that's what he's doing right now.

45
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,280
Right.

46
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,400
So now make sure that everything's safe and let's go back here and less refresh.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,090
And now you have a really cool editor here that you can use gray

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,530
hello that's testis.

49
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,610
All right.

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,030
And heading here lol whatever.

51
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,750
OK.

52
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,680
And then you use publish a post and that should be it.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,190
Again do not worry about anything else that you see here.

54
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,030
This is extra stuff but now you have a really cool

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,590
editor that you can use with the wig editor and now you can go ahead and start adding it to the rest

56
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,740
of your CMS system where you have a text area.

57
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm not going to do that because you should be able to not to do that now.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,440
All you have to do is look for any tets area that you want to include the editor and give a id of body

59
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,170
and that we automatically be executing okay that code will be executed scripts.

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,320
Now later on what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that our body the our document was loaded

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,610
so we're going to create something with Jake what we call document that already does this function.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,430
This is what we're going to be doing later.

63
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:33,760
Now you can go ahead and do it now and just include this piece of code inside here and everything else

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,780
that comes after you can put it right here.

65
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,230
OK.

66
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm just going to put a come in here and say it's her a C K or something and below here you put the

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,540
rest rest of the code.

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,250
Now this function here is a G-code functionality which allows us to make sure that the document was

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,190
loaded before we do anything.

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,670
OK.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,080
And you can save that and that should give us the same result refresh and you still have the same results

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,950
right here.

73
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,560
OK.

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
Pretty simple.

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,650
The rest of the code meaning that next time we come to the scripts page you are going to ride everything

76
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,560
else below this line right here.

77
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,060
OK.

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:23,000
In some other videos you're going to see that I have another cold here like tiny MC MC the whatever

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,510
that is the other.

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,580
So we were using before and we're not going to be using that now.

81
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,670
So if you see that code owned then that's lectures.

82
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,650
Do not worry you can delete it.

83
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,130
You don't have to actually not only the leader you don't have to write it down.

84
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,480
OK.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,150
So I hope you don't skip any lectures and you're watching this one so you don't have to have that code

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,080
right here.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,170
All you have to because that code was for the last editor.

88
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,360
We don't have that editor anymore since I came to the lead that lecture because my editor is charging

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,490
us money for it.

90
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,560
The matter of fact I'm going to show it to you right now.

91
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,100
It's called Tiny and M C edits or something like that.

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,190
I think I forgot the name already right here.

93
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,550
So this one's the functionality we had before and they started charging money for it.

94
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,950
OK as you can see they started charging for it.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,680
They got really big.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,530
And now they're charging 10 bucks and all this stuff.

97
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,370
But with S.K. editor it is open source right now so it's free and there is a lot of things that you

98
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:33,390
can do with it if you go to the documentation and you click on events set up you can start integrating

99
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,280
more functionalities you can pass in a second parameter on that create method.

100
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,160
Let me show you.

101
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,620
You see this create this is what we got right now right.

102
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:55,640
And then you can pass a second parameter an object with a property with an array with a bunch of other

103
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,180
plugins that we can use to make our editor more powerful.

104
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,940
Ok so you can read up on the command station if you want something extra and try to build it yourself.

105
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,710
Anyway I want to thank you for being here.

106
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,890
Thank you for being my students.

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm going to keep updating adding more lectures to this course.

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,710
See you around guys.

109
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,510
Take care.
