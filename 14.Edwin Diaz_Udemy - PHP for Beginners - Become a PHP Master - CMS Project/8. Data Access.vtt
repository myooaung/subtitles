1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.990
I will come back.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:09.180
This video here we're going to be learning how to control the axes of data our classes and methods and

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.500
anything else right.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.410
It's our program.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.330
So let's go ahead and open our co-editor really simple.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.020
I'm going to do a Save As some class on the score car three dot BHP or you can do or save some classic

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.870
heritance is up to you.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.630
All right.

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.150
And we just want some of this functionality there especially the class and we're going to call this

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
class underscore at CES.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.710
All right.

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330
So now we want to open this in a browser.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.920
Now I want to explain a couple of details to you now.

14
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.820
All right.

15
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.290
So now this word usually took control data we use three different keywords that will help us make this

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.010
happen.

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.340
First one is we can declare properties public.

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.890
The second is protected.

19
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
And the third one is private.

20
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.470
When we declare something public it means the same thing as bar.

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.670
It means that it is available through our whole program.

22
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.810
All right so these data here is public.

23
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.990
Very descriptive.

24
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.840
Protect the means that is only available to this class or any subclasses that will or maybe a class

25
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.940
that will extend the same functionality as this one so it will be available to that one for privacy.

26
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.220
It will only be available to this class meaning that even if you do extend the classroom Harrod some

27
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.150
of those properties you will not be able to use it.

28
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.730
The private information you can make methods private and you can make them public and protected the

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.370
same way as you can make properties.

30
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.010
All right.

31
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.340
So let's first let's take I'll take this idea here because I want to show you an example or what I'm

32
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.560
talking about.

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.110
Now we know that we can come here and say you know what BMW I want to see your wheels.

34
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.620
Right.

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.490
So let's first do the echo and we want to see wheels when we go in the browser with C-4.

36
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.120
Right.

37
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.410
That is perfect we can do that and we can as a matter of fact use any of these because.

38
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.880
Right.

39
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.940
Well look look at this.

40
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.150
Look what happened.

41
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.220
I use Hood

42
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.940
we get a narrower array of course.

43
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.760
We get an error.

44
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.900
Think about it.

45
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440
I say we can use this within this class of protected we can use that insight right now what we're doing.

46
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.760
We're trying to use it outside of class you see.

47
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.740
Now if I go here let's see let's make a mentor and say we sure show property.

48
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.070
Let's go this shall property and let's go ahead and say this hood

49
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.980
and this is A.F. from here.

50
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.610
All right.

51
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.010
And instead of this one here we're going to call in show property and I'm going to explain to you what

52
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.590
I did right now but you know this.

53
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.340
Look at that.

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.900
Now we can see that see even though this is protected this hood is protected we can see it because we

55
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.750
are using it.

56
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.980
And I tell you we can use it inside of a class or inside any subclass that extends it.

57
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.640
All right.

58
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.450
So right now we are using this inside of the class.

59
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.130
We can go ahead and comment it out and create another last call this.

60
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.520
I don't know semi This is by the way a big truck right.

61
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:51.130
And we can go ahead instantiated is right and say new semi right.

62
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.230
And then we say semi stands.

63
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.090
And if you don't know what I'm riding here you need to go back to the video and look at the classic

64
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.810
inheritance right.

65
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.270
You need to go but not on this video.

66
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.180
But in another lecture and this distance car.

67
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.390
So now what I want to do is I want to use I when I use this function here as a matter of fact I don't

68
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.320
have to use a function there.

69
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.580
Well I could if I wanted to take that out of there and just put it right here then what I'm going to

70
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.410
do is I'm going to use semi to call that and look at that you see that.

71
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:46.350
So I made another class here that extended this class and I was able to use protected in psi this night

72
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.010
with a show property.

73
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.910
So as you can see the show protected we can use it inside the class or inside any subclasses.

74
00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:02.160
But what happens if I try to use the engine see this try to actually do this the engine when I get an

75
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.990
error because the engine is private.

76
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.210
I can I use the engine property right there says undefined properties and my engine doesn't even recognize

77
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.840
own define an engine.

78
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.710
Right.

79
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.870
So I can use that privacy there.

80
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.880
It doesn't even know that it's there because it's private to that right.

81
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.360
So how can I use this private well take that out of here.

82
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.950
This function here.

83
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.150
Let's put it back here

84
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.270
and let's go ahead and we'll be in W here.

85
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:51.150
And let's just take this the end of you and we can use it inside the class private.

86
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.850
All right so no the differences here probably we can use anywhere we want.

87
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.800
And I would actually make this a little neater for you so when you go to your course that is as far

88
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.280
as you can see what's going on.

89
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.110
But no that probably we can use it anywhere Protech that we can only use it inside the class or inside

90
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.700
subclasses.

91
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.380
All right.

92
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.480
And Matt that's of course and the private we can only use it inside this specific class.

93
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.240
We cannot use it any in any subclasses or outside the function.

94
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.560
Right so just privacy a more tighter security for data.

95
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.920
This is like a semi tight security semi-secret in between public and private.

96
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.590
And this is just everything free data.

97
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.070
Right.

98
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.200
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

99
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.180
Hopefully you understand the concept and know that this is very important and that you should be using

100
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.430
public protected privacy to control the absence of data inside your program.

101
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.920
Take care and I'll see you in the next lesson
