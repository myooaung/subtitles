1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.630
All right so we do a little cleaning up here.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.810
Now it's time for us to get into action.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.260
So let's go ahead and start writing Ph.D..

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.230
All right.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.310
So I told you that we will need two arrays.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.400
And the reason is because we need to hold some static information right here.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.480
Tetes and then the values of.

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.480
And in this case it's going to be the counts.

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.930
All right.

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.470
We're going to be holding the counts as this one years user accounts.

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.410
We're going to be hold in common count puls counting all that.

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.080
All right.

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.830
That's what we're going to be holding in this column right here and that's why this one we are going

14
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.300
to be holding some static data.

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
So let's go ahead and create that array.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
So he's going to say elemental one elements elements.

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.910
That's right.

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.270
And this one is just going to be an array actually is used.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.660
Let's use a shorthand version of of making a race like this.

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.910
And let's just call this active polls because we're going to have different polls and I'll show you

21
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.000
later on how that works.

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.040
I suppose

23
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.060
we're going to have that draft posing after polls.

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.190
But right now he's going to do what we've got right now just to show you how this works.

25
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.430
Then we're going to be adding more things later.

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.920
All right.

27
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.350
And I think we got comments too.

28
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.220
All right.

29
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.080
So we got for this information we got for widgets on top post comments user in categories perfect are

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.430
we going to make one ray of that.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.280
All right.

32
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.190
And then let's make another way.

33
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440
And this is going to be in some other information.

34
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.040
This is going to be whole thing element count.

35
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.530
All right.

36
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.950
That's this dairy and this one is going to have we don't need this double quotation there or single

37
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.300
quotation post count.

38
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.590
Let's make sure that we have the dollar sign there first.

39
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.470
The other one is is a category count.

40
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.870
Who's going to make sure it is.

41
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.440
Yes it is category count and it's going to copy

42
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.240
category count.

43
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.000
This one is a user account

44
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.560
and this one is coming out of course.

45
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.790
All right we can make a mistake.

46
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.940
We make one mistake it won't work.

47
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.880
All right.

48
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.000
Just to let you know.

49
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.770
All right so we have the race here the next the next thing for us to do is create a for loop.

50
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.950
Remember what we're doing is we're creating a loop and we're going to be displaying each of these values

51
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.640
right here of whatever we got up here.

52
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.320
All right.

53
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.090
So we've got 10 polls we're going to be creating this column's dynamically.

54
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.020
All right.

55
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.840
That's what it looks for right so.

56
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.590
All right.

57
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.440
Let's go ahead and create a for loop and you're going to say it's going to be the initialises going

58
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.500
to be equal to zero.

59
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.060
We're going to start the loop was zero.

60
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.000
Then remember how you remember how we did it right.

61
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.550
And we are going to be looping one two three and four.

62
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.090
All right.

63
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.020
So four times.

64
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.890
Just a simple loop.

65
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.850
And we're going to be incrementing it so we can go to the next.

66
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.320
All right.

67
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.160
Next value over and over again right.

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.970
We're going to keep going up and up.

69
00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.600
All right.

70
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.850
Until we reach for.

71
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.100
All right so then here we're going to be echoing this value.

72
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.440
So let's just say ekal and

73
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.950
this is this here we're going to be echoing this

74
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.410
right here this Saray First of all there's going to be right here.

75
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.560
But we need to enclose this in this right here.

76
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.400
All right.

77
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.600
And inside here we need a full quotation because this is a it's all going to be tets right.

78
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.590
So we have this quotation that we just put some brackets right here and acting that way is the right

79
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.430
way.

80
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.200
All right.

81
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.270
And we also need to create because this is an array array we need to look through it.

82
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.760
So we are going to be using this initialiser to go through each of this array right here.

83
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.480
So right now we get the array right here.

84
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.880
All right.

85
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.050
But we use in the lab the Initialize of the loop to go through each of these values right and then we're

86
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.310
going to be echoing each of these values in this column right here in this bracket you see there we're

87
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.760
basically what we do is replacing this right here right here.

88
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.650
This first part with this element tets array right here.

89
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.580
The first part and you see this quarter here this is the same chords right here.

90
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.650
All right.

91
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.940
Now this data is going to be dynamic of course.

92
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.580
Right.

93
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.950
So I think we're good here there's nothing else we need.

94
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.650
Now we need to jump into the next one so we're going to concatenate.

95
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.270
We going have put a coal mine here and this is this Colma right here that we're going to be putting.

96
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.010
All right.

97
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.510
Let me just bring this up a little bit.

98
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.090
I left this here so that where you can tell what I'm doing.

99
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.910
That's the only reason why I left the place there so we could concatenating right here and the Colma

100
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.900
because we need that Colmar right there to separate these values.

101
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.630
Now here we don't need any quotation because this is integers this is going to be counts.

102
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.980
All right this is going to be just numbers right.

103
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.120
But we still need to concatenate.

104
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.740
So we're just going to put double quotation and we're going to do the same thing we did here.

105
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.510
Right.

106
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.580
Right there.

107
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:41.180
And we don't see that because we have that back as a matter of fact this bracket right here needs to

108
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.560
go all the way down here.

109
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.250
All right now let's just paste this in there and let me just check this bracket out there.

110
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.180
We don't need a bracket there.

111
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.620
As a matter of fact that's the way it goes right there.

112
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.130
All right.

113
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.600
This bracket is the one that is going to go right here.

114
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.110
There we go.

115
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.880
I know it seems a little confusing right now and this Colma I use put it right here.

116
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.840
All right.

117
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.570
So I know it sounds a little confusing there but trust me he makes sense.

118
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.760
Now of course we're not going to have the same array again.

119
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.010
We're going to have this array right here element count.

120
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.330
I'm going to recap right now what we are doing.

121
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.680
Right.

122
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.080
So don't worry if you don't understand it let's just close with a semi-colon.

123
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.410
I'm going to come in that out right.

124
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.250
First let's see if it works refresh.

125
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.350
There we go.

126
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.420
Perfit right we got two posts six comments.

127
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.430
Well category's sits right here and users three and comments two.

128
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.010
All right.

129
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.900
So we should actually have few comments right here right.

130
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.450
And they use this here.

131
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.670
Switch it around a little bit.

132
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.470
But anyway let's go ahead and recap how this is working.

133
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.780
All right.

134
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.140
Perfect.

135
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.110
All right so what we did here is these data usually is static.

136
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.710
Right.

137
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:19.730
We would be using static and we would have many different columns like this like this if it was in because

138
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.410
we are using a loop.

139
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.660
We have users and this is just an example right.

140
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.380
Categories and comments.

141
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:36.870
If it wasn't because of the loop this information would you have to type it in statically like this.

142
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.650
Right.

143
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.970
I hope you get the idea and what I'm saying to you.

144
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.890
All right.

145
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.640
So instead of this instead of writing this like this statically.

146
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.510
All right.

147
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.050
We are using two arrays.

148
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:57.640
The first array element on the score tets is to print all these values in this column right here.

149
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.600
All right.

150
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.720
So we are printing all these static because right now we are using static tests right here.

151
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.190
All right.

152
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.390
So we're printing all these values every time the loop goes around.

153
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.500
So the loop goes around the first time the prince posts goes around the second time Prince a user in

154
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.290
this case is going to print category and then the next one is going to be print the users and so on

155
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.290
every time he goes around four times.

156
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.470
All right so he's going to do that for his first column he's going to print out all this tets every

157
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.100
time he goes around.

158
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:40.670
Then he also prints out when he goes around the value the count right of each of these values right

159
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.880
here.

160
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:48.590
So with the first print of post count and the post name so posts and post count that's the first time

161
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:56.490
around because we got the element on the score count right here that represents this Aure right here.

162
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:05.420
And we got the I from the loop remember this guy what he's doing is getting inside this array every

163
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.920
time he goes around.

164
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.630
So we can't use the eye for tour or race in the same place.

165
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.760
All right we can have many a race here and use this.

166
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.100
I too either way to go around each of these values for this race.

167
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.490
All right so this I always doing is getting inside these values here.

168
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.790
So he gets into the first in that and and check it out and say you know what.

169
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.620
Let's echo that.

170
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.320
So right now he's echoing two values every time he goes around he echoes the static name the tetes that

171
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.480
we got in the first array and they echoes the numbers that we got in disarray right here.

172
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.610
Right so every time he goes around and does it four times and that's why you see here four times.

173
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.460
All right.

174
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.950
So we still got a little bit to do.

175
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:58.880
We we still got to switch things around since we have let's see we have comments posts and comments

176
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.160
so we should do we should switch it around a little bit.

177
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.750
Right.

178
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.360
So we're going to say comments

179
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.600
and comments.

180
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.780
And then users and was a last one categories.

181
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:26.440
All right let's just fix that right now categories and come and count.

182
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.870
I'm just going to write it down.

183
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.250
Why not.

184
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:37.510
I feel lucky coming count and user count and the category count.

185
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.260
All right.

186
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.020
Not bad.

187
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.590
I just rolled twice.

188
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.420
Category count is a category or category.

189
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.150
Geez I forgot category.

190
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.960
There we go.

191
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.720
Let's see if it works.

192
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.210
Probably.

193
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.130
All right.

194
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.520
All right.

195
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.500
So I did make a mistake somewhere.

196
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:05.840
Active full post count coming count user account and category count.

197
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.720
All right let's check it out again.

198
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.250
I made a mistake made a little boo boo there.

199
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.900
Let's check it out let's see what we did wrong.

200
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.200
All right.

201
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:18.680
OK.

202
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.820
We have some extra.

203
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.360
You see this.

204
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.450
This static that I got right here in this plane.

205
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.180
So I did it right.

206
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:34.300
We got some static and just kind of deleting and then refresh.

207
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.600
Nothing static anymore.

208
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.220
All right.

209
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.300
So in the next video we're going to what we're going to do in the next lecture is we've got some pending

210
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:49.070
comments and we have some users that are subscribers that we want to display and we are still in draft

211
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.490
post that we want to display.

212
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:50.780
Right.

213
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.260
So that's what some extra information that we're going to be displayed on the next lecture.

214
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.910
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

215
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.810
I'll see you in the next one.

216
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.680
Take care.
