00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.530
I Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.430
I can't really believe that you made it to Section 4.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.080
Wow.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.060
Nice.

5
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.670
Anyway let's go ahead and keep going.

6
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.190
All right.

7
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.680
So this section here we are going to be practising functions.

8
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.200
All right so make sure that you are inside your practic whap folder.

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.890
And for that BHB.

10
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.920
All right.

11
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.380
All right.

12
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.920
So this one is just asking us to define a function and make it return a calculation of two numbers.

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.080
All right cool.

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
And then we can just echo that right and then make a function that passes parameters and color using

15
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.030
parameters.

16
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.420
Right we did this in the in the lectures.

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.010
Let's go ahead and do it now so positive we'll do that yourself.

18
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.310
Try as much as you can go back to the video if you don't understand it and then come back here.

19
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.820
All right.

20
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.590
So I wait for you just positivity right now don't cheat.

21
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.980
OK

22
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.950
perfect.

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.940
Hopefully you'll be able to do it.

24
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.750
And I think you did it because I think I'm a good teacher right.

25
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
I think I'm showing you something here valuable and I think you are learning it right so I know that

26
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.440
you did it but if you did it you can just wait a little bit and let me do it let me see if our code

27
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.420
matches are right.

28
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.840
So first thing asking us to define a function and we can just define the functions here and name it

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.220
whatever we want which is name and numbers what about that.

30
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.000
Or maybe calculation right.

31
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.000
Just to be clear and right there.

32
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.000
So coolish.

33
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.770
All right.

34
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.870
And let's bring it down and Dave is going to return a calculation of two numbers.

35
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.220
All right so perfect.

36
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
So how do we make every turn of calculation and two numbers.

37
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.870
Well first we need to make them two numbers.

38
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.290
Number one to any number two.

39
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.290
And the reason why I wasn't so descriptive it's because you should be able to get the idea of what I'm

40
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.840
saying here.

41
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830
As you watch the lecture Right.

42
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.320
Right.

43
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.960
All right.

44
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.860
Hopefully you watch the lecture and you can skip it.

45
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.270
All right.

46
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.010
And then here I'm just going to say some because when we need a variable to to hold is some right here

47
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.640
right.

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.370
We're going to make a sum of two numbers some one plus some too.

49
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.860
Well number two right.

50
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.450
And then we are going to return this returns some.

51
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.710
Right and that's it.

52
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.500
That's it for this.

53
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.890
Now how do we use it.

54
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.090
I wasn't very descriptive here for a reason because we did this in the lecture.

55
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.390
OK.

56
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.830
So let's go ahead and do that.

57
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.620
Let's go ahead and use this function.

58
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.430
However we want.

59
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.010
Now we can call this function right here by just saying calculation.

60
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.030
Actually this just copy and paste it as do the macerate there.

61
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.740
And right now we're not going to see much here.

62
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.060
Right.

63
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.050
Because on the find Consta number one will we have a problem here because we're missing this right here.

64
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.870
Fresh in that we're not going to see anything because this function here we could do whatever we want

65
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.660
with it now.

66
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.250
All right.

67
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.620
What I want to do is a sign that a very we're going to see some kind of call this some I don't want

68
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.420
capital there.

69
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.740
I don't.

70
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.020
Why does my hand want to do capital.

71
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.650
I don't understand it and I just want to echo.

72
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.930
Then after some echoing and I just going to pieces here.

73
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.000
Perfect.

74
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.290
All right.

75
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.640
And it's refreshing.

76
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.410
And now we are echoing some.

77
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.730
All right.

78
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.540
So there isn't.

79
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.430
And please understand that I'm going fast because I have to do a couple of things here.

80
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.460
I don't want to take 20 minutes to go over something that we already did.

81
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.740
You should know this.

82
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.920
And for some reason you have any problems all you have to do is go back to the video and learn it.

83
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.570
All right.

84
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.630
Just watch you keep watching and watching and watching until you get it right.

85
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.280
So I'm going fast here because you should do.

86
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.440
You should know this but for some reason you don't just rewind that same video that you're doing right

87
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.070
now and that you're watching.

88
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.230
And just look at what I'm doing right.

89
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.410
So it's a matter of just watching the video and rewinding if I'm going too fast.

90
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.390
I shouldn't this should be very easy for you by now.

91
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.840
But if it's not don't worry about it you can just keep watching and watching until you get it right

92
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.840
now.

93
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.720
Make a function that passes a parameter and call it using the parameters.

94
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.180
All right so just make a function here called.

95
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.210
I don't know say law.

96
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.130
It's in Spanish by the way or it means hello.

97
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.550
For those of you that don't know.

98
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.560
All right.

99
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.530
I said my fans are going to call it all so that way you can remember this.

100
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.130
I say how are you.

101
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.030
You know that's what that all means.

102
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.350
All right so.

103
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.260
And says You're going to pass a parameter there.

104
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.970
All right so we're going to say we're going to call this in English.

105
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.380
Look at that very well.

106
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.530
English is going to say hello and echo Hello.

107
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.180
That's all we've got to do with its function.

108
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.750
To be honest with you.

109
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:24.220
And then we've called the functions here or law and we passed it a parameter and we say Hey is that

110
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.050
Spanish

111
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.590
right.

112
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.100
And what's going on with this.

113
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.800
Right.

114
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.770
All right.

115
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.040
Refresh a Spanish together make sure that you put something here so that we goes to that and that's

116
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.800
where I'm stuck with that.

117
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.970
Yes.

118
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.990
They actually we don't need a break here.

119
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.630
We need it all up here.

120
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.310
This corner here we go.

121
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.010
Hayes.

122
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.100
Spanish Yes it is.

123
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.400
All right.

124
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.840
So I think we're good here.

125
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.760
That's all we needed to do here.

126
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.650
So we have a function here we turn into some and then we use that somehow.

127
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.600
But we will and once we get we call the function we can use assigning a variable and then we could just

128
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.120
equity's very well do whatever we want we can do.

129
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.390
We can use as a variable to add it to some other variable like we did in the lecture or and now here

130
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.390
we made a function call which means hello in Spanish.

131
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.100
Right.

132
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.960
And we just gave it a variable here so that where we have a value here to use to do different things

133
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.230
with it.

134
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.150
In this case we use equity.

135
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.400
All right.

136
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.780
So anyway hopefully this lecture helped you out.

137
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.840
And I'm going to see you in the next section.

138
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.410
Take care.
